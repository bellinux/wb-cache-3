5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, Trott again {{acted as a}} Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain Percy McDonnell. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of promising young players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> kept walking.|$|E
5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate <b>nods,</b> <b>and</b> he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe cytosolic sensors <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{activate}} defense signaling pathways {{in response}} to microbial stimuli. However, the role of <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their interplay with TLRs during systemic bacterial infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report that macrophages or mice made insensitive to TLRs by previous exposure to microbial ligands remained responsive to <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 stimulation. Furthermore, <b>Nod</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 -mediated signaling and gene expression are enhanced in TLR-tolerant macrophages. Further analyses revealed that innate immune responses induced by bacterial infection relied on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their adaptor RICK in macrophages pretreated with TLR ligands but not in naive macrophages. In addition, bacterial clearance upon systemic infection with L.  monocytogenes was critically dependent on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 when mice were previously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or E. coli. Thus, <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 are important for microbial recognition and host defense after TLR stimulation...|$|R

500|$|Comet {{was portrayed}} by five horses, {{each with a}} {{different}} talent. The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse [...] "Leadbelly" [...] due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near {{the end of the}} season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set. The [...] "true show horse" [...] was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head <b>nods,</b> <b>and</b> hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts [...] "as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that" [...] were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take. No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. [...] With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip's appearance was chosen for Brisco's steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with [...] "clown white" [...] greasepaint to match Strip's markings.|$|E
40|$|<b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 (nucleotide-binding {{oligomerization}} domain-containing proteins 1 and 2) {{are related}} innate immune receptors responsible for initiating {{a response to}} bacterial infection. They belong to a class of receptors known as Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which are germline encoded immune receptors that mediate various innate immune responses. These receptors recognize conserved microbial motifs known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). The PRR-PAMP paradigm forms the bedrock of how innate immunity is understood today. As two of the first intracellular PRRs discovered, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 came to define an entire subclass of PRRs, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs). PRRs relay their signals through protein:protein interaction motifs that typically adopt a characteristic Death Domain (DD) fold. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signal through their respective CAspase Recruitment Domains (CARDs), which {{are part of a}} DD subfamily. The CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 interact with multiple downstream effectors and are thus situated at a key point for regulation <b>and</b> coordination of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling. To better understand this regulation, I structurally and functionally characterized interactions made by the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Receptor Interacting Protein kinase 2 (RIP 2) is an effector of both <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 that activates the NF-ΚB pathway to elicit an inflammatory response. I discovered a new binding interaction between the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ubiquitin. Furthermore, I elucidated a role for this interaction by showing that ubiquitin binds <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 CARDs competitively with the CARD of RIP 2. Through biophysical and biochemical investigation, I identified mutants of NOD 1 CARD that did not bind ubiquitin and were thus insensitive to its competitive effect on RIP 2 binding. Utilizing this mutant in functional studies defined ubiquitin as a negative regulator of NOD 1 signaling. Characterizing NOD 1 allowed rational design of mutations that uncovered a similar role for ubiquitin in the NOD 2 pathway. This introduces the potential for broader application of these findings in other DD-mediated pathways. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 also bind the autophagy protein ATG 16 L. I investigated the molecular mechanisms of this interaction <b>and</b> found that <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 bind ATG 16 L through their CARDs. I also found that the domain on ATG 16 L responsible for binding <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 is the C-terminal WD 40 Β-propeller. Furthermore, the CARD:Β-propeller interaction is sufficient to mediate interaction between NOD 1 or <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ATG 16 L. The finding that the ATG 16 L Β-propeller also binds ubiquitin leaves open the possibility that ubiquitin regulates pathway selection by <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Together, these studies advance our understanding of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling <b>and</b> lay the groundwork for further mechanistic investigations into coordination of inflammatory and autophagic signaling pathways by the immune system in general...|$|R

2500|$|Pierce {{spent the}} first fifteen years of {{his career with the}} Boston Celtics, who drafted him with the 10th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He became a bone fide star as captain of the Celtics, earning ten All-Star <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> {{becoming}} a four-time All-NBA team member. After nine seasons of leading the Celtics as their sole star player, Pierce combined with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007 to form a [...] "Big Three" [...] that together led Boston to the NBA Finals in 2008 and 2010, winning the 2008 NBA Championship. Pierce was instrumental to the Celtics' 2008 championship run, as he was awarded the Finals MVP after averaging 22 points per game. Pierce is one of only three players, alongside Larry Bird and John Havlicek, to score over 20,000 points in their career with the Celtics alone. He holds the Celtics' record for most three-point field goals made and also ranks third in team history in games played, second in points scored, seventh in total rebounds, fifth in total assists, and first in total steals. He has also made the fourth most three-point field goals in NBA history, behind only Jason Terry, Reggie Miller and Ray Allen. His nickname, [...] "The Truth", was given to him by Shaquille O'Neal in March 2001.|$|E
40|$|The nucleotide-binding {{oligomerization}} domain (NOD) proteins <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2, {{the founding}} {{members of the}} intracellular NOD-like receptor family, sense conserved motifs in bacterial peptidoglycan and induce proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Here, we discuss recent developments about the mechanisms by which <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 are activated by bacterial ligands, the regulation of their signaling pathways, and their role in host defense and inflammatory disease. Several routes for the entry of peptidoglycan ligands to the host cytosol to trigger activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 have been elucidated. Furthermore, genetic screens and biochemical analyses have revealed mechanisms that regulate <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling. Finally, recent studies have suggested several mechanisms {{to account for the}} link between <b>NOD</b> 2 variants <b>and</b> susceptibility to Crohn’s disease.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{mononuclear cell}} expression {{and function of}} the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing receptors, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2, in very preterm and full-term infants. Methods: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 gene <b>and</b> protein expression in very preterm infants, term infants and healthy adult, cord and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (C/PBMC) were quantified using qPCR and flow cytometry. Cytokine responses of purified infant and adult monocytes to <b>NOD</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 -specific agonists were assessed using a multiplex immunoassay (Bioplex). Results: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 were expressed by a range of infant and adult mononuclear cell types, including T- and B cells, with highest expression in classical (CD 14 ++CD 16 -) and intermediate (CD 14 ++CD 16 +) monocytes. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression levels by monocytes from very preterm infant were similar to those in term infants or adults. Monocyte production of TNFα, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β induced by activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 was similar between very preterm infants, term infants and adults. Conclusion: Monocyte expression <b>and</b> function of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 in very preterm infants are intact and comparable/equivalent to term infants and adults. Functional deficiencies in monocyte NOD signalling pathways are unlikely to contribute to the increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis in preterm infants...|$|R

2500|$|Edwards {{decided on}} a {{restrained}} approach similar to when films were fueled by a [...] "sense of anticipation" [...] and relied on [...] "high suspense", with films such as Alien and Jaws. Edwards also wanted Godzilla to feel [...] "universal" [...] {{in a way that}} it could appeal to a general audience like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which Edwards cited was a heavy influence on the film. Edwards additionally stated, [...] "I grew up watching Spielberg movies, what they did so well — as well as having epic, fantastic spectacle — they made the characters feel real and human. We were trying to do the same thing here." [...] Critics and journalists have also noted the film's <b>nods</b> <b>and</b> homages to Steven Spielberg's style of filmmaking and his films such as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira had also influenced the visual design of the film, Edwards stated, [...] "...one of our designers on the film - a friend called Matt - when we were designing things, and got stuck, we'd always go, 'What would Akira do?'" [...] For the film's cinematography, Edwards wanted [...] "...to do this beautifully real documentary vibe, but also that classic Spielberg style". Ishirō Honda's 1954 original Godzilla also inspired the film, Edwards stated, [...] "Godzilla is a metaphor for Hiroshima in the original movie. We tried to keep that, and there are a lot of themes from the '54 movie that we've kept." [...] Real life events such as the 2004 Indian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster served as heavy influences on the realism behind the film's destruction scenes and man vs. nature themes. Edwards had also cited action films from the late 70's and early 80's having influenced the film as well, stating, [...] "We tried to make a blockbuster that harks back to the pace and style of the early ’80s and late ’70s action movies." ...|$|E
