Atoms for Peace [...] "made funding accessible to anyone who had the imagination, if not the ability, to harness the atom's power for peaceful purposes". Under the new program, the airplane manufacturer Curtiss-Wright Corporation sought a large isolated area in central Pennsylvania [...] "for the development of nuclear-powered jet engines and to conduct research in <b>nucleonics,</b> metallurgy, ultrasonics, electronics, chemicals and plastics". Curtiss-Wright {{worked closely with the}} state, and in June 1955, Governor George M. Leader signed legislation that authorized the construction of a research facility at Quehanna. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sold Curtiss-Wright [...] for $181,250 ($22.50 an acre, $55.60 a hectare), and gave the company a 99-year lease on the remaining [...] at $30,000 a year.

The equation of state (EoS) of this matter shows features qualitatively very similar to the one obtained from pure <b>nucleonic</b> gas. In the {{isothermal compression}} process, there is a sudden enhancement of clusterization at a transition density rendering features analogous to the gas-liquid phase transition in normal dilute <b>nucleonic</b> matter. Different observables like the caloric curves, heat capacity, isospin distillation, etc. are studied in both the models.

40|$|The {{relativistic}} neutrino emissivity of the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA {{processes in}} neutron star matter are investigated within the relativistic Hartree-Fock approximation. We study particularly {{the influences of}} the tensor couplings of vector mesons ω and ρ on the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA processes. It is found that {{the inclusion of the}} tensor couplings of vector mesons ω and ρ can slightly increase the maximum mass of neutron stars. In addition, the results indicate that the tensor couplings of vector mesons ω and ρ lead to obvious enhancement of the total neutrino emissivity for the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA processes, which must accelerate the cooling rate of the non-superfluid neutron star matter. However, when considering only the tensor coupling of vector meson ρ, the neutrino emissivity for the <b>nucleonic</b> direct URCA processes slightly declines at low densities and significantly increases at high densities. That is to say that the tensor coupling of vector meson ρ leads to the slow cooling rate of a low-mass neutron star and rapid cooling rate of a massive neutron star...|$|R
40|$|We present {{possible}} {{manifestations of}} octahedral and tetrahedral symmetries in nuclei. These symmetries {{are associated with}} the O D h and T D d double point groups. Both of them have very characteristic finger-prints in terms of the <b>nucleonic</b> level properties- unique in the Fermionic universe. The tetrahedral symmetry leads to the four-fold degeneracies in the <b>nucleonic</b> spectra; it does not preserve the parity. The octahedral symmetry leads to the four-fold degeneracies in the <b>nucleonic</b> spectra as well but it does preserve the parity. Microscopic predictions have been obtained using mean-field theory based on the relativistic equations and confirmed by using ’traditional’ Schrödinger equation formalism. Calculations are performed in multidimensional deformation spaces using newly designed algorithms.

40|$|One of {{the frontiers}} of today`s nuclear science is the ``journey to the limits``: of atomic charge and nuclear mass, of neutron-to-proton ratio, and of angular momentum. The new data on exotic nuclei are {{expected}} to bring qualitatively new information about the fundamental properties of the <b>nucleonic</b> many-body system, {{the nature of the}} nuclear interaction, and <b>nucleonic</b> correlations at various energy-distance scales. In this talk, current developments in nuclear structure of neutron-rich nuclei are discussed from a theoretical perspective...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the talk was {{to point out the}} {{relation}} between recent developments in nuclear dynamics and theories dealing with the transition from order to chaos in general. The leading idea can be stated very simply : a) when the <b>nucleonic</b> motions in the mean nuclear field are ordered, then the nucleus as a whole is expected to behave like an elastic solid, b) when the <b>nucleonic</b> motions are chaotic, the nucleus should behave like a very viscous fluid, dominated by the so-called one-body dissipation, c) when the <b>nucleonic</b> motions are intermediate, the nucleus should exhibit the properties of a visco-elastic material. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} dynamical evolutions of nuclear systems, such as take place in nuclear fission or nucleus-nucleus collisions, it is absolutely necessary to understand the degree of order in <b>nucleonic</b> motions and how this order may give place to chaos as the shape (and temperature) of a nuclear system changes in time. Examples illustrating these ideas were discussed, including giant quadrupole resonances, nuclear fission, the dynamical hindrance to compound nucleus formation and the centrifugal solidification of the 152 Dy superdeformed nucleus...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} density {{contrasts}} of collisionless particles and <b>nucleonic</b> matter is pursued from the decoupling era {{up to the}} present in the Newtonian mechanics. The negative density perturbation of collisionles particles grows quickly to the void and surrounding ridge. Meanwhile, the shell-crossing occurs. The <b>nucleonic</b> matter, which is set uniformly at the decoupling epoch, is enforced to concentrate into the ridge by the gravitational force at this shell-crossing epoch. At the same time, the temperature of <b>nucleonic</b> matter increases rapidly due to the dissipation of kinetic energy by the pressure force. The dependence of results upon the amplitude of the initial density perturbation is made clear. If the galaxies were formed after the shell-crossing, the initial amplitude of density perturbation of collisionless particles must be higher than 0. 03 in the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Through the analysis of gravitational instability of ridges, a possible scenario for the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe within the adiabatic theory is presented...|$|R

The canonical wavefucntion of A= 3 nuclei which does well for electromagnetic properties of A= 3 nuclei fails to produce the hole in A= 3 nuclei. The hole is normally assumed to arise from explicit quark degree of freedom. Very often quark degrees of freedom are imposed to propose a different short range part of the wavefunction for A= 3 to explain the hole in $^ 3 {\text He}$.
