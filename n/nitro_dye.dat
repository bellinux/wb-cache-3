30|$|Nitro and nitroso dyes are minor {{commercial}} {{importance and}} constitute {{only a fraction}} of the total dyes market. Nitro dyes have simple chemical structures. They are small aromatic molecules which contain minimum one nitro group and one or more amino or hydroxy groups. Initially, the nitro dyes were acid dyes which were used for dyeing the natural animal fibers i.e. wool and silk. Picric acid was the first synthetic <b>nitro</b> <b>dye</b> which imparted a greenish-yellow color to silk but could not be used for longer period of time because of its toxicity and poor fastness properties.|$|E

This process may allow the design of polymeric azo prodrugs for specific release of certain aromatic amines in the colon...|$|R
30|$|The {{composite}} nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 and Au {{combine the}} functions of these two components and can be applied in the waste water treatment. As has been reported, some noble metal nanoparticles stabilized with surfactant or dendrimer are capable for catalytic reduction of aromatic <b>nitro</b> compounds or <b>dyes</b> [13 – 15] because they have higher Fermi potential {{and can be used}} as catalyst for many electron-transfer reactions [16, 17]. However, their recovery from such stabilizers-containing systems is not easy. To overcome this problem, using magnetic nanoparticles as their support is a superior strategy which makes them easy to recover. Thus, the composite nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 and Au are expected to have great potential as magnetically recoverable catalyst for the treatment of waste water.|$|R
40|$|Previous reports {{indicate}} that the in vitro bactericidal activity of rat alveolar macrophages (AM) {{is dependent on the}} lipid fraction (ALM-L) of the alveolar lining material (ALM). The present study demonstrates that luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of stimulated rat AM is increased when rat AM are prein-cubated in the ALM or in the ALM-L. Evidence is presented that oxidation of the unsaturated lipids is responsible for the increase. In addition to pretreat-ment with the ALM, cells were also pretreated in commercial preparations of several lipids found to be present in the ALM. Preincubation in these lipids produced {{a significant increase in the}} luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response. However, when a saturated lipid, dipalmitoyl phosphatidycholine, was used no increase was found. Pretreatment in ALM did not increase the <b>nitro</b> blue tetrazolium <b>dye</b> reduction by the AM, nor was the phagocytosis of latex beads by the AM altered by the addition of the ALM. Key words: lipid oxidation, oxidative burst, alveolar lavag...|$|R
40|$|HL- 60 {{promyelocytic leukemia}} cells were induced to {{differentiate}} by 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (calcitriol) into mature monocytes. Differentiation {{was assessed by}} <b>nitro</b> blue tetrazolium <b>dye</b> reduction, nonspecific esterase activity, and DNA synthesis. Terminal differentiation of cultures induced by calcitriol (10 nM) was inhibited by 80 % when cells were treated simultaneously with protein kinase inhibitors 1 -(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) - 2 -methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H- 7) (32 [mu]M) and N-[2 -guanidinoethyl]- 5 -isoquionlinesulfonamide hydrochloride (HA 1004) (320 [mu]M). The 50 for inhibition of calcitriol-induced differentiation was approximately 15 [mu]M for H- 7 and 170 [mu]M for HA 1004. The IC 50 values for H- 7 and HA 1004 antagonism of calcitriol-induced differentiation are quantitatively and relatively correlated to their known action to inhibit protein kinase C activity. Treatment of cells with concentrations of 0 - 32 [mu]M H- 7 or 0 - 320 [mu]M HA 1004 alone did not affect cell growth, differentiation, or trypan blue exclusion. However, higher concentrations of H 7 (> 32 [mu]M) and HA 1004 (> 320 [mu]M) {{were found to be}} cytotoxic. The data presented suggest that calcitriol-induced differentiation is antagonized by inhibitors of protein kinase and are consistent with the hypothesis that kinase C activity is required for HL- 60 cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Macrophages in Peyer's patches are {{important}} in the initiation of gastrointestinal immune responses to enteric pathogens. To examine their potential role in giardiasis, murine mononuclear cells were isolated from collagenase-treated Peyer's patches by their adherence to glass. These cells were incubated with Giardia lamblia trophozoites {{in the presence of}} nonimmune or immune (anti-Giardia antibody titer, {{greater than or equal to}} 1 : 1, 024) mouse serum. Macrophages ingested trophozoites at low levels when they were incubated with nonimmune mouse serum. Ingestion was significantly increased at all time points (P less than 0. 01) when cells and parasites were incubated in 5 % immune mouse serum; the number of Giardia trophozoites ingested per 100 macrophages was 21. 6 +/- 7. 1 (standard error of the mean) at 1 h and increased to 59. 0 +/- 16. 4 at 8 h. Electron microscopy documented trophozoite destruction within macrophages. Association of G. lamblia with macrophages elicited an oxidative response; 50. 9 +/- 3. 6 % of macrophages with trophozoites attached or ingested reduced the <b>dye</b> <b>Nitro</b> Blue Tetrazolium, compared with 13. 0 +/- 5. 2 % for cells without associated trophozoites (P less than 0. 04). These results demonstrate that macrophages are capable of ingesting G. lamblia in vitro and may play an important role in host defense in giardiasis...|$|R
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} that impacts a {{wide range}} of hosts, including Arabidopsis. Pre-treatment with nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on Arabidopsis leaves suppressed Botrytis cinerea infection development. Additionally, in this study the dosage levels of SNP applied to the leaves had no direct, toxic impact {{on the development of the}} pathogen. The relationship between NO and reactive oxidant species (ROS) was stud-ied by using both spectrophotometrical methods and staining leaf material with fluorescent <b>dyes,</b> <b>nitro</b> blue tetrazolium (NBT), and with 3, 3 -diaminobenzidine (DAB). The results showed that exogenous NO restrained the generation of ROS, especially H 2 O 2, as the pathogen interacted with the Arabidopsis plant. And this inhibition of reactive oxidant burst coincided with delay infection development in NO-supplied leaves. The influence of elevated level of NO on antioxidant enzymes was investigated in this study. The activities of catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) were increased to different degrees in both: 1) SNP treated only leaves, and 2) SNP pretreated leaves that were subsequently inoculateted with pathogens. However, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was unchanged in the leaves studied. The decrease in H 2 O 2 content probably resulted from the increase in activities of POD and CAT. Our study suggests that NO might trigger some metabolic reactions, i. e. enhanced enzyme activity that restrains H 2 O 2 which ultimatel...|$|R
40|$|Rats are {{resistant}} to Toxoplasma infection, and macrophages are thought to mediate this resistance. We performed a series of experiments to investigate the mechanism of the anti-Toxoplasma activity of resident rat peritoneal macrophages. Resident rat peritoneal macrophages killed more than 90 % of ingested Toxoplasma gondii in vitro. This capacity was reduced progressively with the prolongation of culturing of macrophages in vitro before challenge with T. gondii. Exhaustion of the respiratory burst of macrophages with phorbol myristate acetate impaired their ability to kill and limit the replication of T. gondii. Histidine and diazabicyclooctane, presumed scavengers of singlet oxygen, were the only members of a battery of scavengers of metabolites of the respiratory burst that impaired the anti-Toxoplasma activity of macrophages. Ingestion of heat-killed Candida albicans by macrophages reduced large amounts of intracellular <b>Nitro</b> Blue Tetrazolium <b>dye,</b> whereas little dye was reduced by the ingestion of T. gondii. Challenge of macrophages with T. gondii released no detectable superoxide anion, {{as measured by the}} reduction of ferricytochrome c, whereas stimulation of macrophages with phorbol myristate acetate or ingestion of heat-killed Candida by macrophages released abundant superoxide anion. These data are consistent with the contributions of oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms to the anti-Toxoplasma activity of rat peritoneal macrophages. In addition, neonatal rats are known to be susceptible to Toxoplasma infection in vivo. However, resident neonatal rat peritoneal macrophages ingested and killed T. gondii to the same extent as did adult macrophages. Thus, the susceptibility of neonatal rats to Toxoplasma infection probably resides in other aspects of macrophage function or the immune response...|$|R
40|$|The Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 {{receptor}} {{was examined}} in human promyelocytic leukaemic cells (HL- 60) and in HL- 60 cells differentiated towards granulocytes with either retinoic acid (RA) or dimethyl sulphoxide (Me 2 SO). HL- 60 cell membranes enriched in marker enzyme {{activities of the}} endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane possess a high-affinity binding site for [3 H]Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 (KD = 22 nM). Electrotransfer studies indicate that Ins(1, 4,[32 P] 5) P 3 binds specifically to a 260 kDa protein of HL- 60 cell membranes. This Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 -binding protein selectively binds Ca(2 +) -mobilizing inositol phosphates and other inositol phosphates which also bind to the purified InsP 3 receptor, suggesting that the Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 -binding protein of HL- 60 cell membranes is the InsP 3 receptor. When HL- 60 cells are incubated with 1 microM-RA or with 1. 25 % Me 2 SO the cells differentiate within 5 - 7 days into cells resembling neutrophils in both structure and function. Treated cells cease to proliferate, acquire the ability to reduce <b>Nitro</b> Blue Tetrazolium <b>dye,</b> and undergo morphological changes typical of differentiated granulocytes. Concomitant with HL- 60 cell differentiation, the maximal [3 H]Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding in membranes increases 3 - 4 -fold, with no change in KD. The results {{suggest that there is}} an absolute increase in the level of the InsP 3 receptor during HL- 60 cell differentiation and that the expression of this signal-transducing protein may be specifically regulated by differentiation factors...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} a virulent wild-type parent strain and acapsular avirulent transposon mutants to enter and survive intracellularly within murine peritoneal macrophages. In the presence of normal or immune serum, the parent and mutant strains were both ingested; however, the number of ingested bacteria was three- to fourfold greater in the case of mutant strains than {{in the case of the}} parent strain. The parent strain, but not the mutant strains, survived and replicated intracellularly when ingested in the presence of normal serum, whereas both the parent and the mutant strains were readily killed when ingested in the presence of immune serum. To further investigate the mechanism by which the parent strain can survive and replicate within macrophages, we studied the oxidative burst response of macrophages to these strains by measuring chemiluminescence and intracellular reduction of <b>Nitro</b> Blue Tetrazolium <b>dye.</b> Challenge exposure of macrophages with either the parent strain preopsonized with immune serum or the mutant strains preopsonized with normal or immune serum induced a strong oxidative burst, whereas the level was very low when the parent strain was preopsonized with normal serum. Phagocytosis of either the parent strain, in the presence of immune serum, or the mutant strains, in the presence of normal or immune serum, by macrophages reduced large amounts of intracellular Nitro Blue Tetrazolium, whereas minimal amounts were reduced by the parent strain in the presence of normal serum. These results suggest that virulent E. rhusiopathiae can survive and subsequently replicate within murine macrophages when ingested in the presence of normal serum and that the reduced production of reactive oxidative metabolites by macrophages may, in part, be responsible for this occurrence...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) {{has previously been}} shown to be impaired in smokers in comparison with healthy nonsmokers. Potent inhibition of PMN chemotaxis has been achieved with whole tobacco smoke, the gas phase of smoke, and a water-soluble extract of whole smoke. In the present work several aspects of PMN function were studied after exposure to water-soluble fraction of the particle phase of tobacco smoke collected on glass fiber filters. These tests included capillary tube random migration, chemotaxis under agarose, phagocytosis of yeasts, <b>Nitro</b> Blue Tetrazolium <b>dye</b> reduction, and whole-blood bactericidal activity. The water extract of the particle fraction of smoke had a high content of nicotine when compared with the levels achieved in plasma of smokers and a much lower concentration of aldehydes when compared with the gas phase of smoke. It had no cytotoxic effect and did not affect phagocytosis, oxygen consumption, or bactericidal activity. Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction of both resting and stimulated PMNs was significantly decreased only with the most concentrated solution. The tested solutions exerted a dose-related depressive effect on capillary tube random migration, whereas the random migration measured in the agarose chemotaxis test was normal. Nevertheless, the chemotactic response to a caseine solution was significantly decreased. The same tests were performed in the presence of several concentrations of a nicotine solution and the only test to be affected was the capillary tube random migration, and, that only at a very high concentration. The results of this study contribute to the more precise delineation of the extent of the dys{{function of}} PMNs exposed to tobacco smoke components and indicate that deleterious products are released from the particle phase of the smoke, which deposits all along the respiratory tree...|$|R
