Design/methodology/approach – This study investigates the presence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in eight African countries – Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Tunisia and Zambia – for the period 1976 to 2005 using both regional and US dollar as anchor currencies. Findings – The paper finds that currency substitution is prevalent in Ghana and Nigeria when CFA franc is used as an anchor currency. However, when US dollar is used as an anchor currency {{there is no evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in Ghana, but the presence <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in Nigeria is still observed.

The main result offers a simple {{relationship between the}} relative amount <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> held and their opportunity costs, i. e., interest and capital gains. Our hypothesis is tested by case studies for Canada and the Netherlands Antilles. In contradistinction with other studies, we conclude that the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution is very small and negative. It is shown how the omission of the interest term in other studies biases the elasticity <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution considerably...|$|R

After discussing the ambiguity surrounding the definition <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution, the paper illustrates the causes of substitutability <b>of</b> different <b>currencies</b> using a cash-in-advance model and a model where money yields liquidity services. The effects <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitutability on exchange rates, international adjustment and the inflation tax are discussed. The paper also reviews the empirical facts on the size <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution in developed and developing countries. Whereas currency substitution {{is found to be}} sizable in some developing countries and on the rise in the European Community, estimates of the ability to substitute foreign for domestic currency are often found to be unreliable due to data, methodological and conceptual problems. Policy implications <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution for international monetary cooperation and inflationary finance are explored. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} state of the use <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> {{derivatives}} in small and entrepreneurial businesses. The research concentrates on the examination of whether the literature on the use <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives differentiates between different companies with different sizes and different maturities. The analysis makes the use of qualitative data collected from three small-sized entrepreneurial companies. Among the participated companies; two are based in the UK and one in China, and are all involved in international trading. In general, the findings have produced a similar result of the rationales that are behind the use <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives in small and entrepreneurial businesses in comparison with their large and established counterparts. However, it is suggested the current situation <b>of</b> the <b>currency</b> derivative usage among the researched companies is not optimistic even though with an increasing level of concern over foreign exchange risks expressed by the interviewed owner-managers as well as the potential benefits <b>of</b> using <b>currency</b> derivatives. In addition, unlike the demand side <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives largely shared between all companies, the research discovers a number of distinctive features of the non-usage <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives in small and entrepreneurial companies in relation to large and established companies...|$|R
