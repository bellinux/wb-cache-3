According to similar reports, Baylor had been offered a different position in the organization, with the same salary, but with little to no decision-making power; Baylor refused. In fact, when pressed about his status with the franchise, Baylor had been advised by his attorneys <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> indicating that the team and Baylor are in negotiations {{to work out a}} settlement agreement based on his departure.

25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E

Steve decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to Becky because he doesn't trust Kylie and knows that she will take Max away from Becky.

500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because he was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E

2500|$|The {{release date}} for When Your Heart Stops Beating was heavily {{anticipated}} and publicized {{by the music}} press. As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006 although the band's management denied the claims.

[...] "No, It Isn't" [...] leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews before shortly prior to the release of the album, instead spending time updating his blog, producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack, and working on the album in relative secrecy. [...] "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders," [...] reported James Montgomery of MTV News.

[...] "We just bit our tongues and didn't say anything, and now that the record is done, we get the chance to tell the truth about everything," [...] Hoppus said.
