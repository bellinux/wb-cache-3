25|$|On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, {{along with}} 30 {{hardware}} and software vendors, announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> platform. The idea was to design technology based on a profile that included diskless computers, commonly coded applications using languages such as Java, and interface with the Internet using common software such as Netscape Navigator. In May 1996, Apple became {{a partner in the}} network computing effort, and used the Apple Pippin platform as its implementation. Katz Media attempted to use the <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> platform concept as a way to push the Pippin into vertical markets. Although the Apple iMac (1998) is popularly known for the disappearance of the floppy disk, the Apple Pippin platform was about two years ahead of the iMac in this effort.|$|E

These included the Acorn Archimedes range, Acorn's R line of computers (with RISC iX as a dual boot option), RiscPC, A7000 and also prototype models {{such as the}} Acorn NewsPad and Phoebe computer. A version of the OS (called NCOS) was also used in Oracle's <b>Network</b> <b>Computer</b> and compatible systems.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues for PHRs is how the technology could threaten the privacy of patient information. <b>Network</b> <b>computer</b> break-ins are becoming more common, thus storing medical information online can cause fear of the exposure of health information to unauthorized individuals. In addition to height, weight, blood pressure and other quantitative information about a patient's physical body, medical records can reveal very sensitive information, including fertility, surgical procedures, emotional and psychological disorders, and diseases, etc. Various threats exist to patient information confidentiality: ...|$|E

40|$|This project {{addresses}} two questions: (1) To {{what extent}} might <b>networked</b> <b>computer</b> technologies affect existing writing center practices? and (2) How can one make informed choices about implementing such technologies? It addresses these two questions {{through a combination}} of theoretical inquiry and qualitative research. Specifically, instrumental and substantive theories of technology are implicated in current discussions of <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> and writing center practice, and the project argues for the value of critical theory as an alternative theoretical framework that enables those who work in writing centers to critique <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> while envisioning future uses and designs. Important principles for writing center instruction are defined, principles such as individualized instruction, negotiation and dialogue, and minimal risk. The project argues that those principles should be embodied in the computer technologies that writing centers adopt. In order to ensure that such principles may be embodied in technologies adapted for writing center instruction, a set of strategies for their critique and design are defined, a set of strategies that includes both diachronic (historical) and synchronic (contemporary) critiques. A number of principles for the development and adaptation of <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> are also defined. Specifically, the project argues that design efforts must include a variety of voices, including those of students, tutors, teachers, and administrators. Many of those strategies and principles are illustrated in a study of Purdue 2 ̆ 7 s Online Writing Lab (OWL). This set of strategies and principles offers a theoretically informed set of guidelines for the implementation of <b>networked</b> <b>computer</b> technologies in writing centers in particular and for writing instruction in general. Therefore, the project should be of particular interest to writing center administrators and tutors who are using, or who are planning to incorporate, <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> in their writing centers. It also should interest writing instructors and writing program administrators who view <b>networked</b> <b>computers</b> {{as an integral part of}} writing instruction. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Thin client or network {{computing}} {{is a hot}} topic. The hype claims lower total cost of ownership, faster applications deployment and reduced management pain, compared to traditional computing architectures.

This paper is a review of <b>network</b> <b>computers</b> {{in the light of}} our experience over the past two years. Do <b>network</b> <b>computers</b> offer all that is claimed in the hype? Are there hidden costs? What are the issues of configuration, server scaling, network performance and fault diagnosis? Do they have a future in the Library arena...|$|R
