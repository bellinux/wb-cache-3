40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes (PBL) {{were collected from}} five healthy adults under standard conditions and {{on a number of}} different occasions, and used in neutralization assays of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) strain IIIB with three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Variations in <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> were observed with different batches of PBLs with, for example, titres of ICR 39. 3 b ranging from 1 / 10 to over 1 / 40000. However titres were as high, or higher, in PBLs than in C 8166 cells (a human CD 4 (+) T lymphoblastoid cell line) in 82 % (28 / 34) of tests made. Most surprising was that neutralization by the three mAbs did not vary coordinately. In one batch of PBLs the <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> of one of the mAbs might be increased while that of another mAb did not increase, or decrease. Thus PBLs could not be described as giving high or low levels of neutralization without reference to a specific mAb. This was not an assay problem as infectivity titres were relatively constant (varying by 1 to 1. 4 fold with respect to C 8166 cells), and neutralization titres were reproducible with the same batch of frozen PBLs over a three month period. Only one donor gave consistently low neutralization titres (defined here as 1 / 200; 2 / 2 batches tested) with all three mAbs, but all other donors gave similarly low titres with one of their batches of PBLs. The non-coordinate variation in <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> indicates the advisability of using antibodies of several different specificities in any kind of preventive or therapeutic immunity.

40|$|In this study, the {{immunity}} {{level of}} the southern Greek population in the 1 - 10 -year, 11 - 20 -year, 21 - 30 -year and 31 - 40 -year age groups with regard to Sabin vaccine strains {{and a collection of}} 11 recombinant and three non-recombinant poliovirus vaccine strains was determined. The results showed the lowest <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> in the 21 - 30 -year-age group against poliovirus type 3. Moreover, the capsid coding region of OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) derivatives was sequenced in order to identify mutations that might lead to antigenic changes. In Sabin- 1 derivatives a tendency of accumulation of mutations was observed in or near antigenic sites while in Sabin- 2 and Sabin- 3 derivatives in sites known to be involved in restoring neurovirulence or eliminating their temperature-sensitive phenotype. It was concluded that the combination of mutations in the capsid coding region and not the number of specific mutations in antigenic sites determines the antigenic properties of OPV derivatives and their reactivity with human sera.

Glycoprotein (G-protein) cDNA from RABV challenge virus standard- 11 (CVS- 11) and EBLV- 1 and - 2 were cloned and co-expressed with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag–pol and packageable green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter genes in human cells. The harvested lentiviral (HIV) vector infected over 40  % of baby hamster kidney (BHK) target cells, providing high-titre pseudotype stocks. Tests on blinded antibody-positive (n= 15) and -negative (n= 45) sera, predetermined by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Office International des Epizooties (OIE), revealed that the CVS- 11 pseudotype assay had 100  % concordance with FAVN and strongly correlated with <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres</b> (r 2 = 0. 89). Cross-neutralization tests using sera from RABV-vaccinated humans and animals on pseudotypes with CVS- 11, EBLV- 1 and EBLV- 2 envelopes showed that the relative <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres</b> correlated broadly with the degree of G-protein diversity. Pseudotypes have three major advantages over live-virus neutralization tests: (i) they can be handled in low-biohazard-level laboratories; (ii) the use of reporter genes such as GFP or β-galactosidase will allow the assay to be undertaken at low cost in laboratories worldwide; (iii) each assay requires < 10  μl serum.

40|$|Sequential serum samples, {{collected}} over a 2 - 3 year follow-up period, of 28 HIV-infected individuals were {{tested for the}} presence of neutralizing antibodies against one HIV isolate, HTLV-IIIB, and titrated, by Western blotting, against different HTLV-III specific proteins. Neutralizing antibodies were found in 66 % of the samples tested and highest neutralization titres observed in cases with lymphadenopathy syndrome. Antibody titres against the viral proteins also seemed to be highest in cases with LAS. Neutralization titres correlated well with antibodies to envelope glycoproteins gp 41 and gp 120 and to one of the core proteins, p 17. An increase in <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> during the follow-up period was associated with a stable clinical course. Furthermore, the occurrence of antibodies directed against the external envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) in the initial serum sample correlated well with a stable clinical course. The results suggest that neutralizing activity in the serum, particularly that evoked against gp 120, may have some prognostic significance, and that several distinct antigenic epitopes on the virus may be a target for neutralizing antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) {{are common}} human {{pathogens}} {{that can cause}} painful but benign manifestations and recurrent complaints, but can also cause significant morbidity and mortality on infection of the eye or brain and with disseminated infection of an immunosuppressed patient or a neonate. HSV growth inhibition measurement by plaque or yield reduction is a key task {{in the development of}} novel antiviral compounds but the manual methods are very labour intensive. The sensitive and specific PCR technology could be an effective method for quantitation of HSV DNA related to virus replication; however the currently described PCR approaches have a major limitation, namely the requirement of purification of DNA from the infected cells. This limitation makes this approach unfeasible for high-throughput screenings. The monitoring of HSV specific antibody titre is essential in vaccination trials and in the improvement of HSV-based oncolytic virotherapy. Usually, conventional cytopathic effect-based and plaque reduction neutralization tests are applied to measure the <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre,</b> but these methods are also time-consuming. To overcome this, we developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for the detection of HSV- 2 DNA directly from the infected cells (direct qPCR) and the method was further adapted to measure the titre of HSV specific neutralizing antibody in human sera. The conditions of direct qPCR assay were optimized to measure the antiviral activity of known and novel antiviral substances. Using HSV- 2 seronegative and seropositive patients' sera, the validity of the direct qPCR neutralization test was compared to traditional cytopathic effect-based assay. The direct qPCR method was able to detect the HSV- 2 DNA quantitatively between multiplicity of infection 1 / 64 and 1 / 4194304, indicating that the dynamic range of the detection was approximately 65, 500 fold with high correlation between the biological and technical replicates. As a proof of the adaptability of the method, we applied the direct qPCR for antiviral inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50) measurements of known and novel antiviral compounds. The measured IC 50 of acyclovir was approximately 0. 28 mug/ml, similar to the previously published IC 50 value. The IC 50 of novel antiviral candidates was between 1. 6 - 3. 1 mug/ml. The direct qPCR-based neutralization titres of HSV positive sera were 1 : 32 - 1 : 64, identical to the neutralization titres determined using a traditional neutralization assay. The negative sera did not inhibit the HSV- 2 replication in either of the tests. Our direct qPCR method for the HSV- 2 growth determination of antiviral IC 50 and <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> is less time-consuming, less subjective and a more accurate alternative to the traditional plaque titration and growth reduction assays...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} to what extend vaccines from the German or EU vaccine bank would protect also against infection with FMDV strains of serotype A which clearly deviate from the vaccine stain, homologous and heterologous cattle challenge experiments were carried out. It could {{be shown that}} FMD vaccines to serotype A with a homologous potency that is very high but often reached by modern vaccine bank vaccines can protect even against fairly distant challenge strains. In order to improve the capabilities of diagnostic laboratories to predict cross protection, the correlation between protection and antibody titre was investigated. It could be shown that the titres of neutralizing antibodies in post-vaccinal sera to the challenge virus generally correlated well with the protection - which supports {{the choice of a}} suitable vaccine. In order to facilitate rapid exploitation of the correlation between protection and <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre,</b> a new cell line for virus isolation was established. It could be shown that the fetal goat cell line ZZ-R 127 allowes to isolate virus strains of all seven serotypes faster and with a higher sensitivity than the cell lines that had been used so far.

40|$|A {{controlled}} calfhood vaccination {{trial to}} prevent bovine virus diarrhea {{was conducted in}} a 100 head cow-calf operation with a three year history of annual calf losses due to enteric bovine virus diarrhea (persistently infected herd). Approximately 50 % of the calves were vaccinated at six, 12 and 24 weeks of age. Paired serum samples and growth data were collected on three occasions for comparison between vaccinates and controls. Three vaccinated calves died of enteric bovine virus diarrhea {{in the first year}} of the trial and one nonvaccinated calf died in the second year. Two of the three vaccinated calves had developed bovine virus diarrhea virus <b>neutralization</b> antibody <b>titres</b> of 2048 or greater before developing clinical signs. The control and third vaccinated calf failed to seroconvert before dying of enteric bovine virus diarrhea. Approximately 90 % of the vaccinated calves seroconverted compared to approximately 40 % of the controls. Paired serum samples collected from 75 % of the cows in the spring, summer and fall of each year of the trial, showed persistent high bovine virus diarrhea virus <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres</b> in all samples. Calf vaccination before 12 weeks of age had little effect on seroconversion due to high levels of passive antibody to bovine virus diarrhea.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAb) against sequential or conformational epitopes on {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) passively protected neonatal syngeneic (BALB/c) mice at dilutions at which they could not neutralize virus infectivity in vitro. The B 2, D 9, 1 C 6 and 4 C 9 MAb, against the Group 1 (sequential) and Group 2 (conformational) epitopes, protected the mice at an antibody:virion molar ratio of between 38 : 1 and 84 : 1 (12 - 18 times lower than that required for neutralization of virus infectivity in vitro). The 3 C 8 (Group 3) and 6 C 3 (Group 4) MAb were, respectively, between 5 and 12 times, and between 18 and 40 times, less efficient at protection. There was no consistent correlation between the efficiency of neutralization of virus infectivity in vitro {{and the protection of}} neonatal mice against the virus pathogen. Thus, immune protection against FMDV must use mechanisms other than the direct neutralization of virus infectivity by antibody. Complement did not increase the virus <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> of the MAb, but pepsin digestion of the MAb abrogated the enhanced in vivo protection over in vitro neutralization, with little effect on their capacity to neutralize virus infectivity. It is therefore likely that opsonization to a minimum affinity, and subsequent rapid phagocytosis, {{play a major role in}} the immune defence against FMDV. This is discussed in terms of the natural host for FMDV and the induction of immunological protection...|$|E
40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{relationships between}} three bovine rotaviruses, UK, CP- 1 and PP- 1, and a porcine rotavirus were investigated; their pathogenicity for piglets was also assessed. After propagation and cloning in cell culture, the four viruses {{were used to}} produce convalescent and hyperimmune antisera in gnotobiotic animals. For the UK and PP- 1 viruses, reciprocal virus neutralization tests gave ratios of homologous to heterologous titres in the range 57 to> 2300. Taking a 20 -fold difference in titre to be the criterion of heterogeneity, these two viruses could be regarded as separate serotypes. The third bovine virus, CP- 1, was identical to PP- 1 in reciprocal neutralization tests but gave a one-way cross-reaction with UK convalescent sera, i. e. {{it appeared to be}} intermediate between the two serotypes. UK and CP- 1 differed antigenically from the porcine virus as shown by. homologous:heterologous <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> ratios of 30 to 12 600. The bovine virus, PP- 1, however, had a closer relationship with the porcine virus, the homologous: heterologous ratios ranging from 4 to 110. Oral inoculation of piglets with the bovine viruses revealed differences in their pathogenicity. Isolates UK and CP- 1 caused no clinical disease and could not be passaged. However, on the first and second passages in pigs, the bovine virus PP- 1 and the porcine virus produced clinical disease, excretion of virus in the faeces and seroconversion. The results suggest that PP- 1 may be a natural hybrid between a bovine and a porcine rotavirus...|$|E
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that an {{effective}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) vaccine should be capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. However, even the best antibodies known to date lack neutralizing ability against {{a significant proportion of}} primary HIV- 1 variants and, despite great efforts, still no immunogen is available that can elicit humoral immunity which is protective against infection or disease progression. We tested sera from 35 participants in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV- 1 infection, who were all infected with HIV- 1 subtype B and therapy-naïve at the time of sampling, for neutralizing activity against a panel of 23 tier 2 – 3 HIV- 1 variants, with a minimum of five HIV- 1 variants per subtype (A, B, C and D). Strong cross-clade neutralizing activity was detected in sera from seven individuals. Strikingly, sera from 22 of 35 individuals (63  %) neutralized three or more of the six tier 2 – 3 HIV- 1 subtype B viruses in the panel. There was a strong correlation between <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> and breadth in serum. Indeed, the IC 50 of sera with strong cross-clade neutralizing activity was significantly higher than the IC 50 of sera with cross-subtype B activity, which, in turn, had a higher IC 50 than sera with the lowest neutralization breadth. These results imply that humoral immunity, at least in HIV- 1 subtype B-infected individuals, is often subtype-specific rather than strain-specific and that the breadth of neutralization is correlated with the titre of neutralizing activity in serum. Considering the difficulties in designing a vaccine that is capable of eliciting cross-clade neutralizing activity, subtype-specific vaccines may be explored as an interesting alternative...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Avian {{influenza}} virus H 5 N 1 has demonstrated considerable pandemic potential. Currently, no effective vaccines for H 5 N 1 infection are available, so passive immunotherapy {{may be an}} alternative strategy. To investigate the possible therapeutic effect of antibody against highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 virus on a mammal host, we prepared specific equine anti-H 5 N 1 IgGs from horses vaccinated with inactivated H 5 N 1 virus, and then obtained the F(ab') 2 fragments by pepsin digestion of IgGs. Methods The horses were vaccinated with inactivated H 5 N 1 vaccine to prepare anti-H 5 N 1 IgGs. The F(ab') 2 fragments were purified from anti-H 5 N 1 hyperimmune sera by a protocol for 'enhanced pepsin digestion'. The protective effect of the F(ab') 2 fragments against H 5 N 1 virus infection was determined in cultured MDCK cells by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay and in a BALB/c mouse model by survival rate assay. Results By the protocol for 'enhanced pepsin digestion', total 16 g F(ab') 2 fragments were finally obtained from one liter equine antisera with the purity of over 90 %. The H 5 N 1 -specific F(ab') 2 fragments had a HI titer of 1 : 1024, and the <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> of F(ab') 2 reached 1 : 2048. The in vivo assay showed that 100 μ g of the F(ab') 2 fragments could protect BALB/c mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza H 5 N 1 virus. Conclusion The availability of highly purified H 5 N 1 -specific F(ab') 2 fragments may be promising for treatment of influenza H 5 N 1 infection.

40|$|The {{ability of}} eight {{neutralizing}} monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for structural proteins of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) to protect mice passively against MCMV infection was examined to determine firstly whether a correlation {{existed between the}} neutralization titres of the MAbs in vitro and the protection afforded by the MAbs in vivo and, secondly, {{the contribution of the}} host towards neutralization by the MAbs in vivo. The reduction in MCMV titre in the livers of BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 10 mice by the MAbs closely correlated with their neutralization titres in vitro. However, in the spleens of BALB/c mice, in which MCMV replicates to high titre, almost all of the MAbs tested were ineffective in reducing MCMV replication. Indeed, a significant increase in splenic MCMV replication was observed in mice treated 24 h prior to MCMV replication with either neutralizing MAbs or polyclonal Ig. Each of six MAbs prophylacti-cally protected between 66 and 100 % of mice from an intraperitoneal challenge with 4 LDs 0 MCMV regardless of their <b>neutralization</b> <b>titre</b> in vitro. The persistence of MCMV replication in the salivary gland was not prevented by either polyelonal Ig or MAbs. Despite the absolute requirement for complement for the neutralization of MCMV in vitro, both polyclonal lg and MAb 4 F 9 protected A/J mice, which are deficient in the fifth component of complement, as efficiently as they did complement competent BALB/c mice. These results demonstrate that MAbs specific for single MCMV polypeptides are protective in vivo. In addition, {{the extent to which the}} MAbs protected against MCMV could not be predicted from their immunoreactive or neutralizing titres in vitro or by their effect on splenic MCMV replication in vivo. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the mechanism(s) of neutralization of MCMV in vitro are different to those which act in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Many acute viral infections can be {{controlled}} by vaccination; however, vaccinating against persistent infections remains problematic. Herpesviruses are a classic example. Here, we discuss their immune control, particularly that of gamma-herpesviruses, relating the animal model provided by murid herpesvirus- 4 (MuHV- 4) to human infections. The following points emerge: (i) CD 8 + T-cell evasion by herpesviruses confers {{a prominent role in}} host defence on CD 4 + T cells. CD 4 + T cells inhibit MuHV- 4 lytic gene expression via gamma-interferon (IFN-c). By reducing the lytic secretion of immune evasion proteins, they may also help CD 8 + T cells to control virus-driven lymphoproliferation in mixed lytic/latent lesions. Similarly, CD 4 + T cells specific for Epstein–Barr virus lytic antigens could improve the impact of adoptively transferred, latent antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells. (ii) In general, viral immune evasion necessitates multiple host effectors for optimal control. Thus, subunit vaccines, which tend to prime single effectors, have proved less successful than attenuated virus mutants, which prime multiple effectors. Latency-deficient mutants could make safe and effective gamma-herpesvirus vaccines. (iii) The antibody response to MuHV- 4 infection helps to prevent disease but is suboptimal for neutralization.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the immune response in Peruvian children following measles vaccination. METHODS: Fifty-five Peruvian children received Schwarz measles vaccine (about 10 (3) plaque forming units) at about 9 months of age. Blood samples were taken before vaccination, then twice after vaccination: one sample at between 1 and 4 weeks after vaccination {{and the final}} sample 3 months post vaccination for evaluation of immune cell phenotype and lymphoproliferative responses to measles and non-measles antigens. Measles-specific antibodies were measured by plaque reduction neutralization. FINDINGS: The humoral response developed rapidly after vaccination; only 4 of the 55 children (7 %) had plaque reduction <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres</b> < 200 mlU/ml 3 months after vaccination. However, only 8 out of 35 children tested (23 %) had lymphoproliferative responses to measles antigens 3 - 4 weeks after vaccination. Children with poor lymphoproliferative responses to measles antigens had readily detectable lymphoproliferative responses to other antigens. Flow cytometric analysis of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} revealed diffuse immune system activation at the time of vaccination in most children. The capacity to mount a lymphoproliferative response to measles antigens was associated with expression of CD 45 RO on CD 4 + T-cells. CONCLUSION: The 55 Peruvian children had excellent antibody responses after measles vaccination, but only 23 % (8 out of 35) generated detectable lymphoproliferative responses to measles antigens (compared with 55 - 67 % in children in the industrialized world). This difference may contribute to the less than uniform success of measles vaccination programmes in the developing world...|$|R

40|$|Two bovine rotaviruses, C 3 - 160 and 17 / 4, which multiplied in calves without {{inducing}} disease, {{were studied}} {{for their ability}} to protect against disease caused by a virulent rotavirus, CP- 1. Rotavirus 17 / 4 and the virulent virus CP- 1 cross-neutralized poorly and, on the basis of 20 -fold differences in <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres,</b> belonged to different serotypes. Rotaviruses C 3 - 160 and CP- 1 were more closely related: neutralization of the CP- 1 virus by C 3 - 160 antisera was within 20 -fold of the homologous <b>titre</b> although <b>neutralization</b> fthe C 3 - 160 virus by CP- 1 antisera was not. Nine gnotobiotic calves infected with either C 3 - 160 or 17 / 4, had rotavirus antibody in their faeces and/or serum 21 days after oral inoculation as detected by indirect immunofluorescence and IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies by ELISA. As expected from the antigenic relationships between the viruses, the sera and faeces from the four calves infected with C 3 - 160 contained moderate l vels of neutralizing antibody to the virulent virus CP- 1 and the sera and most of the faeces from the five calves infected with 17 / 4 contained undetectable or low levels. When challenged with CP- 1 on day 21, four age-matched controls developed isease whereas all of four calves previously infected with C 3 - 160 and four of five calves previously infected with 17 / 4 were protected from disease. It was concluded that avirulent rotavirus infection provided protection against disease caused by a virulent rotavirus even when one of the avirulent viruses was poorly related to the virulent virus by neutralization. Mechanisms other than neutralizing antibody appeared to be important in protection...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{dynamics}} of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in long-term AIDS-free HIV- 1 -infected subjects and establish correlations with known markers of disease progression. Cross-sectional study using sera collected from long-term non-progressors (LTNP) 8 years after seroconversion or study entry. Longitudinal study using sera collected from LTNP at 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years after seroconversion and, as controls, from rapid progressors. Individuals with documented AIDS-free HIV- 1 infection for at least 8 years were evaluated for NAb against five heterologous HIV- 1 primary isolates. In the cross-sectional study, serum viral RNA levels, CD 4 + T-cell numbers and T-cell function were determined on samples collected during the eighth year of follow-up. For the longitudinal study, NAb were assessed in sequential sera taken from LTNP and rapid progressors. Serum <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres</b> found in individual sera differed from one HIV- 1 isolate to another, were detected in 49 - 76 % of LTNP, without correlation with the coreceptor usage of the isolate, and were positively associated with CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts (P = 0. 0041) and T-cell function (P = 0. 04). No correlation was found between NAb {{and the level of}} viral RNA in serum or the rate of CD 4 + T-cell decline. Longitudinal analysis of sera from LTNP and rapid progressors showed that although several subjects in both groups had neutralizing activity at seroconversion, it thereafter became lower or no longer detectable. NAb were again found 1 - 4 years later and stably persisted in LTNP, but remained undetectable or at low levels in rapid progressors. NAb were preferentially found in subjects with relatively preserved T-cell function and CD 4 + T-cell numbers. In these individuals, neutralizing activity against heterologous isolates increased with time. These data suggest that the capacity to produce broadly NAb {{is a function of the}} integrity of the immune syste...|$|R
40|$|West Nile Virus (WNV) is a {{pathogenic}} arbovirus {{that belongs}} to genus Flavivirus under family Flaviviridae. Till now there are no approved vaccines against WNV for human use. In this study, the effect of two alkylating agents, formaldehyde and β-PL, generally used for inactivated vaccine preparation, was assessed {{on the basis of}} antigenic and immunogenic potential of the inactivated WNV. Lineage 5 WNV isolates were inactivated by both formalin and β-PL treatments. Inactivation was confirmed by repeated passage in BHK- 21 cell line and infant mice. Viruses inactivated by both the treatments showed higher antigenicity. Immune response in mice model showed serum anti-WNV antibody titre was moderately higher in formalin inactivated antigen compared to β-PL inactivated antigen. However, no significant differences were observed in <b>neutralization</b> antibody <b>titre.</b> In conclusion, we can state that both formaldehyde and β-PL inactivation processes were found to be equally efficient for inactivation of WNV.

40|$|A plant virus, cowpea mosaic virus, {{expressing a}} 22 amino acid peptide 731 - 752 of the gp 41 {{glycoprotein}} of human immunodeficency virus type 1 (HIV- 1 IIIB), was shown previously to stimulate HIV- 1 cross reactive neutralizing antibodies in adult C 57 /BL 6 mice. Here some parameters concerning the stimulation of HIV- 1 -specific neutralizing and ELISA antibody have been determined in adult C 57 /BL 6, C 3 H/He-mg and BALB/c mice Two injections per mouse of all CPMV-HIV/ 1 doses tested (100, 10 and 1 mu g chimera which contained, respectively, 1700, 170 and 17 ng HIV peptide per injection) stimulated a strong serum neutralizing antibody response in all mice. One hundred micrograms or 10 mu g CPMV-HIV/ 1 per injection gave 99 % neutralization of HIV- 1 IIIB in C 8166 cells at a serum dilution of 1 / 200, whereas sera from mice immunized with 1 mu g per injection neutralized virus to 97 %, 79 % and 63 % at a 1 / 200 dilution of serum from C 3 H/He-mg, C 57 /BL 6 and BALB/c mice respectively. Restimulation of these mice {{with the same}} immunogen dose marginally increased the <b>neutralization</b> <b>titres.</b> The longevity of the neutralizing antibody response increased as the immunogen dose decreased and was dependent on the strain of mouse, in the order C 57 /BL 6 C 3 H/He-mgBALB/c. Re-immunization with a third injection improved the longevity of the antibody response. All mice immunized with 100 mu g CPMV-HIV/ 1 responded with ELISA antibody to the gp 41 peptide bound in solid phase. Ten micrograms stimulated ELISA antibody in some but not all mice, while mice immunized with 1 mu g had no detectable ELISA antibody. This synthesis of ELISA antibody decreased {{greater than or equal}} to 230 -fold over the range of immunogen doses tested but, in the same mice, the neutralizing antibody response decreased only twofold, showing an unusual bias to production of the fatter. Neutralizing antibodies were thus stimulated at a lower immunogen dose than ELISA antibodies. Antibody which was affinity purified using the free gp 41 peptide gave a good ELISA titre but did not neutralize HIV- 1, suggesting that the neutralizing antibody is recognizing a conformational epitope on the gp 41 oligomer...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines (IIV) may elicit production of heterosubtypic antibodies, which can neutralize avian H 5 N 1 virus in a small proportion of subjects. We hypothesized that prime boost regimens of live and inactivated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines (LAIV and IIV) would enhance production of heterosubtypic immunity and provide evidence of cross-protection against other influenza viruses. METHODS: In an open-label study, 26 adult volunteers were randomized to receive one of four vaccine regimens containing two doses of 2009 - 10 seasonal influenza vaccines administered 8 (± 1) weeks apart: 2 doses of LAIV; 2 doses of IIV; LAIV then IIV; IIV then LAIV. Humoral immunity assays for avian H 5 N 1, 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 (pH 1 N 1), and seasonal vaccine strains were performed on blood collected pre-vaccine and 2 and 4 weeks later. The percentage of cytokine-producing T-cells was compared with baseline 14 days after each dose. RESULTS: Subjects receiving IIV had prompt serological responses to vaccine strains. Two subjects receiving heterologous prime boost regimens had enhanced haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and <b>neutralization</b> (NT) <b>titres</b> against pH 1 N 1, and one subject against avian H 5 N 1; all three had pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies detected at baseline. Significantly elevated titres to H 5 N 1 and pH 1 N 1 by neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay were observed following LAIV-IIV administration. Both vaccines elicited cross-reactive CD 4 + T-cell responses to nucleoprotein of avian H 5 N 1 and pH 1 N 1. All regimens were safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Neither homologous nor heterologous prime boost immunization enhanced serum HI and NT titres to 2009 pH 1 N 1 or avian H 5 N 1 compared to single dose vaccine. However heterologous prime-boost vaccination did lead to in vitro evidence of cross-reactivity by NI; the significance of this finding is unclear. These data support the strategy of administering single dose trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine at the outset of an influenza pandemic while a specific vaccine is being developed.

40|$|International audienceAbstractThe Sterne live spore vaccine (34 F 2) is {{the most}} widely used {{veterinary}} vaccine against anthrax in animals. Antibody responses to several antigens of Bacillus anthracis have been described with a large focus on those against protective antigen (PA). The focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate the protective humoral immune response induced by the live spore anthrax vaccine in goats. Boer goats vaccinated twice (week 0 and week 12) with the Sterne live spore vaccine and naive goats were used to monitor the anti-PA and toxin neutralizing antibodies at week 4 and week 17 (after the second vaccine dose) post vaccination. A/J mice were passively immunized with different dilutions of sera from immune and naive goats and then challenged with spores of B. anthracis strain 34 F 2 to determine the protective capacity of the goat sera. The goat anti-PA ELISA titres indicated significant sero-conversion at week 17 after the second doses of vaccine (p =  0. 009). Mice receiving undiluted sera from goats given two doses of vaccine (twice immunized) showed the highest protection (86 %) with only 20 % of mice receiving 1 : 1000 diluted sera surviving lethal challenge. The in vitro toxin <b>neutralization</b> assay (TNA) <b>titres</b> correlated to protection of passively immunized A/J mice against lethal infection with the vaccine strain Sterne 34 F 2 spores using immune goat sera up to a 1 : 10 dilution (rs ≥  0. 522, p =  0. 046). This study suggests that the passive mouse protection model could be potentially used to evaluate the protective immune response in livestock animals vaccinated with the current live vaccine and new vaccines...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe live oral {{poliovirus}} vaccine (OPV) strains {{are genetically}} unstable, causing, in rare cases, vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Reversions {{of the known}} attenuating mutations in OPV strains and intertypic recombination {{have been identified as}} the underlying causes of the increased neurovirulence of poliovirus isolates. In this study, three OPV isolates (one non-recombinant and two recombinants) were tested in order to correlate phenotypic traits such as temperature sensitivity (Rct test) and growth kinetics (one-step growth curve test) with mutations and recombination events of the viral genome. Moreover, the immunity level of the western Greek population aged 1 – 40 years was evaluated against OPV isolates and Sabin vaccine strains, with a microneutralization assay. Members of the 1 – 40 -year age group (both pooled and individual sera) showed no significant differences in <b>neutralization</b> test (NT) <b>titres</b> against OPV isolates in comparison with the Sabin vaccine strains. However, all three OPV isolates showed reverted phenotypic traits in Rct or one-step growth curve assays. The results of our study revealed a significant decrease in immunity level from the 1 – 10 -year age group to the 21 – 30 -year age group (pooled sera) for both poliovirus types 1 and 3. For both poliovirus types, the highest NT titres were observed in the 1 – 10 -year age group, and the lowest NT titre was observed in the 21 – 30 -year age group, towards poliovirus type 3. Our study underlines the need for immunological studies in all age groups, in order to allow reconsideration of the current vaccination policies and to avoid epidemics caused by the circulation of highly evolved OPV derivatives...|$|R

Four bulls (Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5) were inoculated intratesticularly with 10 (5) plaque-forming units of bovine herpesvirus- 4 (BHV- 4) in each {{testicle}} (Day 0). The challenge BHV- 4 strain was previously isolated from testicle cells of a bull exhibiting orchitis and azoospermia. The fifth bull (No. 1) {{was used as a}} control and received the same volume of uninfected cell culture supernatant. For 5 days, beginning on Day 51 post-infection, two bulls (Nos. 4 and 5) and the control bull (No. 1) received 0. 1 mg kg- 1 of dexamethasone. Unilateral castrations were then performed at regular intervals for viral examination. Treatment with dexamethasone reactivated latent BHV- 4, but no clinical signs were observed in treated bulls {{until the end of the}} experiment (Day 93). Only Bull 3 showed conjunctivitis and temporary azoospermia. The virus was recovered from various samples showing that: (i) BHV- 4 can be present in a latent state in the testicles and mononuclear blood cells; (ii) dexamethasone reactivates the virus; (iii) the virus is excreted by nasal and ocular routes. Each infected bull seroconverted and a booster antibody response appeared after dexamethasone treatment as shown by immunofluorescence. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in each bull by complement-dependent <b>neutralization</b> test with <b>titres</b> higher than those obtained by a classical neutralization test.
