25|$|In the animation, {{juvenile}} herring {{hunt the}} copepods in synchronization: The copepods sense with their antennae the pressure-wave {{of an approaching}} herring and react with a fast escape jump. The length of the jump is fairly constant. The fish align themselves in a grid with this characteristic jump length. A copepod can dart about 80 times before it tires out. After a jump, it takes it 60 milliseconds to spread its antennae again, and this time delay becomes its undoing, as the almost endless stream of herrings allows a herring to eventually snap the copepod. A single juvenile herring could <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> a large copepod.|$|E

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting anything.

500|$|The {{philosophy}} of mind also has important {{consequences for the}} concept of self. If by [...] "self" [...] or [...] "I" [...] one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the person, some modern philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion. The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives {{from the idea of}} an immaterial soul. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of [...] "self" [...] as postulated by David Hume, who could <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> himself not doing, thinking or feeling anything. However, in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology, developmental biology and neuroscience, the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.|$|E

Soderbergh also noted Mitch's [...] "common individual" [...] lack of medical and scientific knowledge, though keeping the situation dynamic and compelling was challenging for the director, as he was concerned that Emhoff would be a one-dimensional character. Soderbergh felt that Damon understood the concept and addressed the producers' concerns. [...] "You <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> him acting", said Soderbergh. [...] "There's no vanity, no self-consciousness in his performance; it's as if the cameras aren't there." [...] Writer Scott Z. Burns sent him a copy of the script with a [...] "read this and then go wash your hands" [...] note attached to it. Damon recalled: [...] "I just really want to be in this movie. It was a terrific, riveting, really fast read and really exciting and really horrifying, but managed to be really touching." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} the first to feature Alfre Woodard and Mehcad Brooks as series regulars after they were {{introduced}} in the final two episodes of the first season. Woodard played Betty Applewhite, a [...] "deeply religious, overbearing single mother" [...] while Mehcad portrayed her son, Matthew. In regards to the characters and their mystery storyline, Cherry stated: [...] "They come on the street; they seem like nice people—but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful all at the same time." [...] Woodard commented that her character [...] "never means harm... Let's just say she has flaws. She had to make some really tough decisions quick and if the law ever catches up with her, she'll have to serve time... But they'll <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> her." [...] The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first season finale but saved for [...] "Next" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 {{newspaper}} report {{notes that}} [...] "no worries" [...] {{has begun to}} be used in American English. Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser, Samela Harris comments: [...] "The Americans have no idea of the etymology of 'no worries'. So, while they may cheerily adopt our 'no worries' mantra, 'no worries' will <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> on as an attitude." [...] According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including [...] "no worries", [...] "absolutely", and [...] "bottom line" [...] have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings. The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English.|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Richie Unterberger, Tommy was hailed by contemporary critics as the Who's breakthrough, but its critical standing diminished {{slightly in the}} subsequent decades, because of its occasionally pretentious concept and flimsy songs that functioned as devices to [...] "advance the rather sketchy plot." [...] Christgau wrote in 1983, [...] "Tommys operatic pretensions were so transparent that for years it seemed safe to guess that Townshend's musical ideas would <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> up with his lyrics." [...] In his review for AllMusic, Unterberger said that, despite its slight flaws, the album has [...] "many excellent songs" [...] permeated with [...] "a suitably powerful grace", while Townshend's ability to devise a lengthy narrative introduced [...] "new possibilities to rock music." [...] Uncut wrote that the album [...] "doesn't quite realise its ambitions, though it achieves {{a lot on the}} way", and felt it was not as well developed as their later album, Quadrophenia. Mark Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), felt that [...] "in retrospect, Tommy isn't quite the masterpiece it was originally hyped to be", suggesting The Who Sell Out was better, though because of Townshend, it produced several [...] "bona fide classic songs".|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{was cast}} in the {{independent}} drama Boys Don't Cry (1999) after director Kimberly Peirce saw her performance in The Last Days of Disco. Sevigny's role in Boys Don't Cry—a biographical film of trans man Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska in 1993—was responsible for her rise to prominence and her mainstream success. Sevigny played Lana Tisdel, {{a young woman who}} fell in love with Teena, initially unaware {{of the fact that he}} was biologically female and continued the relationship despite learning about his birth gender. Boys Don't Cry received high praise from critics, and was a moderate box-office success. Sevigny's performance was singled out as one of the film's strong points and was widely embraced as one of the best acted films of that year: The Los Angeles Times stated that Sevigny [...] "plays the role with haunting immediacy", Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times stated that [...] "it is Sevigny who provides our entrance into the story" [...] and Rolling Stone wrote that Sevigny gives a [...] "performance that burns into the memory". Director Kimberly Peirce echoed the same feelings of the critics: [...] "Chloë just surrendered to the part. She watched videos of Lana. She just became her very naturally. She's not one of those Hollywood actresses who diets and gets plastic surgery. You <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> her acting." [...] The role earned Sevigny Best Supporting Actress nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Sevigny won an Independent Spirit Award, a Satellite Award, and a Sierra Award for her performance.|$|E

5000|$|In {{reviewing}} The Mark of Cain, Britmovie wrote, [...] "... {{the story}} <b>never</b> <b>catches</b> fire, {{one reason for}} this is the heavy-handed direction of Brian Desmond Hurst which fails to maintain adequate suspense.

Sally Gray is somewhat inconsequential and there’s no spark of chemistry between the leads." ...|$|R

2500|$|After Germany was {{united by}} Otto von Bismarck into the [...] "German Reich", he {{determined}} German politics until 1890. Bismarck tried to foster alliances in Europe, {{on one hand}} to contain France, {{and on the other}} hand to consolidate Germany's influence in Europe. On the domestic front Bismarck tried to stem the rise of socialism by anti-socialist laws, combined with an introduction of health care and social security. At the same time Bismarck tried to reduce the political influence of the emancipated Catholic minority in the Kulturkampf, literally [...] "culture struggle". The Catholics only grew stronger, forming the Center (Zentrum) Party. Germany grew rapidly in industrial and economic power, matching Britain by 1900. Its highly professional army was the best in the world, but the navy could <b>never</b> <b>catch</b> up with Britain's Royal Navy.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that lead singer Gary Lightbody wrote the song, sober after a binge of white wine, in the garden of producer Jacknife Lee's Kent cottage. The song has Lightbody singing a plain melody over sparse guitars, which has an ever-building crescendo. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he said [...] "It's the purest love song that I've ever written. There's no knife-in-the-back twist. When I read these lyrics back, I was like, 'Oh, that's weird.' All the other love songs I've written have a dark edge." [...] The phrase [...] "Chasing Cars" [...] came from Lightbody's father, in reference to a girl Lightbody was infatuated with, [...] "You're like a dog chasing a car.

[...] The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first-season finale but saved for [...] "Next" [...] instead. While the Applewhites are regarded as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated that the role of Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues. He clarified: [...] "There's nothing strategically black about her character. Her color is incidental." [...] Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became [...] "instantly hooked" [...] on the series. Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role. Both Brooks and his brother, Billy, auditioned for the role of Matthew. The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors. According to Cherry, Brooks was cast because he exuded a [...] "dangerous" [...] element, as well as [...] "a combination of this wholesome, sweet quality and a dark, brooding quality." ...|$|E
