In 0. 04 mol dm– 3 Britton-Robinson buffers, <b>novobiocin</b> <b>sodium</b> has developed an irreversible cathodic wave over the pH range 5 – 12. The variation of the potential and/or current of reduction signal with pH of the supporting electrolyte and instrumental variables such as scan rate, frequency, pulse height and deposition time have been studied. Novobiocin exhibits an adsorption characteristic due to its adsorption phenomena. It has been {{also found that the}} adsorption of novobiocin on the electrode surface depends predominantly on the pH of the supporting electrolyte. Since the electrode reaction mechanism of <b>novobiocin</b> <b>sodium</b> has been firstly discussed, a mechanism is proposed for the reduction process. At the mercury electrode, the reduction of <b>novobiocin</b> <b>sodium</b> has been probably carried out by means of the attack of hydroxyl ion to the coumarin moiety in the molecular structure and then the consumption of two electrons. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{coumarin}} antibiotic novobiocin forms ion {{channels of}} varying conductances in lipid bilayers. The conductances (about 20, 22, 14, 7 and 2 pS for 100 mM NH 4 Cl, CsCl, KCl, NaCl and LiCl, respectively) and selectivities (cation transference {{numbers in the}} range of 0. 97 - 0. 98) of one type of novobiocin-induced channel are similar to those found for channels formed by gramicidin A, an antibiotic of very different structure. The conductance of novobiocin channels of this type was independent of the species of the membrane lipid. This observation suggests that novobiocin molecules directly form these channels, and that channels are not formed through defects in lipid structure. The similarity in conductance and ion selectivity between channels induced by novobiocin and those formed by gramicidin A suggests that these structurally different molecules form channels with comparable internal diameter and internal surface charge distribution. Using HPLC purification we argue that the channel-forming activity of novobiocin is related to the activity of the novobiocin molecule itself, and not to a contaminant of the commercially available <b>novobiocin</b> <b>sodium</b> salt preparation...|$|E
40|$|In Helicobacter pylori, the {{contribution}} of efflux proteins to antibiotic resistance is not well established. As translocases that act in parallel may have overlapping substrate specificities, the loss of function of one such translocase may be compensated for by that of another translocase with no effect on susceptibilities to antibiotics. The genome of H. pylori 26695 was assessed {{for the presence of}} putative translocases and outer membrane efflux or TolC-like proteins which could interact to form efflux systems involved in drug resistance. Twenty-seven translocases were identified, of which HP 1184 was the sole representative of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family of translocases and which could thus have a unique substrate specificity. In addition, four TolC-like proteins (HP 0605, HP 0971, HP 1327, and HP 1489) were identified. Thus, it is feasible that inactivation of a TolC-like protein would affect the functions of multiple translocases. We aimed to determine whether efflux systems contribute to antimicrobial susceptibility by evaluation of the susceptibility profiles of an HP 1184 -knockout mutant, four mutants in which one of the four TolC homologs was inactivated, as well as a mutant in which both HP 0605 and HP 0971 were inactivated. The HP 1184 - and HP 1489 -knockout mutants both showed increased susceptibilities to ethidium bromide, while the HP 0605 -knockout mutant exhibited increased susceptibilities to <b>novobiocin</b> and <b>sodium</b> deoxycholate. The HP 0605 and HP 0971 double-knockout mutant was also more susceptible to metronidazole, in addition to being susceptible to <b>novobiocin</b> and <b>sodium</b> deoxycholate. Thus, active efflux is an eminent means of resistance to antimicrobials in H. pylori and resembles the situation in other bacteri...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out with the {{suckling}} mouse cataract agent (SMCA) {{in an attempt to}} better characterize the nature of this agent. Despite the fact that high titers of SMCA were found in the chorioallantoic fluid of inoculated chicken embryos, the agent did not replicate in chicken embryo epithelial cell cultures. SMCA did not interfere with Sindbis virus plaque formation and was not inhibited by chicken interferon or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. The agent was relatively resistant to high pH and osmotic shock but was inactivated by low pH. Electron micrographs of negatively stained particles concentrated and semipurified from infected chicken embryo chorioallantoic fluids revealed pleomorphic particles ranging from approximately 70 to 400 nm in diameter.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} drug novobiocin {{was evaluated}} for its anti-tumour properties in B 16 melanoma cells. Novobiocin {{is shown to}} inhibit melanoma B 16 cell proliferation.

40|$|The bioavailabilities of orally {{administered}} drugs depend to a {{great extent}} on their capability of being transported across the intestinal mucosa. In an attempt to develop an in vitro model for studying the intestinal transport of drugs, we used an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco 2) derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma. A renal epithelial cell line (MDCK) was also used to determine the tissue specificity of drug transport. These cell lines, which were grown on filters, form a monolayer of well-polarized cells coupled by tight junctions and can be used for transcellular transport experiments. We studied the transport of nine antimicrobial agents with different physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics using these epithelial cell monolayers to determine whether this model could be predictive of oral bioavailability. The transepithelial passage was assayed from the apical (AP) to the basolateral (BL) side and in the opposite direction (BL to AP) in both cell lines. Radioactively labeled mannitol was used to monitor the intactness of the cell monolayer during drug passage. The results indicated that all antimicrobial agents tested tended to behave in vitro generally according to their known in vivo absorptive characteristics. In addition, the use of epithelia from different tissues enabled us to divide the drugs into four groups according to their behaviors and suggested the existence of different transport mechanisms. In particular, two antibiotics, gentamicin and teicoplanin, showed no passage in either direction or cell line, in accordance with their very poor in vivo absorbances after oral administration. In contrast, rifapentine, rifampin, and nalidixic acid passed very efficiently at similar rates in both directions and cell lines in a concentration-dependent, nonsaturable manner, which is suggestive of passive diffusion down a concentration gradient. Of the remaining drugs, isoniazid and <b>novobiocin</b> <b>sodium</b> showed some differences in passage between the two cell lines and, given their ionized state at the pH that was used, may use the paracellular route. Finally, trimethoprim and D-cycloserine exhibited differences in passage both with respect to polarity and cell line; in particular, trimethoprim had a faster rate of passage only in Caco 2 cells and in the BL to AP direction, while D-cycloserine was exclusively transported by Caco 2 cells in the AP to BL direction. In both cases it is possible that active transport mechanisms are involved...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type {{strains of}} the {{bacterial}} phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora (the cause of fire blight disease of apples and pears) are markedly susceptible to <b>novobiocin,</b> deoxycholate, and <b>sodium</b> dodecyl (= lauryl) sulfate. The inhibitory concentration, expressed as the concentration causing a 99 % inhibition of growth, of these three antibacterial agents were 15 to 100, 40 to 800, and 50 to 800 μg/ml, respectively, depending on the E. amylovora strain. Growth of strains of other Erwinia spp. and Salmonella typhimurium is not affected at all, or is only slightly affected, at these concentrations. Introduction of the F′lac+, RP 1, and R 100 drd- 56 (but not E-lac+) plasmids into an E. amylovora strain results in enhanced susceptibility to <b>novobiocin</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecyl sulfate but not to deoxycholate. E. amylovora wild-type strains spontaneously release a periplasmic enzyme, cyclic phosphodiesterase, but not a cytoplasmic enzyme, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, into the growth medium. Addition of MgCl 2 (20 mM) and NaCl (84 mM) to tryptone broth stimulates the growth of wild-type E. amylovora strains and reduces or eliminates leakage of the periplasmic enzyme. Mutant strains of E. amylovora, selected for resistance to each separate antibacterial agent (or {{to all three of}} them), showed a direct correlation (in all but the novobiocin-resistant mutant) between drug resistance and reduced periplasmic leakiness. The relatively low maximum growth temperature (< 37 °C) of E. amylovora seems unrelated to periplasmic leakage, as judged from the inability of added MgCl 2 to raise the maximum growth temperature, although the generation time at 30 °C is reduced from 108 to 54 min upon the addition of 20 mM MgCl 2. The extensive leakage of periplasmic enzyme and unusual drug susceptibility of E. amylovora strains might stem from some defect(s) in some cell envelope component(s) other than the lipopolysaccharide of these bacteria (which contain the usual liposaccharide constituents) ...|$|R

40|$|Lactoperoxidase is {{an enzyme}} that {{contributes}} to the antimicrobial defense in secretory fluids and that has attracted interest as a potential biopreservative for foods and other perishable products. Its antimicrobial activity is based on the formation of hypothiocyanate (OSCN-) from thiocyanate (SCN-), using H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. To gain insight into the antibacterial mode of action of the lactoperoxidase enzyme system, we generated random transposon insertion mutations in Escherichia coli MG 1655 and screened the resultant mutants for an altered tolerance of bacteriostatic concentrations of this enzyme system. Out of the ca. 5, 000 mutants screened, 4 showed significantly increased tolerance, and 2 of these had an insertion, one in the waaQ gene and one in the waaO gene, whose products are involved in the synthesis of the core oligosaccharide moiety of lipopolysaccharides. Besides producing truncated lipopolysaccharides and displaying hypersensitivity to <b>novobiocin</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecyl sulfate (SDS), these mutants were also shown by urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis to have reduced amounts of porins in their outer membranes. Moreover, they showed a reduced degradation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and an increased resistance to ampicillin, two indications of a decrease in outer membrane permeability for small hydrophilic solutes. Additionally, ompC and ompF knockout mutants displayed levels of tolerance to the lactoperoxidase system similar to those displayed by the waa mutants. These results suggest that mutations which reduce the porin-mediated outer membrane permeability for small hydrophilic molecules lead to increased tolerance to the lactoperoxidase enzyme system because of a reduced uptake of OSCN-. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{the effects of}} growth inhibition on glutamine transport and metabolism in human hepatoma cells. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatoma cells exhibit markedly higher (10 - to 30 -fold) glutamine uptake than normal human hepatocytes, via a disparate transporter protein with a higher affinity for glutamine. Currently, {{little is known about}} the effects of growth arrest on glutamine transport and metabolism in hepatoma cells. METHODS: The authors determined proliferation rates, glutamine transport, and glutaminase activities in the human hepatoma cell lines HepG 2, Huh- 7, and SK-Hep, both in the presence and absence of the chemotherapeutic agents <b>novobiocin</b> and <b>sodium</b> butyrate. The transport activities for alanine, arginine, and leucine also were determined in both treated and untreated cells. Glutaminase activity was determined in normal human liver tissue and compared with that present in hepatoma cells. RESULTS: Glutaminase activities were similar in all three cell lines studied, despite differences in proliferation rates, and were sixfold higher than the activity in normal human liver. In contrast to normal hepatocytes, which expressed the liver-specific glutaminase, hepatomas expressed the kidney-type isoform. Sodium butyrate (1 mmol/L) and novobiocin (0. 1 mmol/L) inhibited cellular proliferation and reduced both glutamine transport and glutaminase activity by more than 50 % after 48 hours in the faster-growing, less differentiated SK-Hep cells. In contrast, the agents required 72 hours to attenuate glutamine uptake by 30 % and 50 % in the slower-growing, more differentiated HepG 2 and Huh- 7 cell lines, respectively. Treatment of all three cell lines with novobiocin/butyrate also resulted in a 30 % to 60 % attenuation of the transport of alanine, arginine, and leucine, and glutamine, indicating that inhibition of cellular proliferation similarly affects disparate amino acid transporters. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocellular transformation is characterized by a marked increase in glutamine transport and metabolism. Inhibition of cellular proliferation attenuates glutamine transport and metabolism, especially in fast-growing, relatively undifferentiated hepatoma cells. Because the uptake of other amino acids is similarly reduced under cytostatic conditions, plasma membrane amino acid transport activity in hepatoma cells is regulated by the proliferation state of the cells...|$|R
