Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau posted a time that was provisionally best much of the day and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Contador, who won the time trial, dedicated the victory to Tondó, as the two were acquainted despite <b>never</b> <b>having</b> been teammates.|$|E

Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to <b>never</b> <b>having</b> built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects a distance from the machine. As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than <b>never</b> <b>having</b> had them.|$|E

Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.|$|E
5|$|Schmid {{coached the}} Los Angeles Galaxy and the Columbus Crew in MLS, before {{becoming}} {{the head coach}} of Seattle Sounders FC in 2009.

Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite <b>never</b> <b>having</b> had a heart attack or stroke in the past.

However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on October11 {{in the central}} Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning {{to the north and}} northeast. On October15, Hurricane Jig passed about 300mi (480km) east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of 115mph (185km/h), although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, <b>never</b> <b>having</b> affected land due to its small size.|$|E

John Lennon was informed by his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed an ad in the paper, and hired detectives to look for her. They searched Norway for Victoria, and came up empty handed, and John died <b>never</b> <b>having</b> found or knowing her.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>never</b> <b>having</b> {{heard of}} female doctors, {{from an early}} age Mayo had been set on {{pursuing}} a career in medicine. However, Edward Rennie, then a professor at the University of Adelaide advised Helen's father that she was too young to commence study in Medicine, so in 1896, Mayo enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Adelaide. The death of her younger sister Olive {{at the end of her}} first year of study meant that Mayo was unable to sit her final exams for that year, and when she repeated her first year in 1897, she failed two of her five subjects (Latin and Greek). Having gained her father's permission, Mayo enrolled in medicine in 1898. She was a distinguished medicine student, coming top of her class and winning the Davis Thomas scholarship and the Everard Scholarship in her fourth and fifth years of study, respectively.|$|E
