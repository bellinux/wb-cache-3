While most varieties of cast iron are brittle, ductile iron has much more impact and fatigue resistance, due to its nodular graphite inclusions.|$|E

In this study, effect of chill formation {{on the surface of}} grey and <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> irons is investigated on the wear behavior, hardness, impact toughness and microstructure of grey and <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> irons. For this purpose, four types cam shaft made of grey cast iron with and without chill on the surfaces and <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron with and without chill on the surfaces, were casted. Mechanical tests were conducted after the camshafts have been produced by casting method. Surface hardness and wear resistance of grey and <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> irons have been improved by chill formation on the surfaces and it is concluded that the amount of wear on the surfaces of grey cast iron with chill and <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron with chill is almost the same. Maximum hardness value was obtained on the surface of grey cast iron with chill. The impact toughness has been found to decrease by chill formation.

In the present case a non-intrusive procedure is developed in which the 4 D sensitivity fields are obtained with a commercial finite element code, allowing for a large versatility in meshing and incorporation of complex constitutive laws.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the toughness of <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron, the flow stress have been studied numerically by using Gurson's model considering that <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron can be regarded as a porous material. The damaged zone ahead of the crack tip is studied by SEM observations on the pre-polished surface of a CT 25 specimen, before and after ductile tearing. It is shown that the damaged zone is very large in the GGG 40 <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron (through almost the whole ligament ahead of the crack), so the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics is not valid in <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron for small specimens. The force versus crack opening displacement curves calculated in 2 D for plane strain and plane stress conditions give respectively an upper and a lower limit as compared with the experimental curve. Only 3 D calculations lead to a good fît with the experimental curve. This result shows that the stress state ahead of the crack tip of a <b>nodular</b> <b>cast</b> iron is intermediate between plane stress and plane strain conditions, due to the high density of voids inside the damaged material...|$|E
