Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and mined minerals. Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.|$|E

2500|$|When {{properly}} managed, dairy {{and other}} livestock waste, {{due to its}} nutrient content (N, P, K), makes an excellent fertilizer promoting crop growth, increasing soil organic matter, and improving overall soil fertility and tilth characteristics. [...] Most dairy farms in the United States are required to develop <b>nutrient</b> <b>management</b> plans for their farms, to help balance the flow of nutrients and reduce the risks of environmental pollution. [...] These plans encourage producers to monitor all nutrients coming onto the farm as feed, forage, animals, fertilizer, etc. and all nutrients exiting the farm as product, crop, animals, manure, etc. For example, a precision approach to animal feeding results in less overfeeding of nutrients and a subsequent decrease in environmental excretion of nutrients, such as phosphorus. In recent years, nutritionists have realized that requirements for phosphorus are much lower than previously thought. [...] These changes have allowed dairy producers {{to reduce the amount}} of phosphorus being fed to their cows with a reduction in environmental pollution.|$|E

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of dietary supplementation with PUFA (sunflower seed oil, borage oil and fish oil concentrate) for three months on RBC membrane fatty acid composition in healthy and dysmenorrheica young women. Conversion of linoleic acid, via gamma-linolenic acid, to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (a precursor of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E- 1) in dysmenorrheic subjects as compared to the controls was slower whereas the level of arachidonic acid (a precursor of pro-inflammatory PGE(2)) was not affected by the supplementation.

40|$|Contribution of {{inorganic}} {{nutrients from}} chemical fertilizer (CF) to increment the food production is about 50 % in China. The investment of the inorganic nutrients has been half of total material input of Chinese farmers at present. However, sustainable agricultural production in China faces serious challenge {{because of low}} efficiency of nutrients use, especially N. The reason of the low N use efficiency is as followings. Firstly, {{there is a great}} gap between theory and technology of balanced fertilization and extension of the theory in farming. Secondly, CF especially compounds produced are divorced from both plant demand and soil fertility. Thirdly, quality of locally made compounds is poor. Finally, so called specialty compounds are not specialized. Therefore, inorganic nutrients from CF may lose into ground, surface water system or accumulated into soil to cause environmental problem as a side effect. In order to realize sustainable agricultural production and to increase nutrients utilization efficiency we have concentrated on developing technique to manufacture a series of specialty compounds (SSC) as loader or carrier of balanced fertilization theory and technology to establish an intelligent <b>nutrients</b> <b>management</b> system.

In this study, a <b>nutrient</b> solution <b>management</b> procedure was developed to maintain outputs while minimizing inputs. Lactuca sativa (lettuce) crops were grown in six closed hydroponic systems utilizing the nutrient film technique.

The climate change, though, a very slow phenomenon is now accelerated due to natural, as well as enormous human activities disturbing the composition of atmosphere. The predications of various climatic models for probable rise in temperature, rainfall, sea level show an alarming condition in forthcoming decades. As the sugarcane is very sensitive to temperature, rainfall, solar radiations etc. therefore, {{a significant effect on}} its production and sugar yield is expected in future. It is also well known that sugarcane is one of the precious crops of the world and its end products i. e. sugar and ethanol have a continuous growing demand on global level.

These emissions should therefore be controlled by an appropriate management of agricultural practices. Effective agricultural management builds on {{a thorough understanding of}} the fate and behavior of nutrients and pesticides in the soil–crop system. Unsaturated flow and transport models may therefore be used as tools to predict fate and behavior of chemicals in soil, supporting decision making in the area of <b>nutrient</b> and pesticide <b>management.</b> In this paper, we show how flow and transport models are introduced in the <b>nutrient</b> and pesticide <b>management</b> decision-making process. Examples are given of the use of flow and transport models in field-scale nutrient and pesticide management; the identification and evaluation of fertilization and pesticide application practices supporting the implementation of regional-scale environmental management plans; and the registration of plant-protection products.

40|$|Quantifying {{non-point source}} (NPS) {{phosphorus}} (P) pollution loads {{is essential for}} watershed <b>nutrients</b> <b>management.</b> This study intended to develop a NPS P indicator which (1) was suitable in semi-humid and semi-arid watersheds of Northern China; (2) integrated the key NPS P loss factors and constructed them in a simple and physically understandable way and (3) kept P loss forms distinctively separate. An inverse distance-based delivery ratio was proposed to count for the P delivery efficiency from source to watercourses. We applied this P indicator in Luan River Watershed (LRW) of northern China under typical hydrological years and seasons. Results demonstrated that this NPS P indicator predicted reasonable NPS TP loads using simple methods and readily obtainable inputs. The sub-watersheds located {{in the south of}} LRW were recognized as the high risk areas of NPS P loss to Panjiakou reservoir. The upland and paddy fields near the river channels were particularly posing high risk and thus should be treated with prioritized management practices such as soil conservation and recommended fertilization. Rainfall runoff related variables rather than P source variables explained more of the spatial variation in NPS P load and percentages. Using this tool could give policy makers insight into the component and location of NPS P pollution that needs to be the focus of policy at watershed scales before sophisticated studies were conducted in smaller scales.

40|$|Abstract. Water {{pollution}} {{is a key}} environmental problem affecting modern day China. Increased human population, agricultural and advanced industrial activities present a complex multiple problems impacting water resource across China. This situation is more pronounced in Tianjing Lake, Tiacang City. Engineered in April 2012, the lake exemplifies severe eutrophication problems. Constructed for recreational uses, the lake plays {{a vital role in}} the economic and sociopolitical development of Tiacang City. As a result, the Tianjing Lake water transfer project was carried out in order to improve water quality and alleviate eutrophication. The project considered major field observations that monitored the lake’s nutrients concentrations (TN, TP, NH 4, COD Mn) before and after water diversions. Results showed that the effects of water transfer on the overall water quality improvement in the lake seemed heterogeneous. The observed heterogeneity is {{as a result of the}} lake’s hydrodynamic conditions influenced by inflow tributaries. However, poor water movement resulting from the lack of outlet to actively expel pollutants may be a key factor compounding the lake’s internal <b>nutrients</b> <b>management.</b> This, however, dictates the engineering of additional flow directions in order to ensure better exchanges and additional nutrients removal through the expulsion via the outlet to improve water quality and sustain ecosystem health. Hence, this study provides useful information necessary to better understand the complex hydrodynamic and mass transport processes in the Tianjing Lake and present a road-map for future management decision-making...|$|R
