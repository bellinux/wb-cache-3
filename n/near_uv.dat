50|$|Fish {{and some}} members of their food chain have color receptors in their eyes {{optimized}} for the light of their “space”. Eyes that can see a single space color can detect changes in light intensity. This is equivalent to a world in black, white and shades of gray. In this simplest level of visual information processing, an animal can recognize that something is different in its space—i.e., that there is food or a predator “over there”. Most animals living in a lighted world have an additional visual resource: color vision. By definition, that requires that they have color receptors containing at least two different visual pigments. To efficiently perform this function in water illuminated with light, an aquatic animal would have visual pigments sensitive to the background “space” color and one or more visual pigments offset from this blue-green region, say, in the red or ultraviolet region of the spectrum. This imparts a clear survival advantage to these animals because they can detect not only changes in light intensity but also contrasts in color. Many fish, for example, have two color receptors, one in the blue region of the spectra (425-490 nm) {{and the other in}} the <b>near</b> <b>UV</b> (320-380 nm). Insects and shrimp, members of the fish food chain, have blue, green (530 nm) and <b>near</b> <b>UV</b> receptors.

50|$|The {{chemical}} {{effects of}} moisture {{can be seen}} in the chalking of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigmented coatings and polymers; the anatase form is particularly sensitive to wavelengths below about 405 nm while the rutile forms absorb energy above that wavelength. Chalking results from the degradation of the binding material resulting in a release of the TiO2 pigment particles. These particles form a dull layer on the surface which may be wiped off. Experience shows that chalking is strongest where more water is available on the surface; little to no chalking occurs in dry atmospheres. TiO2 is a semiconductor where electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band result from the absorption of light at wavelengths in the <b>near</b> <b>UV</b> range, below 400 nm. Ultraviolet radiation causes electron-hole pairs to be created in the TiO2 lattice. These react with the hydroxide groups on the surface and the Ti4+ ions. Hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals are formed through the conversion of oxygen and a water molecule whereby the TiO2 surface again resumes the initial form and acts as a catalyst for continued activity, thus repeating the chalking cycle. The hydroxide and perhydroxyl radical then cause oxidative decomposition of the binder with the subsequent release of TiO2 particles.|$|E
