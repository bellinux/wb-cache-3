This meant that the City could <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> or destroy the houses using federal funds without a public hearing.|$|E

5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E
5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E

5|$|John Sigismund {{had made}} his last {{testament}} and will {{in the presence of}} Chancellor Mihály Csáky and Treasurer Gáspár Bekes during his earlier illness in the summer of 1567. Despite his recovery, he did <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> the text in the following years. He willed most of his wealth to his uncle, Sigismund August of Poland, and his three aunts, Sophia, Anna and Catherine. He bequeathed his library to the Protestant school of Gyulafehérvár.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|While Adams was {{attending}} the ratifying convention, {{his only son}} Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams. The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> their frugal lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|Savitri {{benefited the}} Tamil version by {{improving}} the on-screen chemistry with Ganesan; they had secretly married in 1952, before filming began. After {{the release of}} Devadasu (1953), Akkineni Nageswara Rao wanted to trade his tragic-romantic-hero image for a comic role in Missamma. Nageswara Rao reportedly accepted the role for financial reasons, until he said that Missamma was the only film of his career that he lobbied to participate in. K. A. Thangavelu and K. Sarangkapani reprise Nageswara Rao and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah's roles in the Telugu version in the Tamil one. M. N. Nambiar and Ramana Reddy were cast as the antagonist in the Tamil and Telugu version, respectively. Balakrishna and A. Karunanidhi were cast as the assistant of Nageswara Rao and Thangavelu, respectively. Although Chakrapani did <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> the character in adapting it from Detective, the actors' body language was different.|$|E
5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does <b>not</b> <b>alter</b> the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E
