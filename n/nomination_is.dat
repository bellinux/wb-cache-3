5|$|He {{finished}} as {{the first}} runner-up in the Joliet City Council election of 1989, but when a sitting councilwoman died {{a few months after}} the election he was passed over several times for the nomination.

He returned to elective politics to defeat the mayor, who did not nominate him in the subsequent election in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Season 3 {{begins with}} Underwood's {{presidency}} {{off to a}} rocky start: six months into his term, he is unpopular with the public, and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward. He plans to secure his legacy with an ambitious jobs bill, America Works, but the Democratic Congressional leadership refuses to support it; they also tell him {{that they will not}} support him if he seeks the presidential nomination in the next election. He nominates Claire for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, but her <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> defeated after she makes a gaffe during a Senate nomination hearing.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. It can only be awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded posthumously. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-З. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-З allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is evaluated, and if deemed worthy, the <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then, after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council, to the President of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|The World Heritage <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of eleven component parts that are representative for processes at the High Middle Ages that shaped the whole continent: Christianization, settlement and cultivation processes, the so-called Landesausbau, {{that took place}} between 1000 and 1300. This borderland region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the High Middle Ages. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self-confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers {{as well as to}} the region’s crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.|$|E
25|$|The writer Gore Vidal, who {{admired and}} {{supported}} Stevenson, based a main character in his 1960 Broadway play The Best Man on Stevenson. The play, which {{was nominated for}} six Tony Awards, centers on the contest for the presidential nomination at a fictitious political convention. One of the main contenders for the <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> Secretary of State William Russell, a principled, liberal intellectual. The character is based on Stevenson; his main opponent is the ruthless, unscrupulous Senator Joseph Cantwell, whom Vidal modeled on Richard Nixon and the Kennedy brothers. The play {{was turned into a}} 1964 film of the same name, with actor Henry Fonda playing Russell. Fonda had been a Stevenson supporter at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Cortina’s {{contribution}} to the legitimist cause in the early 1900s, except that he entertained national Carlist leaders visiting Andalusia and himself travelled to Venice to see Carlos VII. He remained adamant in public and got expulsed from the Seville agricultural organization for his vehemently hostile stand towards Alfonso XIII. In 1907 he was rumored {{to run for the}} Cortes from Seville, but the news proved false. In 1909 he visited Melilla and the same year he travelled to Venice again, this time to attend the funeral of his king and to welcome the new claimant, Don Jaime, who promoted him to general de división. Also in 1909 Cortina appeared already as regional leader of the Andalusian Carlism; exact year of his <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> not clear.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} can make certain appointments {{only with the}} advice and consent of the Senate. Officials whose appointments require the Senate's approval include members of the Cabinet, heads of most federal executive agencies, ambassadors, Justices of the Supreme Court, and other federal judges. Under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, {{a large number of}} government appointments are subject to potential confirmation; however, Congress has passed legislation to authorize the appointment of many officials without the Senate's consent (usually, confirmation requirements are reserved for those officials with the most significant final decision-making authority). Typically, a nominee is first subject to a hearing before a Senate committee. Thereafter, the <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> considered by the full Senate. The majority of nominees are confirmed, but in a small number of cases each year, Senate committees purposely fail to act on a nomination to block it. In addition, the president sometimes withdraws nominations when they appear unlikely to be confirmed. Because of this, outright rejections of nominees on the Senate floor are infrequent (there have been only nine Cabinet nominees rejected outright in United States history).|$|E
500|$|Any {{individual}} can prepare a National Register nomination, although historians and historic preservation consultants often are employed for this work. The nomination {{consists of a}} standard nomination form and contains basic information about a property's physical appearance {{and the type of}} significance embodied in the building, structure, object, site, or district. The State Historic Preservation Office receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group. After preliminary review, the SHPO sends each nomination to the state's historic review commission, which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register. For any non-Federally owned property, only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register. After the <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO, the <b>nomination</b> <b>is</b> sent to the National Park Service, which approves or denies the nomination. If approved, the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places. Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state's historic review commission. If an owner objects to a nomination of private property, {{or in the case of}} a historic district, a majority of owners, then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
