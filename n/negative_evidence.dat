Tilden Jr., sought to combine {{the popularity of the}} Kinetoscope with that of prizefighting. This led to a series of significant developments in the motion picture field: The Kinetograph was then capable of shooting only a 50-foot-long <b>negative</b> (<b>evidence</b> suggests [...] feet was the longest length actually used). At 16 frames per foot, this meant a maximum running time of 20 seconds at 40 frames per second (fps), the speed most frequently employed with the camera. At the rate of 30 fps that had been used as far back as 1891, a film could run for almost 27 seconds. Hendricks identifies Sandow as having been shot at 16 fps, as does the Library of Congress in its online catalog, where its duration is listed as 40 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|In 1903 Clement F Rogers {{published}} [...] "Baptism and Christian Archaeology". [...] This was a {{study of}} the archaeological evidence, both the positive evidence that paintings and carvings on sarcophagi etc. provide about how baptism actually was conferred, and the <b>negative</b> <b>evidence</b> given by the structure of baptismal fonts on how it could not have been conferred. He used literary sources plentifully but merely for illustration. For the first three centuries (i.e. before the time of Constantine) direct archaeological evidence is limited to pictures of baptism in the catacombs of Rome. Rogers concluded that [...] "the direct evidence from archaeology alone may not be conclusive to show that in pre-Constantinian times baptism by affusion only was practiced generally or indeed in any one single case; but it does show that there was nothing repugnant in it to the general mind, that no stress was laid on total immersion, that the most important moments were held to be those when water was poured over the catchumen, and when the minister laid his hand on his head. This, taken in connexion with the known customs of later ages, make it more than probable that the usual method of administration was by affusion only." [...] Taking into account the positive archaeological evidence of post-Constantinian times, Roger concludes: [...] "All the evidence of archaeology goes to prove that the essential part of baptism was considered in the early Church to be the pouring of water over the candidate's head by the bishop, or the guiding his head under a descending stream, followed by the laying on of hands"; he adds: [...] "There remains the question, whether this was preceded by a self-immersion". To answer this question, he examines the <b>negative</b> <b>evidence</b> of ancient baptismal fonts, especially those found in archaeological sites, providing on pp.347–49 a Synoptic Table of Fonts, with date, shape, diameter and depth, showing that some of them could not have been intended for full immersion.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, {{this debate}} has largely {{surrounded}} Chomsky's {{support of a}} universal grammar, properties that all natural languages must have, through the controversial postulation of a language acquisition device (LAD), an instinctive mental 'organ' responsible for language learning which searches all possible language alternatives and chooses the parameters that best match the learner's environmental linguistic input. Much of Chomsky's theory is founded on the poverty of the stimulus (POTS) argument, the assertion that a child's linguistic data is so limited and corrupted that learning language from this data alone is impossible. As an example, many proponents of POTS claim that because children are never exposed to <b>negative</b> <b>evidence,</b> that is, information about what phrases are ungrammatical, the language structure they learn would not resemble that of correct speech without a language-specific learning mechanism. [...] Chomsky's argument for an internal system responsible for language, biolinguistics, poses a three factor model. [...] "Genetic endowment" [...] allows the infant to extract linguistic info, detect rules, and have universal grammar. [...] "External environment" [...] illuminates the need to interact with others {{and the benefits of}} language exposure at an early age. [...] The last factor encompasses the brain properties, learning principles, and computational efficiencies that enable children to pick up on language rapidly using patterns and strategies.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{debate has}} enabled debaters to {{seamlessly}} file, read, and utilize mass quantities of evidence {{at a level}} unthinkable under debate’s traditional paper medium. This shift has altered how evidence is both produced and tested. A dominant trend in debate has been to view evidence’s chief function as making claims. As a result, most debate research in a digital age {{is characterized by the}} “production” of specific claims; finding and constructing precise wordings to fit strategic expectations takes priority over providing and comparing the reasoning aspect of argumentation. This approach, which I dub “debate as information production, ” leads students further away from developing the skills of critically evaluating and judging competing truth claims in evidence. In this paper, I attempt to rectify this imbalance by arguing for prioritizing the perspective of “debate as argument-judgment ” over one of “debate as information production, ” while articulating a set of best practices that educators can call upon to improve debates about evidence when moving forward. The 2012 National Debate Tournament (NDT) final round between Northwestern University and Georgetown University was the first championship final to feature two teams who were “paperless, ” or delivered all of their evidence off of computers. A majority of the published ballots also negatively commented on the sufficiency of the evidence presented by either side. The brevity of the <b>negative’s</b> <b>evidence</b> was a central feature of the two dissenting critics. Heidt (2012) noted that “this under-highlighting problem is true for {{a good deal of the}} <b>negative’s</b> <b>evidence</b> ” and that greater analysis may have swung his vote (para. 5). Mosley-Jensen (2012) laments “the increasing need to highlight evidence until nearly all of the warrants are stripped out ” and argues that Contemporary Argumentation & Debate, 2012 135 now is the key time to discuss how contemporary policy debate presents evidence (para. 25).
