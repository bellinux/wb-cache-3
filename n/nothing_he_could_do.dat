5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the {{dramatic}} 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix the Toyotas {{were the only}} cars to stay out on dry tyres in the torrential rainstorm in the closing stages of the race, and that had a significant factor on deciding the destiny of the world title. Trulli had qualified 2nd, but both he and Glock faded to 6th and 8th respectively at the finish, Glock relinquishing the vital fifth place to Lewis Hamilton on the final lap, which was enough for the McLaren driver to seal the world title by a point from local hero and race winner Felipe Massa. Afterwards, Glock denied conspiracy claims that he gave the place to Hamilton, citing that he was struggling for grip on the wet track surface {{and that there was}} absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|By mid-May, {{the army}} had reached the {{vicinity}} of the heavily fortified Persian capital, Ctesiphon, where Julian partially unloaded some of the fleet and had his troops ferried across the Tigris by night. The Romans gained a tactical victory over the Persians before the gates of the city, driving them back into the city. However, the Persian capital was not taken, the main Persian army was still at large and approaching, while the Romans lacked a clear strategic objective. In the council of war which followed, Julian's generals persuaded him not to mount a siege against the city, given the impregnability of its defenses and the fact that Shapur would soon arrive with a large force. Julian not wanting to give up what he had gained and probably still hoping for the arrival of the column under Procopius and Sebastianus, set off east into the Persian interior, ordering the destruction of the fleet. This proved to be a hasty decision, for they were {{on the wrong side of}} the Tigris with no clear means of retreat and the Persians had begun to harass them from a distance, burning any food in the Romans' path. Julian had not brought adequate siege equipment, so there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> when he found that the Persians had flooded the area behind him, forcing him to withdraw. A second council of war on 16 June 363 decided that the best course of action was to lead the army back to the safety of Roman borders, not through Mesopotamia, but northward to Corduene.|$|E

50|$|Hasdrubal, {{seeing that}} there was <b>nothing</b> more <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> and presumably {{doubtful}} of his own prospects of escape or simply unwilling to be taken captive, charged into {{the thick of the}} nearly concluded battle and met a glorious, if pointless, death.|$|R
500|$|He was on {{the bench}} {{for the first nine}} games of the 1990–91 campaign, but in his first start scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Sheffield United. However Venables dropped him to the bench for the {{following}} game, and Walsh became [...] "cynical and pissed off" [...] as he felt <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> could displace either Stewart and Lineker, though he ended the season with 20 starts and 19 substitute appearances. He did though make an appearance at Wembley in the 1991 FA Cup Final, coming on for Vinny Samways 82 minutes into a 2–1 victory over Nottingham Forest.|$|E
500|$|Digby unsuccessfully {{sought an}} {{audience}} with James to try and explain himself, in Fraser's opinion suggesting either that {{the extent of his}} involvement was limited, or that he was [...] "astonishingly naive and trusting of his sovereign's forgiveness." [...] While imprisoned he busied himself with writing secret letters, smuggled from the Tower and not rediscovered until Kenelm Digby's death in 1675. [...] Although he was fortunate not to suffer the fate of Guy Fawkes, who was tortured on several occasions, one of these letters hints that it had been [...] "in a fashion, offered". [...] He described his refusal to cooperate with his interrogators, boasted of his deceit, and how there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to make the plot appear less abhorrent to fellow Catholics. [...] Digby also carved an inscription on the wall of his cell, extant as of 1996.|$|E
500|$|When {{he heard}} of Eisenhower's posture, Nixon's {{happiness}} {{at what he}} had finally been convinced was a [...] turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy the general, <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left {{the room with her}} notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting. [...] "Dick {{is not going to be}} placed in the position of a little boy going somewhere to beg for forgiveness." ...|$|E

50|$|If {{defendant}} {{claims that}} there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> to make the steps safer {{at the time of}} plaintiff's slip and fall, and plaintiff disputes this allegation, plaintiff may introduce evidence of the subsequent remedial measure to prove that undertaking precautionary measures was, in fact, feasible.|$|R

500|$|Katzenberg {{moved the}} opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, [...] "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI [...] "rich {{financial}} incentives to induce them to whatever {{it would take to}} have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start". Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug’s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt. Jobs believed it [...] "a blatant extortion attempt" [...] and would not go for it, explaining that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [...] "I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you’re allowing them to use you to screw me," [...] Katzenberg said. He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug’s Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{was later}} given command of a squadron, {{and carried out}} cruises in the Mediterranean, intercepting French and Spanish ships. [...] He {{returned}} to Gibraltar, but was ordered to sea again in June 1798 to reinforce Nelson's squadron in their hunt for the French fleet that had earlier escaped from Toulon. He was with Nelson when they located the French fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Brueys, moored in Aboukir Bay. In the ensuing engagement Thompson came to the assistance of , which had run aground on shoals in the entrance to the bay. [...] Finding that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> Thompson took Leander into the battle, despite his ship being considerably smaller than the French ships of the line. He anchored between the Franklin and Brueys' flagship the Orient, firing on them in company with [...] and [...] until the Franklin surrendered. [...] Thompson then took the Leander to assist the British attack on the French rear.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{situation}} involving sibling rivalries, David {{is confronted}} by James, who he blames for {{being taken away}} from their mother and being consigned to a worse life with King George. After James knocks David out by using his stun gun, he tricks his niece Emma and Robin Hood to lead him to Zelena's baby. James reveals himself when they reach the rendezvous point, after slapping an anti-magic cuff on Emma, and is joined by Cruella, who is {{still looking for a}} way to escape the Underworld, by stealing Zelena's baby for leverage with Hades. When Cruella and James enter the harbor, as part of their plan to send Emma and Robin to their deaths, David and Hook arrive to rescue Emma and Robin, before it's too late. Hook grabs the gun dropped by James and removed the cuffs from Emma, and Cruella runs back to safety. Meanwhile, David attempts to help James move on while confronting him, as James continues to believe that killing David is the [...] "unfinished business" [...] that is keeping him in the Underworld. After David's plea to help James falls on deaf ears, the twins continue fighting each other on the edge of the dock, with David wanting the others to stay out of the struggle. As James begins to lose, he pulls out a boot knife, despite David's pleas to stop. David eventually twists James off into the River of Lost Souls, condemning him to eternal torment, while Cruella flees the scene. Emma tells her father that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to save James, despite his best efforts, and that some people just won't ever move on.|$|E

50|$|Turytt is seen {{during the}} Sinestro Corps War, {{and during the}} debate over Laira's killing of Amon Sur. He also held a vigil for all the fallen Corpsmen the night after Sinestro was defeated. Turytt blames Jordan for Ke'Haan's death {{at the hands of}} the Anti-Monitor, despite the fact that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> about it.|$|R

60|$|He {{found that}} Sarmiento was out, {{and none of}} the hotel {{servants}} knew where he had gone. Grahame felt disturbed by this; but there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|Cole gasped for breath. He was caught. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> More {{soldiers}} were pouring {{down into the}} gulley, surrounding him on all sides. They studied him curiously, murmuring together. Cole shook his head wearily and said nothing.|$|E
60|$|After the mid-day dinner Phil Matlack, {{in a pair}} of high hunting-boots and an oil-skin coat, came to Mr. Archibald {{and said}} that as there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that afternoon, he would walk over to Sadler's and attend to some {{business}} he had there.|$|E
60|$|Never in all {{his life}} had Jack Kennard felt so abjectly wretched as he did then, so miserably helpless. There was <b>nothing</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> save {{to return to the}} lodging, which a kind friend had lent him for the occasion, and from whence <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> at any rate, see the windows behind which his beloved was {{watching}} and suffering.|$|R
60|$|An ominous silence followed. Ughtred was {{conscious}} of it, yet {{there seemed to be}} <b>nothing</b> which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to dispel it. He knew that the loyalty of these men was being sorely taxed. In their hearts they believed him responsible for the war. This severance with Reist encouraged them in their belief. Baron Doxis rose slowly to his feet.|$|R
60|$|And {{yet there}} was {{absolutely}} <b>nothing</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> had not his gun with him; he had not even a stick in his hand, and a stick would have been of little use against such a strong man as that, who could have taken Harry in his big red hands and have thrown him over the highest fence in the county.|$|R

6000|$|Still, he {{had been}} happy. He began to realize it, now that these awful girls had come to disturb his peace.

60|$|Brooke {{stood still}} and listened {{a moment or}} two while the hoarse roar of a river which he knew was {{swirling}} in fierce flood among the boulders far down in the hollow came up in deep reverberations across the pines. It was a significant hint of what was likely to happen when the pent-up water poured down upon the mine. Still, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in that thick darkness.|$|E
60|$|But Rollo {{was very}} far from being {{convinced}} {{that he ought to}} give back the dipper then. He had borrowed it, he said, for the whole expedition, and he had a right to keep it till he got home. Besides, he had a fish in it, and there was <b>nothing</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with him, if Henry took away the dipper.|$|R
3000|$|... “The event {{happened}} {{because of the}} way I acted, you hear that a lot, unrealistic guilt. We had a client who had been beaten unconscious by a group of soldiers who attacked his family and then his mother was killed, so he was actually unconscious at the time she was killed, so there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> and <b>he</b> was wracked by guilt” (PC).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well he {{just took}} a look at me, gents, winked with one eye, as much as to say, 'I see you,' and went down again. There warn't <b>nothing</b> else as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> was there?" ...|$|R
60|$|His first {{sensation}} {{was simple}} irritation. How had {{they come to}} commit such an imbecility? Monstrous! The evidence--! Then the futility of even reading the report, of even considering how {{they had come to}} record such a verdict struck him with savage suddenness. There it was, and <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> or say would alter it; no condemnation of this idiotic verdict would help reverse it. The situation was desperate, indeed! That five minutes' walk from the Law Courts to his chambers was the longest he had ever taken.|$|E
60|$|She was unchanged, then! This time he {{recognized}} the note of finality in her tone. All the time and thought he had given to this matter were wasted. He had failed, and he knew why. He seldom permitted himself the luxury of anger, but he felt all the poison of bitter hatred stirring within him at that moment, and craving {{for some sort of}} expression. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> nothing he could say. But if Mannering had been within reach then he would have struck him. He rose and walked slowly away.|$|E
6000|$|Vacation was over, {{the boys}} {{went back to}} school, and poor Mac was left lamenting.

Anyone who has ever been condemned to that sort of idleness knows how irksome it is, and can understand the state of mind which caused Mac to say to Rose in a desperate tone one day, ...|$|E
60|$|He {{knew there}} was now <b>nothing</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> The current had evidently sucked the {{fugitive}} under, and, dismounting, he groped {{his way up the}} slope, leading the horse by the bridle, and only swung himself into the saddle when he found the trail again.

5000|$|Flor, the niece of the {{neighboring}} rancher, rides up to say that her uncle was in grave condition and she needed the priest to come. She says the doctor said [...] "there was <b>nothing</b> more <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for him". Dona Rosa says she would come along, but Flow knew [...] "how he is". Flor nods her agreement.

6000|$|... "Is it possible!" [...] cried Dunham; {{he was now}} fairly at sea for {{the first}} time himself, though by virtue of his European {{associations}} he seemed to have made many voyages. It appeared to him that if there was <b>nothing</b> else <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for Lydia, it was his duty to talk to her. He found another stool, and drew it up within easier conversational distance. [...] "Then you've never been out of sight of land before?" ...|$|R
