50|$|The energy tariff {{during the}} first phase has been divided into five categories; The {{purchase}} price per kilowatt-hour (KWh) for residential solar generation is EGP 0.848. For non-residential installations of less than 200 kilowatts of installed generation capacity, the price rises to 0.901 EGP/KWh. The third category, between 200 and 500 kilowatts, will be paid 0.973 EGP/KWh. The fourth and fifth categories of non-residential installations are paid in USD, to attract foreign investments, with the fourth category, ranging from 500 kilowatts to 20 megawatts, paid 0.136 USD/KWh (with 15% of tariff pegged at the exchange rate of 7.15 EGP per USD).

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{long-term}} operation of price-taker peak hydropower plants associated to reservoirs {{and subject to}} minimum flows and maximum ramping rates that sell energy in day-ahead electricity markets. The thesis is organised in five chapters and two appendixes. The first chapter is an introduction of the above-mentioned issue. It aims to provide both an overview {{as well as a}} mathematical description of the addressed problem and define the scope and objectives of the thesis. The second chapter shows {{a review of the literature}} related to the main topics tackled in the thesis, such as the principal approaches of reservoir decision support tools, the optimisation techniques most used in hydro scheduling, the main procedures for the characterisation of the involved random inputs and the methods most employed to estimate the generation characteristic of a peak hydropower plant. Furthermore, the chapter also presents a brief description of the hydro scheduling models that have considered minimum flows and maximum ramping rates jointly. The third and the fourth chapters are devoted to the achievement of the thesis objectives and are divided in several studies. Among the main contributions cointaned in these studies can be found different long-term optimisation models for hydropeaking subject to minimum flows and maximum ramping rates, several sensitivity analyses of the long-term effects of these constraints on certain economical and operational aspects of a peak hydropower plant, a set of formulae for the approximate assessment of the long-term economic impact caused by these constraints on this type of plants, and the introduction of a new concept in hydro scheduling: flow value. The fith chapter sets out the conclusions of the thesis which can be summarised as follows. On the one hand, the presence of minimum flows in hydropeaking increases the spillage volume and the water value, whereas decreases the generated energy, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> start-ups and shut-downs of the hydro units, the plant capability for price tracking and the revenue. On the other hand, the presence of maximum ramping rates, in turn, increases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>operating</b> <b>hours,</b> the spillage volume, and, in the driest weeks, the flow value, whereas decreases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> start-ups and shut-downs of the hydro units, the plant capability for price tracking, the revenue, the water value, and, in the wettest weeks, the flow value.

40|$|Purpose – In {{transportation}} and distribution systems, the shipment decisions, fleet capacity, and storage capacity are interrelated {{in a complex}} way, especially when the authors take into account uncertainty of the demand rate and shipment lead time. While shipment planning is tactical or operational in nature, increasing storage capacity often requires top management’s authority. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a new method to integrate both operational and strategic decision parameters, namely shipment planning and storage capacity decision under uncertainty. The ultimate goal is to provide a near optimal solution that leads to a striking balance between the total logistics costs and product availability, critical in maritime logistics of bulk shipment of commodity items. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use simulation as research method. The authors develop a simulation model to investigate the effects of various factors on costs and service levels of a distribution system. The model mimics the {{transportation and}} distribution problems of bulk cement in a major cement company in Indonesia consisting of a silo at the port of origin, two silos at two ports of destination, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ships that transport the bulk cement. The authors develop a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> “what-if” scenarios by varying the storage capacity at the port of origin as well as at the ports <b>of</b> destinations, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ships <b>operated,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> ports, and dispatching rules for the ships. Each scenario is evaluated in terms of costs and service level. A full factorial experiment has been conducted and analysis of variance has been used to analyze the results. Findings – The results suggest that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ships deployed, silo capacity, working hours of ports, and the dispatching rules of ships significantly affect both total costs and service level. Interestingly, operating fewer ships enables the company to achieve almost the same service level and gaining substantial cost savings if constraints in other part of the system are alleviated, i. e., storage capacities and working hours of ports are extended. Practical implications – Cost is a competitive factor for bulk items like cement, and thus the proposed scenarios could be implemented by the company to substantially reduce the transportation and distribution costs. Alleviating storage capacity constraint is obviously an idea that needs to be considered when optimizing shipment planning alone could not give significant improvements. Originality/value – Existing research has so far focussed on the optimization of shipment planning/scheduling, and considers shipment planning/scheduling as the objective function while treating the storage capacity as constraints. The simulation model enables “what-if” analyses to be performed and has overcome the difficulties and impracticalities of analytical methods especially when the system incorporates stochastic variables exhibited in the case example. The use of efficient frontier analysis for analyzing the simulation results is a novel idea which has been proven to be effective in screening non-dominated solutions. This has provided the authors with near optimal solutions to trade-off logistics costs and service levels (availability), with minimal experimentation times...|$|R

However, as CHP plants are not optimized for electricity production, their operation is profitable only if a sufficient heat demand is available throughout the year.

While cooling is often provided by electric compression cooling systems, thermal cooling systems powered by low-temperature waste heat could improve energy efficiency and promise a technical saving potential corresponding to 0. 5 % of the total electricity demand in the German industry. In this paper, we investigate the current and future cost-effectiveness of thermal cooling systems for industrial companies. Our focus is on single-stage, closed absorption and adsorption cooling systems with cooling powers between 40 and 100 kW, which use low-temperature waste heat at temperature levels between 70 °C and 85 °C. We analyse the current and future cost-effectiveness of these alternative cooling systems using annual cooling costs (annuities) and payback times. For a forecast until 2015, we apply the concept of experience curves, identifying learning ra tes of 14 % (absorption machines) and 17 % (adsorption machines) by an expert survey of the German market. The results indicate that thermal cooling systems are currently only cost-effective under optimistic assumptions (full-time operation, high electricity prices) when compared to electric compression cooling systems. Nevertheless, the cost and efficiency improvements expected for this still young technology mean that thermal cooling systems could be more cost-effective in the future.

The most significant safety element in the waste hoist is the hydraulic brake system, whose possible failure was identified in these studies as the most important contributor in accident scenarios. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Waste Isolation Division has calculated {{the probability of}} an accident involving the brake system based on studies utilizing extensive fault tree analyses. This analysis conducted for the U. S.

An additional controlling factor in the DOE calculations is the mode of operation of the brake system. This factor enters for the following reason. The basic failure rate per annum of any individual element is called the Event Probability (EP), and is expressed as the probability of failure per annum. The EP in turn is the product of two factors.

40|$|Gas turbine {{operators}} are often {{met with the}} challenge of utilizing and making meaning of the vast measurement data collected from machine sensors during operation. This can easily be about 576 million data points of gas path measurements for one machine in a base load operation in a year, if the width of the data is 20 columns of measured and calculated parameters. This study focuses on the utilisation of large data in the context of quantifying the degradation that is mostly related to compressor fouling, in addition to investigations on the impact of off-line and on-line compressor washing. To achieve this, 4 gas turbine engines operating for about 3. 5 years with 51 off-line washes and 1, 184 occasions of on-line washes have been examined. This investigation includes different wash frequency, liquid concentration and one engine operation without on-line washing (only off-line). This study has involved correcting measurement data, not just with compressor inlet temperatures and pressures, but also relative humidity. TURBOMATCH: an in-house gas turbine performance simulation software has been implemented to obtain non-dimensional factors for the corrections. All of the data visualization and analysis have been conducted using Tableau analytics software, which facilitates the investigation of global and local events within an operation. The concept of using of handles and filters is proposed in this study, and it demonstrates the level of insight to the data and forms the basis of the outcomes obtained. This work shows that during operation, the engine performance is mostly deteriorating, though to varying degrees. On-line washing also showed an influence on this, reducing the average degradation rate each hour by half, when compared to the engine operating only with off-line washing. Hourly marginal improvements were also observed with an increased average wash frequency of 9 hours and a similar outcome obtained when the washing solution is 2. 3 times more concentrated. Clear benefits of off-line washes is also presented, alongside the typical obtainable values of increased power output after a wash, also in relation to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> before a wash...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{the solar}} energy for {{electricity}} or useful heat generation has been extensively investigated {{as an alternative to}} fossil fired energy conversion. Particularly in the last decade, many studies have been carried out on Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) which was developed worldwide with Spain acting as the leading country in this field. Concentrating solar energy requires complex mirror systems which continuously move to track the sun. In comparison with flat mirrors, Parabolic Through Collectors (PTCs) have allowed to reduce costs, but they still remain quite an expensive solution. Instead, compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) are able to collect a higher fraction of both the direct and the diffuse radiation, although they have a lower efficiency at high temperature. Moreover, at least within certain limits, they do not require a tracking system. Their employment is therefore suited for the collection of medium temperature heat (up to 200 °C) and is useful for the reduction of the installation cost of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) heating/cooling and energy generation systems. Small size plants (10 - 50 kW) were studied in this paper since {{they are more likely to}} be realized due to their smaller initial investment cost and to the capability of being installed on the roof of existing buildings. While the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) solution is well established to be the optimal for small size, distributed generation plants, the technology of the expansion device is still to be defined for the investigated installed power range. Accordingly to previous studies, an expansion device based on the Wankel mechanism was employed. Based on these considerations and prior to more detailed analyses, a study of the annual energy production of a small scale ORC power plant using CPCs as a heat source and a volumetric machine as an expansion device was carried out. The influence of the thermodynamic cycle parameters, the working fluid, the concentration and the tilt angle of the collectors on the electrical energy production were taken into account. The thermal module power output, the expansion device isentropic efficiency and the overall efficiency were evaluated by means of a numerical model developed within the simulation tool AMESim v. 12. 0. The aim of this work is to provide a contribution in the assessment of the optimal configuration of such kind of plants in terms of collectors concentration and tilt angle on one hand, and thermodynamic parameter of the thermal module on the other. The annual electricity production was used as a criterion of comparison among the various parameters combinations. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> per year was also taken into account for the sake of ensuring a regular production of energy. A selection of commercial solar tubes for the realization of the solar field was carried out and the optimal configuration for both the solar field and the thermal module was found. The results of this study are encouraging and constitute the basis for the development of future analyses...|$|E

The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal issued an interim order that the plant remain shut down on weekdays between 8am to 5pm, due to neighbouring offices being affected by the level of noise and vibration. However, the order was lifted in July 2007.|$|R
