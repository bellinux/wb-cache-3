5000|$|After take-off, there {{follows a}} long {{interval}} of sustained growth {{known as the}} stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it [...] "as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources." [...] Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The make-up of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds {{its place in the}} international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors will in an economy be determined by the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> endowments and not only by technology.|$|E
5000|$|According to Ernest Mandel, {{the law of}} value, as a law of exchange, did {{influence}} non-capitalist {{societies to}} some extent, inasmuch as exchange and trade persisted, but because the state directed the bulk of economic resources, the law of value no longer ruled or dominated resource allocation. The best proof of that {{was that there was}} mostly no clear relationship at all anymore between the exchange-value of goods traded, how they were allocated, and what it really cost to produce them; accounting information, insofar as it was valid, might in fact be unable to show anything about the real <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> allocation. The prices in the Soviet economy were, for the most part, not market prices but administered prices set by the planning boards (there was also a black market, mainly for consumer goods). [...] Insofar as the social priorities of state policy ensured that people got what they needed, that was a good thing; but insofar as resources were wasted {{because of a lack of}} sensible cost-economies, it was a bad thing. Cost-accounting is, of course, no more [...] "neutral" [...] than profit-accounting; a lot depends on what costs are included and excluded in the calculation.|$|E

It was projected that approximately $4 million was saved annually by this bold decision to run a small government. The hundreds of Special Assistants, Presidential Staffers and Spokespersons were also eliminated to improve fiscal efficiency. He commissioned a review of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana in a bid to improve upon the country's governance architecture. He held an annual media forum every year at the presidency to interact with journalists about socio-political issues. President Atta Mills re-equipped and re-tooled the security agencies: the military, the police, the fire service, the Immigration, The Prisons Service and the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS). In order to ensure inter-generational equity because of the [...] "finite <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> revenue" [...] as well as financial security for future Ghanaian generations, the Mills government established in 2011, the Ghana Heritage Fund - a sovereign wealth fund generated from petroleum revenue accumulated from the country's oil and gas industry. John Atta Mills established the Media Development Fund to promote media excellence and freedom in the spirit of 1992 constitution. A few months prior to his death, he was praised by US President Barack Obama for making Ghana a [...] "good news story" [...] that had good democratic credentials. He also fostered economic ties with China in a bid strengthen Sino-Ghanaian bilateral relations. In 2009, the Journal of International Affairs at Columbia University featured Mills as one of the [...] "Five Faces of African Innovation and Entrepreneurship" [...] along with South African innovator, Euvin Naidoo and Mo Ibrahim, (founder of Celtel International and Chairman of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation) where he was lauded for his commitment to strengthening Ghana's Electoral Commission, National Media Commission andNational Commission for Civic Education and more importantly, transparency in public institutions, particularly in the country's growing oil and gas sector. Mills' leadership style was very diplomatic, inclusive and less polarising than his predecessors. The BBC described his presidency as that of [...] "a peacemaker who was never one to make disparaging comments in public" [...] despite intense criticisms and vilification from his political supporters and opponents alike.|$|E

However, for the joint working relationships to be effective, the partner agencies need to equally share power/autonomy {{as well as other}} resources and the government needs to supply conducive environments to enable the same. This study addresses the practise of inter-organisational working relationships with focus on <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> sharing and government support to interagency working relationships. Agencies (n= 3) involved in the control and prevention of HIV/AIDS in New Zealand were interviewed to analyse the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> sharing among the partner agencies, and the extent of government influence on these. Results show that the government supplies conducive environments for interagency working relationships. Three key factors determine resource contributions by the agencies involved in the control and prevention of HIV/AIDS i. e. the depth of the relationship,. the similarity of agency's core missions to HIV/AIDS, and the resource interdependencies of the agencies. The research findings imply that agencies will work together effectively only if the joint ventures have no s:ignificant consequences on partner agency's resources - in particular, autonomy, budget, domain problems, and professional carriers...|$|E
