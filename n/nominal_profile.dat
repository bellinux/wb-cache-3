Traditional {{defending}} approaches cannot be easily applied in cloud security due to their relatively low efficiency, large storage, to name a few. In view of this challenge, a Confidence-Based Filtering method, named CBF, is investigated for cloud computing environment, in this paper. Concretely speaking, the method is deployed by two periods, i. e., non-attack period and attack period. More specially, legitimate packets are collected at non-attack period, for extracting attribute pairs to generate a <b>nominal</b> <b>profile.</b> With the <b>nominal</b> <b>profile,</b> the CBF method is promoted by calculating the score of a particular packet at attack period, to determine whether to discard it or not.

We find that the reflected field can be approximated by the mean field reflected by a distribution of periodic gratings and that the field does not represent the field from the average profile.

Direct operating cost, (as derived from the ATA formulation) is minimized using aircraft lift coefficient and power as control variables each with upper and lower limits. Only the portion of the flight from the end of transition to the beginning of retransition was considered, with both initial and final values of velocity, flight path angle, and altitude specified. The results show that full power is used to accelerate and to climb at a speed about twice the value for maximum rate of climb. At 12000 feet, power is reduced to flight idle and a high speed, power off glide is made to destination.

The stock rail profiles are optimized {{to decrease the}} rolling radii difference (RRD).

The improved sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is used to generate a sequence of improving profiles leading to the optimum one.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the major}} threats to cyber {{security}} is the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. In our previous projects, PacketScore, ALPi, and other statistical filtering-based approaches defend DDoS attacks via fine-grain comparisons between the measured current traffic profile and the victim’s <b>nominal</b> <b>profile.</b> These schemes can tackle virtually all kinds of DDoS attacks, even never-before-seen attack types, due to the underlying statistics-based adaptive differentiation. The viability of those aforementioned statistical filtering defense systems {{is based on the}} premise that attackers do not know the victim’s nominal traffic profile and, thus, cannot fake legitimate traffic. However, a sophisticated DDoS attacker might circumvent the defense system by discovering the statistical filtering rules and then controlling zombies to generate flooding traffic according to these discovered rules. This type of sophisticated attack seriously threatens the current Internet and has not yet been solved. In this paper, we propose a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) -based DDoS defense system, which extracts nominal traffic characteristics by analyzing intrinsic dependency across multiple attribute values. The PCA-based scheme differentiates attacking packets from legitimate ones by checking if the current traffic volume of the associated attribute value violates the intrinsic dependency of nominal traffic. The correlation among different attributes makes it more difficult for the attacker to accurately discover the statistic filtering rules and, thus, makes it highly robust to cope with new and more sophisticated attacks...|$|E
40|$|Background Closed-loop {{control of}} type 1 {{diabetes}} is receiving increasing attention due to advancement in glucose sensor and insulin pump technology. Here the function and structure of a class of control algorithms designed to exert control to range, defined as insulin treatment optimizing glycemia within a predefined target range by preventing extreme glucose fluctuations, are studied. Methods The main contribution of the article is definition of a modular architecture for control to range. Emphasis is on system specifications rather than algorithmic realization. The key system architecture elements are two interacting modules: range correction module, which assesses the risk for incipient hyper- or hypoglycemia and adjusts insulin rate accordingly, and safety supervision module, which assesses the risk for hypoglycemia and attenuates or discontinues insulin delivery when necessary. The novel engineering concept of range correction module is that algorithm action is relative to a nominal open-loop strategy—a predefined combination of basal rate and boluses believed to be optimal under nominal conditions. Results A proof of concept of the feasibility of our control-to-range strategy is illustrated by using a prototypal implementation tested in silico on patient use cases. These functional and architectural distinctions provide several advantages, including (i) significant insulin delivery corrections are only made if relevant risks are detected; (ii) drawbacks of integral action are avoided, e. g., undershoots with consequent hypoglycemic risks; (iii) a simple linear model is sufficient and complex algorithmic constraints are replaced by safety supervision; and (iv) the <b>nominal</b> <b>profile</b> provides straightforward individualization for each patient.

40|$|ENGLISH SUMMARYFunctional-Cognitive Corpus Study of the English Gerund and its SpanishEquivalents The {{main purpose}} of our thesis project is to study the English ing gerund and its Spanish {{equivalents}} from a contrastive point of view. Our goal is to carry out an in-depth study and to complete the functional-cognitive characterization of these constructions {{with the aim of}} comparing their use and function in both languages as well as providing the trendshelping the translation of the ing gerund into Spanish. Three areas with a particular difficulty exist in the analysis of the ing form. Based on the bibliography used, it can be ascertained that thecharacterization of the ing gerund {{is one of the main}} obstacles. Traditionally, the characterization of the ing gerund was established from tense / aspect criteria regarding the infinitive and the ing participle. As argued in chapter 1, the description of the ing gerund cannot be established from tense / aspect criteria because it is not valid for all the contexts where it appears. Another aspect directly related to the previous one, and which constitutes another limitation on the previous studies, is the difficulty in finding a schematic meaning of the ing gerund. This meaning must explain all the contexts in a coherent manner (for example, the different types of syntactic constructions or the different types of lexical elements with which the ing gerund appears etc.) as well as its ambivalent nature (noun and verb uses). Finally, there are specific cases that traditionally set out difficulties in its classification as gerund / participle: the so-called half-gerunds (according to Sweet 1968 and Duffley 2006). In our opinion, a functional-cognitive characterization (in particular,Givón and Langacker as main representatives) solves all the limitationsexposed in the previous section to a great extent. On one hand, the analysis of the type of construction and lexical elements where the ing gerund is placed, as well as a joint study of its ambivalent nature (the nominal and verbal ing forms), help us locate it more precisely within the continuum consisting of the different uses or functions of the ing form and understand how the different parameters are combined to favour aparticular reading (gerund and /or participle). On the other hand, a functional-cognitive approach helps us determine the schematic meaning of the ing gerund. Based on the observations on the cognitive grammar and psycho-mechanical approach (see, Langacker and Duffley as their main representatives, respectively) we have defined the ing according to its noun construct, as an abstract entity. The meaning of the -ing gerund as an abstract entity includes the different aspects listed above in a coherent and satisfactory way. The results of our analysis therefore provide the study of the ing gerund form with two important contributions. Firstly, it is proven that the characterization of the ing gerund based on its <b>nominal</b> <b>profile</b> is possible (Langacker 1991, 1990 a and 2008, and Duffley 1995 and 2003 b). Secondly, it is ascertained that the ing gerund must be interpreted as a continuum expressing different degrees of interaction with the governing elements it appears with. The noun profile and the non-discrete interpretation of the ing form highlight that, both the ing gerund as direct object complement and the prepositional ing form should be treated as variants of the transitivity phenomenon (Radden and Dirven 2007; García-Miguel 2007). Nevertheless, the ing gerund as direct object complement and the prepositional ing form show different degrees of conceptual transitivity (Radden and Dirven 2007 : 287). The transitivity, as conceptual phenomenon, appeals to situations showing different degrees, this gradation explainsthe fact that there are forms that are more prototypical and more peripheral with regard to the transitivity phenomenon. This difference explains that the relationship between the ing gerund as direct object and the governing element (lexical elements) can be analysed according to the billiard ball model (Langacker 1991, 1990 a and 2008) whereas the prepositional ing gerund must be analysed according to the atemporal relationship it establishes with its governing element (Langacker 1991, 1990 a and 2008). In both cases, as direct object and as prepositional form, the active participant (in particular, the type of energy displayed) constitutes the binding force which explains, on one hand, the different degreesof transitivity and, on the other hand, specifies the type of relationship between the ing gerund and the governing elements. As far as the Spanish equivalents, according to the corpus data, it canbe corroborated that literal cases are a minority (i. e., translation into the Spanish ndo gerund) and ascertained that the ing gerund displays a great variety of equivalents of a varied nature (i. e., infinitive, noun, noun clause, main verb, gerund, adjective clause, zero, participle and version proposed by the translator). This variety proves the great flexibility in the interpretation of the ing gerund form and its all-purpose character. The analysis of the equivalents highlights the validity of analysing the ing gerund from a noun profile. In other words, the characterization of the ing gerund is more eloquent if we consider Spanish data.

Russian Mission Controllers in Korolev, just outside Moscow verified that all systems on the spacecraft were performing nominally {{as well as the}} alignment with the docking port in the Zvezda Module. With the final command approach issued, Progress fired its thrusters and followed a <b>nominal</b> approach <b>profile.</b> The docking to the Zvezda Module occurred at 13:33 UTC on October 31, 2012, five hours fifty-two minutes after launch. At the time of docking, the space station and the Progress were flying above Bogota, Colombia.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2014, Paragon {{announced}} that its offshoot company, World View Enterprises, Inc., successfully completed a scaled systems {{test of the}} proposed <b>nominal</b> tourist flight <b>profile</b> to nearspace. World View uses a high-altitude balloon to rise to 32 km (20 miles) above the earth, after which it returns gently back down to earth beneath a remotely guided parafoil. Although not reaching space, the curvature of the Earth and the blackness of space can be seen. Commercial flights are expected to cost $75,000.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the human {{locomotor}} {{adaptation to the}} action of a powered exoskeleton providing assistive torque at the user’s hip during walking. To this end, we propose a controller that provides the user’s hip with {{a fraction of the}} <b>nominal</b> torque <b>profile,</b> adapted to the specific gait features of the user from Winter’s reference data [34]. The assistive controller has been implemented on the ALEX II exoskeleton and tested on ten healthy subjects. Experimental results show that when assisted by the exoskeleton, users can reduce the muscle effort compared to free walking. Despite providing assistance only to the hip joint, both hip and ankle muscles significantly reduced their activation, indicating a clear tradeoff between hip and ankle strategy to propel walking.

40|$|The European X-ray free {{electron}} laser requires a high-precision control of accelerating fields to ensure a stable photon generation. Its low level radio frequency system, based on the MicroTCA. 4 standard, detects the probe, forward and reflected signals for each cavity. While the probe signal is used to control the accelerating fields, {{a combination of the}} forward and reflected signals can be used to compute a virtual probe, whose accuracy is comparable to the directly sampled probe. This requires the removal of cross-coupling effects between the forward and reflected signals. This paper presents the precise generation of a virtual probe using an extended method of least squares. The virtual probe can then be used for precise field control in case the probe signal is missing or corrupted. It {{can also be used to}} detect any deviation from the <b>nominal</b> probe <b>profile...</b>|$|R
