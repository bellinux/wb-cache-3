6000|$|Yes, {{hear your}} true friend-your only true friend--list to his voice. Disband these societies, hotbeds of vice, of moral decay--perpetuators of ancestral superstition. Here on this board I see water, I see milk, I see {{the wild and}} deadly lemonade. These are but steps upon the {{downward}} path. Next we shall see tea, then chocolate, then coffee--hotel coffee. A few more years--all too few, I fear--mark my words, we shall have cider! Gentlemen, pause ere it be too late. You are on the broad road which leads to dissipation, physical ruin, moral decay, gory crime and the gallows! I beseech you, I implore you, in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> anxious <b>friends,</b> in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> suffering families, in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> impending widows and orphans, stop ere it be too late. Disband these New England societies, renounce these soul-blistering saturnalia, cease from varnishing the rusty reputations <b>of</b> <b>your</b> long-vanished ancestors--the super-high-moral old iron-clads of Cape Cod, the pious buccaneers of Plymouth Rock--go home, and try to learn to behave! ...|$|R
