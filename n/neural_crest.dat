5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. <b>Neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells at the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> The <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> runs the length of the tube with cranial <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells at the cephalic end and caudal <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed by a surgical pathologist, {{taking into account}} the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> element of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine parafollicular cells, {{also known}} as C cells, {{responsible}} {{for the production of}} calcitonin, are derived from <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, which migrate to the pharyngeal arches. This part of the thyroid then first forms as the ultimopharyngeal body, which begins in the ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins the primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location.|$|E
5|$|The KIT gene encodes {{a protein}} called steel factor receptor, which is {{critical}} to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells, sperm cells, and pigment cells. A process called alternative splicing, which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins (isoforms) for use in different circumstances, may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells, sperm cells, or pigment cells. Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages. These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes (pigment cells) from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer. The <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line. Melanocytes migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites: near the eye, near the ear, and the top of the head; six sites along each side of the body, and a few along the tail. At these sites, the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation, and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest,</b> which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. The rest of the body is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
25|$|Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive {{signaling}} works synergistically with EphB signaling {{to guide}} <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells down the rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin {{acts in the}} cephalic region to guide <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. <b>Neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.|$|E
25|$|Prior to delamination, {{presumptive}} <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> {{cells are}} initially anchored to neighboring cells by tight junction proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N-Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate delamination by inducing {{the expression of}} the zinc finger protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. <b>Neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells to escape. Additionally, <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo.|$|E
25|$|Neural plate border specifiers are induced {{as a set}} of {{transcription}} factors. Distalless-5, PAX3 and PAX7 {{prevent the}} border region from becoming either neural plate or epidermis. These induce a second set of transcription factors called <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> specifiers, which cause cells to become <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Molluscs have a {{structure}} called a radula which bears a ribbon of chitinous teeth. However, these teeth are histologically and developmentally different from vertebrate teeth and {{are unlikely to}} be homologous. For example, vertebrate teeth develop from a <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> mesenchyme-derived dental papilla, and the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> is specific to vertebrates, as are tissues such as enamel.|$|E
25|$|After {{fusion of}} the neural fold {{to create the}} neural tube, cells {{originally}} located in the neural plate border become <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells. For migration to begin, <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells must undergo a process called delamination that involves a full or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Delamination {{is defined as the}} separation of tissue into different populations, in this case <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells separating from the surrounding tissue. Conversely, EMT is a series of events coordinating a change from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. For example, delamination in chick embryos is triggered by a BMP/Wnt cascade that induces the expression of EMT promoting transcription factors such as SNAI2 and FoxD3. Although all <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells undergo EMT, the timing of delamination occurs at different stages in different organisms: in Xenopus laevis embryos there is a massive delamination that occurs when the neural plate is not entirely fused, whereas delamination in the chick embryo occurs during fusion of the neural fold.|$|E
25|$|The {{semilunar}} valves of {{the heart}} are associated with <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells according to new research.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{defining}} {{the mechanisms of}} <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> development may reveal key insights into vertebrate evolution and neurocristopathies.|$|E
25|$|The vagal and sacral <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells {{develop into}} the ganglia of the enteric nervous {{system and the}} {{parasympathetic}} ganglia.|$|E
25|$|The {{migration}} of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells involves a highly coordinated cascade {{of events that}} begins with closure of the dorsal neural tube.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells (NCC) are {{vertebrate}} {{embryonic stem}} cells that function directly and indirectly during early embryogenesis to produce many tissue types. Because the traits commonly affected by domestication syndrome are all derived from NCC in development, the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> hypothesis suggests that deficits in these cells cause the domain of phenotypes seen in domestication syndrome. These deficits could cause changes we see to many domestic mammals, such as lopped ears (seen in rabbit, dog, fox, pig, sheep, goat, cattle, and donkeys) as well as curly tails (pigs, foxes, and dogs). Although they do not affect {{the development of the}} adrenal cortex directly, the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells may be involved in relevant upstream embryological interactions. Furthermore, artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} describes {{abnormalities of}} structures {{derived from the}} embryonic ectoderm. These abnormalities affect both the superficial ectodermal layer, {{as well as the}} mesectodermal layer constituted by the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b>|$|E
25|$|General gene {{knock out}} of the TGF-β {{resulted}} in death. Conditional inactivation of TGF-βr2 of osteochondroprogenitor cells in the cranial <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> resulted in faster osteoprogenitor differentiation and disorganised chondrogenesis.|$|E
25|$|A review {{published}} in 2010 identified 6 main teratogenic mechanisms associated with medication use: folate antagonism, <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell disruption, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, vascular disruption and specific receptor- or enzyme-mediated teratogenesis.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two layers}} of mesoderm; intraembryonic and extraembryonic. As the intraembryonic layer grows laterally, it becomes {{continuous}} with the extraembryonic layer, forming the chorion (contributing to the blood supply). At the same time during embryonic development, the ectoderm begins to thicken and fold upward, forming the neural folds, which eventually meet to form the neural tube and <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> Because these two events occur {{at roughly the same}} time in embryological development, abnormalities found in this syndrome can involve not only the ectodermal cells, but also disruption to development in the mesectodermal layer constituted by the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b>|$|E
25|$|Superoxide dismutase is {{also not}} {{expressed}} in <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells in the developing fetus. Hence, high levels of free radicals can cause damage to them and induce dysraphic anomalies (neural tube defects).|$|E
25|$|Ganglioneuroma is a {{rare and}} benign tumor of the {{autonomic}} nerve fibers arising from <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> sympathogonia, which are completely undifferentiated cells of the sympathetic nervous system. However, ganglioneuromas themselves are fully differentiated neuronal tumors that do not contain immature elements.|$|E
25|$|In primary neurulation, {{the layer}} of {{ectoderm}} divides into three sets of cells: the neural tube (future brain and spinal cord), epidermis (skin), and <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells (connects epidermis and neural tube and will migrate to make neurons, glia, and skin cell pigmentation).|$|E
25|$|The motor {{division}} of the trigeminal nerve derives from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, and the sensory division originates in the cranial <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> Sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> <b>crest</b> {{cells are}} a {{temporary}} group of cells unique to vertebrates {{that arise from}} the embryonic ectoderm cell layer, and in turn {{give rise to a}} diverse cell lineage—including melanocytes, craniofacial cartilage and bone, smooth muscle, peripheral and enteric neurons and glia.|$|E
25|$|Cranial <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> migrates dorsolaterally to {{form the}} craniofacial mesenchyme that differentiates into various cranial ganglia and craniofacial cartilages and bones. These cells enter the {{pharyngeal}} pouches and arches where they contribute to the thymus, bones {{of the middle ear}} and jaw and the odontoblasts of the tooth primordia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the central}} nervous system, glia develop from the {{ventricular}} zone of the neural tube. These glia include the oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and astrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system, glia derive from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> These PNS glia include Schwann cells in nerves and satellite glial cells in ganglia.|$|E
25|$|The tooth germ is an {{aggregation}} {{of cells}} that eventually forms a tooth. These cells {{are derived from}} the ectoderm of the first pharyngeal arch and the ectomesenchyme of the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> The tooth germ is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental sac or follicle.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in neuronal development, and is responsible for the formation and arborisation of dendrites in neurons by forming a signalling complex with TINK and Rap2A. It is also required for proper formation and function of neuromuscular junctions, and normal numbers of cranial <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, motor neurons and axons.|$|E
25|$|A {{putative}} {{cause for}} the broad changes seen in domestication syndrome is pleiotropy. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of many species. These changes include extensive white markings (particularly on the head) floppy ears, and curly tails. These arise even when tameness is the trait under selective pressure. The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, {{so it is not}} known how or to what extent pleiotropy contributes to domestication syndrome. Tameness may be caused by the down regulation of fear and stress responses via reduction of the adrenal glands. Based on this, the pleiotropy hypotheses can be separated into two theories. The <b>Neural</b> <b>Crest</b> Hypothesis relates adrenal gland function to deficits in <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells during development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network Hypothesis claims that genetic changes in upstream regulators affect downstream systems.|$|E
25|$|Genes in horses such as Frame and Sabino1 produce white {{spotting}} by interrupting or {{limiting the}} migration of melanocytes from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest,</b> while the cream mutation affects {{the nature of the}} pigments produced by melanocytes. Therefore the skin, eyes, and hair of horses with the cream mutation do not lack melanocytes, melanosomes, or melanins, but rather exhibit hypomelanism.|$|E
25|$|DCC is developmentally regulated, {{being present}} in most fetal tissues {{of the body}} at higher levels than what is found in adult tissues. DCC and netrin {{have been found to}} be {{specifically}} involved in the secondary migration of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells into the pancreas and developing gut structures, and may prove to be vital to other areas during fetal growth.|$|E
25|$|During {{development}} of the aortic arch and the aortic arch arteries, the Notch receptors, ligands, and target genes display a unique expression pattern. When the Notch pathway was blocked, the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell marker expression failed to occur, suggesting that Notch {{is involved in the}} differentiation of cardiac <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells into vascular cells during outflow tract development.|$|E
