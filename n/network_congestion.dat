FTTP customers may choose either 30/10Mbit/s, 100/20 Mbit/s, 200/20 Mbit/s, 200/200 Mbit/s, or in selected areas, 1000/500Mbit/s maximum speed (down/up); ADSL and VDSL customers' download speeds are only limited to what their line and equipment can handle, while upload speeds are limited to 1Mbit/s and 10Mbit/s respectively. All three offer both data-capped and unlimited plans. Data-capped customers may choose either to pay extra per GB (or part thereof) over their data cap, or have their speed throttled back to 128kbit/s at no charge once they exceed the cap. Unlimited plans have no data caps, but a customer's download and upload speeds may be throttled during times of <b>network</b> <b>congestion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Xfinity Voice allows {{communication}} {{over the}} internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of service standards. For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing <b>network</b> <b>congestion</b> from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen {{by some as a}} violation of net neutrality, who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe. Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009. In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an information service exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.|$|E
500|$|In a road <b>network,</b> <b>congestion</b> can be {{considered}} a specific measure of the time delay in a journey or time lost through traffic jams. Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density, road capacity, and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights, junctions, and street works. This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference. [...] However, this technical definition of congestion as a measurement of delay can get confused and used interchangeably with traffic density in the public mind.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—IP {{multicast}} {{has proved}} to be the best approach for large scale multimedia communications enhancing video transmissions for applications like IPTV, video conferencing or other best-effort real-time audio/video applications. IP multicast connectivity, unfortunately, relays on certain network technologies and protocols and is present only in some areas of the Internet, while the majority of hosts lack in such connectivity and do not have sufficient network resources, or are locked behind firewalls. In this paper we present an effort to design and implement a HTTP Gateway for IP multicast communications. The main objective is to allow connections to IP multicast subsystems from different locations over Internet by tunneling multicast traffic over HTTP protocol. This way, the content of multicast network is easily accessible and independent of transport network. Another important goal of our gateway design is the optimization mechanism based on cache overriding to cope with <b>network</b> <b>congestions.</b> It is well known that TCP video streaming amplify the <b>network</b> <b>congestions.</b> Our proposed solution implements an intelligent buffering mechanism based on packet discarding rather then connection dropping...|$|R

2500|$|As the cap {{provoked}} a strongly negative reaction from some, Comcast decided to modify its policy in 2012.

[...] Customers could purchase a $30 add-on for [...] "unlimited" [...] data.

2500|$|More specifically, the {{photovoltaic}} tariffs {{were reduced}} somewhat, {{but not enough}} to affect uptake. [...] The degression for PV was tightened from 5% to 8–10%, {{depending on the size of}} installation. [...] A new 'self-consumption incentive' granted a fixed tariff of 25.01¢/kWh for electricity consumed by a PV operator within their own house. [...] A 'flexible degression cap' was introduced, under which the degression rate could be adjusted to keep the uptake of photovoltaics within a specified corridor. [...] The support for onshore wind improved. [...] The initial tariff was raised, the repowering (when old turbines are replaced by new) bonus (Repoweringbonus) was increased, and an additional system service bonus was granted for specified technical contributions (Systemdienstleistungen or SDL), including the ability to maintain voltage if the transmission grid fails. [...] The tariff for offshore wind was raised substantially. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was offered for offshore wind farms entering operation before 2015. [...] In parallel to the EEG, a separate loan program of €5 billion was established, to be administered by the state-owned KfW bank, with the goal of reaching 25GW installed capacity for wind by 2030. [...] Support of biomass was also increased, with special bonuses for a number of different biomass types. [...] Biomass must also comply with specified ecological requirements to be eligible, these requirements being contained in a separate 'sustainability ordinance' (Nachhaltigkeitsverordnung or BioSt-NachV). [...] The hydroelectricity tariffs were raised considerably and particularly for micro and small power plants. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised considerably too, as was the cogeneration bonus. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was introduced for geothermal projects put into operation before 2016. [...] A 'green power privilege' (Grünstromprivileg) was introduced, which exempted electricity suppliers with a minimum quota of renewables from the EEG surcharge under certain circumstances. [...] New measures allowed grid operators to temporarily limit wind turbine output in times of <b>network</b> <b>congestion,</b> with compensation payable to the plant owner for lost remuneration.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{proliferation}} of {{distributed energy resources}} (DERs) leads to capacity challenges, i. e. <b>network</b> <b>congestions,</b> in the low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. A number of strategies are being widely studied to tackle the challenges with direct switching actions such as load shedding or power curtailment. On the other hand, various market-based demand response (DR) programs {{have been developed to}} influence the large number of DERs to use their flexibility to deal with <b>network</b> <b>congestions.</b> However, most of the market-based solutions rely on the flexibilities of the DERs, thus cannot solve the congestion when flexibility is not available in the network. To complement the market-based solutions, a smart active power curtailment based mechanism is necessary for managing the congestions in the distribution network. In this paper, we propose a novel method for congestion management by active power curtailment based on a Mixed-Integer Programming technique. In addition, two greedy selection methods together with fair power curtailment and security constrained OPF methods have been developed for the sake of comparison. The overall performance of the proposed approach and the comparison with other methods have been verified by a simulation with a typical LV network of the Netherlands...|$|R

[...] Wind energy auctions will be held more often in the beginning, with three in 2017 and four in 2018, in order to quickly establish a price level. [...] The annual capacity for onshore wind farms will be set at 2.8GW per year for 2017 to 2019 and at 2.9GW thereafter. [...] In order to better synchronise the development of the grid with renewables growth, the addition of onshore wind will be restricted to specified 'grid congestion zones' where high inputs of renewable electricity cannot be accepted because of <b>network</b> <b>congestion.</b> [...] These areas are to be identified by the Federal Network Agency. [...] The new rules on funding offshore wind farms will apply to those projects that commence operation in 2021 or later. [...] From 2025, the government will specify the sites for future wind farms and investors will then compete for the right to build at those locations. [...] This centralised (Danish) model is designed to ensure competition and to make project approvals, site planning, and network connections more cost effective and better integrated. [...] Between 2021 and 2024 a transitional auction model will be used and wind farms that have been planned and approved but not built will compete in two rounds of tenders for a restricted amount of capacity. [...] Offshore wind will remain capped at 15GW by 2030 and the capacity auctioned each year will be consistent with this target. [...] In 2021, only wind farms in the Baltic Sea will be considered, due to a shortage of network connections at the North Sea. [...] Biomass projects will also participate in the new auction system. [...] Biomass capacity is to be expanded by 150MW annually in the next three years and by 200MW annually for the following three years. [...] Installations with a capacity greater than 150kW will also be able to tender. [...] Biomass facilities will only receive remuneration for half their runtime in order to incentivize their use during times of high electricity prices. [...] Hydroelectricity, geothermal, and mine, landfill, and sewage gas are excluded from the auction system because of the prospect of insufficient competition.|$|E

Being them mostly based on caching of Web objects and replication of DBMS managed data at the edges, or at intermediate points, of the Web infrastructure, they reveal effective when handling client requests only performing read access to application data. However, any update request typically needs to be redirected to the origin DBMSs, hence not taking advantage from data replication and related client proximity. In order to alleviate the effects of <b>network</b> <b>congestions</b> or failures, we have proposed a multi-path protocol that increases the likelihood for the update request to be processed along a responsive (e. g. failure free) network path in between the client location and the origin DBMS sites. In this paper we present an extensive simulation study of the effects of such a multi-path approach on the client perceived response time. The study relies on both Brite generated network topologies and the NLANR graph. Also, well known realistic TCP models are used to capture the effects of network delays during both normal and anomalous (i. e. packet loss affected) operation mode. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} in computer <b>networks,</b> <b>congestion</b> {{has become a}} critical issue. As a <b>network</b> term, <b>congestion</b> usually occurs when the incoming packets exceed the available network resources. This study proposed an Adaptive Gentle Random Early Detection (AGRED) algorithm based on Gentle Random Early Detection (GRED) algorithm in order to detect congestion at router buffer at a preliminary stage and thus enhance the parameter setting of the max threshold and the D max. The AGRED algorithm is simulated and compared with the original GRED and Random Early Detection (RED). The simulation results for the proposed AGRED, RED and GRED algorithms are carried out by varying the variable of packet arrival probability. During congestion, the simulation results reveal that AGRED offers marginally better performance results than RED and GRED, with regard to mean queue length, average queuing delay and packet loss probability due to overflow. Therefore, the AGRED is an effective method in controlling congestion at router buffers of networks. Whereby, improve networks performance...|$|R
30|$|Stream {{classification}} service (SCS) {{is a novel}} concept {{proposed in}} the newly released IEEE 802.11 aa standard for robust audio and video streaming, particularly for graceful degradation of streaming quality during <b>network</b> <b>congestions.</b> Based on intra-access category prioritisation (IACP), SCS {{is equipped with a}} pair of access category (AC) queues to differentiate real-time and non-real-time video streams, namely (AC_VI, AAC_VI), and thus introduces the need for an efficient scheduler design; similarly for audio. In this study, we propose a novel cross-layer design called virtual queue dropping (VQD) for packet scheduling between AC_VI and AAC_VI. Driven by a real-time video-packet-importance scheme, VQD adopts conditional priority weighting to enhance the priority of I-packets from AAC_VI so that they can fairly compete with P-packets from AC_VI. Moreover, to achieve graceful degradation during <b>network</b> <b>congestions,</b> VQD (i.e. based on priority coupling among different component queue lengths within the same physical AC queue) is adopted so that the dropping probabilities of lower-priority video packets are not only larger but also affected-and-increased by those of higher-priority ones. Different limits of priority retires of I- and P-packets can avoid unexpected long delays, and an optimal set of retry limits has been found to minimise the performance impact due to real-time constraints. Our results show that VQD outperforms PWD and SCS-CR in various performance metrics, and achieves a win-win game for the dilemma in maintaining priority for AC_VI and fairness for AAC_VI simultaneously.|$|R
