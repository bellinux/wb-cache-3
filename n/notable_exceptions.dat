5|$|An antipope is a {{historical}} papal claimant not recognized as legitimate by the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike papal tombs, the tombs of antipopes have generally not been preserved, with a few <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Romance {{speaking}} part of Europe the scruple {{was divided}} in 24grains, {{in the rest}} of Europe in 20grains. <b>Notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> were Venice and Sicily, where the scruple was also divided in 20grains.|$|E
5|$|Show Boat {{was adapted}} for live radio {{at least seven}} times. Due to network {{censorship}} rules, many of the radio productions eliminated the miscegenation aspect of the plot. <b>Notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> were the 1940 Cavalcade of America broadcast and the 1952 Lux Radio Theatre broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Broadly speaking, {{daylight}} saving time was abandoned {{in the years after}} the war (with some <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> including Canada, the UK, France, and Ireland). However, it was brought back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades and commonly during World War II. It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s {{as a result of the}} 1970s energy crisis.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the visual}} effects on Labyrinth were {{achieved}} in-camera, with several <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions.</b> The most prominent of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears {{at the opening of}} the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer, and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film. The owl head maquette had to be rescued from a skip (dumpster) when Omnibus, the animation company, went bankrupt in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Shooters are {{generally}} {{divided into four}} classes: men, junior men, women and junior women. The junior classes are included in most championships, with some <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> (such as the Olympic Games and the ISSF World Cup). A shooter remains a junior {{up to and including}} the calendar year in which he or she becomes 21 years of age, although a junior may opt to participate in the main class instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} long {{scale is}} used by most Continental European countries and by most other countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Albania, Greece, Romania, and Brazil). These countries use a word similar to billion to mean 1012. Some use a word similar to milliard to mean 109, while others use a word or phrase equivalent to thousand millions.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} battle was almost always followed, {{the battle of the}} Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions.</b> At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a {{flanking}} force, routing the opposing Carthaginian troops.|$|E
5|$|For the {{two centuries}} prior to 1854, Japan had {{severely}} limited exchange with foreign nations, with the <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Korea via Tsushima, Qing China via the Ryūkyūs, and the Dutch through the trading post of Dejima. In 1854, Commodore Perry opened Japan to global commerce with the implied threat of force, thus initiating {{a period of}} rapid development in foreign trade and Westernization. In large {{part due to the}} humiliating terms of the Unequal Treaties, as agreements like those conveyed by Perry are called, the Shogunate soon faced internal hostility, which materialized into a radical movement, the sonnō jōi ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians").|$|E
50|$|John Dryden's Alexander's Feast (1697) is a <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of an English {{language}} dithyramb.|$|R

5|$|The Crusaders' mentality {{to imitate}} the customs from their Western European homelands meant that {{there were very few}} {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states. Three <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> to this rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In this way the knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E
5|$|The Supermarionation puppets {{featured}} in Joe 90 {{are of the}} more accurately proportioned kind introduced for Captain Scarlet, and which would {{also be used for}} the Andersons' final puppet series, The Secret Service. Simultaneously, the drive for enhanced realism across all major design aspects which started with the preceding series continued for Joe 90. Main character puppets from Captain Scarlet were re-used for Joe 90 with the exceptions of the Captain Scarlet and Captain Blue marionettes. Few new puppets were constructed, the only <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> being Professor McClaine (sculpted by Mary Turner), Joe (sculpted by Tim Cooksey), and Mrs Harris.|$|E
5|$|The local Bulgarians {{traditionally}} {{belong to}} the ethnographic group of the Torlaks and speak a transitional Bulgarian dialect, the Belogradchik dialect. Most of the population are adherents of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The municipality has 30 registered cultural monuments and 12 consecrated stone crosses, of which eight in Chiprovtsi. Such crosses are typical for the Bulgarian northwest and each is dedicated to a saint: they serve both demarcating and religious purposes. Most of the crosses are not dated, with the <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Saint Demetrius—1755, Saints Peter and Paul—1781 and Holy Mother of God—1874.|$|E
5000|$|Out of North American dialects {{that have}} unrounded , the only <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> is New York City.|$|R
500|$|The {{island of}} Ireland fields a single {{international}} team in most sports. One <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> {{to this is}} association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name [...] "Ireland" [...] until the 1950s. The sport {{is also the most}} <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> where the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.|$|R
50|$|Few {{networks}} in Europe use {{this method of}} operation, the Strasbourg tramway network being a <b>notable</b> <b>exception.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{nervous system}} is large {{relative}} to the bird's size. The most developed {{part of the brain}} is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.|$|E
5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions.</b> While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E

5|$|Between Lake Michigan Beach and the {{northern}} terminus south of Mackinaw City, most of US31 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between the main highway and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions)</b> but academic success did not improve significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions.</b> Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E
