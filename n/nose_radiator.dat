25|$|The Sprat was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} 275hp (210kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine with a <b>nose</b> <b>radiator,</b> driving a four-bladed wooden propeller. As on the Velos, the upper engine cowling dropped smoothly away from the upper wing leading edge.|$|E
25|$|The 'Camel' may be {{regarded}} as the prototype of the Consolidated response to the USAAS's 1924 requirement for a new primary trainer. In the early summer of 1924, the USAAS tested a prototype unofficially designated TW-8 and placed an order for 50 examples of the Consolidated Model 1 production variant for service with the designation PT-1. Early production models had flat dorsal turtledecks, soon replaced by a faired version, and some of the first ones were likely built at the Gallaudet plant in Norwich before production began at Buffalo. The first 171 of the 221 produced used a streamlined <b>nose</b> <b>radiator,</b> the remainder used the unfaired installation. One PT-1 airframe was completed as XPT-2 with a 220hp (164kW) Wright J-5 radial engine.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{additional}} airframes possibly {{connected to}} the Nieuport 14 were built, all featuring a <b>nose</b> <b>radiator,</b> single bay wings and a deeper hunchback fuselage. One had cut-outs in its wing to improve visibility and was fitted with a [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 8A engine, another with a [...] Hispano-Suiza engine, and a third with a [...] Hispano-Suiza engine and a crescent-shaped wing.|$|E
25|$|P-40K, an Allison-engined P-40L, {{with the}} nose-top scoop {{retained}} and the Allison-configured <b>nose</b> <b>radiators</b> scoop, cowl flaps and vertical-stabilizer-to-fuselage fillet. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the Kittyhawk Mk III, {{it was widely}} used by US units in the CBI.|$|R
5000|$|Experimental prototype, with sequiplane wings, {{streamlined}} <b>nose</b> and retractable <b>radiator.</b>|$|R
500|$|The BT46 debuted at {{the third}} race of the 1978 season, the South African Grand Prix on 4 March 1978, with the revised <b>nose</b> mounted <b>radiators.</b> The cars were {{immediately}} competitive, although reliability was suspect.|$|R
2500|$|Improved {{aerodynamics}} were innovatively {{tested in}} Vickers' wind-tunnel by R.K. Pierson, their Chief Designer. Blue Bird’s body shape was substantially changed, {{with the famous}} coachbuilders Mulliner producing the bodywork. The results were unorthodox. A vertical tail fin was added for stability, a first for Blue Bird and land speed record cars. Open spats behind the wheels also reduced drag. The biggest change was to the radiators, which were moved {{to the rear of}} the car and mounted externally. These surface radiators were made by Fairey Aviation and contained [...] of tube. Removing the <b>nose</b> <b>radiator</b> allowed a low, rounded nose with better streamlining. However, one French newspaper compared its looks to a whale.|$|E
2500|$|The clean {{fuselage}} of the R.V was an internally wire braced, {{welded steel}} tube structure of rectangular cross section. The [...] Mercedes D.I water-cooled six cylinder inline engine was mounted behind a rectangular <b>nose</b> <b>radiator</b> in an aluminium covered forward fuselage region; fuel was gravity fed from a wing tank. Aft, the fuselage was fabric covered. The pilot had an open cockpit under the wing trailing edge, with one passenger next to him. Two other passengers could sit, though not stand, {{side by side}} within the fuselage forward of the pilot in a cabin lit by windows, one in the small, starboard side door, and heated by hot air from the engine. Their luggage {{was placed in a}} small compartment behind the pilot. The empennage was a steel tube structure, fabric covered. [...] The braced tailplane carried separate elevators which, like the rudder, were balanced. [...] The R.V had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage with steel tube V struts and mainwheels on a rubber sprung single axle, together with a tailskid.|$|E
50|$|The Sprat was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} 275 hp (210 kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine with a <b>nose</b> <b>radiator,</b> driving a four-bladed wooden propeller. As on the Velos, the upper engine cowling dropped smoothly away from the upper wing leading edge.|$|E
50|$|The MG 14/28 Super Sports is {{a sports}} car that was {{launched}} in 1924. It was the second line of cars produced by W R Morris's MG company. The first line of cars were 1548cc Morris Oxfords fitted with a two-seater body supplied by Charles Raworth & Sons of Oxford. They were built at first in small premises in Alfred Lane, Oxford moving in 1925 to a larger site shared with Morris Motors Limited radiator factory at Bainton Road, Oxford. The badge {{on the front of}} the car still read Morris Oxford, MG badges were not to appear on the car's nose until 1928 but they did appear below the Morris badge on the honeycomb of the last of the 14-28 cars which had flat <b>nose</b> <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modified {{with new}} glazed <b>nose</b> section, new <b>radiators</b> and new [...] "D" [...] fin and rudder. The dorsal turret {{was changed to}} a four-gun Boulton Paul Type A Mk VIII, and there were {{improvements}} to the bomb bay door sealing. Some aircraft were fitted with the H2S radar.|$|R
50|$|The 72 was {{yet another}} {{innovative}} design by Chapman featuring inboard brakes, side mounted radiators in sidepods, {{as opposed to the}} <b>nose</b> mounted <b>radiators</b> which had been commonplace since the 1950s, and an overhead air intake. The overall shape of the car was innovative too, resembling a wedge on wheels which was inspired by the earlier Lotus 56 gas turbine car, and the layout taken from the Lotus 63 four wheel drive project testbed. The shape made for better air penetration and higher speeds. In a back-to-back test with the Lotus 49, the 72 was 12 mph faster with the same Cosworth engine.|$|R
50|$|The Seely was a three-bay biplane {{with greater}} wing area than the Tourer, with ailerons on both {{upper and lower}} wings. The rudder was horn-balanced and the fin area generous. For the competition, it was powered by a {{water-cooled}} upright inline 240 hp (180 kW) Siddeley Puma with a large <b>nose</b> <b>radiator</b> behind the wooden two-blade propeller.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{additional}} airframes possibly {{connected to}} the Nieuport 14 were built, all featuring a <b>nose</b> <b>radiator,</b> single bay wings and a deeper hunchback fuselage.

50|$|Only three R.T.1s were built, differing chiefly {{in their}} engines. The {{first and third}} were powered by a 200 hp (150 kW) Hispano-Suiza and the second by the 150 hp (110 kW) RAF 4A also used in the R.E.8. The Hispano-Suiza {{installations}} differed in their nose and radiator arrangements: the first used a rectangular <b>nose</b> <b>radiator</b> {{like that of the}} S.E.5, whereas the third had a neatly rounded nose with a small chin radiator. The ailerons on the third aircraft were extended beyond the wing-tips to allow horn balancing.|$|E
50|$|Baldwin made {{a number}} of {{switchers}} with similar dimensions and body styles. The first body style, used in VO models, had a slightly pointed nose with a round radiator opening. The second and third body style, almost indistinguishable and used interchangeably, had a flat <b>nose</b> and rectangular <b>radiator</b> opening. Various exhaust stacks were used, and are not an effective spotting feature, except that turbocharged models always had one large stack offset to the side.|$|R
5000|$|The chief {{structural}} {{difference between}} the two models, which shared the same span and length, was the D.25's second cockpit itself and the fuselage strengthening around it to allow a gun mounting. Though the two-seater was heavier, it had a less powerful engine: it used a [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb water-cooled upright W-12 instead of the similarly arranged [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Gb. Both the D.21 and D.25 had much in common with the Dewoitine D.12 of 1924. For example, the D.25's parasol wing was {{similar to that of the}} D.12, with the same span, a constant chord inner panel, outer sections tapered on both the leading and trailing edges but chiefly on the latter, ending in blunt tips. It was braced to the lower fuselage by a parallel pair of long struts on each side. The D.12 and D.25 used the same Lorraine-Dietrich engine with a circular <b>nose</b> mounted <b>radiator</b> immediately behind the propeller.|$|R
5000|$|Bizzarrini {{focused his}} design {{effort on the}} car's {{aerodynamics}} {{in an attempt to}} improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at Pisa University as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low <b>nose,</b> small <b>radiator</b> inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear spoiler. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as Lotus. The bodies were constructed by Scaglietti, with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by Pininfarina (in the case of s/n 2643 GT). Cars were produced in many colours, with the most famous being the bright red [...] "Rosso Cina".|$|R

5000|$|The 1927 {{record was}} short-lived, as Segrave's Sunbeam 1000 hp {{achieved}} both the 180 mph and 200 mph targets a month later.

50|$|The R90CK {{would appear}} as an {{evolution}} of the R89C's design, borrowing many stylistic elements which had been used before. The {{front end of the}} car was low, with two deep channels on either side of a slanted <b>nose</b> leading to <b>radiator</b> inlets {{on the sides of the}} cockpit. Small slated inlets would also be placed on the leading edge of the car, partially feeding brake cooling ducts. The cockpit would feature a longer raked windshield then the R89C, yet the areas around the cockpit would remain nearly identical, including the sides of the car. At the rear, the rear wing would be mounted high on exposed struts for better downforce.|$|R
2500|$|At {{its most}} basic the Mk III Series C is nearly {{identical}} to the Mk III {{in terms of its}} layout. [...] At the front, a slanted <b>nose</b> housed a <b>radiator</b> fed air from a vent above the front splitter, and exiting {{over the top of the}} bodywork just in front of the cockpit. [...] The sidepods were straight and flat and featured a variety of exchangeable panels for cooling and aerodynamics. [...] An engine intake was mounted behind and above the cockpit, and shrouded an engine bay which could accept multiple naturally aspirated engine designs. [...] Also shared with the Mk III was the use of a steel tube frame and carbon fiber chassis, rather than the all-carbon monocoque used by the Northstar LMP.|$|R
50|$|After Loris Kessel {{had left}} John Macdonald's RAM team, he {{approached}} Frank Williams {{for a drive}} at his team. Williams had no place left for Kessel, but could sell him an old car, the FW03. Kessel agreed and approached the Swiss Jolly Club of Switzerland, that was successful in touring cars and rallying. Kessel also hired ex-Ferrari designer Giacomo Caliri. In his FLY-studio the FW03 was heavily updated. The result was {{a car with a}} striking long <b>nose</b> and <b>radiators</b> placed {{directly in front of the}} front wheel suspension. Painted in fresh yellow and white colours the former FW03 was a nice looking car. The car was renamed the Apollon Fly, named after the sponsor of the project, a pharmacist. However, it took a long time before the Apollon actually appeared on the track. Jolly Club tried to race in Belgium, France, Austria and the Netherlands. However, in Belgium and France, Kessel had transport problems. At Monza the Apollon finally appeared. Because not enough pit boxes were available, the Swiss had to settle for a place in the open air, a clumsy scene. In the untested car Kessel was way too slow and when he went off track in the final qualifying session, the adventure was finally over.|$|R
40|$|Part 1 {{deals with}} the head {{resistance}} {{of a number of}} common types of radiator cores at different speeds in free air, as measured in the wind tunnel at the bureau of standards. This work was undertaken to determine the characteristics of various types of radiator cores, and in particular to develop the best type of radiator for airplanes. Some 25 specimens of core were tested, including practically all the general types now in use, except the flat plate type. Part 2 gives the results of wind tunnel tests of resistance on a model fuselage with a <b>nose</b> <b>radiator.</b> Part 3 presents the results of preliminary tests of head resistance of a radiator enclosed in a streamlined casing. Special attention is given to the value of wing radiator and of the radiator located in the open, especially when it is provided with a properly designed streamlined casing...|$|E
5000|$|When the BT43 {{made its}} next {{appearance}} at {{the second round of}} the 1979 Australian Drivers' Championship at Oran Park on July 29, 1979 two factors were evident. The first was dramatic modifications to the car primarily to cure the chronic lack of front end downforce exhibited since initial testing and in Bartlett's words its [...] "unhealthy transition to spectacular oversteer"; while the second was the sponsorship of Bartlett's racing activities by Kerry Packer's Nine Television Network. Modifications included: a new nose (similar to that of the Lola T400); removal of the <b>nose</b> mounted <b>radiators</b> and replacement with two new radiators mounted on the end of each upper side of the pyramidic monocque; and the change in livery. All of these changes were for nothing however as owing to an engine issue during practice the car failed to start the race. The third and final round of the 1979 Australian Drivers' Championship at Sandown Park on September 9, 1979 proved to be the BT43's final race. One further modification to the car was the addition of a new airbox which again was similar to that fitted to a Lola. Bartlett had taken a deposit on the car and raced it for its new owner. Bartlett was in second place early in the race - ahead of eventual second place getter and series winner Johnnie Walker driving a Lola T332 - and entering the bridge turn Bartlett had the centre of the right rear Dymag wheel collapse sending the BT43 into the catch fences breaking Bartlett's leg and arm and significantly damaging the BT43.|$|R
25|$|In late 1938, the Bf 109E entered production. To {{improve on}} the {{performance}} afforded by the 441–515kW (600–700PS) Jumo 210, the larger, longer Daimler-Benz DB 601A engine was used, yielding an extra 223kW (300PS) {{at the cost of}} an additional 181kg (400lb). A much bigger cooling area was needed to disperse the extra heat generated by the DB 601 and this led to the first major redesign of the basic airframe. Enlarging the existing <b>nose</b> mounted <b>radiator</b> sufficiently to cool the engine would have created extra weight and drag, negating some of the performance gains afforded by the increased power, so it was decided to move the main radiators to beneath the wings' undersurfaces immediately outboard of the juncture between the wing root and wing panel, just forward of the trailing edges' inner ends, leaving the oil cooler under the nose in a small, streamlined duct. The new radiator position also had the effect of counterbalancing the extra weight and length of the DB 601, which drove a heavier three-bladed Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (VDM)-made propeller. To incorporate the new radiators, the wings were almost completely redesigned and reinforced, with several inboard ribs behind the spar being cut down {{to make room for the}} radiator ducting. Because the radiators were now mounted near the trailing edge of the wing, coinciding with the increased speed of the airflow accelerating around the wing's camber, the overall cooling installation was more efficient than that of the Jumo engined 109s, albeit at the cost of extra ducting and piping, which could be vulnerable to battle damage. In addition, the lowered undercarriage could throw up mud and debris on wet airfields, potentially clogging the radiators.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{in contrast}} {{was made of}} metal. [...] The central Salmson water-cooled radial was mounted in the <b>nose</b> with rectangular <b>radiators</b> mounted on the fuselage forward of and just above the lower wing. The outer engines were also fuselage mounted, each having pairs of struts to the upper fuselage longeron and to the lower ones via the wing roots. Thus they were positioned a little above the lower wing, near to {{the centre of the}} inner bay in neatly faired nacelles with circular radiators at the front. The underlying fuselage structure was rectangular in cross-section aft of the leading edge, but faired at its sides and top into a rounder shape. [...] It was deepest between the wings and gave the aircraft a somewhat short, fat look. The pilot sat just forward of the wings, high up and well above the central motor line, with a god view. Below and forward of him were positions for a radio operator and an engineer. The passenger cabin, entered via a port side door had tables, armchairs and sliding windows for thirteen, with another three places accessed forward via a 500 mm wide corridor.|$|R
