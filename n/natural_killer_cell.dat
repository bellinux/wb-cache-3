40|$|The {{regulation}} of dendritic cells {{is far from}} fully understood. Interestingly, several recent reports have suggested a role for <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in affecting dendritic cell maturation and function upon direct contact between the cells. It is not known if this interaction takes place also in vivo, or if a potential interaction of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and dendritic cells {{would be affected by}} allergen exposure of the dendritic cells. The yeast Malassezia can act as an allergen in atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome, and induce maturation of dendritic cells. Our aims were to study the distribution of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in the skin from atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome patients with the emphasis on possible <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> cell–dendritic <b>cell</b> interaction, and to assess whether the interaction of Malassezia with dendritic cells would affect subsequent interaction between dendritic <b>cells</b> and <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> A few scattered <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> (CD 56 +/CD 3 –) cells were found in the dermis of healthy individuals and in nonlesional skin from atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome patients. In lesional skin and in biopsies from Malassezia atopy-patch-test-positive skin, however, <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> were differentially distributed {{and for the first time}} we could show close contact between <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and CD 1 a+ dendritic cells. Dendritic cells preincubated with Malassezia became less susceptible to natural-killer-cell-induced cell death, suggesting a direct effect imposed by Malassezia upon interaction of dendritic <b>cells</b> with <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings indicate that <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and dendritic cells can interact in the skin and that Malassezia affects the interaction between <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and dendritic cells.

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> are {{increasingly}} being considered {{an important component of}} innate resistance to viruses, but their role in HIV infection is controversial. Some investigators have found that <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> do not confer a protective effect during the progression of HIV disease, whereas others have shown that <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> may be protective and retard the progression of the disease, either through their lytic activity or by a chemokine-related suppression of HIV replication. In this study, we analyzed functional alterations in the activity of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> during HIV- 1 infection using a <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> activity assay with K 562 cells as targets. RESULTS: Our results show that the activity of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> decreases only in the advanced phase of HIV infection and when high (40 : 1) effector cell-target cell ratios were used. The depression {{at this stage of the}} disease may be related to increased levels of some viral factors, such as gp 120 or gag, that interfere with the binding capacity of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells,</b> or to the decreased production of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> -activity-stimulating cytokines, such as IFN-a and IL- 12, by monocytes, a subset of cells that are also affected in the late stage of HIV infection.

25|$|Thalidomide and its analogs {{help with}} the co-stimulation of T-cells through the B7-CD28 complex by phosphorylating {{tyrosine}} on the CD28 receptor.

This enhances natural and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are about 100-1000 times more potent in stimulating T-cell clonal proliferation than thalidomide.

500|$|Not all virus infections {{produce a}} {{protective}} immune response in this way. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins {{on the surface of}} the virion. This is known as [...] "escape mutation" [...] as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine resistance, evasion of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic shift. Other viruses, called neurotropic viruses, are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them.|$|E
2500|$|The pathway {{by which}} hepatic viruses cause viral {{hepatitis}} is best {{understood in the}} case of hepatitis B and C. The viruses do not directly cause apoptosis (cell death). [...] Rather, infection of liver cells activates the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system leading to an inflammatory response which causes cellular damage and death. [...] Depending on the strength of the immune response, the types of immune cells involved and the ability of the virus to evade the body's defense, infection can either lead to clearance (acute disease) or persistence (chronic disease) of the virus. [...] The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that overtime lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma. [...] Individuals with an impaired immune response are at greater risk of developing chronic infection. Natural killer cells are the primary drivers of the initial innate response and create a cytokine environment that results in the recruitment of CD4 T-helper and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. [...] Type I interferons are the cytokines that drive the antiviral response. In chronic Hepatitis B and C, <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> function is impaired.|$|E

The average number of <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and LGL in normal controls was 3. 0 ± 1. l per mn 2.

40|$|Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} is a {{neoplasia}} {{resulting from a}} translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 producing the BCR-ABL hybrid known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). In chronic myeloid leukemia a proliferation of malignant myeloid cells occurs in the bone marrow due to excessive tyrosine kinase activity. In order to maintain homeostasis, <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells,</b> by means of receptors, identify the major histocompatibility complex {{on the surface of}} tumor cells and subsequently induce apoptosis. The NKG 2 D receptor in the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> recognizes the transmembrane proteins related to major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB), and it is by the interaction between NKG 2 D and MICA that <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> exert cytotoxic activity against chronic myeloid leukemia tumor cells. However, in the case of chronic exposure of the NKG 2 D receptor, the MICA ligand releases soluble proteins called sMICA from the tumor cell surface, which negatively modulate NKG 2 D and enable the tumor cells to avoid lysis mediated by the <b>natural</b> <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> Blocking the formation of sMICA may be an important antitumor strategy.
