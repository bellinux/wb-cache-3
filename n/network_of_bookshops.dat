40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a project aimed at revitalizing small and old rural villages through {{establishing}} a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>bookshops,</b> the BookTownNet. The project combined a research framework based on theories from information system research and regional economics in analyzing the development and diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT) to small, rural enterprises through that network. Our findings indicate that use of the Internet both locally and between the booktowns has strengthened the communication and collaboration between them, thus creating a better basis for the small bookshops to be competitive in the information society. Further, {{we have found that}} differences in local innovation systems to some extent have influenced the diffusion processes. Our data also show that the booktown network has been able to compensate for the lack of support in the regional innovation system, which makes the importance of the ICT-based virtual network spanning geographically distributed regions evident. This indicates that the booktown infrastructure and support system has been {{the most important factor in}} the bookshops ’ ability to implement and use the ne...|$|E

40|$|Among the {{set goals}} of {{improving}} book consumption in Slovenia the National Culture Program 2004 - 2007 also includes encouraging {{the development of}} <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>bookshops</b> and ‘quality’ bookshops, that will be evenly distributed across Slovenia. The program suggests them to be formed {{within the framework of}} already existing public cultural institutions. Book consumption in Slovenia has been characterised by poorly developed retail book market and well developed network of public libraries with a high number of book lendings that serves as a substitute for the paperback market as it is known in bigger language communities abroad. Along with surveying the possibilities of directing the libraries towards book marketing (as well), the paper also examines the historical development of commercial publishing companies / bookshops / libraries, existing in Europe in 18 th and 19 th century and in some places existing side by side with public libraries until the middle of 20 th century. The paper shows that the present ratio between bookshops and libraries on some big book markets is different than in Slovenia, as libraries are loosing patrons {{as a consequence of the}} growth of big bookshop chains. A characteristic feature of book consumption in Slovenia can be seen in the use of the internet in libraries as well as bookshops. The ‘merging’ of the marketing segment and book lending is to a smaller extent already under way abroad, where large online bookshops encourage libraries by means of provision to act as the mediator in the sale of books. In this way, a library can turn into a bookshop with the help of connections via ISBN numbers, without having to jeopardise their original mission...|$|E

50|$|The target {{readership}} {{was reached}} by selling directly to trades unions, women's organizations and networks, student unions, and theatre audiences {{as well as}} through the <b>network</b> <b>of</b> radical <b>bookshops</b> that emerged in the 1970s. Pluto Press became a distributor and co-publisher of titles generated by Urizen Books and South End Press in the USA, and Ink Links in the UK, as well as distributor for Counter-Information Services, History Workshop, Feminist Review and others. A trade sales organization, Volume Sales, was set up in partnership with Allison & Busby, under the direction of Ric Sissons. New departures in publishing included working with Max Stafford-Clark and the Royal Court Theatre to encourage theatre-goers to read playscripts by printing programmes that included the entire play. In 1987 Pluto Press was bought by Roger van Zwanenberg and Norman Drake. Drake later sold his shares to van Zwanenberg.|$|R
5000|$|According to , {{the ending}} of the FBPA in the UK (1995) did not lead to a sharp {{decrease}} of the number <b>of</b> <b>bookshops,</b> rather to a displacement <b>of</b> small, independent <b>bookshops</b> by big-chain outlets. He notices however that the former stayed in place where a quality-sensitive demand existed, and that competition between bookshops spurred a reduction of operational costs thanks to better logistics and collection management (an argument also found in [...] ). In a counterfactual manner, [...] shows that in France, the FBP helped to maintain a dense <b>network</b> <b>of</b> independent <b>bookshops,</b> reined in the deployment of chain bookstores and spurred supermarkets to boost their offer of books. Fishwick also shows that while the number of published titles increases as fast as in France, {{there is no sign of}} an overall increase of book prices. He shows however that this stability hides a strong distributive effect. Comparison with France show that the FBP leads to an increase of the price of bestsellers relative to non-FBP markets and a decrease of low-selling or long-selling books. He argues that the assessment of this effect is difficult, since the relation between the (un)popularity of a book and its cultural value is unclear, whereas consumers of low-selling books are, on average, wealthier than consumers of bestsellers (making a FBP a subsidy of wealthier people by poorer people).|$|R
