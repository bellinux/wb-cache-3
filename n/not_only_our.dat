500|$|While he {{remained}} genial in public, Rimsky-Korsakov personally found {{the situation with}} Tchaikovsky more conflicting. He was uncomfortable that Tchaikovsky was becoming more popular among Rimsky-Korsakov's followers, and had developed a jealous resentment of Tchaikovsky's greater fame. He confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov, writing that if Tchaikovsky followed through with a contemplated move to Saint Petersburg, a group of followers [...] "will immediately form around him, which Lyadov and Glazunov will certainly join, and after them many others... ur youth will drown (and <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>our</b> youth—look at Lyadov) {{in a sea of}} eclecticism that will rob them of their individuality." [...] About this eclecticism, and Tchaikovsky's part in it, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in his memoirs, seemingly matter-of-factly, [...] "By this time quite an accretion of new elements and young blood had accumulated in Belyayev's circle. New times, new birds, new songs." [...] Yet to Kruglikov he confessed in 1890, [...] "New times, new birds, new birds , new songs—except our birds are not so new, and the new songs they sing are worse than the old ones." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts late in February 1604 Thomas's cousin, Robert Catesby, {{invited him to}} his house in Lambeth, but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend. [...] Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to, and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright, a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman. [...] Catesby planned to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament, killing the king. Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea. [...] As a former soldier he was a practical man, and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed, it would [...] "breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations". He also offered a warning {{of the price of}} failure: [...] "the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain, as <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>our</b> enemies, but our friends also would with good reason condemn us." [...] He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy, and as Catesby had not entirely given up hope of foreign support—"because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untried"—Thomas returned to the continent.|$|E

2500|$|From his {{bases in}} Pankisi, Gelayev {{organised}} {{a series of}} cross-border hit-and-run attacks into Russia. He would not perform any large-scale raid into Chechnya {{because he wanted to}} avoid clashes with fellow [...] Chechens serving in pro-Moscow forces and because of his strained relations with Maskhadov and Basayev. However, more than 100 Chechen fighters left his group and returned to Chechnya under the command of Umarov in 2002. Many Dagestani and Kabarday fighters also split from Gelayev and returned to their own republics, Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria, launching the local insurgencies there. In September 2002, Gelayev personally led an incursion into the Russian republic of Ingushetia, capturing the villages of Tarskoye and Galashki, but his fighters became surrounded, took large losses and were dispersed. According to Russia, 30-40 Chechen fighters were killed in shootouts and air attacks and five were captured (though Chechen sources said that seven fighters were killed and five were missing). 17 Russian servicemen were also reported killed. Among those killed was Roddy Scott, a British freelance reporter who travelled with the rebels and was allegedly shot by a Russian sniper while attempting to surrender. Gelayev himself was severely injured and for a time being was out of action. In an October 2002 interview, he said he would [...] "continue to fight until <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>our</b> country but all the nations of the Caucasus are freed from the double-headed eagle [...]" ...|$|E
