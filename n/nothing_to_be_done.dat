5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: [...] "It {{is a great}} pity {{that such}} a man is not with us any longer. But there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> For us, {{everything}} is lost now {{and the only way}} out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1730, {{news came}} to Paraguay {{that a third}} {{replacement}} governor was on the way, Ignacio de Soroeta. [...] Rumors spread that Soroeta {{was a friend of}} the Jesuits and Reyes. [...] Mompó rallied his followers, called the comuneros, and raised a force of 300 outside the city. [...] A delegation of the comuneros sent to the cabildo demanded that the new governor be denied entry. [...] Barúa demanded that the comuneros disband; when they refused, he resigned his post in frustration. [...] The comuneros demanded new elections of the cabildo, which, unsurprisingly, they won. [...] Only those members who had accepted the rebel line were re-elected, while the other cabildo members were replaced by comuneros. [...] When Soroeta arrived, he was informed he was not wanted, and only allowed to stay in Asunción for four days under virtual house arrest. [...] Convinced there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> Soroeta left; Barúa and Bishop Palos of Asunción also left. [...] The city was entirely under comunero control. [...] Despite the new comunero influence on the cabildo, Mompó desired an even more radical shift. [...] He apparently felt that he could not abolish the cabildo directly; instead, he created his own parallel governmental structure, [...] the Junta Gobernativa, whose members were elected by the people.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{used to be}} a real leftist. I {{remember}} Arik Sharon [...] coming here, to my house, a {{few months}} before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt {{that there would be a}} deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Fortunately the Socialist League is dormant for {{the time}} being. Our good Bax and Morris, craving to do {{something}} (if only they knew what?), are restrained only {{by the fact that}} there is absolutely nothing to do. Moreover they have far more truck with the anarchists than is desirable.... All this will pass, if only because there is absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> over here [...] just now. But with Hyndman, who is well versed in political imposture and capable of all sorts of folly when his self-advancement is at stake...on the one hand and our two political babes in arms on the other, prospects are no means bright. Yet now we have socialist papers abroad proclaiming at the top of their voices that socialism in England is marching forward with gigantic strides! I am very glad to say that what passes for socialism here in England is not on the march — far from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gabe Habash of Publishers Weekly {{called it}} an ingenious, upsetting, and unforgettable novel. He added, [...] "There is much to admire in Han's novel. Its three-part {{structure}} is brilliant, gradually digging {{deeper and deeper into}} darker and darker places; the writing is spare and haunting; but perhaps most memorable is its crushing climax, a phantasmagoric yet emotionally true moment that's surely one of the year's most powerful". He compared its parts to Patrick Süskind's Perfume, Herman Koch's The Dinner, and Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life respectively. Eileen Battersby, writing for The Irish Times, said, [...] "The Vegetarian is more than a cautionary tale about the brutal treatment of women: it is a meditation on suffering and grief. It is about escape and how a dreamer takes flight. Most of all, it is about the emptiness and rage of discovering there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> when all hope and comfort fails. For all the graphic, often choreographed description, Han Kang has mastered eloquent restraint in a work of savage beauty and unnerving physicality." [...] Laura Miller, writing for Slate, compares the straightforward style of writing with works by the Japanese author Haruki Murakami.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 November 1958, {{over the}} {{opposition}} of the Emperor, Crown Prince Akihito announced his engagement to Shōda Michikio, which {{marked the first time}} that a member of the House of Yamato had married a commoner or had married for love. For the Japanese people, the idea that a member of the Imperial family would marry a commoner for love was revolutionary as such thing had never happened in Japan before, and the marriage proved very popular with the public. In February 1959, a public opinion showed 87% of the Japanese people approved of Akihito's choice of bride. The Shinto clergy disapproved of the wedding because Michikio was a Roman Catholic while traditionalists in general led by the Emperor himself were opposed to the idea of the Crown Prince marrying a commoner for love as this was out of line with Japanese tradition, but given the level of public support, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to stop the wedding. Kishi saw the Imperial wedding as a chance to divert attention from the unpopular security treaty, and gave his approval to the engagement. As the nation was caught in Imperial wedding fever, the so-called [...] "Mitchii" [...] crave as Michikio became the most popular woman in Japan, the issue of the security treaty vanished and Kishi mistakenly assumed the matter was over. On 10 April 1959, before a TV audience of 15 million people, Crown Prince Akihito married Michiko while half-million people showed up to watch the wedding in person. After the wedding, the matter of the security treaty returned to the public mind while Kishi thought the public had forgotten about the treaty. At the same time, right-wing terrorism which had flourished in the 1930s returned to Japan. The prospect of the children of a commoner sitting one day on the Chrysanthemum Throne energized the far-right in Japan, and left-wing opponents of the revised security treaty were threatened and sometimes assassinated. The most gory killing of the terrorist campaign of 1958-61 occurred when Inejiro Asanuma, the leader of the Socialist Party was killed while giving a speech on live television by a right-wing fanatic who stabbed him to death with his samurai sword. Kishi does seem not to ordered the killings, but he fostered a climate of opinion when anyone who criticized his government was seen as a traitor, and the police proved remarkably ineffective at stopping the far-right in their campaign of intimation and assassination against critics of the Kishi government. In 1959, Kishi visited Buenos Aires, Argentina.|$|E
