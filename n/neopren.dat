Based in previous reports, we have made an anatomical revision of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery focused to its anterior pontine and lateral pontine segments with data that may contribute to their better knowledge. This research {{was done by the}} study of 70 human brains from both sexes, collected at S창o Paulo Medical School/ UNIFESP, Brazil, and to which them, we registred some anthropological data. The brains were inyected in its vascular system with red collored <b>neopren</b> latex and fixed using established anatomical techniques. The range of 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm for the external diameter of the AICA is more frecuently at right side in both sexes; in 47. 4 % of the Brachycephalics (BH) and in 53. 1 % of the Dolicho-mesocephalics (DM). At the left side and masculine sex, was observed in 45. 3 % and in 64. 3 % of feminine sex; in 52. 7 % of the BH and in 53. 1 % of the DM. The course of the AICA at right side is ventral to abducent nerve (AN) in 68. 0 % in DM groups and in 69. 0 % in BH groups; at the left side this course was observed in 74. 0 % in DM and 77. 0 % in BH groups.

40|$|At present, the {{clinical}} specialized literature, insist in {{the necessity of}} an anatomical precise knowledge, necessary for the success in neurochirurgical interventions during the approaching to the posterior cranial fossa. Based in previous reports, we have made an anatomical revision of the superior cerebellar artery and anterior inferior cerebellar artery focused to its anterior pontine segments with data that may contribute to their study {{and that they could}} be of practical useful. This study was done in 70 brains of brazilian adult cadavers, from both sexes, collected at the Anatomy Laboratory S찾o Paulo Medical School / UNIFESP (S찾o Paulo, Brazil), and to which them, we registred their anthropological data. It was considered the cephalics measurements too. We took the brains from skulls, using established anatomical techniques and inyected its vascular system with red collored <b>neopren</b> latex and fixed into a 10 % formaldehyde solution. At right side, masculine sex, the external diameter of superior cerebellar artery was 2. 0 to 2. 9 mm in range in 66. 7 % of the cases, and in the feminine sex in 82. 1 %; in 75. 0 % in dolicho-mesocephalics and 71. 1 % in the brachycephalics. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery external diameter at right side, masculine sex, this range of 1. 0 to 1. 5 mm was observed in 50 % of the cases, the same porcentagem was registred in the feminine sex; in 53. 1 % in the dolicho-mesocephalicsand; in 47. 4 % in the brachycephalics. The authors insists in the variability observed in the patterns, upon taking in consideration, besides the side and sex, other parameters suchs as the cephalic index, that they are important {{in the face of the}} evident heterogeneity of our indoamerican population...|$|E
