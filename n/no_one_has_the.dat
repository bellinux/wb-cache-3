Soon the gods arrive and ask Wong to find them shelter for the night. They are tired, having travelled far and wide in search of good people who still live according to the principles that they, the gods, have handed down. Instead they have found only greed, evil, dishonesty, and selfishness. The same turns out to be true in Szechwan: no one will take them in, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> time or means to care for others – no one except the poor young prostitute Shen Teh, whose pure inherent charity cannot allow her to turn away anyone in need. Shen Teh was going to see a customer, but decides to help out instead; however confusion follows leaving Wang fleeing from the illustrious Ones, leaving his water carrying pole behind.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{wrote that}} prior to Nirvana, [...] "alternative music was {{consigned}} to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off". Following the release of Nevermind, [...] "nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse". The success of Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established [...] "the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general". While other alternative bands had hits before, Nirvana [...] "broke down the doors forever", according to Erlewine. Erlewine further stated that Nirvana's breakthrough [...] "didn't eliminate the underground", but rather [...] "just gave it more exposure". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported that Nirvana's breakthrough had made others in the alternative scene impatient for achieving similar success, noting, [...] "Suddenly, all bets are off. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock groups {{had been replaced by}} the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.|$|E
500|$|Nevermind {{not only}} popularized the Seattle grunge {{movement}} but also brought alternative rock {{as a whole}} into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Neverminds success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: [...] "It was like our record {{could have been a}} hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. [...] It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did". Karen Schoemer of the New York Times added that [...] "What's unusual about Nirvana's [...] "Nevermind" [...] is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the group's debut album." [...] In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that {{in the aftermath of the}} album's breakthrough, [...] "Suddenly, all bets are off. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions".

2500|$|On 30 April 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Ahmadinejad's {{economic}} policy {{and said the}} West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a [...] "crisis" [...] spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. The Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has crippled {{the world has been}} unprecedented in the past 60 years. [...] "This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true", he said. Khamenei emphasized that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> right to blame the Iranian government for Iran's economic problems.

2500|$|Rowan Moore of The Guardian {{questioned}} if it {{was going}} to be anything more than a folly, or whether it would be as eloquent as the Statue of Liberty. He speculated that the project might mark the time when society stops using large iconic projects as a tool for lifting areas out of deprivation. He questioned its ability to draw people's attention to Stratford after the Games, in a similar manner to the successes of the Angel of the North or the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. He also questioned the piece's ability to strike a chord like the Angel, which he believed had at least [...] "created a feelgood factor and sense of pride" [...] in Gateshead, or whether it would simply become one of the [...] "many more unloved rotting wrecks that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> nerve to demolish".

2500|$|In May 2011, Supreme Court Justice Yoram Danziger granted Katsav's {{motion to}} delay his {{entrance}} to prison until the Supreme Court heard his appeal. Deliberations on the appeal began on 7 August 2011, and {{were conducted by}} a three-judge panel consisting of Justices Edna Arbel, Miriam Naor, and Salim Joubran. Katsav's attorney suggested that his client actually was sexually involved {{with one of the}} alleged victims, but that no rape occurred. He also suggested that the plaintiffs' testimonies were filled with contradictions. When deliberations resumed on 10 August, Katzav's attorney suggested that his client's actions did not constitute anything beyond [...] "an ordinary hug". Deliberations on the appeal adjourned on 11 August. The court delivered its opinion on 10 November, unanimously upholding Katsav's conviction and sentence. The three-judge panel stated that they refrained from assessing the truth of the statements made by the accusers and otherwise rejected possibly exculpatory evidence. Justice Salim Joubran stated that Katsav [...] "fell from the loftiest heights to the deepest depths. Such a senior official should be a role model to his subordinates. Every woman has a right to her own body. A right to dignity. A right to freedom. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> liberty to take any of those from her".
