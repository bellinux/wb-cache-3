40|$|Quick {{tracking}} in <b>nano-manipulation</b> {{has been}} attracting increasing attention among scientific researchers and engineers {{because it can}} significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>nano-manipulation.</b> The main reasons that hinder the improvement of accuracy and efficiency of <b>nano-manipulation</b> are the lack of effective real-time tracking and unavoidable perturbations by uncertainties and nonlinearities in the manipulation system. In this paper, we present a new strategy based on compressive sensing to realize quick real-time tracking <b>nano-manipulation</b> trajectory, and build a new kinematic model for objects to be manipulated to overcome the effect of tip positioning and contacting biases on <b>nano-manipulation</b> with AFM. With this approach, the deviation of the object from the predesigned trajectory during the manipulation can be corrected with up to two-thirds of time less than the traditional method, and the object can be smoothly moved to any destination in the nano-space. The approach requires no priori knowledge about the system, environment, and objects being manipulated.

On the basis of the obtained model, an inversion-based technique is adopted to design a compensator for the hysteresis of the piezo-scanner.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Forming a {{complete}} understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern friction on the nanometer and atomic scales is an ongoing endeavor for scientists from various disciplines. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{has proven to be}} invaluable for the detailed study of nano-scale frictional properties associated with various surfaces, issues related to the precise characterization of the contact formed by the probe tip and the sample surface remain largely unsolved. In recent years, an alternative approach to nanotribology experiments has involved the lateral manipulation of well-characterized nanoparticles on sample surfaces via AFM and the measurement of associated frictional forces. In line with this idea, ambient-condition structural/nanotribological characterization and <b>nano-manipulation</b> experiments involving gold nanoparticles (AuNP) thermally deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are presented in this thesis. The effect of deposition amount on thin film morphology is discussed and post- deposition annealing procedure in terms of different annealing temperatures and times are tackled in order to characterize AuNP formation on HOPG. The morphology and distribution of AuNPs on HOPG are studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the confirmation of AuNP crystallinity via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also described. Topographical characterization of the resulting AuNP/HOPG material system performed via contact-mode AFM is demonstrated. Lateral force measurements are also presented, in terms of the dependence of friction force on normal load as well as the dependence of friction force increase at AuNP edges on normal load and particle height. Subsequent to comprehensive structural and frictional characterization, the results of <b>nano-manipulation</b> experiments performed on AuNPs on the HOPG substrate are reported and it is observed that AuNPs experience remarkably low frictional forces during sliding. A detailed study of friction with respect to contact area firmly confirms the occurrence of structurally lubric sliding under ambient conditions for this material system.

40|$|Since the {{demonstration}} of super-low friction (superlubricity) in graphite at nanoscale, {{one of the main}} challenges in the field of nano- and micro-mechanics was to scale this phenomenon up. A key question to be addressed is to what extent superlubricity could persist, and what mechanisms could lead to its failure. Here, using an edge-driven Frenkel-Kontorova model, we establish a connection between the critical length above which superlubricity disappears and both intrinsic material properties and experimental parameters. A striking boost in dissipated energy with chain length emerges abruptly due to a high-friction stick-slip mechanism caused by deformation of the slider leading to a local commensuration with the substrate lattice. We derived a parameter-free analytical model for the critical length that is in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.

Because of the influence of the tip morphology on the tip pushing direction, it is difficult to establish an effective operating model for stably manipulating nanoparticles with controllable manipulation results. To resolve this problem, the acting force of manipulating the nano-particle is analyzed firstly based on the least action principle. Then the influence of the contact point between the nano-particle and the tip is taken into account on the pushing direction, and manipulation of the nano-particle is modeled to predict its position after manipulation.

Under controlled conditions and correct calibration, AFM provides researchers {{with the ability to}} accurately observe and manipulate matter on the micro- and nano-scale.

The optical lever method, a common displacement measurement technique employed in AFM, calculates probe displacement based on a calibration that assumes a consistent response profile throughout operation. Off-resonance excitation and tip-sample interaction forces during intermittent contact mode AFM can alter this response profile. Standard tapping-mode operation at the fundamental frequency is observed to be robust to changes in effective stiffness, maintaining accurate measurements for all laser spot positions considered. A nominal laser spot position between Xp = 0. 5 and 0. 6 is determined to most accurately predict displacement for off-resonance excitation during both free response and intermittent contact condit ions.

Switched systems are those governed by differential equations, which undergo vector field switching due to sudden changes in model characteristics. Such systems arise in many {{applications such as}} mechanical systems with contacts, electrical systems with switches, and thermal-fluidic systems with valves and phase changes. The presented controllers guarantee system stability, under typical adaptive control assumptions, for systems with piecewise differentiable bounded parameters and piecewise continuous disturbances without requiring a priori knowledge on such parameters or disturbances. The effect of plant variation and switching is reduced to piecewise continuous and impulsive inputs acting on a Bounded Input Bounded State (BIBS) stable closed loop system. This, in turn, provides a separation between the robust stability and robust performance control problems.

40|$|Since {{the early}} work by Ashkin in 1970, optical {{trapping}} {{has become one}} of the most powerful tools for manipulating small particles, such as micron sized beads or single atoms. The optical trapping mechanism is based on the interaction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In atom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed optical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic particles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two different regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any direct link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one being the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other one being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum optics. Here we show that for nanoscale diamond crystals containing artificial atoms, so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers, both regimes of optical trapping can be observed at the same time even in a noisy liquid environment. For wavelengths in the vicinity of the zero-phonon line transition of the color centers, we observe a significant modification (10 %) of the overall trapping strength. Most remarkably, our experimental findings suggest that owing to the large number of artificial atoms, collective effects greatly contribute to the observed trapping strength modification.

40|$|Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) {{has been}} used to {{manipulate}} nano-objects for more than a decade. However, it is still in the infant stage to serve as a manufacturing tool for fabrication of nanodevices. The major hindrance is the low efficiency due to the absence of visual feedback, positioning errors, and losing objects during manipulation. The lack of visual feedback can be solved by integrating an augmented reality interface into an AFM based nano-robotic system. Through the augmented reality interface, the operator can manipulate the nano-objects and simultaneously observe the real-time changes of the nanoenvironment. Position errors caused by thermal drift and nonlinearity of piezoactuators often lead the AFM tip to a wrong position and in turn miss the nano-objects. Due to the small touching area between AFM tip and the object, the tip often slips over or slips aside the nano-object during manipulation. All these problems can be solved by introducing a local scan mechanism to the AFM based robotic system. The local scan strategies will improve the reliability of the visual feedback, therefore, significantly improve the efficiency of AFM based <b>nano-manipulation.</b> In this paper, the augmented reality interface is briefly introduced. And then the local scan strategies are proposed to eliminate the positioning errors, relocate the actual position of nanoobjects, and find back the nano-objects if they are lost during manipulation.

40|$|Within this thesis, many {{building}} blocks {{that are necessary}} to fabricate nano-scale biotechnology devices are examined. In this rapidly expanding field, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been identified as a key component. In particular, the biomedical applications of CNTs functionalised with DNA or RNA, utilising dielectrophoresis as a nano-manipulating tool, is investigated. The use of RNA and RNase A to generate chemically unmodified and pure single walled CNTs in a simple two step procedure is described. RNA is shown to efficiently wrap and solubilise CNTs while RNase effectively strips the RNA from the CNT, providing a convenient purification technique. The mechanism of binding of DNA to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is shown to be much more efficient when the DNA is single-stranded rather than a double-stranded helix, while parameters (e. g. pH) are optimised for the most efficient CNT solubilisation with RNA. The compatibility of RNA-CNT composites with mammalian cells in tissue culture is also investigated. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy show it is highly likely that RNA-CNTs composites are internalised into mammalian cells, while laser heating did not effectively kill cells. This is presumably because the power was too low or not enough CNTs were internalised in the cells. DNA-CNT composites are used to electrically sense the binding of biomolecules which have been trapped between micro-electrodes by dielectrophoresis. In a fluid cell, it is shown that solutions affect the flow of current through the CNTs, as an ionic solution increases the resistance in relation to deionised water, whereas with no CNTs, the opposite is true. Moreover, a rise in the resistance is also seen as proteins bind to CNTs. The <b>nano-manipulation</b> of DNA was studied with dielectrophoresis. It is shown that poly(dG) -poly(dC) (GC) collects at higher frequencies than poly(dA) -poly(dT) (AT) indicating that GC is a better conductor than AT. It was also found that different lengths of DNA polarise at about the same frequency, while shorter lengths need a higher field intensity to trap them...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} self-assembled growth of Ag 2 Ga nano-needles on batch {{fabricated}} micro-grippers are reported. The room temperature growth of Ag 2 Ga nano-needles have been recently developed as stylus for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Integration of such nano-needles onto batch fabricated micro-grippers can potentially {{lead to the}} development of nano-grippers for <b>nano-manipulation</b> of materials, measurement of electrical properties of nanostructures and finally measurement of electrochemical properties of cells. We explored the growth process of nano-needles on batch fabricated microgrippers. Micro-grippers were first batch fabricated using carbon nanotube/SU 8 process at the University of Louisville 2 ̆ 7 s clean room facility. Following the gripper fabrication, 20 nm chromium and 100 nm silver were selectively deposited onto the arms of the grippers using shadow masking techniques. Each silver coated arm was selectively dipped onto liquid gallium and retracted for the formation of Ag 2 Ga eutectic nano-needles at room temperature in ambient environment. The length and diameter of nano-needles can be controlled by the thickness of silver and volume of gallium liquid. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) characterization revealed nano-needles of 100 - 120 nm in diameter and 7 - 15 µm long on each gripper. Following the nano-needle growth on the grippers, the grippers were packaged onto a ceramic chip carrier and wire bonded. Following wire bonding, 100 nm of parylene was coated everywhere besides the surface of gripper/needles to enable electrical insulation in liquid environments, and then the tips of nano-needles are exposed. I-V measurements revealed an open circuit resistance of 120 Giga-ohms showing the versatility of the grippers integrated with the needles as electrodes for measurement of electrical properties of nano-materials and in liquids. Preliminary measurements on a small carbon nanotube film when brought into contact with the needle revealed six to eight orders of magnitude change in the resistance showing that these needles are highly sensitive for electrical property measurement on nano-materials. Finally, the needles were tested inside phosphate buffered saline and performed linear sweep voltammetry to investigate reduction-oxidation reactions {{on the surface of the}} nano-needle...|$|E
