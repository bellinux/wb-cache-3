On October 2, 2003, Valve CEO Gabe Newell publicly explained in the Halflife2.net (now ValveTime.net) forums the events that Valve experienced around the time of the leak, and requested users to track down the perpetrators if possible.|$|E

In this paper we reveal important observations of academic search queries, and provide an algorithmic solution to address a type of failure during search sessions: null queries. We start by providing a general characterization of academic search queries, by analyzing a large-scale transaction log of a leading academic search engine. Unlike previous small-scale analyses of academic search queries, we find important differences with query characteristics known from web search. E. g., in academic search there is a substantially bigger proportion of entity queries, and a heavier tail in query length distribution. We then focus on search failures and, in particular, on null queries that lead to an empty search engine result page, on <b>null</b> <b>sessions</b> that contain such null queries, and on users who are prone to issue null queries. In academic search approximately 1 in 10 queries is a null query, and 25 % of the <b>sessions</b> contain a <b>null</b> query. They appear in different types of search sessions, and prevent users from achieving their search goal. To address the high rate of null queries in academic search, we consider the task of providing query suggestions. Specifically we focus on a highly frequent query type: non-boolean informational queries. To this end we need to overcome query sparsity and make effective use of session information. We find that using entities helps to surface more relevant query suggestions in the face of query sparsity. We also find that query suggestions should be conditioned on the type of session in which they are offered to be more effective. After casting the session classification problem as a multi-label classification problem, we generate session-conditional query suggestions based on predicted session type. We find that this session-conditional method leads to significant improvements over a generic query suggestion method. Personalization yields very little further improvements over session-conditional query suggestions...|$|R

This is the so-called <b>null</b> <b>session</b> connection, which allows unauthenticated users.The basic syntax for connecting anonymously is:net use \\IP address\IPC$ [...] "" [...] /u:""For example, typing at the command prompt:net use \\192.168.1.101\IPC$ [...] "" [...] /u:""attempts to connect to the share IPC$ of the network 192.168.1.101 as an anonymous user with blank password.

This would provide a hacker with a lot of information about a remote user.|$|E
