5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all <b>non-residents</b> entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from <b>non-residents</b> could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} {{the factors that influence}} the <b>non‐resident</b> enrollment percentage for public and private institutes of higher education (IHEs). We find a significant positive correlation between the enrollment percentage and tuition for private IHEs and no significance for public IHEs. Further investigation reveals that the highest‐priced public and private IHEs generally attract the highest percentage of <b>non‐resident</b> students. This suggests that the more costly IHEs, especially private, may enjoy a special cache that allows them more latitude in setting <b>non‐resident</b> tuition. The <b>non‐resident</b> enrollment percentage is not appreciably different across a wide range of tuition levels for both IHE types, indicating that these IHEs might be able to maintain their <b>non‐resident</b> enrollment percentage levels with marginal tuition increases. <b>Non‐resident</b> enrollment, <b>non‐resident</b> tuition, higher education, tuition pricing,...|$|R

The station's opening continued the trend of development, and Pulaski station was credited with boosting business in Archer Heights and doubling property values in the neighborhood. The station also created a parking problem in the neighborhood. The station's parking lot filled up as early as 7 A.M. most workdays, causing commuters to park on residential streets. The commuters prompted local residents to ban <b>non-residents</b> from parking on certain streets during daytime hours.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND With the {{diffusion}} of marital instability, {{the number of children}} who spend some of their childhood without one of their parents has become significant, even in Italy. Therefore, given the importance of parent-child interactions for children’s wellbeing, analyzing children’s contact with the <b>non-resident</b> parent has become relevant. OBJECTIVE In this paper we consider the frequency of contact between children and their <b>non-resident</b> parent after separation, with a double aim: a) to analyze if and how the <b>non-resident</b> parent’s contact with his/her children varies according to whether the (resident or <b>non-resident)</b> parent has repartnered, and b) to investigate whether the relationship between repartnering and contact differs according to the gender of the <b>non-resident</b> parent. METHODS The study focuses on children aged 0 - 17 living with only one biological parent, using data pooled together from two cross-sectional rounds of the Italian survey, Family and Social Subjects. RESULTS Results show that parents’ repartnering is positively associated with lower <b>non-resident</b> parent-child contact only in the case of <b>non-resident</b> fathers; {{in the case of a}} <b>non-resident</b> mother, her repartnering is actually correlated with higher contact...|$|R
5|$|The {{settlement}} was expanded by {{the construction of}} trenches bordering a second adjoining space to the northeast with two additional access points named Ampanidinamporona and Ambavahaditsiombiomby, the latter a natural gateway formed by two boulders. This latter entrance was most likely used to access the space even before the formal establishment of a royal city there, and is therefore considered by archaeologists to be the oldest gateway at the site. After {{the establishment of the}} rova, this entrance was reserved for use by the sovereign, a reflection of the spiritual significance of the northeastern direction and its association with the ancestors, whose benediction and hasina provided the basis for the sovereign's power and legitimacy. It was also used to bring sacrificial cattle into the compound. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then expanded toward the west to a series of natural defenses, including stony cliffs and steep forested slopes that obviated the need to dig defensive trenches, and he constructed several additional gates that he named Ambavahadimahazaza, Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina. Andrianampoinimerina expanded the trenches around the city using fanampoana labor. During his reign, a trench was dug that entirely encircles the hill, and a series of trenches was dug alongside existing ones to further protect the city against enemies. The current defensive wall was reconstructed around 1830 during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I. An estimated sixteen million egg whites were mixed with lime to produce the whitewash for the compound's exterior and interior walls. Until French colonization in 1897 and at least as early as the reign of Radama I, foreigners and <b>non-residents</b> were not allowed to enter the royal city without authorization from the sovereign.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{selected}} {{aspects of a}} recent study of <b>non-resident</b> fathers' leisure with their children. The settings and context for <b>non-resident</b> fathers' contact with their children are described and the methodology comprising interviews with eighteen <b>non-resident</b> fathers is briefly explained. The fathers who participated were a diverse group. Leisure is a vital aspect of most <b>non-resident</b> fathers' engagement with their children. Nevertheless, for <b>non-resident</b> fathers to be fully-integrated in their children's lives they need to participate in a range of everyday activities that allow them to function as parents rather than as regular visitors. Policy and legislation must better recognise the qualitative aspects of parent's engagement with their children...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the countryside facet of the <b>non-resident</b> ownership phenomenon. The utilization of spatio-temporal analysis in the research answered some of the questions that have arisen concerning the extent and trends associated with the <b>non-resident</b> ownership process. Rather than employ one of the many diverse governmental definitions based on political ethnocentrism, this study made use of a three-part <b>non-resident</b> ownership definition based more on distance and the characteristics of the Burce County agricultural subsystem. Consequently, foreigners and Canadians were equally viewed as potential <b>non-resident</b> owners. Such a breakdown revealed that Canadian, rather than foreign <b>non-resident</b> ownership, has exhibited the more significant spatio-temporal trends. An historical examination of the spatial trends derived from the 1900 to 1974 Assessment Roles in twelve townships in Bruce County revealed a <b>non-resident</b> diffusion process essentially parallel to a settlement diffusion. This “resettlement” has been controlled by specific spatial determinants. Specifically, there has been a high preference for shoreline, stream and low agricultural capability land and, conversely, a negative preference for swamp land and high capability agricultural land. This latter hypothesis was examined in terms of the spatial impact of <b>non-resident</b> ownership upon the prime land of oneof the County’s townships. The above set of explanatory hypotheses was examined vis-à-vis an ‘a priori’ construct which envisaged the <b>non-resident</b> diffusion process in Bruce County operating as two prime diffusion continuums. The continuums were defined in a North-South and West-East direction by means of a consistent “ 2375 ” <b>non-resident</b> acreage wave. The <b>non-resident</b> ownership process in Lindsay Township (Bruce County’s <b>non-resident</b> ownership diffusion “hearth”) was explained by means of the same set of hypotheses which were employed in ‘a priori’ fashion to explain the diffusion along both continuums. An ‘a posteriori’ deterministic model, based on the same set of hypotheses, contributed “micro” justification to the diffusion’s explanatory variables...|$|R

40|$|Literature and {{research}} examining child support compliance and <b>non-resident</b> fathers has primarily {{come from the}} perspective of collecting child support payments from <b>non-resident</b> fathers, most notably, those who are divorced, employed, and earning an income. Receiving limited attention in the literature has been the exclusive discussion of establishment of child support orders, which is related to child support compliance. Furthermore, literature {{and research}} examining child support compliance has given limited attention to never married, cohabitating, unemployed, underemployed, and low-income <b>non-resident</b> fathers. Building upon these limitations, this study focuses on the intra- and inter-dependent networks <b>non-resident</b> fathers utilize in fulfilling their child support obligation of establishing child support orders. Using cross-sectional data on a sample of <b>non-resident</b> fathers from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study from 1998 - 2002, this study addresses whether <b>non-resident</b> fathers' relationship with their children and former spouses or partners and involvement with extended family and friends and formal institutions are associated with the establishment of child support orders. Results of the logistic regression models indicate that <b>non-resident</b> fathers' involvement with formal institutions contributes to an increase in the establishment of child support orders. Based on these findings, it is recommended the child support enforcement system includes and integrates formal support services into the program to help <b>non-resident</b> fathers fulfill their child support obligations. <b>Non-resident</b> fathers Social networks Social capital Establishment of child support orders Child support compliance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There is {{emerging}} {{concern in the}} health literature about the impacts of <b>non-resident</b> work modes {{on the quality of}} service delivery particularly in sparsely populated or remote areas, but little is known about what <b>non-resident</b> health workers themselves see as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} their modes of work, and whether <b>non-resident</b> workers face the same or different social/personal and professional barriers to rural and remote practice as their resident colleagues. Although literature from the resources sector provides insights into the expected social/personal advantages and disadvantages, very little is said about professional issues. Methods: This article reports on semi-structured interviews conducted with seven <b>non-resident</b> nurses working in remote locations in Australia’s Northern Territory in 2011. All nurses lived outside the Northern Territory when not at work. The interviews focussed on how the separation of place of residence and place of work affected nurses’ private and professional lives. Results: Social/personal issues faced by these nurses are similar to what has been reported in the broader literature on <b>non-resident</b> work. Nurses who successfully engage in <b>non-resident</b> work develop strategies to manage their lives across multiple locations. However, questions are raised about the professional impacts of <b>non-resident</b> work, in terms of the continuing competency of the workers themselves, the performance of work teams that consist of resident and <b>non-resident</b> workers, and the maintenance of context-specific skills. Conclusions: <b>Non-resident</b> work is likely to become more common in remote areas such as Australia’s Northern Territory because of the advantages workers experience in their personal lives. There is an urgent need to address professional issues associated with <b>non-resident</b> work modes...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{instances}} of divorce, de-facto separation and non-marital childbirth in westernised states {{have led to}} growing numbers of fathers living separately from their children. In Australia these <b>non-resident</b> fathers now number approximately 400, 000. Despite increasing evidence that fathers can be central to their children's education, health and wellbeing, and that for many <b>non-resident</b> fathers contact with their children is important and highly desirable but inadequate, research on <b>non-resident</b> fathers, fatherhood and family as aspects of contemporary western society is lacking. In particular, few investigators have explored the qualitative dimensions of <b>non-resident</b> parent-child contact {{and the role of}} leisure within this. This paper establishes parameters for future investigation into the levels, nature, meanings and impacts of leisure involving <b>non-resident</b> fathers and their children. Drawing on an international literature and with particular emphasis on the Australian context, it critically analyses the context of <b>non-resident</b> fathers' leisure with their children. It examines the problematic terms of 'father' and 'non-resident father', describes the models of contact that occur between <b>non-resident</b> fathers and their children, and summarises the factors affecting that contact. The paper then turns to research into family and leisure, drawing attention to the salience of leisure in <b>non-resident</b> parenting while also highlighting the lack of substantive research into this area. Particular attention is paid to the trivialising of 'leisure' as a parenting activity in this context, and the underplaying of the positive qualities that leisure-based interaction may contribute. The paper concludes by suggesting initial directions for research into the role of leisure within the relationship that <b>non-resident</b> parents have with their children...|$|R
