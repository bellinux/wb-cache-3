5|$|Placing the {{elements}} into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is {{a spectrum of}} properties within each category and it is <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> overlaps at the boundaries, {{as is the case}} with most classification schemes. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of {{the elements}} into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works is <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, {{has said that}} “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work {{as a violation of}} the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E

2500|$|Skepticism {{had existed}} even before Yamano's blog post. [...] The National Archive wrote in {{warning that the}} Archives version of the {{photograph}} {{did not have a}} date. [...] Dorothy Cochrane, a curator at the aeronautics department of the National Air and Space Museum, called the new evidence merely a [...] "blurry photograph" [...] and cited the existing evidence from radio transmissions that suggested that the Electra was at least close to Howland Island, 800 miles away from the Marshall Islands. [...] Author Fukiko Aoki, who researched and wrote a 1982 book, Looking for Amelia, was similarly critical before the revelations from Yamano. [...] Aoki located an elderly officer, part of the 1937 crew of the Kōshū Maru, who denied the ship's involvement. [...] Aoki subsequently researched the Kōshū Maru ship log which showed it as having been 1,500 miles away at the time of Earhart's disappearance. [...] It was also argued that to reach and somehow land on the remote atoll where she purportedly crashed would have required Earhart, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest. [...] Additionally, had Japanese officials found Earhart, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue and return her considering her fame. [...] The claims of a U.S. government cover-up also came under criticism; the documentary prominently mentions [...] "a report dated January 7, 1939 that Earhart was a prisoner in the Marshall Islands." [...] TIGHAR, a group that advocates the Gardner Island hypothesis of the disappearance, investigated the 1939 government report, which was <b>not</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> and found that it was a report on an obvious prankan implausible tale found in France from someone who did not identify themselves. [...] The message told of being kidnapped by the Japanese, having his crew killed, finding Earhart in custody, then being sent to Europe on an unnamed Japanese ship. [...] TIGHAR wrote that the photo was [...] "neither lost nor evidence" [...] and that the picture had been [...] "exactly where it should be, and was exactly what it was labeled to be, a picture of Jaluit Harbor," [...] criticizing the [...] "lost and misfiled photo" [...] element of The Lost Evidence as well.|$|E

Now my belief is that the Italians seldom do this to the English, as far as Napoleon is concerned.

Robinson and Sir Evelyn Wood in language as strong as the formal terms of a report will allow, were acts contrary to the rules of civilised warfare.
