50|$|In some countries, {{especially}} those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in water softener that removes calcium and magnesium ions from the water. Dishwasher salt, which is coarse-grained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to recharge the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit; unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> insoluble anticaking agents or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. Anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> iodine {{in the form of}} sodium iodide or potassium iodide. These compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system, but adding table salt to the dishwasher's water softening unit can damage it.|$|R

The homeopathic treatment consisted of Echinacea angustifolia, Avena sativa, Ignatia amara, Calcarea carbonica, all 6 cH. Piglets were weighed daily for weight gain or loss, and observed for diarrhea and feed intake. Results: Animals receiving sucrose saline alone and sucrose saline with homeopathy had less weight loss than control (p = 0. 017, p = 0. 0001 respectively). There was no statistical difference in relation to overall incidence of diarrhea or food consumption.

40|$|The present article {{describes}} {{the second part of}} a study investigating the effect of adding vegetables on the nutritional, physico-chemical, and oxidative properties of wheat bread, and specifically focuses on bread that does <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> oil as an added ingredient. Wheat flour breads fortified with freeze-dried carrot, tomato, beetroot or broccoli were developed and assessed for their nutritional composition, antioxidant potential, oxidative stability, and storage properties. Using a simulated in vitro model, the study also examined the impact of vegetable addition on the oxidative stability of macronutrients during gastro-intestinal digestion. Adding vegetables improved the nutritional and functional attributes of the oil-free breads. However, they demonstrated a lower antioxidant potential compared to their oil-containing counterparts. Similarly, the textural and storage properties of the oil-free vegetable breads were poorer compared to the oil-containing breads. As expected, in the absence of oil the oil-free breads were associated with lower lipid oxidation both in their fresh form and during gastro-intestinal digestion. Adding vegetables reduced protein oxidation in the fresh oil-free breads but had no effect during gastro-intestinal digestion. The impact of vegetables on macronutrient oxidation in the oil-free breads during digestion appears to be vegetable-specific with broccoli exacerbating it and the others having no effect. Of the evaluated vegetables, beetroot showed the most promising nutritional and physico-chemical benefits when incorporated into bread that does <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> oil...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Protein {{substitutes}} (PS) are {{an essential}} component in the dietary management of phenylketonuria (PKU). PS are available as phenylalanine-free amino-acid mixtures (AAM), glycomacropeptide-based PS (GMP) and large neutral amino acids (LNAA). There {{is a lack of}} information regarding their availability in different countries and comparison of their nutritional composition is limited. The objectives of this study were to identify the number of PS available in different European countries and Turkey and to compare their nutritional composition. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Members of the European Nutritionist Expert Panel on PKU (ENEP) (Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Denmark and Turkey) provided data on PS available in each country. The nutritional composition of PS available in Portugal was analyzed. RESULTS: The number of PS available in each country varied from 30 (Turkey) to 105 (Germany), with a median of 64. GMP was available only in Portugal, whereas LNAA was an option in Portugal, Italy, Turkey and Denmark. Some PS were designed for weaning. Many PS did <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> fat and fiber. GMP contained the highest carbohydrate (CHO) and energy content as well as higher LNAA content compared with AAM. Only one AAM <b>contained</b> <b>added</b> fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides. AAM designed for the first year of life had the highest CHO, fat and LNAA contribution. Liquid AAM had lower CHO and fat contents compared with powdered AAM, but contained higher LNAA. CONCLUSIONS: There was widely dissimilar numbers of PS available in different countries. Nutritional composition of different PS was variable and should be considered before prescription...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{synergism}} between adrenaline (epinephrine) and low concentrations of thrombin in gel-filtered human platelets prelabelled with [32 P]Pi. Suspensions of platelets, which did <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> fibrinogen, were incubated at 37 degrees C to measure {{changes in the}} levels of 32 P-labelled phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2), phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidate (PA), aggregation and dense-granule secretion after stimulation. Adrenaline alone (3. 5 - 4. 0 microM) did not cause a change in any parameter (phosphoinositide metabolism, aggregation and dense-granule secretion), but markedly enhanced the thrombin-induced responses over a narrow range of thrombin concentrations (0. 03 - 0. 08 units/ml). The thrombin-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids by phospholipase C, which was measured as the formation of [32 P]PA, was potentiated by adrenaline, as was {{the increase in the}} levels of [32 P]PIP 2 and [32 P]PIP. The presence of adrenaline caused a shift to the left for the thrombin-induced changes in the phosphoinositide metabolism, without affecting the maximal levels of 32 P-labelled compounds obtained. A similar shift by adrenaline in the dose-response relationship was previously demonstrated for thrombin-induced aggregation and dense-granule secretion. Also, the narrow range of concentrations of thrombin over which adrenaline potentiates thrombin-induced platelet responses is the same for changes in phosphoinositide metabolism and physiological responses (aggregation and dense-granule secretion). Our observations clearly indicate that adrenaline directly or indirectly influences thrombin-induced changes in phosphoinositide metabolism...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{source of}} {{infection}} is rarely identified for sporadic cases of Legionnaires' disease. We found that professional drivers are five times more commonly represented among community acquired sporadic cases in England and Wales than expected. We therefore investigated possible risk exposures in relation to driving or spending time in a motor vehicle. A case control study including all surviving community acquired sporadic cases in England and Wales with onset between 12 July 2008 and 9 March 2009 was carried out. Cases were contacted by phone and controls were consecutively recruited by sequential digital dialling matched by area code, sex and age group. Those who consented were sent a questionnaire asking questions on driving habits, potential sources in vehicles and known risk factors. The results were analysed using logistic regression.   75 cases and 67 controls {{were included in the}} study. Multivariable analysis identified two exposures linked to vehicle use associated with an increased risk of Legionnaires' disease: Driving through industrial areas (OR 7. 2, 95 %CI 1. 5 - 33. 7) and driving or being a passenger in a vehicle with windscreen wiper fluid <b>not</b> <b>containing</b> <b>added</b> screenwash (OR 47. 2, 95 %CI 3. 7 - 603. 6). Not adding screenwash to windscreen wiper fluid is a previously unidentified risk factor and appears to be strongly associated with community acquired sporadic cases of Legionnaires' disease. We estimated that around 20 % of community acquired sporadic cases could be attributed to this exposure. A simple recommendation to use screenwash may mitigate transmission of bacteria to drivers and passengers...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has not only}} questioned the necessity of iron supplementation in human milk substitutes prior to weaning, but also suggested some potential adverse effects. This study investigated the hypothesis that infant formula need <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> iron in the � rst 3 mo. Healthy term infants were recruited into a double-blind controlled trial and randomized to receive either a new no added iron formula (New; < 0. 1 mg Fe 100 ml¡ 1) or a standard formula (Standard; 0. 5 mg Fe 100 ml¡ 1) for the � rst 3 mo of life. A breastfed reference group was also studied. Iron status was assessed at 3 and 12 mo from heel-prick capillary blood samples evaluated by full blood-count analysis, including reticulocytes and serum ferritin. In total, 149 infants were entered (51 New, 49 Standard, 49 breastfed) with no {{differences between the groups}} in gender distribution, birthweight, gestation or numbers completing the study. There were no signi� cant differences between the principal outcome measures: mean values for haemoglobin, mean cell volume and ferritin, between the two formula-fed groups, and the proportion with a haemoglobin level < 11 g dl¡ 1 or ferritin < 10 mg l¡ 1 did not differ. Conclusion: The use of a “no added iron” infant formula in place of an iron-forti� ed formula during the � rst 3 mo of life did not clinically affect iron status at 3 and 12 mo of age. The universal supplementation of formulae with iron during this initial period needs further consideration...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} to assist people making a submission to the Productivity Commission 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry into the import of processed fruit products. About the inquiry On 21 June 2013, the Australian Government asked the Commission to inquire into whether safeguard action under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is justified against imports of selected processed fruit products falling within subheading 2008 of the Australian Customs Tariff. The subheading is defined as: Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise prepared or preserved, whether or <b>not</b> <b>containing</b> <b>added</b> sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included. As specified {{in the terms of}} reference, the inquiry covers products under the following tariff classifications: 	 2008. 30. 00 (citrus) 	 2008. 40. 00 (pears) 	 2008. 50. 00 (apricots) 	 2008. 70. 00 (peaches) 	 2008. 97. 00 (mixtures) 	 2008. 99. 00 (other). The terms of reference are reprinted {{at the beginning of this}} report. Safeguard action is temporary, ‘emergency action’ (using tariffs, tariff-quotas or quotas) implemented in situations where a surge of imports causes or threatens to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. Safeguard measures may be applied for up to four years, and may be extended for a further four years, subject to several conditions. The Commission is to provide a report to the Australian Government by 20 December 2013 on whether safeguard measures are justified. In addition, the Commission is to provide an ‘accelerated report’ by 20 September 2013, as to whether provisional safeguard measures should be put in place...|$|R

Food and Drug Administration {{does not}} define the term “all-natural ” but {{says that it}} may refer to any food product that does <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> color, {{artificial}} flavors, or synthetic substances. Additionally, labeling is not presently standardized for genetically modified (GM) food in the U. S. Yet, there is an increasing interest from the public {{to know exactly what}} they are eating; for instance, Prop 37 in California, which would have required retailers to label products made with GM foods, barely lost this fall with 47 % of voters favoring it. Many people assume that the definition for “all-natural ” is quite strict, including the implication that it is similar to the term “organic”, and therefore genetic modification has not occurred. To determine whether or not foods labeled “all-natural ” match this assumption, a variety of corn products with this label (n= 18) have been assayed through standard methods that extract DNA and look for the presence of specific markers indicative of genetic modification (using PCR and electrophoresis). Prior work in this lab indicated that at least 60 % (n= 61) of all U. S. corn products not labeled as “organic ” have been genetically modified (only 3 % of products labeled “organic ” have tested positive). Preliminary data on those labeled “all-natural ” indicate a similar percent of modification, with 54 % of the samples testing positive. Additional samples are being assayed in an effort to gain a clearer picture of the percentage of GM products in the U. S. market place.
