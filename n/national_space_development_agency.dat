50|$|As Chief of Air Staff Badeh {{initiated}} Optimizing Local Engineering (OLE 1 and 2) {{to focus}} on developing indigenous Unarmed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and other weapon systems. The OLE teams consisted of Nigerian Air Force officers with PhDs and master's degrees in various fields of aerospace design, avionic and armament specializations from the Cranfield University in the UK. OLE 1 and 2 resulted {{in the production of}} the AMEBO project (aka GULMA 1 UAV) which allowed the Air Force survey and carry out attacks remotely without putting the lives of pilots at risk and this was the 1st locally produced drone in Nigeria. Badeh ensured UAV pilots were trained locally to promote local content and save the nation huge resources that would have been spent conducting same training abroad. The Nigerian trained UAV pilots have been resourceful in the ongoing war against terror in the North East of Nigeria. He encouraged aggressive R &D programs in all NAF units, which led to the first NAF R&D exhibition in Abuja drawing participants from Nigerian universities and research institutes. NAF subsequently signed MOUs with some of the institutions to offer impetus to NAF’s R&D efforts. Some of the universities are University of Benin, University of Ibadan, University of Lagos, Covenant University, Ota; Federal University of Technology, Minna; Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and Yaba College of Technology.

40|$|The Ground/Orbiter Lasercomm Demonstration (GOLD) is a {{demonstration}} of optical communications between the Japanese Engineering Test Satellite (ETS-VI) and an optical ground transmitting and receiving station at the Table Mountain Facility in Wrightwood, California. Laser transmissions to the satellite are performed for approximately 4 hours every third night when the satellite is at apogee above Table Mountain. The experiment requires the coordination of resources at the Communications Research Laboratory (CRL), JPL, the <b>National</b> Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Agency</b> (NASDA) Tsukuba tracking station, and NASA's Deep Space Network at Goldstone, California, to generate and transmit real-time commands and receive telemetry from the ETS-VI. Transmissions to the ETS-VI began in November 1995 and are scheduled to last {{into the middle of}} January 1996, when the satellite is expected to be eclipsed by the Earth's shadow for a major part of its orbit. The eclipse is expected to last for about 2 months, and during this period there will be limited electrical power available on board the satellite. NASDA plans to restrict experiments with the ETS-VI during this period, and no laser transmissions are planned. Posteclipse experiments are currently being negotiated. GOLD is a joint NASA-CRL experiment that is being conducted by JPL in coordination with CRL and NASDA...|$|R

We examine {{the status and}} limitations of CWM as a viable tool that freely contributes towards using globally assessed and free Web Mapping Platforms (WMPs) such as Google Maps, Google Earth, OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps and Yahoo!

Here we use Google Map Maker Web 2. 0 to conduct an experimental mapping analysis using 50 volunteered staff drawn from different departments of the <b>National</b> <b>Space</b> Research and <b>Development</b> <b>Agency</b> (NASRDA) and the Centre for Satellite Technology Development (CSTD) in Abuja, Nigeria. We find that Geographic Information (GI) experts are faster at data integration, while the reverse {{is the case for}} non-GI experts due to limited knowledge of geo-spatial data management. We then describe how Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) revealed that all participants are willing to optimistically contribute towards a global map by using a free web mapping medium. Finally, we explain that limitations to the advancement of integrating Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in most developing countries like Nigeria include poor knowledge of geo-spatial data and analytical methods, unstable electric power supply, slow but high-cost Internet facilities, inadequate computer systems and lack of personal volunteerism...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{countries}} with more or less comprehensive <b>national</b> <b>space</b> legislation addressing in particular the authorization and supervision of private space activities continues to grow, and several more countries are currently {{in the process of}} adding themselves to that list. One of the more recent and most interesting ones among them is Nigeria, as the second African country after South Africa and—after Brazil—the second leading spacefaring nation from the developing world, to draft, further to a fairly recently established succinct framework law, a set of regulations addressing precisely those issues. The paper briefly recaps the underlying international obligations, in particular as following from Articles VI, VII, and VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, the Liability Convention, and the Registration Convention, Nigeria being a party to all three. It then proceeds to analyze the 2010 <b>National</b> <b>Space</b> Research and <b>Development</b> <b>Agency</b> Act and the 2015 draft Regulations on the Licensing and Supervision of Space Activities from the above perspective. It will compare the Nigerian legislation as needed or helpful with other <b>national</b> <b>space</b> laws already pronounced on those issues, and in doing so will take Nigeria’s role as leading African nation in outer space in this respect into consideration. This will finally allow for some conclusions as to the contribution to the further development of (international and <b>national)</b> <b>space</b> law represented by these Nigerian legislative efforts...|$|R
