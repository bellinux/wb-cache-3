5|$|On August 26, 1940, {{a preview}} of the highway was {{organized}} by commission chairman Jones. It began the previous <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> banquet at The Hotel Hershey and proceeded west along the turnpike, stopping at the Clear Ridge cut before lunch at the Midway service plaza. The preview ended with dinner and entertainment at the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh. That month, a military motorcade traveled portions of the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|When Dexter visits Rita {{the next}} morning, Gail—who {{suspects}} {{that he is}} hiding something—announces {{that she will be}} staying in Miami and will live with Rita. Dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets, so he begins by cleaning his boat that <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> black light to detect any blood. He is unaware that the marina is being videotaped by the Miami-Metro Police, who believe that the Bay Harbor Butcher may be keeping his boat at that marina.|$|E
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly at <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong and direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea {{on a broad}} front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E

5|$|Failing {{to reach}} their initial {{destination}} of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away {{in the middle of}} the <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.|$|E
5|$|Flowering {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at <b>night,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008 {{the band}} also {{announced}} that for their 30th anniversary in 2009, {{they would be}} staging a fifth Madstock festival in London's Victoria Park on 17 July 11 years after the last Madstock concert. It was originally rumoured that the newly reformed The Specials would make an appearance after finishing their reunion tour. However, this did not occur, although original Specials keyboardist Jerry Dammers – who {{was not part of}} the reunion line-up – was announced as a support act with The Spatial AKA Orchestra shortly before the festival. Dammers would support Madness again during their 2009 Christmas tour, when he opened each <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> DJ set.|$|E

5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a <b>night,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> peak between midnight and 3am.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2010, Phaneuf {{made his}} Toronto Maple Leaf debut, leading all Maple Leafs players in time on ice and ended the <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fight and given second {{star of the}} game honours. He would record his first point, an assist, four nights later {{in a game against}} the Ottawa Senators and scored his first goal as a Leaf on April 7, 2010, on Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers. Phaneuf was named an {{alternate}} captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs Head Coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a positive change in the mood in the Toronto dressing room.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} spotlight shone {{briefly on}} Feldman on August 16, 2006, when he sparked a violent bench-clearing brawl {{in the ninth}} inning of a game between the Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Tensions between the two division rivals were already high after two Ranger starting pitchers — Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla — had been ejected in previous games that month for throwing at Angel hitters, along with Texas manager Buck Showalter. Before Feldman took the mound in relief, on a <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> game-time temperature of 101 degrees, two Angel pitchers (Kevin Gregg and Brendan Donnelly) had already been thrown out of the game for hitting Ranger batters, and Angel manager Mike Scioscia and acting manager/bench coach Ron Roenicke had been ejected as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night.

The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution.

5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at <b>night</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
