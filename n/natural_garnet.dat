40|$|Major {{and trace}} element zonation {{patterns}} were determined in ultrahigh-pressure eclogite garnets from the Western Gneiss Region (Norway). All investigated garnets show multiple growth zones and preserve complex growth zonation patterns {{with respect to}} both major and rare earth elements (REE). Due to chemical differences of the host rocks two types of major element compositional zonation patterns occur: (1) abrupt, step-like compositional changes corresponding with the growth zones and (2) compositionally homogeneous interiors, independent of growth zones, followed by abrupt chemical changes towards the rims. Despite differences in major element zonation, the REE patterns are almost identical in all garnets and {{can be divided into}} four distinct zones with characteristic patterns. In order to interpret the major and trace element distribution and zoning patterns in terms of the subduction history of the rocks, we combined thermodynamic forward models for appropriate bulk rock compositions to yield molar proportions and major element compositions of stable phases along the inferred pressure-temperature path with a mass balance distribution of REEs among the calculated stable phases during high pressure metamorphism. Our thermodynamic forward models reproduce the complex major element zonation patterns and growth zones in the <b>natural</b> <b>garnets,</b> with garnet growth predicted during four different reaction stages: (1) chlorite breakdown, (2) epidote breakdown, (3) amphibole breakdown and (4) reduction in molar clinopyroxene at ultrahigh-pressure conditions. Mass-balance of the rare earth element distribution among the modelled stable phases yielded characteristic zonation patterns in garnet that closely resemble those in the <b>natural</b> samples. <b>Garnet</b> growth and trace element incorporation occurred in near thermodynamic equilibrium with matrix phases during subduction. The rare earth element patterns in garnet exhibit distinct enrichment zones that fingerprint the minerals involved in the garnet-forming reactions as well as local peaks that can be explained by fractionation effects and changes in the mineral assemblage. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The high field {{strength}} elements (HFSE: Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, and W) {{are an important}} group of chemical tracers that are increasingly used to investigate magmatic differentiation processes. Successful modeling of these processes requires the availability of accurate mineral-melt partition coefficients (D). To date, these have largely been determined by ion microprobe or laser ablation-ICP-MS analyses of the run products of high-pressure, high-temperature experiments. Since HFSE are (highly) incompatible, relatively immobile, high-charge, and difficult to ionize, these experiments and their analysis are challenging. Here we explore whether high-precision analyses of natural mineral-melt systems can provide additional constraints on HFSE partitioning.

These results differ by several percent from those reported previously for synthetic pyrope, but are based upon a much larger data set. Although the hydrous components of the two samples from the present study are substantially different, representing both ‘dry’ and ‘saturated’ samples, we find no discernable effect of structurally bound water on the elastic properties.

40|$|Many oceanic-island basalts (OIBs) with isotopic {{signatures}} of recycled crustal components are silica poor and strongly nepheline (ne) normative and therefore unlike the silicic liquids generated from partial melting of recycled mid-oceanic-ridge basalt (MORB). High-pressure partial-melting experiments on a garnet pyroxenite (MIX 1 G) at 2. 0 and 2. 5 GPa produce strongly ne-normative and silica-poor partial melts. The MIX 1 G solidus is located below 1350 and 1400 °C at 2 and 2. 5 GPa, respectively, slightly cooler than the solidus of dry peridotite. Chemographic analysis suggests that <b>natural</b> <b>garnet</b> pyroxenite compositions straddle a thermal divide. Whereas partial melts of compositions on the silica-excess {{side of the}} divide (such as recycled MORB) are silica saturated, those from silica-deficient garnet pyroxenites can be alkalic and have similarities to low-silica OIB. Although the experimental partial melts are too rich in Al_ 2 O_ 3 to be parental to highly undersaturated OIB suites, higher-pressure (4 – 5 GPa) partial melting of garnet pyroxenite is expected to yield more appropriate parental liquids for OIB lavas.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Uvarovite and grossular, {{the former}} com-paratively rare, occur along the serpentinite-graphite schist contact in the Fengtien area, {{on the eastern}} slope of the Central Range of Taiwan. Uvarovite occurs as small emerald-green {{euhedral}} crystals on diopside-fels with dodecahedral crystal forms and many other modifica-tions. Its refractive index is 1. 782, specific gravity 3. 702, and unit cell edge 11. 912 A. Chemical and probe analyses give average Cr 20 3 contents of 11. 60 wt. ~; spectro-graphic analysis shows significant enrichment in Cr, Be, Co, Y, Sb, and La over grossular. Associated minerals include nephrite, diopside, tremolite asbestos, zoisite, and clinozoisite. Grossular is reddish-brown; large crystals, dodecahedral in form often modified by trapezohedrons, are associated with diopside, idocrase, and calcite, n = 1. 746, SG = 3. 636, and a = 11. 866 A. Structurally and chemically it is quite near the grossular end member.

40|$|Abstract Concentration {{gradients}} in calcium {{are common}} in metamorphic or magmatic garnets {{and can be used}} to determine the timescales of geological pro-cesses. However, the kinetics of Ca diffusion in garnet is poorly constrained and experimental studies have to date yielded widely varying diffusion coefficients. In this paper, we describe a new method for generating diffu-sion profiles in garnet. We incorporated polished and compositionally homogeneous garnet seeds in a finely ground powder of clinopyroxene and garnet. During the experiments (1. 3 GPa, 1, 050 – 1, 250 C, and ƒO 2 £ the graphite-O 2 buffer), the mineral powder partially mel-ted, recrystallized, and formed a 10 – 50 lm wide over-growth zone of compositionally distinct garnet around the seeds. Long duration experiments generated mea-surable relaxation profiles at these seed/overgrowth interfaces. We performed analytical transmission elec-tron microscope traverses across the interfaces in each experiment. Thirteen usable compositional profiles were obtained with characteristic distances of diffusion ranging from 300 to 1, 000 nm. From these profiles, Ca– (Fe, Mg) interdiffusion coefficients were retrieved using an analytical solution for the diffusion equation and the data were cast in an Arrhenius relation. Linear regres-sion of the data yields an activation energy QCa–(Fe, Mg) equal to 188 ± 48 kJ mol– 1 and a frequency factor D 0 equal to 6. 6 · 10 – 14 m 2 s– 1. Within the compositional range studied, the composition of garnet has no major effect on the Ca–(Fe, Mg) interdiffusion coefficient. The very slow diffusion rate of Ca is in agreement with natural observations indicating that Ca diffuses more slowly than Fe and Mg. The Ca diffusion coefficients derived from this study are not model-dependent and can be used to determine the durations of geological events from Ca relaxation profiles in <b>natural</b> <b>garnets...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} with garnet and coexisting melt {{have been carried out}} across a range of oxygen fugacities (near hematite-magnetite (HM) to below the iron-wustite (IW) buffers) at 1. 7 GPa to study the partitioning and valence of Cr and V in both phases. Experiments were carried out in a non end loaded piston cylinder apparatus, and the run products were analyzed with electron microprobe and xray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis at beamline 13 -ID at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Lab. The valence of vanadium and chromium were determined using the position and intensity of the Ka pre-edge peaks, calibrated on a series of Cr and Vbearing standard glasses. This technique has been applied to V and Cr in glasses and V in spinels previously, and in these isotropic phases there are no orientational effects on the XANES spectra (Righter et al., 2006, Amer. Mineral. 91, 1643 - 1656). We also now demonstrate this to be true for V and Cr in garnet. Also, previous work has shown that V has a higher valence in the glass (or melt) than in the coexisting spinel. This is also true for V in garnet-glass pairs in this study. Vanadium valence in garnets varies from 2. 7 below the IW buffer to 3. 7 near HM, and for coexisting glass it varies from 3. 2 to 4. 3. Vanadium valence measured in some <b>natural</b> <b>garnets</b> from mantle localities indicates V in the more reduced range at 2. 5. Comparisons will be made between fO 2 estimated from V valence and other methods for garnet-bearing mantle samples. In contrast, Cr valence measured in garnet and coexisting glass for all experimental and natural samples is 2. 9 - 3. 0, suggesting that the valence of Cr does not vary within either phase across a large fO 2 range. These results demonstrate that while V varies from 2 + to 3 + to 4 + in garnet-melt systems, Cr does not, and this will ultimately affect the partitioning behavior of these two elements in natural systems. Garnet/melt D(Cr) are between 12 and 17 across this range of fO 2, whereas D(V) has the highest partition coefficient approx. 3, near the IW buffer where the valence of V is almost entirely 3 +...|$|R
40|$|A multi-technique {{approach}} (based on electron microprobe analysis, structure refinement, and EXAFS analysis at the Ca Kedge) {{was used}} to characterise the local geometry of Ca in synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>garnet</b> compositions referable to the pyrope-grossular solid solution. Multi-shell fits of the EXAFS data indicate that Ca assumes the standard [4 + 4]-fold coordination (the polyhedral shape being a triangular dodecahedron with Cal-O= 2. 30 - 2. 31 (1) and Ca 2 -O= 2. 45 - 2. 46 (1) angstrom) when Ca > 1. 50 atoms per formula unit (apfu), but assumes a nearly regular [8]-fold coordination with Ca-O= 2. 35 - 2. 36 (1) A when (Mg, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +) > 1. 50 apfu. Therefore, in the pyrope-dominant structure the Cal-O distance lengthens and the Ca 2 -O distance shortens to converge towards the value observed for the Mg 2 -O bond in pyrope. This {{finding is consistent with}} many distinct structural features observed in solid solution terms with (Mg, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +) > 1. 50 apfu or Ca > 1. 50 apfu, {{as well as with the}} anomalous properties of the intennediate terms observed both in the short-range and in the long-range perspective. The presence of two distinct Ca coordinations in the pyrope (almandine, spessartine) -like and in the grossular-like structure, and thus of an isosymmetric transition at the intennediate composition, can help to explain both the strong and asymmetric non-ideality of the solid solution between pyrope (almandine) and grossular, as well as the differences in the ability to incorporate some trace elements (such as REE and actinides) which are commonly used as process-specific indicators. This feature must be taken into account when building theoretical models of the garnet solid solutions, which are at the moment the most promising approach for calculating thermodynamic properties or for interpreting and predicting trace-element behaviour in this crucial mineral phase...|$|E
40|$|Spinel and garnet peridotites are the {{dominant}} rock types {{of the upper}} mantle. Petrography, mineralogy, bulk rock and mineral chemistry of spinel lherzolites from inclusions in basanites in Victoria, Australia were studied to provide evidence for their petrogenesis and relation to host rocks and to other xenolithic rock types occurring within these host rocks. Experimental studies in ultramafic systems were carried out to infer P,T conditions {{of the origin of}} garnet peridotites, particularly those of xenolithic occurrence in kimberlites reported in the literature, to investigate the relation between garnet and spinel peridotites and to give clues to the relation between host rocks, garnet peridotites and simultaneously occurring xenoliths, megacrysts and minerals. Ultramafic inclusions from two neighbouring localities in Victoria, Australia (Lake Bullenmerri and Mt Leura) include spinel lherzolites with and without hydrous phases, wehrlites, pyroxenites and hornblendites. Mineral chemistry provides evidence for equilibrium crystallization for individual nodules at a depth near 45 km but over a range of temperatures. Temperature estimates yield systematic differences between anhydrous assemblages > phlogopite-bearing assemblages > amphibole-bearing assemblages. Bulk rock variation of `MgO, CaO, Al_ 2 "O_ 3 ` and compatible element contents in lherzolite and harzburgite has been modelled as an early partial melting event, giving rise to various degrees of depletion. The extracted liquid was of picritic composition. Amphiboles in spinel lherzolites are developed independently of the early partial melting event and postdate it They crystallized as a response to near-isochemical metamorphic reaction, consequent on addition of water. The hydration events predate but are not precursor conditions for production of basanite. Hydration-metasomatism occurs in the uppermost mantle above the LVZ, but this is most probably not the region of formation of the alkaline magams. The emplacement and passage of alkaline magmas through the lithosphere/upper mantle may be the cause of local metasomatism and hydration. Wehrlites, pyroxenites, some lherzolites, and hornblendites are precipitates from magmas fractionating and/or crystallizing at mantle depths. Observable wallrock reaction is extremely restricted (about 1 cm) as evidencedby composite xenoliths. Experiments in the systems `CaO-MgO-Al_ 2 "O_ 3 "-SiO_ 2 ` (CMAS) and `SiO_ 2 `-`MgO- Al_ 2 "O_ 3 `-`CaO-Cr_ 2 "O_ 3 ` (SMACCR) show that spinel and garnet in peridotitic assemblages are related by an univariant reaction in the CHAS system, but coexist with each other over a range of P,T conditions in the SMACCR system. Both the width and location of this field in P,T space is dependent on the Cr/Cr+Al ratio of the bulk composition. Temperature estimates for assemblages containing two pyroxenes by the method of Wells (1977) give satisfactory results for the range of 1000 - 1400 °C and 15 - 40 kb in all systems studied (CMS, SMACCR and multicomponent "natural" systems). Doubts on the accuracy of this thermometer exist particularly at loWtemperatures (< 900 °C), but for most xenolithic occurrences of <b>natural</b> <b>garnet</b> lherzolites,'temperatures may be estimated by this method with considerable confidence. Cr-Al distributions between ortho- and clinopyroxene as well as between pyroxenes and spinel show a regular behaviour in the SMACCR system, independent of pressure and temperature. The Cr-Al exchange between garnet and spinel is sensitive to temperature in the SMACCR system above 1200 °C and a thermometer based on this, reaction has been calibrated for the simple system.. Experiments in multicomponent systems show however strong compo-sitional dependencies of this reaction, rendering it as of no use for practical geothermometry. The solubility of both `Al_ 2 "O_ 3 ` and `Cr_ 2 "O_ 3 ` in orthopyroxene coexisting with garnet and clinopyroxene is dependent on pressure, temperature and composition of the coexisting phases. By both thermodynamic reasoning and empirical curve-fitting these dependencies have been modelled in the CMAS and SMACCR systems, resulting in barometric expressions for these systems. The results have been combined with recent experimental investi-gations in Fe-bearing systems and two independent empirical geobarometers were calibrated, giving satisfactory and consistent results when applied to experiments in multicomponent systems and <b>natural</b> <b>garnet</b> lherzolites. P,T estimates for various suites of garnet lherzolite xenoliths show differing distributions of P and T comditions of equilibration for different provinces and host rocks. Low temperature xenoliths (1100 °C) from South Africa are derived from a narrow pressure interval around 48 - 51 kb, covering a range of temperatures from 1100 - 1400 °C. Russian samples with transitional temperatures (1050 - 1200 °C) indicate a parallel trend to South African'xenoliths. Garnet lherzolites from lanprophyre (Four-Corners area, southwestern U. S. A.) equilibrated over a range of = 1000 - 1200 °C at a narrow pressure range around 36 - 39 kb. Samples from oceanic environments (Solomon Islands), young continental areas (N. S. W., Australia) and the Ile Bizard locality (Canada) show P,T conditions of equilibration in agreement for estimates of P,T conditions for oceanic upper mantle based on heat-flow data or convecting mantle models. The data on P,T estimates for garnet lherzolites from South Africa have been combined with melting studies on peridotitic systems and lquidus studies on kimberlite to infer conditions of 160 - 180 km depths and 1400 - 1500 °C for the origin of South African kimberlites. Megacrysts and cumulates found in those kimberlites are precipitates from pre-dating magmas fractionating and/or crystallizing at mantle depths. Diamonds crystallized from pre-dating magmas at conditions close to the graphite-diamond boundary (900 - 1300 °C, 40 - 55 kb).

The {{variation in the}} energy and intensity of spectral features {{as a function of}} Fe 3 +/ΣFe was investigated to identify correlations {{that could be used to}} determine Fe 3 +/ΣFe of unknowns. The pre-edge energy, which is commonly used for quantification, was found to be relatively insensitive for garnet, particularly at low values of Fe 3 +/ΣFe. The best correlation was for the absorption edge energy, which may provide an accurate and precise method for determining Fe 3 +/ΣFe of garnets in metapelitic rocks. The resulting calibration curve, however, significantly and non-systematically overestimates the Fe 3 +/ΣFe value of mantle garnets (from xenoliths and megacrysts) for which Fe 3 +/ΣFe had been determined previously by Mössbauer spectroscopy. This is probably a result of differences in composition between the synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>garnets.</b> For the mantle garnets, Fe 3 +/ΣFe is strongly correlated with the intensity ratio of post-edge features at 7138. 4 and 7161. 7 eV. The deviation of the Mössbauer results from a linear fit is less than 0. 01 (1 σ). This suggests a new method for determining Fe 3 +/ΣFe from XANES spectra that does not require precise energy calibration or spectral fitting.

40|$|The site {{location}} and local geometry of trace amounts (299 ppm) of dysprosium in a <b>natural</b> melanite <b>garnet</b> from a carbonatitic rock {{have been studied}} by high-energy fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS). Measurements were done at the Dy K-edge (53789 eV). Data analysis shows that Dy (i. r. = 0. 98 Angstrom) is incorporated at the X site, similarly to other REE, namely Nd (i. r. = 1. 11 Angstrom) and Ce (i. r. = 1. 14 Angstrom). Comparison of the XAFS data obtained for these three REE and for Ca shows that, within a given garnet composition, {{the difference in the}} local geometry can be modelled in terms of differences in the ionic radii. On the contrary, the local coordination of the individual cations is different in distinct garnet compositions, in contrast to what was suggested by previous atomistic simulations of the garnet structure. Comparison of the local coordination geometries available in the literature shows that the Young modulus of the X site strongly depends on the major-element composition of all the structural sites. Both these points are important for Earth Sciences, and especially for geochemical modelling of trace-element incorporation and partitioning...|$|R

Thus the duration of experimental study {{and the risk of}} failure of expensive experimental equipment can be decreased considerably. The diffusion experiments were carried out in piston-cylinder apparatus. Gem-quality garnets of almandine, spessartine and grossular compositions together with inclusion-rich eclogitic garnets were embedded in a powder of natural pyrope and annealed together under dry conditions at P = 1. 9 – 3. 2 GPa and T = 1, 070 – 1, 400 C. Diffusion profiles were measured by electron microprobe and fitted numerically on the basis of multicomponent diffusion theory. The datasets derived from different diffusion couples yields parameters of the Arrhenius equation for Ca, Mg and Fe in <b>natural</b> eclogitic <b>garnets</b> and Mg, Mn and Fe in gem-quality garnets. We have also studied the effect of grain-boundary diffusion in the sintered pyrope matrix on interdiffusion on the basis of 2 D modeling. Under conditions analogous to those of our experimental runs, we show that observed irregularities in some measured diffusion profiles (not applied for the diffusion modeling) can be directly related to the superposition of local grain-boundary diffusion on dominant volume diffusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} {{zone of the}} Earth’s mantle (the depth interval between two major seismic discontinuities at 410 km and 660 km) is critical to understanding our planet’s evolution. Some diamonds {{are thought to have}} originated in the {{transition zone}} and the inclusions found in them are the only samples of material directly extracted from this depth range. By comparing <b>natural</b> majorite <b>garnet</b> inclusions in diamonds with the compositions of experimentally crystallized majorite garnets, we determine two major compositional trends, the pure metabasitic (or eclogitic) trend and the combined metaperidotitic and metapyroxenitic trend, that are strongly correlated with their preferred substitution mechanisms during majorite formation. Based on these trends, we demonstrate {{that the majority of the}} reported majorite inclusions in natural diamonds formed neither in a pure metabasite nor in a metaperidotite lithology, but in fact crystallized from a wide range of compositions intermediate between conventional basaltic and peridotitic, referred to here as metapyroxenitic. Given the dominance of metapyroxenite-type majorite diamond inclusions and their inferred syngenetic origin, we argue that a significant fraction of metapyroxenite rock is present within Earth’s transition zone and is important in the diamond-forming process. This is in agreement with recent self-consistent seismological and/or mineral physics studies that support models of a lithologically heterogeneous transition zone. From trace element and carbon isotope features, we infer a crustal origin for these rocks...|$|R

On the basis of a proposed extension of the MgSiO 3 -Al 2 O 3 high-pressure phase diagram toward FeSiO 3, Fe is shown to partition preferentially into the garnet phase.

An isosymmetric phase transition {{was observed in}} the pressure range between 55 and 70 GPa, which {{is associated with a}} gradual high-spin to low-spin electronic transition in Mn$^{ 3 +}$ and a pronounced reduction of the Jahn-Teller distortion of the Mn$^{ 3 +}$O$_{ 4 }$(OH) $_{ 2 }$ octahedra. In the high-pressure phase the Jahn-Teller distortion is totally suppressed and the Mn$^{ 3 +}$ is in a low-spin configuration. Experimental structural data before and after the phase transition are in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted structural compression of the high-spin and low-spin phases, respectively. While the overall unit-cell volume is reduced by about 1. 5 % across the phase transition, a collapse of about 4 – 5 % of the MnO 6 octahedral volume is observed. The high-spin phase shows a bulk modulus B = 101 (1) GPa and its pressure derivative B'= 4. 5 (1).

The experimental method involves measuring the composition of garnet in equilibrium with an assemblage in which {{the activity of the}} Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 component is fixed. Experiments on the assemblage garnet solid solution, anorthite, Al 2 SiO 5 polymorph and quartz at known pressure and temperature fix the activity of the Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 component through the equilibrium: {Mathematical expression} This equilibrium, with either sillimanite or kyanite as the aluminosilicate mineral, was used to control {Mathematical expression}. The compositions of the garnet solutions produced were determined by measurement of their unit cell edges. At 1 bar Fe 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 -Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 garnets exhibit negative deviations from ideality at the Fe-rich end of the series and positive deviations at the calcium end. With increasing pressure the activity coefficients for the Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 component increase because the partial molar volume of this component is greater than the molar volume of pure grossular. Previous studies indicate that the activity coefficients for the Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 component also increase with increasing (Mg/Mg+Fe) ratio of the garnet. The region of negative deviation from ideality implies a tendency towards formation of a stable Fe-Ca garnet component.

40|$|Results from {{experiments}} {{in this work}} have been combined with existing data to yield tracer diffusivities of divalent cations in <b>natural</b> multicomponent <b>garnets</b> at 10 - 40 kb, 1100 - 1475 °C. For the garnet compositions studied in this work, the activation energy for tracer diffusion of Mn < Fe ≃ Mg, while activation volumes increase in the order Mg < Fe < Mn. These data may be used with theoretical models to calculate the full multicomponent diffusion coefficient matrix {{as a function of}} pressure, temperature, composition and oxygen fugacity. An analytical model has been developed to describe the relaxation of compositional zoning in metapelitic garnets during metamorphism. It is found that a significant amount of relaxation occurs during heating and the composition at the core of a garnet crystal is disturbed very early in the process. The extent of relaxation depends on a number of factors which include the grain size, the initial shape of the compositional profile, details of the thermal history and the textural mode of occurrence of the garnet. Complications such as oscillations in a compositional profile may be explained by the mathematical form of the equations describing the process. Graphical representation of the results of this model have been provided that allow quick and easy determination of the extent of relaxation or time scale of metamorphic processes. Calculations using the diffusion data indicate that Fe-Mg exchange geothennometry and Sm-Nd geochronology involving garnets may not yield the peak metamorphic conditions for certain geologically realistic situations. Model calculations on natural assemblages suggest that the diffusion data may be used to yield infonnation on metamorphic processes ranging from time scales to crystal growth rates during metamorphism. Veracity of P-T paths calculated from garnet zoning may also be checked using the diffusion data. Illustrative examples of such calculations have been provided...|$|R
40|$|We review {{experimental}} phase equilibria {{associated with}} partial melting of mafic lithologies (pyroxenites) at high pressures to reveal systematic relationships between bulk compositions of pyroxenite and their melting relations. An {{important aspect of}} pyroxenite phase equilibria is {{the existence of the}} garnet-pyroxene thermal divide, defined by the enstatite-Ca-Tschermaks pyroxene-diopside plane in CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 projections. This divide appears at pressures above ∼ 2 [*]GPa in the <b>natural</b> system where <b>garnet</b> and pyroxenes are the principal residual phases in pyroxenites. Bulk compositions that reside {{on either side of the}} divide have distinct phase assemblages from subsolidus to liquidus and produce distinct types of partial melt ranging from strongly nepheline-normative to quartz-normative compositions. Solidus and liquidus locations are little affected by the location of natural pyroxenite compositions relative to the thermal divide and are instead controlled chiefly by bulk alkali contents and Mg-numbers. Changes in phase volumes of residual minerals also influence partial melt compositions. If olivine is absent during partial melting, expansion of the phase volume of garnet relative to clinopyroxene with increasing pressure produces liquids with high Ca/Al and low MgO compared with garnet peridotite-derived partial melt...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of U and Th between crystals and quenched silicate melt has been measured in experimentally crystallized natural and synthetic starting compositions. Clinopyroxene was crystallized from two natural basalts and a synthetic composition on the diopside-anorthite join, olivine {{from one of}} the <b>natural</b> basalts, and <b>garnet</b> from a synthetic andesite. Clinopyroxene and olivine were crystallized at atmospheric pressure under controlled oxygen fugacity and U and Th distributions were determined by particle track radiography. Garnet crystals were grown at 27 Kbars and actinide distributions were determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Crystals were grown by slow cooling in an effort to maintain chemical equilibrium at the crystal-melt interface. Clinopyroxene- and olivine-melt partition coefficients (D^(xtl/liq) / = C^(xtl) /i / C^(liq) I were calculated from track distributions by correcting for chemical zoning in the crystals (a result of fractional crystallization) and particle range differences between the crystals and glass. Over the range of ƒO_ 2 s and compositions studied, D^(cpx/liq) /U = 0. 0021 - 0. 0093, = D^(cpx/liq) /(Th) 0. 0047 - 0. 021, and D^(ol/liq) /(U;Th) 1. With these constraints, fractionation by partial melting of spinel lherzolite is ruled out. The sense of U-Th fractionation by garnet is consistent with oceanic basalts, but the magnitude of fractionation is much smaller than the entire range in observed fractionations. Since partial melts of neither spinel nor garnet lherzolite can match the sense and magnitude of ^(238) U-^(230) Th disequilibrium in MORB and OIB, partial melting is considered unimportant in generating ^(238) U-^(230) Th disequilibrium in oceanic basalts. ^(238) U-^(230) Th disequilibrium in MORB and OIB must therefore result from some process other than partial melting, and possible alternative mechanisms are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Pyrope single {{crystals}} doped with transition-metal ions (Co, Cr, Ni, Ti and V) were synthesised in a piston-cylinder device at 950 – 1050 °C and 25 kbar. Stoichiometric oxide mixtures {{were used}} as starting materials and distilled water {{was used as a}} fluid flux. Crystals up to 2 mm in size were grown. Microprobe analysis and optical absorption spectroscopy were used to determine on which positions and in which oxidation states the transition-metal ions are incorporated in the pyrope structure. Cr^(3 +) -ions occupy the octahedral site and Co^(2 +) and Ni^(2 +) the dodecahedral site. Although extra metallic Ti was included in the synthesis of Ti-bearing pyropes, only Ti^(4 +) and no measurable Ti^(3 +) could be stabilised on the octahedral site. The optical absorption spectra of V-bearing pyropes show, in addition to the spin-allowed dd-transitions ^ 3 T_(1 g) (F) ^ 3 T_(2 g) (F) at ~ 17000 cm_(- 1) and ^ 3 T_(2 g) (F) ^ 3 T_(1 g) (P) at ~ 20000 cm^(- 1) corresponding to V^(3 +) on the octahedral site, absorption bands which are thought to be caused by dd-transitions of V^(3 +) in the tetrahedral site and V^(4 +) on octahedral and tetrahedral sites. V^(4 +) was not observed in silicate garnets before. IR spectra in the OH- stretching region between 4000 and 3000 cm^(- 1), obtained on pyrope single-crystals which only contain divalent and trivalent transition-metal ions like Ni^(2 +), Co^(2 +), and Cr^(3 +), are similar to that normally shown by end-member pyrope (Geiger et al., 1991). At room temperature the spectra show a single band at ≈ 3630 cm^(- 1), which splits at ~ 79 K into two bands of smaller FWHM's at ∼ 3618 cm^(- 1) and 3636 cm^(- 1). These bands are assigned to OH–stretching modes resulting from the hydrogarnet substitution. The spectra of Ti^(4 +) -bearing pyrope measured at 298 K show four OH–stretching bands at approximately 3686, 3630, 3567 and 3527 cm^(- 1). At ∼ 79 K the band at 3630 cm^(- 1) splits into two narrow bands at 3636 cm^(- 1) and 3614 cm^(- 1). This suggests that additional OH- substitutional mechanisms occur in Ti-containing garnets. In the IR spectrum of a V^(4 +) -bearing pyrope the same number of OH-stretching bands is observed, suggesting that higher charged cations cause additional OH- substitutions and increased OH- concentrations in garnet. The IR spectra of most <b>natural</b> pyrope-rich <b>garnets</b> appear to be {{different from those of the}} synthetics, which suggests that they are not characterised by the hydrogarnet substitution. However, the OH–substitution mechanism and concentrations in garnets from grospydite or similar parageneses are similar to those of the synthetics, which may reflect their formation in water-rich environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{partitioning}} of samarium and thulium between garnets and melts in {{the systems}} Mg 3 Al 2 -Si 3 O 12 -H 2 O and Ca 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 -H 2 O {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} REE concentration in the garnets at 30 kbar pressure. Synthesis experiments of variable time under constant P, T conditions indicate that garnet initially crystallizes rapidly to produce apparent values of D Sm (D Sm=concentration of Sm in garnet/concentration of Sm in liquid) which are too large in the case of pyrope and too small in the case of grossular. As the experiment proceeds, Sm diffuses out of or into the garnet and the equilibrium value of D Sm is approached. Approximate values of diffusion coefficients for Sm in pyrope garnet obtained by this method are 6 × 10 - 13 cm 2 s - 1 at 1, 300 ° C and 2 × 10 - 12 cm 2 s - 1 at 1, 500 ° C, and for grossular, 8. 3 × 10 - 12 cm 2 s - 1 at 1, 200 ° C and 4. 6 × 10 - 11 cm 2 s - 1 at 1, 300 ° C. The equilibrium values of D Sm have been reversed by experiments with Sm-free pyrope and Sm-bearing glass, and with Sm-bearing grossular and Sm-free glass. Between 12 ppm and 1, 000 ppm Sm in pyrope at 1, 300 ° C and between 80 ppm and > 2 wt. % Tm in pyrope at 1, 500 ° C, partition coefficients are constant and independent of REE concentration. Above 100 ppm of Sm in garnet at 1, 500 ° C, partition coefficients are independent of Sm concentration. At lower concentrations, however, D Sm is dependent upon the Sm content of the garnet. The two regions may be interpreted in terms of charge-balanced substitution of Sm 3 Al 5 O 12 in the garnet at high Sm concentrations and defect equilibria involving cation vacancies at low concentrations. At very low REE concentrations (< 1 ppm Tm in grossular at 1, 300 ° C) D REE garnet/liquid again becomes constant with an apparent Henry's Law value greater than that at high concentrations. This may be interpreted in terms of a large abundance of cation vacancies relative to the number of REE ions. The importance of defects in the low concentration region has been confirmed by adding other REE (at 80 ppm level) to the system Mg 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 -H 2 O at low Sm concentrations. These change D Sm in the defect region, demonstrating their role in the production of vacancies. Experiments on a <b>natural</b> pyropic <b>garnet</b> indicate that defect equilibria are of importance to REE partitioning within the concentration ranges found in nature. © 1980 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
