5|$|Patterns in <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> visible regularities of form {{found in}} the natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of physics}} apply the abstractions of {{mathematics}} to the real world, often {{as if it were}} perfect. For example, a crystal is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects. Visible patterns in <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> governed by physical laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of natural philosophy, Baconian real-constructivism claims that <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> <b>nature</b> insofar as it is governed by laws; <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> nothing but mathematical law. On the other hand, there is a type of <b>nature</b> that <b>is</b> phenomenologically given. Technological artifacts and technical systems are not unnatural or beyond nature; they are also, and in particular, natural reality insofar as they are constructed. Furthermore, production <b>is</b> apparent in <b>nature</b> itself: <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> capable of constructing something.|$|R
5|$|Changes in {{direction}} of this <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> most commonly observed {{as a result}} of a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|God must be good, Paley argues, {{because in}} many cases the designs seen in <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> beneficial, and because animals {{perceive}} pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of gout which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> beneficial.|$|E

60|$|If {{you want}} to treat a tiger reasonably, you must {{go back to the}} garden of Eden. For the obstinate {{reminder}} continued to recur: only the supernatural has taken a sane view of Nature. The essence of all pantheism, evolutionism, and modern cosmic religion is really in this proposition: that <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> our mother. Unfortunately, if you regard Nature as a mother, you discover that she is a step-mother. The main point of Christianity <b>was</b> this: that <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> not our mother: <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> our sister. We can be proud of her beauty, since we have the same father; but she has no authority over us; we have to admire, but not to imitate. This gives to the typically Christian pleasure in this earth a strange touch of lightness that <b>is</b> almost frivolity. <b>Nature</b> <b>was</b> a solemn mother to the worshippers of Isis and Cybele. <b>Nature</b> <b>was</b> a solemn mother to Wordsworth or to Emerson. But <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> not solemn to Francis of Assisi or to George Herbert. To St. Francis, <b>Nature</b> <b>is</b> a sister, and even a younger sister: a little, dancing sister, to be laughed at as well as loved.|$|R
5000|$|Human <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> {{a central}} {{question}} in Chinese philosophy. Human <b>nature</b> <b>was</b> considered by Confucius and Mencius to be essentially good.

[...] As suggested by these contrasting views, the question of human nature has generated a long debate among Chinese thinkers.|$|R
5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant <b>nature,</b> <b>are</b> most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in <b>nature</b> <b>are</b> formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E
