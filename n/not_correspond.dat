5|$|During {{early studies}} of the optical {{spectrum}} of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five volumes. Dioscorides {{organized}} the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is {{by the type of}} effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{commissioned}} a lieutenant into the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion, CEF in May 1916. In September, Diefenbaker {{was part of}} a contingent of 300 junior officers sent to Britain for pre-deployment training. Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that he was hit by a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.|$|E
5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> with the facts.|$|E

5|$|Of the A$1.17 billion {{allocated}} to the fast track program, only A$143 million was required to fix problems where the submarines did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> with the original contract: the rest was used to update components that were technologically obsolete and make changes to the submarines beyond the contract specifications. When the fast track program is factored in, the Collins class cost just under 20% more than the inflation-adjusted contract value; a smaller increase than other contemporary defence projects.|$|E
5|$|Once all votes {{have been}} cast, the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container, {{and the last}} Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> {{to the number of}} {{cardinal}} electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the ballots are burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated. If, however, no irregularities are observed, the ballots may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.|$|E
5|$|The Hadoram Shirihai {{expeditions to}} the Madeira {{archipelago}} in 2008, 2009 and 2010 each had sightings of a Pterodroma petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upperwings like Zino's or Fea's. This plumage does <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to any known Pterodroma species. It {{may have been}} an unusual variant of Zino's but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. It may alternatively be a single aberrant individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from Madeira or elsewhere. No conclusion is possible on current knowledge.|$|E

5|$|The Syrians were {{equipped}} with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and {{those used by}} the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. The Syrians also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery batteries. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> with subcutaneous structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{process that}} {{ultimately}} led to Accum's departure from England and return to Germany began {{a few months after}} the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs. For a long time, many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile. Finally in 1951, Cole, in an addendum to the minutes of Royal Institution, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography, and also later in the Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie (according to which Accum was embroiled in charges of embezzlement as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany), did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to the facts.|$|E

The writers were confused when the notes did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to the script and they discovered that Prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else. Prince disliked the Simpsons writers' script and demanded the other one be made into an episode, but the writers refused. The episode eventually fell through and never made it past written form. It {{became one of the}} few completed scripts never to be produced.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E
5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel {{in the structure of the}} word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to any known surface features.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did <b>not</b> <b>correspond</b> to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
