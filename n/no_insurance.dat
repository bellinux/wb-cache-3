5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in R v Dudley and Stephens, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that <b>no</b> <b>insurance</b> claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.|$|E

The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; <b>no</b> <b>insurance</b> on his wife or children.

5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried <b>no</b> <b>insurance</b> on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E

25|$|Before the New Deal, {{there was}} <b>no</b> <b>insurance</b> on {{deposits}} at banks. When thousands of banks closed, depositors lost their savings.

Relief for the poor was the responsibility of families, private charity, and local governments, but as conditions worsened year by year, demand skyrocketed and their combined resources increasingly fell far short of demand.|$|E

25|$|From 1982 onwards, all {{self-employed}} {{women in}} France {{were provided with}} a lump-sum maternity grant which may be supplemented by an income-replacement allowance. In 1983, the unemployment compensation programme was expanded to include workers who had resigned from their jobs. A law of July 1984 introduced a new benefit called the Insertion Allowance, providing short-term support for those in periods of transition into the labour market. Another law passed that same month introduced a Special Solidarity Allowance for long-term unemployed persons with <b>no</b> <b>insurance</b> entitlements remaining. In addition, an Act of October 1982 fully extended the right to join a union {{to people who were}} retired, and a law of February 1984 increased state support for the development and training activities of companies.|$|E

The number of available plans under the Affordable Care Act that will offer service beginning on January 1, 2014, rose to more than 100 from just under 100 in 2013.
