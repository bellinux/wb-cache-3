50|$|The {{growth of}} the company {{proceeded}} rapidly, including more varieties of machines for different aspects of <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> production. Today Mageba has a large product programme ranging from weaving to preparation, finishing and making up. Mageba offers a wide range for <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> production from a single supplier. In 2009 it was Europe’s largest manufacturer of textile machinery.|$|R
50|$|Hattersley <b>Narrow</b> <b>Fabric</b> LoomIn 1908 Hattersley {{developed}} the world's first smallware (or <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric)</b> loom, these were suitable for weaving wicks for oil lamps, and the webbing {{that is used}} in the automotive industry. To demonstrate this loom, the firm bought the Cabbage Mills and later the Greegate Shed in Keighley where they started production of these products. The firm survives today as Hattersley Aladdin Ltd.|$|R
50|$|Mageba {{was founded}} in 1957 by Hans Stang in Wuppertal/Barmen. Initially, Mageba focused on the {{manufacture}} of dyeing and finishing machines for <b>narrow</b> <b>fabrics.</b>|$|R

50|$|Military webbing, {{otherwise}} known as Mil-Spec webbing, is typically composed of high-tensile strength, woven <b>narrow</b> <b>fabrics</b> such as Nylon, Kevlar®, and Nomex®. When these materials are used for parachute and ballooning applications, they must also conform to PIA (Parachute Industry Association) standards.|$|R
40|$|Start-up marks are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} major defect in woven fabric, it occurs when the loom is restarted after loom stoppage due to various reasons. This defect is more prominent in high speed weaving looms especially with elastic warp yarns and is caused to deteriorate the fabric quality. This research paper deals with the mathematical analysis of the startup mark generation in elastic tape on <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> loom. Mathematical analysis was carried out for both continuous operation condition and under stopping condition of the <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> loom. A system simulation was carried out using the model developed and compared with the experimental results to show the accuracy of the model.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{problems}} of a local <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> manufacturer supplying its products to garment factories of the same group. The basic raw materials are (i) Filament yarns of Nylon 6. Nylon 66. Polyester and Lycra: (ii) Dyes and Chemicals. The yarns arc converted to <b>narrow</b> <b>fabrics</b> as per buyers' requirements by weaving or knitting machines and dyed and finished to match buyers' swatches using imported dyes and chemicals. To match the colour shade of the buyer's swatch. a computerised colour matching package namely "Data Color" is used to obtain few closely matching recipes. Using these recipes the respective fabrics are dyed and finished in laboratory scale equipment. These dyed sample swatches are sent for buyer's approval and the bulk is dyed using the buyer approved recipe...|$|R
50|$|In 1798, 10 weavers {{houses were}} built. The weavers lived downstairs and the looms for the {{manufacture}} of tape were upstairs. By the 1820s the looms were transferred into a factory in Tape Street. This tape factory closed in 1972, {{and is now a}} shop. In 1851 silk and <b>narrow</b> <b>fabric</b> mills were built in Cheadle. They employed hundreds of operatives, and closed in 1981.|$|R
50|$|Historically, several textile {{factories}} {{have been}} {{located on the}} northern shores of South Watuppa Pond, including the Fall River Bleachery, Kerr Thread Mills, Lincoln Manufacturing Company, Stevens Manufacturing Company and Heywood <b>Narrow</b> <b>Fabric</b> Company. The eastern and southwestern shores of the pond is currently surrounded by many private residences, and public access is fairly limited. Many of these residences were damaged during the historic floods of March 2010.|$|R
40|$|Chenille yarns are {{traditionally}} {{used in the}} manufacture of furnishing fabrics, fashion knitwear, and as decorative threads in many types of broad and <b>narrow</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Chenille yarn has a very distinct weakness-it does not have very good inherent abrasion resistance. When the yarns are in use, clearly the abrasion resistance of the chenille yarn is crucially important. Either during further processing or during the eventual end-use, any removal of the effect yarn forming the beard will expose the ground yarns, which in turn will result in a bare appearance. To avoid this undesirable result, several options are available. Therefore, the studies on this area are about the investigation of the influences of some material types and machine parameters on the abrasion resistance of chenille yarns and <b>fabrics</b> produced <b>with</b> these yarns. In this paper, the experimental studies about the abrasion properties of chenille yarns in yarn, knitted and woven fabric forms are summarized...|$|R

BST currently operates locations in southern Germany, Poland, and the US in Virginia. BST employs over 1200 persons worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The word poffer {{is derived}} from poffen, the puffing of sleeves and {{trousers}} worn in the mid-19th century. The poffer evolved from a simple headdress, the paske (a strip of <b>fabric</b> decorated <b>with</b> <b>narrow,</b> pleated <b>fabric)</b> which was worn on a white hat. In Limburg the poffer is called a toer. Toer is a term derived from the French word, touronette. Touronette is akin to feminine finery but was originally a braid with ribbons and flowers. The poffer {{is not to be}} confused with the poffer-pan, used to make poffertjes.|$|R

In this study, a {{test device}} was {{designed}} and established for evaluating the sound insulation of fabrics, and six warp knitted <b>fabrics</b> <b>with</b> different parameters were chosen and tested.

The dyed <b>fabric</b> <b>with</b> turmeric powder under alkaline condition created a greater effect in reducing bacteria concentration as compared to that under acidic condition.
