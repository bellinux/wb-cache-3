40|$|The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{conducted}} an assessment {{on the use}} of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant and follow-on formula and in foods for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children. In the opinion of the BfR, <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> are neither required to improve acceptance of such products nor to support development of taste sensation. […] Since infant formula is a standardised product, even the addition of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> does not provide the spectrum of flavours that breast milk offers infants. Based on the current state of knowledge, flavoured infant foods cannot, therefore, support the development of a baby’s sense of taste and smell in the way that breast milk can. Babies are especially vulnerable during {{the first few months of}} life: the body’s detoxification systems […]. Therefore, international expert committees emphasise that the ADI values derived for food additives are not to be applied to babies up to the age of 12 weeks. […] The BfR is of the opinion that the rationale behind the use of food additives in baby food should also apply to the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in baby foods. […] <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> should be used neither in the production of infant formula nor in balanced diets intended for babies aged less than three months. If, under exceptional circumstances, their use is however deemed necessary, the <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> intended to be used require, like any food additives, special case-by-case assessment. In addition, there are indications that sensory experience during infancy influence the development of the sense of taste and thus may have implications on subsequent dietary preferences. However, the currently available data are not sufficient to assess the consequences of the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant formula for later dietary behaviour and related health risks...|$|R

The Flavour Industry provided additional genotoxicity studies for two representative substances, 4 -methylpent- 3 -en- 2 -one [FL-no: 07. 101] and 7 -methyl- 3 -octenone- 2 [FL-no: 07. 177], which were evaluated in this FGE. 204. Based on these new data, the Panel concluded that the <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> [FL-no: 07. 101] does not present a safety concern with respect to genotoxicity and accordingly it can be evaluated using the Procedure. On the contrary, the Panel could not conclude on the in vivo genotoxicity of [FL-no: 07. 177] and more appropriate in vivo genotoxicity tests, considering also first site of contact, should be performed. In addition, the substance 4 -methyl- 3 -hepten- 5 -one [FL-no: 07. 261] was now identified as a substance for which no representative substances could be identified in the present FGE, resulting in a need for additional data on the genotoxic potential of this <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance.</b> However, the Panel noted that the 2 -methyl substituted α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in FGE. 201 Rev 1 {{can be considered as}} structurally related to [FL-no: 07. 261].

The present consideration concerns a group of 29 aliphatic secondary alcohols, ketones and related esters evaluated by JECFA at the 59 th and 69 th meetings in 2002 and 2008. This revision is made due to the inclusion of nine additional substances cleared for genotoxicity concern in FGE. 205 Revision 1.

For all substances, the Panel concludes that there is 'no safety concern at the estimated levels of intake as <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> based on the MSDI approach'. For all 29 substances, the specifications for the materials of commerce have also been considered and found adequate. Ten out of the 14 substances for which use levels became available exceed the modified theoretical added maximum daily intake (mTAMDI) and more reliable exposure data are required to finalise their evaluation.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was {{requested}} to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 49, Revision 1. Consequent to the 2015 scientific opinion from the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on the safety of caffeine from all dietary sources, the CEF Panel considered it inappropriate to evaluate the two substances through the Procedure. For caffeine, the Panel based its assessment on the safety threshold of 5. 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for adults, except pregnant/lactating women, and 3 mg/kg bw per day for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, as established by the NDA Panel. The safety evaluation of theobromine takes into account that approximately 11 % of an oral dose of caffeine is metabolised to theobromine and that both substances have a similar pharmacological profile. For the exposure assessment, a brand loyalty model was chosen. In this model, {{it was assumed that}} a consumer is exposed on a long-term basis to a specific category of food (i. e. non-alcoholic beverages), containing caffeine or theobromine at their respective maximum use levels. For the rest of the categories, normal use levels applied. Daily dietary exposure to caffeine and theobromine (excluding systemic exposure) added as a chemically defined <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> ranged 0 - 2. 3 and 0 - 0. 4 mg/kg bw, respectively, across all population groups. The Panel concluded that caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] would not be expected to present safety concern based on their estimated levels of intake from their use as <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R

The present consideration concerns a group of four <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> consisting of isopulegone and three other substances evaluated by JECFA at the 55 th meeting. This revision is made due to additional toxicity data available for (1 R, 2 S, 5 R) -isopulegol [FL-no: 02. 067]. The substances were evaluated through a stepwise approach that integrates information on structure-activity relationships, intake from current uses, toxicological threshold of concern, and available data on metabolism and toxicity. p-Mentha- 1, 4 (8) -dien- 3 -one [FL-no: 07. 127] is no longer supported by the flavour industry and was not evaluated. In agreement with JECFA, the Panel evaluated the candidate <b>substances</b> in this <b>Flavouring</b> Group Evaluation (FGE) via the B-side of the Procedure. Based on a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from a 90 -day oral toxicity study on [FL-no: 02. 067], adequate margins of safety for the three candidate substances could be calculated. Therefore, the Panel agrees with the JECFA conclusion, 'No safety concern at estimated levels of intake as flavouring substances' based on the maximised survey-derived daily intake (MSDI) approach. Besides the safety assessment of these <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances,</b> the specifications for the materials of commerce have also been considered and found adequate.
