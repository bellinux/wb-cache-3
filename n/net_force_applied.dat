The plate follows a prescribed periodic motion of small amplitude and high frequency, such that the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> <b>applied</b> to the part appears to be from a time-independent, position-dependent velocity field in {{the plane of the}} plate. Theoretical results obtained by Vose et al. were found to be in good agreement with simulation results obtained with the Stewart-Trinkle time-stepping method. In addition, simulations were found to agree with the qualitative experimental results of Vose et al. After such verification of the simulation method, additional numerical studies were done that would have been impossible to carry out analytically. Specifically, we were able to demonstrate the convergence of the method with decreasing step size (as predicted theoretically by Stewart). Further analytical and numerical studies will be carried out in the future to develop and select robust simulation methods that best satisfy the speed and accuracy requirements of different applications. ...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to study and develop {{algorithms}} to visualise ordered sets and secondly to develop algorithms to visualise the faces of complicated ordered sets. To obtain a "pleasing" drawing for an order {{is an important issue}} and deserves attention. To this end, the ordered set may be drawn with minimum edge crossing, same edge length, and it may reflect geometrical symmetry (BaEaTaTo 94). A leading problem is to visualise the faces of an ordered set with discrete structure; some ordered sets, like the projective plane, have a discrete structure that is difficult to visualise and understand. In this thesis we are extending to three dimensions the concept of Eades (Ea 84). The ordered set is treated as a physical object and the vertices are considered as metal spheres with charges while the edges are considered as mechanical springs. The rules of physics are applied to the system and each vertex moves according to the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> <b>applied</b> to it until the system reaches its equilibrium position and the net force on each vertex is zero...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{applicability}} and peculiarities of Alpha engines at low heat source temperature levels of 100 to 200 °C. A parameter study of an Alpha engine has been carried out using the commercial Stirling software Sage. The obtained results revealed some interesting insights into the peculiarities of low-temperature Alpha-SEs. A method for optimising the system design-parameters for a SE is described in this paper. The compact design of a double-acting Alpha engine helps to reduce not only engine size and complexity but also costs. At low temperature differences single-cylinder displacer-type (gamma) engines are well documented, while little is known about the performance of Alpha multi-cylinder engines. In order to achieve the highest possible power output not only the thermodynamic side but also the mechanical side of the engine has to be optimised. This is especially important at low temperature differentials, where the conversion efficiencies are inherently small and the driving force for heat absorption and rejection by the working gas is low. It is mandatory not only to convert as much heat as possible to indicated work but also to transfer as much of this hard gained work to usable power output by minimising internal friction, when trying to keep the engine size as small as possible. The indicated power output of an engine of a specific swept volume is dependent on the temperature and pressure levels, the frequency, the phase angle between the two pistons, the working fluid, and the design of the heat exchangers and the regenerator. A simple model of an Alpha engine was created using the commercial SE simulation tool Sage. In order to explore the relations between those parameters a model was developed, where the design parameters (temperature, mean pressure, frequency, and phase angle) were varied, and the heat exchangers and the regenerator were then optimised for each of the parameter combinations to reach the maximum power output. Temperature and mean pressure are shown to have the expected positive influence on the power output. For the frequency and the phase angle, optimum values can be found that differ significantly from those found for high temperature engines. Helium is used as the benchmark working gas. It can be shown that the use of Nitrogen instead cuts the power output in half, whereas Hydrogen doubles the achievable power output. The mechanical efficiency of a kinematic SE is largely dependent on the load that is transferred from the pistons to the crankshaft during expansion and vice versa during compression, as it increases frictional losses. In double-acting engines an identical pressure oscillation acts on the opposing faces of a piston, although it is out of phase. The resulting forces can balance each other to some extent depending on the phase, and thus the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> <b>applied</b> to the crankshaft can be reduced. For a four cylinder engine it is shown that the Siemens arrangement balances internal forces on the pistons to a larger extent than the Franchot arrangement, so that the mechanical losses are inherently smaller and thus the brake power is larger even though the indicated work is identical for both engine types. The contribution of this work is the provision of a modelling methodology, and the identification of a number of insights for system-design considerations for low-temperature applications...|$|E

There are two approaches to this resolution: one approach is to look for the origin of the fictitious forces (the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). We will find there are no sources for these forces, no associated force carriers, no originating bodies. A second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference. For any inertial frame, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear, so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws, and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of a domain wall in an easy-axis antiferromagnet driven by circularly polarized magnons. Magnons pass through a stationary domain wall without reflection and thus exert no force on it. However, they reverse their spin upon transmission, thereby transferring two quanta of angular momentum to the domain wall and causing it to precess. A precessing domain wall partially reflects magnons back to the source. The reflection of spin waves creates a previously identified reactive force. We point out a second mechanism of propulsion, which we term redshift: magnons passing through a precessing domain wall lower their frequency by twice the angular velocity of the domain wall; the concomitant reduction of magnons' linear momentum indicates momentum transfer to the domain wall. We solve the equations of motion for spin waves {{in the background of}} a uniformly precessing domain wall with the aid of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and compute the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> and torque <b>applied</b> by magnons to the domain wall.
