He moved {{the efforts of}} farmers towards breeding sport pony-style animals, and the breed, originally called the [...] "Mérens horse", was renamed the [...] "Mérens pony" [...] for commercial and administrative reasons.

Between 1975 and 1985, the number of Mérens doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 animals, and its rescue is considered {{a good example of}} saving an endangered breed.|$|E

500|$|Jeffery P. Dennis, {{author of}} the journal article [...] "Queertoons", argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love, while adding that he {{believed}} that SpongeBob and Patrick [...] "are paired with arguably erotic intensity". Martin Goodman of Animation World Magazine described Dennis' comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick as [...] "interesting". Ukrainian website Family Under the Protection of the Holy Virgin, which {{has been described as}} a [...] "fringe Catholic" [...] group by The Wall Street Journal, levied criticism against SpongeBob SquarePants for its alleged [...] "promotion of homosexuality". The group sought to have the series banned, along with several other popular children's properties. The <b>National</b> <b>Expert</b> Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality took up the matter for review in August 2012.|$|E
500|$|During the {{controversy}} surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality, Mrs. Puff's name began to be criticized for supposedly referring to the slang term [...] "puff," [...] a descriptor of gay men that can be derogatory or affectionate. The BBC first noted this in reports of {{the controversy}} in 2002 and again in 2004. In a 2005 issue of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, columnist David Grimes challenged this interpretation, writing, [...] "I do not consider [...] damaging evidence. However, if SpongeBob were receiving lessons from Mr. Puff, {{that would be an}} entirely different matter." [...] K. Sobschak of the St. Catharines Standard also denounced the debate, asking, [...] "What is wrong with taking boating lessons from a fish? This is a comedy for kids." [...] The <b>National</b> <b>Expert</b> Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality revived the criticism of Mrs. Puff's name in 2012, citing it as {{one of the reasons for}} an attempted nationwide ban of the program. Mediaite Editor-in-Chief Andrew Kirell questioned this decision, asking rhetorically, [...] "What's so offensive there? Well, 'puff' is a term often used to describe a gay man, as if Ukrainian children knew that." ...|$|E

40|$|The three European Free Trade Area (EFTA) {{countries}} Norway, Island and Liechtenstein {{are connected}} to the European Union (EU) through the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. This agreement implies that {{a significant part of the}} EU legislation is to be continuously adopted by the before mentioned EEA countries. Yet, these countries have no impact on the process of forming new laws and proposals in the EU. Consequently, channels that might influence this process are of great importance to the EEA countries. The use of seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> can represent such a channel. The research question in this thesis is thus: Does the Norwegian government use seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> in the European Commission as a channel for influence, information and to acquire competence, and do the <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> behave as <b>national</b> representatives? Research on <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> has shown that they can be used as strategic instruments on behalf of national governments. Yet, studies have also indicated that the behavior of <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> is influenced by organizational and institutional factors, and the experts therefore do not act as national representatives. This thesis thus presents two hypotheses. The first hypothesis postulate that because the <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> are the only group of Norwegian national civil servants working for the Commission the government will seek to exploit the secondment system to increase their influence on the policy process. The second hypotheses expect the experts' perception of their role as independent agents for the Commission is the main obstacle for the government's effective use of the experts. This is a qualitative case study. It benefits from an original body of interview data, derived from national officials and <b>national</b> <b>experts.</b> It also includes several government documents and evaluations. The analysis finds that in spite of the fact that the experts emphasize their role as a national representative, the Norwegian government does not use the experts as strategic instruments in order to promote national interests. Thus, it is not the role perception of the <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> that represents the main obstacle for an effective use of the secondment, but a lack of coordination, and an attitude of reserve towards the use of informal channels by the national government...|$|R

2500|$|McKenzie {{soon became}} a <b>national</b> <b>expert</b> on {{government}} Indian policy, and his work in scholarly journals and government publications reached an influential audience of academics, government officials, influential Whites interested in Indian affairs, and Indians themselves. In each piece, McKenzie criticized the government's Indian policy and advanced recommendations for solving the Indian problem. This exposure, combined with his work with the Society of American Indians, provided McKenzie a prominent platform to promote his progressive vision for Indian affairs. [...] In 1908, McKenzie was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, with his dissertation, The American Indian in Relation to the White Population of the United States. [...] In 1909, he collaborated with noted anthropologist Roland Burrage Dixon of Harvard University and William Chamberlin Hunt to conduct {{a study of the}} Indian population as part of the 1910 census of the U.S. population, [...] "Indian population in the United States and Alaska", United States Bureau of the Census (1910). [...] The report represented the most comprehensive study of Indian populations to date. In 1912, McKenzie published [...] "The American Indian of Today and Tomorrow" [...] in the Journal of Race Development, and [...] "The Indian and Citizenship" [...] in the Journal of the Society of American Indians. In 1914, the Phelps-Stokes Fund, through McKenzie's friend and colleague Thomas Jesse Jones, funded a survey and report on conditions in Indian schools. McKenzie published his conclusions, [...] "The Assimilation of the American Indian", in the American Journal of Sociology. In 1928, McKenzie co-authored the Brookings Institution Meriam Report, marking the ideological shift in American Indian policy to restore of tribal self-government and communal lands.|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{executive}} institutions have largely dealt separately with {{national and international}} executive institutions (IEIs). This study unpacks and repacks four conflicting decision-making dynamics that unfolds at the frontier of IEIs – that is, at the institutional rim where national and international executive institutions meet, interact and collide. The empirical laboratory utilised is seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> in the European Commission. The survey and interview data presented demonstrates that the decision-making behaviour of seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> includes a mix of departmental (portfolio), epistemic (expert) and supranational behaviour. The suspicion early voiced by Coombes (1970) that seconded <b>national</b> <b>experts</b> to the European Commission are highly conscious of their national background and that they represent domestic Trojan horses into the European Commission is severally challenged by this study. Arguably, the decision-making dynamics observed at the frontier of the Commission seem less affected by the member-state administrations and the international organisation in which the Commission is embedded, and strongly by organizational characteristics of the Commission itself...|$|R
