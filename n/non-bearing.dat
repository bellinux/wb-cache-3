50|$|Wall framing {{in house}} {{construction}} includes the {{vertical and horizontal}} members of exterior walls and interior partitions, both of bearing walls and <b>non-bearing</b> walls. These stick members, referred to as studs, wall plates and lintels (headers), serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floor platforms, which provide the lateral strength along a wall. The platforms may be the boxed structure of a ceiling and roof, or the ceiling and floor joists of the story above. The technique is variously referred to colloquially in the building trades as stick and frame, stick and platform, or stick and box as the sticks (studs) give the structure its vertical support, and the box-shaped floor sections with joists contained within length-long post and lintels (more commonly called headers), support the weight of whatever is above, including the next wall up and the roof above the top story.

The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{intelligent}} method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect bearing defects of induction motors. In this method, the vibration signal passes through removing <b>non-bearing</b> fault component (RNFC) filter, designed by neural networks, {{in order to}} remove its <b>non-bearing</b> fault components, and then enters the second neural network that uses pattern recognition techniques for fault classification. Four different categories include; healthy, inner race defect, outer race defect, and double holes in outer race are investigated. Compared to the regular fault detection methods that use frequency-domain features, the proposed method is based on analyzing time-domain features which needs less computational effort. Moreover, machine and bearing parameters, and the vibration signal spectrum distribution are not required in this method. It is shown that better results are achieved when the filtered component of the vibration signal is used for fault classification rather than common methods that use directly vibration signal. Experimental results on three-phase induction motor verify {{the ability of the}} proposed method in fault diagnosis despite low quality (noisy) of measured vibration signal. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{viability}} of using Calcium Carbide Residue (CCR) and fly ash (FA) as a cementing agent (binder) for the manufacture of <b>non-bearing</b> masonry units without Portland Cement (PC). CCR and FA are waste products from acetylene gas factories and power plants, respectively. The test samples were made up at a binder to stone dust ratio of 1 : 8 by weight. The studied water to binder (W/B) ratios were 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00, and the CCR/FA ratios were 80 : 20, 60 : 40 and 40 : 60. The W/B ratio of 0. 75 and CCR/FA ratio of 40 : 60 {{were found to be}} an optimal mix proportion providing the highest both unit weight and strength. The higher CCR/FA ratios provide lower strength values because the silica and alumina in FA are insufficient to react with abundant Ca(OH) 2 in the CCR for the pozzolanic reaction. The optimal mix proportion provides the strength of the CCR-FA based material greater than 20 MPa, which is acceptable for <b>non-bearing</b> masonry unit. The cost analysis showed that the material costs of the CCR- FA masonry unit were 40 % lower than those of the PC masonry unit.

40|$|In trees, {{reproduction}} {{constitutes an}} important resource investment which may compete with growth for resources. However, detailed analyses on how growth and fruit production interact at the shoot level are scarce. Primary canopy growth {{depends on the}} development of current-year shoots and their secondary growth might also influence the number and size of fruits supported by them. We hypothesise that an enhanced thickening of current-year shoots is linked positively to acorn production in oaks. We analysed the effect of acorn production on shoot growth of two co-occurring Mediterranean oak species with contrasting leaf habit (Quercus ilex, Quercus faginea). Length and cross-sectional area of current-year shoots, apical bud mass, number of leaves and acorns, xylem and conductive area, number of vessels of acorn-bearing and <b>non-bearing</b> shoots were measured in summer and autumn. Nitrogen and carbohydrates analyses were also performed in stems and leaves of both shoot types. Stem cross-sectional area increased in acorn-bearing shoots when compared with <b>non-bearing</b> shoots for both species and such surplus secondary growth was observed since summer. In bearing shoots, the total transversal area occupied by vessels decreased significantly from basal to apical positions along the stem as did the xylem area and the number of vessels. Leaves of bearing shoots showed lower nitrogen concentration than those of <b>non-bearing</b> shoots. Carbohydrate concentrations did not differ in stems and leaves {{as a function of the}} presence of acorns. Such results suggest that carbohydrates may preferentially be allocated towards reproductive shoots, possibly through enhanced secondary growth, satisfying all their carbon demands for growth and reproduction. Our findings indicate that acorn production in the two studied oaks depends on shoot secondary growth. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. A. Q. A. and J. J.

40|$|In the literature, the {{designing}} of the rolled or welded, doubly symmetrical I- and H-profile bolted splice {{is usually}} {{presented with a}} load combination, which includes axial load, shear {{in one direction and}} bending in respect of strong axis. Because there often exists a load combination with biaxial bending simultaneously, the design method for calculating bolt shear forces in this situation is needed. To design the joint reliable, the distribution of the forces in the joint must be known well. In the nonbearing type joint, the forces of the splice are usually supposed to be distributed in the ratio of the cross-section stiffnesses. With this method, generally acceptable results have been achieved for the joint member stresses. In the bearing type joint, the distribution of the forces for the bolts and splice plates is not as clear as with the <b>non-bearing</b> type splice. In this research, the stiffnesses of the splice members has been used for calculating stresses also in the bearing type splice. This research belongs to the project developing biaxially loaded splice design program in Sweco Rakennetekniikka Oy.
