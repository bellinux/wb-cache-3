According to some theories, Skaryna taught as a professor at the Charles University in Prague. It is possible however it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> Presumably he died in 1551 or 1552.|$|E
25|$|A {{phenomenon}} that reached its pinnacle {{during this time}} was the general scrutiny of textbooks, especially in biology, Earth science, social studies, and literature. In the 1960s, when BSCS, whose textbooks emphasized Darwin's theory of evolution (in contrast to many high school biology texts as the time), submitted its books for state adoption in the lucrative market of Texas, serious trouble surfaced. The Reverend Ruel Lemmons led a protest (that reached the Texas Governor's office) to the get the BSCS textbooks banned claiming the books were pure evolution, completely materialistic and atheistic. The books were not banned, but there were changes made to lighten their evolutionary emphasis. Nelkin reports that BSCS had to specify that evolution theory was a theory, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> {{and that it had}} been modified, not strengthened by recent research.|$|E

500|$|Critics also {{state that}} {{evolution}} is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> In science a fact is a verified empirical observation while in colloquial contexts a fact can simply refer to anything {{for which there}} is overwhelming evidence. For example, in common usage theories such as [...] "the Earth revolves around the Sun" [...] and [...] "objects fall due to gravity" [...] may be referred to as [...] "facts," [...] even though they are purely theoretical. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, evolution may be called a [...] "fact" [...] {{for the same reason that}} gravity can: under the scientific definition, evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time. Under the colloquial definition, the theory of evolution can also be called a fact, referring to this theory's well-established nature. Thus, evolution is widely considered both a theory and a fact by scientists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} that evolution is a theory, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> {{has often been}} made against the exclusive teaching of evolution. The argument is related to a common misconception about the technical meaning of [...] "theory" [...] {{that is used by}} scientists. In common usage, [...] "theory" [...] often refers to conjectures, hypotheses, and unproven assumptions. In science, [...] "theory" [...] usually means [...] "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses." [...] For comparison, the National Academy of Sciences defines a fact as [...] "an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true'." [...] It notes, however, that [...] "truth in science ... is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "evolutionists were incredulous that creationists {{could have}} any influence." [...] A number of {{individuals}} and groups such as National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT), the National Academy of Science, and the Academic Senate of the University of California protested and lobbied against the state board's ruling. The solution to the creation - evolution issue resulted only after the state board had received numerous complaints about the earlier decision. In 1972 the California Board of Education decided to approve a statement prepared by its curriculum committee by proposing neutrality in science textbooks. Dogmatic statements in science books would be removed, and replaced with conditional statements. Textbooks dealing with evolution would have printed in them a statement indicating that science cannot answer all questions about origins, and that evolution is a theory, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> Some textbooks, even in the 1990s, contain statements to this effect, usually printed on the inside cover. The effect of this policy change prevented textbook publishers from having to include in science books, a section on [...] "creation science." [...] The board's decision, which was called the Antidogmatism Statement, caused publishers to rethink {{the way they were}} presenting science information in textbooks.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s the {{demolition}} of great country houses began to slow. However, while {{the disappearance of the}} houses eased, the dispersal of the contents of many of these near redundant museums of social history did <b>not,</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> highlighted in the early 1970s by the dispersal sale of Mentmore. [...] The high profile campaign of Marcus Binney, eminent architectural historian and President of SAVE Britain's Heritage, failed to save the mid-Victorian mansion; and the subsequent departure from Britain of many important works of art from Mentmore caused public opinion to slowly change. The house had, in fact, been offered to the nation by its owners in lieu of death duties, but the Labour Government of James Callaghan with a general election in sight did not wish to be seen saving the ancestral home of an hereditary nobleman, and thus rejected the offer. However, that same year the destruction finally came to a near standstill. This was due not just to stricter application of legislation, but also in part due to the aforementioned high-profile Destruction of the Country House exhibition held in 1974 by the Victoria and Albert Museum. However, the damage to the nation's heritage had been done.|$|E
