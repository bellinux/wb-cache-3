40|$|Nonviral gene {{delivery}} systems are {{a type of}} <b>nanocommunication</b> system that transmit plasmid packets (i. e., pDNA packets) that are programmed at the nanoscale to biological systems at the microscopic cellular level. This engineered <b>nanocommunication</b> system suffers large pDNA losses during transmission of the genetically encoded information, preventing its use in biotechnological and medical applications. The pDNA losses largely remain uncharacterized, and the ramifications of reducing pDNA loss from newly designed {{gene delivery}} systems remain difficult to predict. Here, the pDNA losses during primary and secondary transmission chains were identified utilizing a MATLAB model employing queuing theory simulating delivery of pEGFPLuc transgene to HeLa cells carried by Lipofectamine 2000 nonviral DNA carrier. Minimizing pDNA loss during endosomal escape of the primary transmission process results in increased number of pDNA in the nucleus with increased transfection, but with increased probability of cell death. The number of pDNA copies in the nucleus {{and the amount of}} time the pDNAs are in the nucleus directly correlates to improved transfection efficiency. During secondary transmission, pDNAs are degraded during distribution to daughter cells. Reducing pDNA losses improves transfection, but a balance in quantity of nuclear pDNA, mitosis, and toxicity must be considered in order to achieve therapeutically relevant transfection levels...|$|E

Communication among these nano-devices will expand the capabilities and applications of individual devices {{both in terms of}} complexity and range of operation, enabling new applications of nanotechnology in the medical, environmental and military fields as well as in consumer and industrial goods.

40|$|Nanotechnology is {{enabling}} {{the development of}} devices in a scale ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers. Communication between these devices greatly expands the possible applications, increasing the complexity and range of operation of the system. In particular, the resulting <b>nanocommunication</b> networks (or nanonetworks) show great po-tential for applications in the biomedical field, in which diffusion-based molecular commu-nication {{is regarded as a}} promising alternative to electromagnetic-based solutions due to the bio-stability and energy-related requirements of this scenario. In this new paradigm, the information is encoded into pulses of molecules that reach the receiver by means of diffusion. However, molecular signals suffer a significant amount of attenuation as they propagate through the medium, thus limiting the transmission range. In this work we propose, among others, a signal amplification scheme for molecular communication nanonetworks in which a group of emitters jointly transmits a given sig-nal after achieving synchronization by means of Quorum Sensing.

30|$|Since {{molecule}} migration naturally occurs within both {{living organisms}} and abiotic components, molecular communication is considered {{as the most}} promising approach for <b>nanocommunication</b> networks [3, 4], where the transmission and reception of information are realized through molecules. In the molecular communication model, the nanotransmitter releases molecules, which are modulated and coded to carry information, into the fluid medium. The molecules propagate to the receiver through the medium, which are demodulated and decoded to restore the information that the transmitter intends to convey. There are mainly three molecule prorogation models: walkway-based model, flow-based model, and diffusion-based model [5]. In the walkway-based model, the molecules propagate through physical pathways connecting the transmitter to the receiver, such as molecular motors [6]. In the flow-based model, the propagation of the released molecules {{is controlled by the}} predefined flow and turbulence in the medium, such as pheromonal communication [2]. In the diffusion-based model, the molecules propagate through their spontaneous diffusion in the fluid medium, such as calcium signaling among cells [7]. In this paper, we focus on the diffusion-based model since it represents the most general and widespread molecular communication architecture found in nature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} an RF nanoreceiver, {{based on}} a forest of carbon nanotube (CNT) antennas packaged together. Based on the physical model of a charged carbon nanotube under RF exposure, which is significantly different from a typical RF an-tenna, we analyze the performance of our nanoreceiver. We show that, for low signal-bandwidth applications, our nanoreceiver is highly robust, allowing for a continual operation over {{extended periods of time}} at low probabilities of error at reasonably low SNR values. For the high signal-bandwidth applications, we show that, at a given SNR, the achieved rate grows as n 1 / 4 with the number, n, of the CNTs, at reasonably low probabilities of error. Due to extremely small scale of the CNTs, many millions of CNTs can be packed into very small areas (e. g., hundreds of millions in 1 mm 2) to achieve rates comparable to the commercially available wireless receivers. Hence, a significant spatial miniaturization is achieved by our nanoreceiver compared to a classical RF receiver without a loss in the achievable rates.

30|$|Currently, {{communication}} between nanomachines {{is an important}} topic {{for the development of}} novel devices. To implement a <b>nanocommunication</b> system, diffusion-based molecular communication is considered as a promising bio-inspired approach. Various technical issues about molecular communications, including channel capacity, noise and interference, and modulation and coding, have been studied in the literature, while the resource allocation problem among multiple nanomachines has not been well investigated, which is a very important issue since all the nanomachines share the same propagation medium. Considering the limited computation capability of nanomachines and the expensive information exchange cost among them, in this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for distributed resource allocation in nanoscale molecular communication systems. We first analyze the inter-symbol and inter-user interference, as well as bit error rate performance, in the molecular communication system. Based on the interference analysis, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a non-cooperative molecule emission control game, where the Nash equilibrium is found and proved to be unique. In order to improve the system efficiency while guaranteeing fairness, we further model the resource allocation problem using a cooperative game based on the Nash bargaining solution, which is proved to be proportionally fair. Simulation results show that the Nash bargaining solution can effectively ensure fairness among multiple nanomachines while achieving comparable social welfare performance with the centralized scheme.|$|E
40|$|In {{nanoscale}} communication, diffusion-based molecular communication (DBMC) {{in which}} information is encoded into molecule patterns by a transmitter nanomachine, {{has emerged as}} a promising communication system, particularly for biomedical and healthcare applications. Although, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate and analyze DBMC systems, investigation on DBMC system through a multilayer channel has received less attention. The aims of this paper are to formulate channel characteristics and to evaluate the performance of multilayer DBMC channel in terms of delay spread and capacity. In this paper, the propagation of molecules over an n-layer channel is assumed to follow the Brownian motion and subjected to Fick's law of diffusion. Fourier transform is used to convert time to frequency domain functions. Besides, the multilayer channel is considered as a linear and deterministic channel. For the performance evaluation, the air-water-blood plasma medium representing the simplified multilayer diffusion model in the respiratory system was chosen. It was found that a high channel capacity can be achieved with wide transmission bandwidth, short transmission distance, and high averaged transmitted power. In addition, the findings showed that channel delay spread increases as both the transmission distance, and the pulse duration increased. By setting the symbol duration greater than the pulse duration or delay spread, an inter-symbol interference problem due to previous molecules transmission can be mitigated. These findings {{can be used as a}} guide in the development and fabrication of future artificial <b>nanocommunication</b> and nanonetworks systems involving multilayer transmission medium...|$|E
30|$|However, the {{resource}} allocation issue in molecular communication networks {{has not yet}} been investigated. In traditional electromagnetic wave wireless communications, when multiple users share the same resource, e.g., power and spectrum, how to allocate {{the resource}} among different users is very important to guarantee the high system efficiency while maintaining fairness [26, 27]. Similarly, in the diffusion-based molecular communications, there can be multiple transmitters sharing the same fluid medium. In such a case, interference will occur since the molecules from different transmitters are identical and indistinguishable [13]. Therefore, how to perform resource allocation among multiple transmitters, molecule emission control, is an essential problem in practical molecular communication systems. Generally, the computational capability of nanomachines is low, and the information exchange cost among them is expensive. Thus, distributed resource allocation algorithms are strongly favorable in molecular communications. Moreover, different nanomachines may be fabricated by different manufacturers and may have different objectives, e.g., in human body monitoring nanosensor networks [3], different biomedical sensors may have different functionalities and may be deployed by different doctors. Considering these problems, in this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for distributed resource allocation in diffusion-based molecular communications. The game-theoretical model provides distributed molecule emission control solutions to achieve high system efficiency, while guaranteing fairness among different nanomachines. Game theory has been corroborated as an effective tool for modeling different problems in traditional distributed wireless communication networks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses game theory to study the interactions among nanomachines in molecular communication networks, which is expected to exemplify the application of game theory in the <b>nanocommunication</b> and networking field.|$|E
40|$|Current {{developments}} in nanotechnology make electromagnetic communication (EC) possible at the nanoscale for applications involving Wireless [Body] Sensor Networks (W[B]SNs). This specialized branch of WSN {{has emerged as}} an important research area contributing to medical treatment, social welfare, and sports. The concept {{is based on the}} interaction of integrated nanoscale machines by means of wireless communications. One key hurdle for advancing nanocommunications is the lack of an apposite networking protocol to address the upcoming needs of the nanonetworks. Recently, some key challenges have been identified, such as nanonodes with extreme energy constraints, limited computational capabilities, Terahertz frequency bands with limited transmission range, etc., in designing protocols for wireless nanosensor networks (WNN). This work proposes an improved performance scheme of <b>nanocommunication</b> over Terahertz bands for wireless BSNs making it suitable for smart e-health applications. The scheme contains [...] a new energy-efficient forwarding routine for EC in WNN consisting of hybrid clusters with centralized scheduling, a model designed for channel behavior taking into account the aggregated impact of molecular absorption, spreading loss, and shadowing, and an energy model for energy harvesting and consumption. The outage probability is derived for both single and multilinks and extended to determine the outage capacity. The outage probability for a multilink is derived using a cooperative fusion technique at a predefined fusion node. Simulated using a Nano-Sim simulator, performance of the proposed model has been evaluated for energy efficiency, outage capacity, and outage probability. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through maximized energy utilization in both single and multihop communication, multisensor fusion enhances the link quality of the transmission.

40|$|In {{nanoscale}} communication, diffusion-based molecular communication (DBMC) {{in which}} information is encoded into molecule patterns by a transmitter nanomachine, {{has emerged as}} a promising communication system, particularly for biomedical and healthcare applications. Although, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate and analyze DBMC systems, investigation on DBMC system through a multilayer channel has received less attention. The aims of this research are to mathematically model a closed-form expression of mean molecular concentration over multilayer DBMC channel, to formulate channel characteristics, and to conduct performance evaluation of multilayer DBMC channel. In the mathematical model, the propagation of molecules over an n-layer channel is assumed to follow the Brownian motion and subjected to Fick’s law of diffusion. The partial differential equation (PDE) of the time rate change of molecular concentration is obtained by modeling the n-layer channel as an n-resistor in series and considering the conservation law of molecules. Fourier transform and Laplace transform were used to obtain the solution for the PDE, which represents the mean molecular concentration at a receiver nanomachine. In the formulation, channel characteristics such as impulse response, time delay, attenuation or the maximum peak, delay spread and capacity were analytically obtained from the mean molecular concentration. In this stage, the multilayer channel is considered as a linear and deterministic channel. For the performance evaluation, the air-waterblood plasma medium representing the simplified multilayer diffusion model in the respiratory system was chosen. It was found that both analytical and simulation results of mean molecular concentration using Matlab and N 3 Sim were in good agreement. In addition, the findings showed that the higher the average diffusion coefficient resulted in a smaller dispersion of channel impulse response, and shortened the channel delay spread as well as time delay. However, the channel attenuation remains unchanged. In the performance evaluation, an increase of 100 % in the transmission distance increased the time delay by 300 % but decreased the maximum peak of molecular concentration by 87. 5 %. A high channel capacity can be achieved with wide transmission bandwidth, short transmission distance, and high average transmitted power. These findings {{can be used as a}} guide in the development and fabrication of future artificial <b>nanocommunication</b> and nanonetwork systems involving multilayer transmission medium.
