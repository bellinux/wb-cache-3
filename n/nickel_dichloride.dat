The preparation and characterisation of the phosphonium salts [R 2 P(CH 2 OH) 2]+X- (R = Ph, Cy, C 8 H 14; X- = C 1 -, HSO 4 -) and the preparation and characterisation of aminomethylphosphines are presented in Chapter 2. Treatment of the mixed isomers of the salt [C 8 H 14 P(CH 2 OH) 2]+X- in boiling sulphuric acid gives the 3, 3, 1 isomer by decomposition of the 4, 2, 1 isomer. The X-ray crystal structure of [PH 2 P(CH 2 OH) 2]+C 1 - shows hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups and chlorine anion. Treatment of the reported phosphonium salts with triethylamine and a primary or secondary amine gave aminomethylphosphines in good yields. The 1 H, 13 C and 31 P n. m. r. spectra are reported for all important aminomethylphosphines. The novel nature of the 1 H n. m. r. signals for the methylene protons, in the PCH 2 N link of these phosphines have been investigated using two-dimensional (31 P- 1 H) (HSC) n. m. r. and variable temperature n. m. r. spectra. The X-ray crystal structure of (Cy 2 PCH 2) 2 NCHMePh reveals the bulky nature of the phosphine and the relationship between the methylene protons and phosphorus in the solid state. In Chapter 3 a variety of transition metal complexes have been prepared using aminomethylphosphines of the type (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR' reported in Chapter 2. The preparation and characterisation of cis platinum(II), palladium(II) and <b>nickel</b> (II) <b>dichloride</b> complexes is described together with the X-ray crystal structure of cis-[PdC 12 (Ph 2 PCH 2) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 OH] which shows the phosphine in a six-membered chelate chair conformation. Cobalt(II) dichloride, and molybdenum(0) and tungsten(0) tetracarbonyl complexes of the bis-amino- methylphosphines are also prepared and characterised. Treatment of [Rh (COD) Cl] 2 with a phosphine in the presence of KPF 6 gave hydrogenation catalyst precursors of the type [Rh(COD) (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR'] PF 6 in good yields. Treatment of the cis-Pt(II) aminomethylphosphine complexes with SnC 12 gave [PtC 1 (SnCl 3) (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR'] complexes which displayed poor solubility. Reactions of the phosphine (Cy 2 PCH 2) 2 NCHMePh with various metal complexes have been investigated, as have some reactions of Pt(II) dichloride, diphosphine complexes. The last Chapter investigates the use of Rh(I) and Pt(II) aminomethylphosphine complexes in catalytic hydrogenation and hydroformylation. The catalytic hydrogenation of ?-acetamidocinnamic acid using [Rh(COD) - (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR'] +PF 6 -catalyst precursors at 1. 1 atmospheres of H 2, gave N-acetylphenylalanine in good yields but only as racemic mixtures. The hydroformylation of styrene at 100 atmospheres of CO/H 2 and at 60 °C using a [PtCl 2 (R 2 PCH 2) 2 NR'] + SnCl 2 catalyst system gave low yields of 2 -phenylpro-panal with optical inductions of up to 31 % and high branched to chain product ratios, up to 36 : 1.

The quantum chemical analyses were performed by density functional theory (DFT) using B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G (d, p) basis set. The calculated first order hyperpolarizability of GNC is 0. 233 x 10 - 30 e. s. u. The HOMO and LUMO energies show that charge transfer occurs within molecule.

Advanced optoelectronic technology requires nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for frequency conversion, optical modulation and optical switching [1, 2]. Efforts have been made on the amino acid mixed organic and inorganic complexes for suitable device applications. The intense charge transfer between metal and ligands causes NLO nature and good transparency in visible region and high resistance to optical damage [3, 4].

40|$|Bidentate pyridine-phosphine ligands 1 {{of general}} {{structure}} 2 -aryl- 6 -[2 -(diphenylphosphino) ethyl]pyridine were developed, {{in which the}} aryl group is phenyl (a), 1 -naphthyl (b), 9 -phenanthryl (c), 9 -anthracyl (d), and ferrocenyl (e). The influence of these substituents on the nickel and palladium complexes of the ligands and their ethene oligomerization behavior was studied. The largest influence was observed in species with a square-planar surrounded metal center, whereas the <b>nickel</b> <b>dichloride</b> complexes 5 appeared as monometallic species with a tetrahedrally surrounded metal center. A classical binding mode of the ligand was not possible for the methylpalladium chloride complexes coordinated in a square-planar fashion. Instead, binuclear species in which two ligands span two metal centers were observed for 6 a−d, and an undefined mixture of complexes was obtained for 6 e. In contrast to these neutral palladium complexes, the cationic methylpalladium complexes 7, lacking the chloride anion, appear as well-defined, monomeric complexes. When the nickel complexes 5 a−d were activated with MAO, they catalyzed the oligomerization of ethene with a maximum turnover frequency of 11 × 103 mol ethene per mol nickel per hour, whereas 5 e showed no activity. Selectivities for butenes were between 93 and 97 mol %, with a maximum 1 -butene content of 93 %. The catalytic behavior {{is different from that}} of the nickel complex lacking an aromatic group at the ligand, again showing the influence of these substituents.

Several bands have been recorded and analyzed for three isotopomers, 58 Ni 35 Cl 2, 60 Ni 35 Cl 2, and 58 Ni 35 Cl 37 Cl in natural abundance. Spin components with O values of 0 and 1 {{have been identified in}} both the upper and lower states of the transition. Accurate values for all three vibrational intervals ? 1, ? 2, and ? 3 have been determined for <b>nickel</b> <b>dichloride</b> in the upper state and for the bending wave number ? 2 in the lower state. The results show that the molecule is linear in both states involved in the transition and that the lower (ground) state is 3 S-g in character.

The phosphorus substituents in these bidentates are 2 -tolyl, 2 -anisyl, and mesityl. The ligands could be conveniently synthesized in good yields. The <b>nickel</b> <b>dichloride</b> complexes of the ligands are paramagnetic. The metal centers have a distorted tetrahedral geometry, as was {{evident from the}} crystal structures and the magnetic moments in solution. The neutral methylpalladium chloride and the cationic methylpalladium complexes have a distorted square-planar geometry around the metal center. For the complexes {{of two of the}} ligands, an anagostic C−H···Pd interaction of a ligand-proton with the palladium atom was observed in the crystal structures and in solution. These interactions probably were related to hindered inversion of the six-membered metallocycle, which was observed in VT-NMR measurements. The complexes of the mesityl-substituted ligand show neither hindered inversion of the metal chelate ring nor a sign of Pd···H interactions. The nickel complexes form active catalysts for the oligomerization of ethene after MAO activation. The bulky 2 -tolyl and mesityl groups suppress isomerization of the growing chain, reflected in a high 1 -butene selectivity. For the complex made from the ligand with the most bulky (mesityl) substituents, this selectivity was 90 %. The anisyl substituents induced a different catalytic behavior of the corresponding nickel complex. Selectivity for 1 -butene was lower, but the productivity was higher, with a turnover frequency of 65 × 10 (3) (mol C 2 H 4) ·(mol Ni·h) (− 1).

Cationic monomethyl and mono-η 3 -benzyl complexes are generated from these dialkyl complexes by protonation with [H(OEt 2) 2]+[B(3, 5 -(CF 3) 2 C 6 H 3) 4]−, while the complex [(dtbpm κ 2 P) Ni(η 3 -CH(CH 2 Ph) Ph]+[B(3, 5 -(CF 3) 2 C 6 H 3) 4]−is obtained from protonation of the Ni(0) olefin complex (dtbpm-κ 2 P) N(η 2 -trans-stilbene). Crystal structures of examples of dichlorides, dimethyl, dibenzyl, cationic methyl, and cationic η 3 -benzyl complexes are reported. Solutions of the cations polymerize ethylene under mild conditions and without the necessity of an activating agent, to form polyethylene having high molecular weights and low degrees of chain branching. In comparison to the Ni methyl cations, the η 3 -benzyl cation complexes are more stable and somewhat less active but still very efficient in C 2 H 4 polymerization. The effect on the resulting polyethylene of varying the substituents R, R′ on the phosphine ligand has been examined, and a clear trend for longer chain PE with less branching in the presence of more bulky substituents on the diphosphine has been found.
