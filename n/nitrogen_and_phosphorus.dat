5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E

40|$|After {{the storage}} of Three Gorges Reservoir, the water {{environment}} of the water-back up area of Wujiang River will change. In order {{to search for the}} effects of the environmental factors on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa, which is the dominant species of blue algae in this area, a simulation experiment was designed to study the effects of different environmental factors, including seasonal characteristic (different temperature <b>and</b> illumination), total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> total <b>phosphorus</b> concentration, on the growth of M. aeruginosa under the quiescent culture. The specific growth rate (μ) was used to assess the growth of M. aeruginosa. It was found that:(1) Under the same original concentration of total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> total <b>phosphorus,</b> the value of μ in summer was significant higher than that in spring and winter, but {{there was no difference between}} the value of μ in spring and winter;(2) Under the same season, the value of μ of M. aeruginosa increased with the increase of total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> total <b>phosphorus</b> concentration, the difference of the value of μ among different total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> total <b>phosphorus</b> concentration was biggest in summer;(3) In this experiment, there was no interaction between season <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>phosphorus</b> nutrients. The results demonstrated that: under the quiescent culture, M. aeruginosa grew better in summer than in spring and winter; the higher concentration of total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> total <b>phosphorus,</b> the higher growth of M. aeruginosa; the effect of season on the growth of M. aeruginosa was more important than the effects of nutrients...|$|R

5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus.</b> The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the water}} quality of the lake in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.|$|E
40|$|This work {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} effects of ozonation treatment on waste sludge. During the treatment process, various parameters characterizing sludge were investigated.

With the increase of ozone dose, the settleability and water content of sludge improved obviously, but the filterability of sludge deteriorated drastically. In addition, the evolution of particle size was evaluated, which proved the breakup of sludge flocs and cells. There existed a threshold of ozone dose which was 0. 04 g O- 3 / gMLSS in this work. Above the threshold, the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), protein, carbohydrate, total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> total <b>phosphorus</b> in supernatant increased remarkably and the electron transport system (ETS) sludge activity decreased.

5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Wind gusts {{in central}} Maryland peaked at 83mph (134km/h) in Silver Spring, with a {{location}} along the Patuxent River recording sustained winds of 55mph (88km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> and {{millions of gallons of}} raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result of}} a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E

25|$|Wastewater {{may contain}} {{high levels of}} the {{nutrients}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus.</b> Excessive release to the environment {{can lead to a}} buildup of nutrients, called eutrophication, which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, algae, and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). This may cause an algal bloom, a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate drinking water supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizal fungi {{are found}} {{throughout}} boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems, primarily among the dominant woody-plant-producing families (3.1.a).

25|$|In a plant {{such as the}} Venus Flytrap {{that can}} make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the {{traditional}} objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (<b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> <b>phosphorus</b> in particular) that {{are in short supply}} in its boggy, acidic habitat.|$|E
25|$|Being {{carnivorous}} {{allows the}} plant to grow better when the soil contains little nitrate or phosphate.
