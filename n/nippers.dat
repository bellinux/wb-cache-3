25|$|The narrator, an elderly, unnamed Manhattan {{lawyer with}} a {{comfortable}} business, already employs two scriveners to copy legal documents by hand, <b>Nippers</b> and Turkey.

25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} {{tinsmith}} require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and <b>nippers</b> for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and fire pot were needed to do this.|$|E

That {{finding out}} the {{influence}} of <b>nipper</b> machine parameters on <b>nipper</b> holding process performances in comber has biggish direction means on most parameters choice of comber and new comber design and use. Using resolution way of machine moving analysis means, {{on the base of}} <b>nipper</b> machine structure analysis and moving modeling, by computer, <b>nipper</b> process performances in condition of different eccentric shaft parameters on new comber were calculated and analysed, the relations between eccentric shaft speed ratio, steeve length and <b>nipper</b> opening amount, opening-closing timing, <b>nipper</b> pressure were discussed. Conclusions indicate that: in certain range, the decrease of eccentric shaft speed ratio and steeve length can make <b>nipper</b> opening timing advance and <b>nipper</b> opening amount increase before detaching beginning, which is beneficial to cotton-cluster rising advanced combed by cylinder and comber detaching-overlapping work...|$|R

Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line up straight with both bones in the pastern. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E

50|$|A huge, four-ton <b>Nipper</b> {{can be seen}} on {{the roof}} of the old RTA (former RCA distributor) {{building}} now owned by Arnoff Moving & Storage and located at 991 Broadway in Albany, New York. A second slightly smaller one was purchased by Jim Wells from RCA in Baltimore for $1. After spending many years on private property in <b>Nipper</b> Park in Merrifield, Virginia, perched over Lee Highway (US Route 29), has now been returned to Baltimore, Maryland, where it originally graced the former RCA Building on Russell Street. <b>Nipper</b> now sits atop the Maryland Historical Society building at Park Avenue and West Centre Street in Baltimore. Though smaller than the Albany <b>Nipper,</b> Baltimore's is the only one of the two to include a gramophone for <b>Nipper</b> to listen to. The Baltimore <b>Nipper</b> was saved when the Virginia site where he briefly resided was sold to developers. It is currently the location of a group of townhomes.

2500|$|... "Bartleby" [...] {{is set in}} the Wall Street {{office of}} a New York lawyer, who is the narrator of the tale. His new, pale-looking clerk Bartleby refuses to copy {{documents}} without giving any other explanation than the repeated mantra: [...] "I would prefer not to." [...] The lawyer cannot bring himself to remove his clerk from his office and finally resorts to moving out himself. Leading scholar on the short fiction Merton Sealts notes that in [...] "Bartleby" [...] knowing references to current events occur, and the supporting characters of <b>Nippers,</b> Turkey, and the errand boy Ginger Nut [...] "could easily have come from the pen of Dickens, Lamb, or Irving." ...|$|E
2500|$|The narrator, Bartleby's employer, {{provides}} a first-person narration of his experiences working with Bartleby. He portrays {{himself as a}} generous man, although there are instances in the text that question his reliability. His kindness may be derived from his curiosity and fascination for Bartleby. [...] Moreover, once Bartleby's work ethic begins to decline, the narrator still allows his employment to continue, perhaps out {{of a desire to}} avoid confrontation. He also portrays himself as tolerant towards the other employees, Turkey and <b>Nippers,</b> who are unproductive at different points in the day; however, this simply re-introduces the narrator's non-confrontational nature. Throughout the story, the narrator is torn between his feelings of responsibility for Bartleby and his desire to be rid of the threat that Bartleby poses to the office and to his way of life on Wall Street. [...] Ultimately, the story may be more about the narrator than Bartleby, not only because the narrator attempts to understand Bartleby's behavior, but also because of the rationales he provides for his interactions with and reactions to Bartleby. [...] The narrator's detached attitude, towards life in general, and his compatriots in particular, seems to become increasingly compromised as the story goes on through his emotional and moral entanglement with Bartleby, culminating in the story's pivotal final line [...] "Ah Bartleby! [...] Ah humanity!" ...|$|E

But indeed, nature herself {{seemed to have been}} his vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, <b>Nippers</b> would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for <b>Nippers,</b> brandy and water were altogether superfluous.|$|E
