5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions.

A field experiment was conducted in a hilly area of inner Sicily, Italy, to determine whether symbiosis with AM fungi can mitigate the detrimental effects of drought stress (which in the Mediterranean often occurs during the late period of the growing season) on forage yield and symbiotic N 2 fixation of berseem clover. Soil was either left under water stress (i. e., rain-fed conditions) or the crop was well-watered.

40|$|Nutrients are {{supplied}} to the mixed {{layer of the}} open ocean by either atmospheric deposition or mixing from deeper waters, and these nutrients drive <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>fixation.</b> To evaluate the importance of atmospheric deposition, we estimate marine <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>fixation</b> from present-day simulations of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, phosphorus and iron. These are compared with observed rates of marine <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>fixation.</b> We find that Fe deposition {{is more important than}} P deposition in supporting N fixation. Estimated rates of atmospherically-supported carbon fixation are considerably lower than rates of marine carbon fixation derived from remote sensing, indicating the subsidiary role atmospheric deposition plays in total C uptake by the oceans. Nonetheless, in high nutrient, low chlorophyll areas, the contribution of atmospheric deposition of Fe to the surface ocean could account for about 50 % of C fixation. In marine areas typically thought to be N limited, potential C fixation supported by atmospheric deposition of N is only ~ 1 ¿ 2 % of observed rates. Although these systems are N-limited, the amount of N supplied from below appears to be much larger than that deposited from above. Atmospheric deposition of Fe has the potential to augment atmospherically-supported rates of C fixation in N limited areas. In these areas, atmospheric Fe relieves the Fe limitation of diazotrophic organisms, thus contributing to the rate of N fixation. The most important uncertainties in understanding the relative importance of different atmospheric nutrients are poorly understood speciation and solubility of Fe as well as the N:Fe ratio of diazotrophic organisms.
