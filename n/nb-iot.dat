30|$|As a r{{evolutionary}} and evolutionary regime of traditional grid, {{advanced metering infrastructure}} (AMI) has attracted rapidly growing attention in different areas. In this paper, we focused on reducing the deployment cost and prolonging network lifetime of AMI by introducing <b>NB-IoT</b> technology which could provide minimized power consumption and enhanced coverage. First, we presented a survey of AMI communication requirements mainly in terms of coverage range, data rate, and latency, and then studied the <b>NB-IoT</b> technology. Compared with the theoretical communication requirements of WAN/NAN/HAN, <b>NB-IoT</b> may be very suitable for some applications in HAN/NAN. Later, the five key technologies of <b>NB-IoT</b> were emphasized on. These could make this technology easier to understand and also help to achieve a more effective analysis of the performance in real-world <b>NB-IoT</b> network. Finally, {{the results from the}} aspects of coverage, reliability, latency, and battery life were presented, the performance was analyzed and discussed, and some options which can be used to improve performance were also proposed. These results demonstrated the potential of <b>NB-IoT</b> to support AMI. At the same time, the security issue of <b>NB-IoT</b> technology was also concerned. As a relatively new technology, <b>NB-IoT</b> may bring some worries to the customers, as discussed in the previous section, but they could be effectively and properly solved. It is foreseen that the new technology <b>NB-IoT</b> will be robust enough to support and boost AMI in smart grid.|$|E
30|$|The {{contributions}} of the paper are listed as follows: First, most of <b>NB-IoT</b> technology researches {{are based on the}} theoretical or simulated analysis, rarely related to the real-world <b>NB-IoT</b> network, so our research fills that gap.

Third, <b>NB-IoT</b> is a new technology; many customers and companies still have many concerns about the NB technology, and our research have demonstrated the potential of <b>NB-IoT</b> to support and boost AMI in smart grid which would contribute to the promotion and application of <b>NB-IoT</b> technology.|$|E
40|$|The Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) {{published}} LTE release 13, which standardized a new {{radio access}} network (RAN) called Narrowband Internet of Things (<b>NB-IoT).</b> Such networks, particularly designed for massive machine-type communications (mMTC), inherit theIR functionalities from the existing LTE systems with slight differences and operate in a narrow frequency band of 180 kHz, consisting of one resource block (RB) of 12 LTE subcarriers. This thesis is mainly focused on single-tone in-band transmission with one 15 kHz subcarrier of the <b>NB-IoT</b> RB {{in the middle of}} the LTE RBs. The aim of this thesis is to examine the performance of both <b>NB-IoT</b> transmission and LTE transmission after certain enhancements of the <b>NB-IoT</b> transmitter. These additional approaches including time-domain windowing and filtering. Also a nonlinear power amplifier model for the <b>NB-IoT</b> transmitter is included in the study. It is worth to mention that <b>NB-IoT</b> and LTE signals are transmitted together through asynchronous channels to evaluate the effect of noise and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). In order to compare the effects of different modulation schemes, 4 -QAM and 64 -QAM are both considered for LTE transmission. Filters are designed to suppress the spectral sidelobes of transmitted signals to reduce the interferences due to asynchronous operation. What’s more, transmissions with one-subcarrier-wide guard band between the active <b>NB-IoT</b> and LTE subcarriers or without guard band are both examined from bit error-rate (BER) perspective...|$|E

Consequently, a new channel equalization algorithm is proposed based on the derived effective CFR. In addition, the interference is derived analytically to facilitate the co-existence of <b>NB-IoT</b> and LTE signals.

40|$|Narrowband Internet of Things (<b>NB-IoT)</b> is {{standardized}} by 3 GPP as a novel radio-access {{scheme for}} next-generation IoT technology. In-band operation mode, {{as one of}} its deployment methods, shares the spectrum of LTE. To avoid interference leakage on adjacent resource blocks (RBs), the spectrum sharing system needs a spectrally well-localized waveform. In this thesis, we investigate filtered-OFDM waveform for <b>NB-IoT</b> in-band system. This is achieved by designing and exploiting optimized filter for each sub-band. Specifically, the optimum filter needs a suitable length, a relatively narrowed transition band, and adequate stopband attenuation, which efficiently reduces the required guard-band, minimizing the related overhead in resource usage. In the experiments, we simplify the system model by shifting the <b>NB-IoT</b> RB {{to the center of the}} LTE spectrum. Firstly, we test potential filter types with various transition bands, selecting suitable filter configurations with acceptable performance when the system operates under carrier frequency offset (CFO) of half subcarrier spacing. Then, we define two different power level test cases, which are based on the minimum SNR for 1 % uncoded bit-error rate (BER), for examining <b>NB-IoT</b> and LTE error tolerance in asynchronous cases, when <b>NB-IoT</b> system fails to synchronize to the time-frequency alignment of LTE. Finally, the system performance in a multipath channel is evaluated. With filtered-OFDM, the out-of-band emission is suppressed effectively and the tolerance to time and frequency offset is significantly improved, which makes the proposed scheme suitable for supporting asynchronous <b>NB-IoT</b> operation...|$|E
40|$|Narrowband {{internet}} {{of things}} (<b>NB-IoT)</b> is an emerging cellular technology that will provide improved coverage for massive number of low-throughput low-cost devices with low device power consumption in delay-tolerant applications. A new single tone signal with frequency hopping has been designed for <b>NB-IoT</b> physical random access channel (NPRACH). In this letter we describe this new NPRACH design and explain in detail the design rationale. We further propose possible receiver algorithms for NPRACH detection and time-of-arrival estimation. Simulation results on NPRACH performance including detection rate, false alarm rate, and time-of-arrival estimation accuracy are presented {{to shed light on}} the overall potential of <b>NB-IoT</b> systems.

40|$|In this letter, {{we propose}} an {{enhanced}} Access Reservation Protocol (ARP) with a partial preamble transmission (PPT) {{mechanism for the}} narrow band Internet of Things (<b>NB-IoT)</b> systems.

We provide an analytical model that captures {{the performance of the}} proposed ARP in terms of false alarm, mis-detection and collision probabilities. Moreover, we investigate a trade-off between the mis-detection and the collision probabilities, and optimize the proposed ARP according to the system loads. The results show that the proposed ARP outperforms the conventional <b>NB-IoT</b> ARP, in particular at heavier system loads...|$|E
30|$|Latency {{defines the}} maximum {{time during which}} a {{particular}} message should reach its destination through <b>NB-IoT</b> network. Network topology directly affects the latency, and the data rate supported by <b>NB-IoT</b> also dictates the speed of information exchange. <b>NB-IoT</b> {{can be considered as}} a near-real-time network, and it targets latency-insensitive applications, while it still expects the exception report, latency of 10 s or less is required for 99 % of the devices [34]. In our experiment, the latency between the devices and OceanConnect platform describing the performance of <b>NB-IoT</b> was discussed. In uplink, the latency was less than 2 s for each packet (30 bytes). But for the downlink, it had a close relationship with the access point names (APNs) which defined whether the DRX/eDRX/PSM mode was enable, and the parameters of different timers, such as active timer and the driven time of the packets, were also an important element. For example, when the device was set to APN_CTNB, the latency would be less than 2 s if OceanConnect platform replied to a message received within less than 20 s. Otherwise, the message would not be received because the device had been in PSM mode. For AMI applications, the uplink latency could be acceptable for smart devices and data collectors, but the downlink latency may affect the execution of instructions coming from the server if the APN is not suitable. For instance, if we select <b>NB-IoT</b> as the communication technology between the concentrators and the main station, the <b>NB-IoT</b> devices should not be set to APN_CTNB, due to the requirements of Q/GDW 376.1 - 2009 protocol.|$|E
30|$|Note that LTE uses QPSK, 16 -QAM, and 64 -QAM [6], while <b>NB-IoT</b> does only support QPSK [11].|$|E
30|$|Narrowband {{technology}} {{can provide a}} higher power spectral density (PSD) for <b>NB-IoT</b> with respect to LTE. <b>NB-IoT</b> is kept to a bandwidth of 180 kHz corresponding to one PRB of LTE network for both downlink and uplink [29]. In the downlink, <b>NB-IoT</b> is based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with 15 kHz subcarriers spacing and each OFDM symbol consists of 12 subcarriers, while single-tone and multi-tone operations are supported in the uplink. 3.75 kHz and 15 kHz subcarrier spacing can be both used in single-tone operation, and 15 kHz is supported with single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) [29, 30]. This means each OFDM symbol has 12 or 48 subcarriers. <b>NB-IoT</b> inherits LTE, and the node transmission power is still 43 dBm {{which is the same}} as in LTE. It results in a better PSD that would improve the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at least by a factor of about 11 dB, so it allows the node to reach higher covered distance compared to the GSM case under the same conditions.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{deployments}} {{of massive}} Machine Type Communications (mMTC) involve several challenges on cellular networks. To address {{the challenges of}} mMTC, or more generally, Internet of Things (IoT), the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project has developed NarrowBand IoT (<b>NB-IoT)</b> as part of Release 13. <b>NB-IoT</b> {{is designed to provide}} better indoor coverage, support of a massive number of low-throughput devices, with relaxed delay requirements, and lower-energy consumption. <b>NB-IoT</b> reuses Long Term Evolution functionality with simplifications and optimizations. Particularly for small data transmissions, <b>NB-IoT</b> specifies two procedures to reduce the required signaling: one of them based on the Control Plane (CP), and the other on the User Plane (UP). In this work, we provide an overview of these procedures as well as an evaluation of their performance. The results of the energy consumption show both optimizations achieve a battery lifetime extension of more than 2 years for a large range in the considered cases, and up to 8 years for CP with good coverage. In terms of cell capacity relative to SR, CP achieves gains from 26 % to 224 %, and UP ranges from 36 % to 165 %. The comparison of CP and UP optimizations yields similar results, except for some specific configurations. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Networks Magazine. 17 pages, 5 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
30|$|Secondly, {{once the}} needs of the <b>NB-IoT</b> service to be {{deployed}} are specified, the devices would provide accurate readings automatically at requested time intervals to access points, data collectors, or aggregation nodes.

30|$|Since {{the first}} <b>NB-IoT</b> {{commercial}} network was {{opened in the}} small town of Hongshan in Wuxi, China, <b>NB-IoT</b> technology has become the main topic of fervent research and development at both commercial and academic level.

This technology solution has led to success in many commercial applications in China, such as smart parking, intelligent building, and water/gas metering. It seems to be very attractive to AMI applications due to its good performance as discussed in previous section and its high degree of deployment.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have been}} widely used in industrial systems that demand a high degree of reliability and real-time performance in communications. However, because of limited network resources and delays caused by transmission conflicts and channel contention, many industrial applications cannot meet these demands. To resolve these issues, we introduce Narrow Band Internet of Things (<b>NB-IoT)</b> technology into industrial networks to reduce transmission delays. Two challenges are addressed in this work: (1) the primary goal is to guarantee the schedulability of the system, so the controller must determine when <b>NB-IoT</b> nodes transmit to base stations; and (2) because communication through the base station is a paid service, the controller must minimize the use of <b>NB-IoT</b> slots. We resolve these issues via a scheduling analysis and transmission mode selection. In addition, we propose a Path Selection Algorithm (PSA) to improve the schedulability of the industrial system.

30|$|The {{deployment}} cost {{of advanced}} metering infrastructure (AMI), {{one of the key}} elements for smart grid, often arises from three sub-systems, respectively referred to as data management system, communication network, and smart devices. Among them, the costs of communication network account for a considerable proportion. In smart grid, smart devices are generally fixed in a certain position and schedule reading of interval meter data. They do not only cover smart meters, but also extend gas, water meters, and other sensors measuring light, humidity, and temperature. Many of them are often with battery supply, and this will bring utilization constraints especially in communication network. The deployment needs of reducing cost and the energy-constrained network for an extremely large-scale AMI infrastructure both require optimum communication technologies that consider energy consumption, minimize energy use, simplify network topology, and prolong network lifetime. As an emerging 3 GPP radio interface technology specifically designed for low power wide area networks (LPWANs), Narrowband Internet of Things (<b>NB-IoT)</b> inherits from the existing LTE but does many simplifications. Its most prominent features, enhanced coverage and low power consumption, are being pursued for a large-scale AMI communication network. In this paper, we provide a survey of AMI communication, emphasize on the key technologies of <b>NB-IoT,</b> analyze the performance of <b>NB-IoT</b> network over a real-world, and demonstrate the potential of <b>NB-IoT</b> to support and boost AMI in smart grid.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, <b>NB-IoT</b> {{technology}} inherits LTE/ 4 G, and {{the exciting}} base stations with upgraded hardware or software are utilized. Therefore, its network connection and distance converge {{depend on the}} availability of cellular services. Unfortunately, cellular services are badly dependent on the infrastructure. The weaker resilience against natural disasters, like tsunami, hurricane, and cyclones, or man-made, like terrorist attack, massive power failure, more time of recovering from emergencies caused by cellular services sharing with mobile customers, and current inadequate maintenance mechanisms of utility companies would make some customers be hesitant to rely on <b>NB-IoT</b> network at the present stage.|$|E

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on <b>NB-IoT</b> and LoRa as efficient solutions connecting the devices.

30|$|Low power {{wide area}} network (LPWAN) has become an {{exciting}} new trend {{in the development of}} the wireless communication system since it was first proposed as a class of wireless technology used for machine-to-machine (M 2 M) or Internet of Things (IoT) communications in 2013. Compared with traditional wireless technologies such as mesh, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular, LPWAN has longer lifetime of nodes, lower transceiver chip cost, and larger coverage area, and these main characteristics distinguish itself from other technologies [10]. So far, many of the LPWA technologies have emerged in both unlicensed and licensed markets, such as LTE-M, weightless, SigFox, LoRa, and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT)[11]. Among them, <b>NB-IoT</b> that was standardized in Release 13 of 3 GPP’s specification in 2016 is one of the leading emergent technologies. The performance objectives of <b>NB-IoT</b> are to provide high coverage (20 dB improvement compared to GPRS), low device power consumption (a battery life of up to more than 10 years), low delay sensitivity (less than 10 s), massive capacity (cell-site sector, at least 52, 547 devices), and ultralow device cost (less than $ 5) [12]. These enable a high potential for realization of AMI applications. So we establish a set of experimental system based on China Telecom <b>NB-IoT</b> network and commercial cloud platform, choose different data sources, compare the performance of <b>NB-IoT</b> over a real world with the requirements of AMI communication, analyze the feasibility, and introduce the technology to boost AMI applications.|$|E
30|$|Thirdly, {{the data}} from smart {{metering}} networks generally reveal {{a wealth of information}} that linked with individuals or companies; thus, its privacy is important to the users’ acceptance. The data interval collection disseminated to different components through <b>NB-IoT</b> network enables the utility companies easily control the information management process and further gives rises to the data privacy problem. The privacy of data concerns the security of itself, and users would need to be reassured that their data is secure. For <b>NB-IoT</b> network, some users express their concerns that their data may be intentionally leaked and even used for purposes beyond energy efficiency by the network maintainers.|$|E

In this letter, we model RACH in the <b>NB-IoT</b> network {{taking into account}} the repeated preamble transmission and collision using stochastic geometry. We derive the exact expression of RACH success probability under time correlated interference, and validate the analysis with different repetition values via independent simulations. Numerical results have shown that the repetition scheme can efficiently improve the RACH success probability in a light traffic scenario, but only slightly improves that performance with very inefficient channel resource utilization in a heavy traffic scenario...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} time-of-arrival (ToA) {{estimation of}} a first arrival-path for a device working in narrowband Internet-of-Things (<b>NB-IoT)</b> systems. Due to a limited 180 KHz bandwidth used in <b>NB-IoT,</b> the time-domain auto-correlation function (ACF) of transmitted NB positioning reference signal (NPRS) has a wide main lobe. Without considering that, the performance of ToA estimation can be degraded for two reasons. Firstly, under multiple-path channel environments, the NPRS corresponding to different received paths are superimposed on each other, {{and so are the}} cross-correlations corresponding to them. Secondly, the measured peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) used for detecting the presence of NPRS is inaccurate. Therefore, in this paper we propose a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) based method to jointly estimate the number of channel taps, the channel coefficients and the corresponding delays in <b>NB-IoT</b> systems, with considering the imperfect ACF of NPRS. Such a proposed method only uses the time-domain cross-correlations between the received signal and the transmitted NPRS, and has a low complexity. We show through simulations that, the ToA estimation of the proposed method performs close to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for a single-path channel, and significantly outperforms a traditional ToA estimator that uses signal-to-noise (SNR) or power thresholds based estimation.
