5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} <b>novel</b> by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the <b>novel</b> follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing <b>novel,</b> and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin's following <b>novel,</b> Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E
5|$|Boyd closely {{based his}} version of the Bond {{character}} on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed any of the film versions. The <b>novel</b> is set in 1969—six years after Fleming's last work was set—and Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria and used his experiences during the civil war to provide the location for the <b>novel.</b> He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing the <b>novel</b> he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write the <b>novel,</b> with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond.|$|E
5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} <b>novel.</b> The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, {{reinforces}} {{the theme of}} the changing self in the <b>novel.</b> Many plot points simply fade away. The <b>novel</b> received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the <b>novel</b> {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the <b>novel,</b> like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the <b>novel</b> explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the <b>novel</b> has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E
