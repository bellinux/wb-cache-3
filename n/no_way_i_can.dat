2500|$|... 1: The Sumo Association [...] "advises" [...] {{nineteen}} wrestlers {{to retire}} because of match-fixing: makuuchi-ranked Tokusegawa, Kasugao, Koryu, Hakuba, Shimotori, Kotokasuga and Mokonami, jūryō Masatsukasa, Asofuji, Sakaizawa, Wakatenro, Kiyoseumi, Toyozakura and Kyokunankai, former makuuchi Yamamotoyama and Jumonji, and former jūryō [...] Hoshihikari, Kirinowaka and Shirononami. Tanigawa Oyakata, (the former Kaiho), is {{also asked to}} resign but is quoted as saying, [...] "This is absolutely ridiculous. I told the Japan Sumo Association board that the panel’s investigation was full of holes. I will take legal action." [...] Many of the other wrestlers also declare their anger at being forced to retire, with Yamamotoyama saying,"They decided without listening to my excuse," [...] and Wakatenro protesting, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> accept this because I'm being forced out simply because my name came up in some testimonies and text messages." [...] They had until April 5 of that year to hand in their retirement papers, or face the even more harsh punishment of outright dismissal. Two year bans are given to those who admitted wrongdoing: Chiyohakuho, Takenawa Oyakata (ex Kasuganishiki) and sandanme ranked Enatsukasa (who acted as the go-between). However, all three have indicated they are leaving sumo completely. [...] Enatsukasa issued an apology to sumo fans, saying [...] "I've {{caused a lot of}} problems for the wrestlers who genuinely put in the work, and it hurts." [...] Seventeen sumo elders are demoted, with executive members Kitanoumi, Kokonoe and Michinoku resigning from their posts and chairman Hanaregoma taking a 30 per cent pay cut for two months. Hanaregoma told a press conference, [...] "We had to punish many people, all of whom are our colleagues. It was a very tough decision to make." [...] About ten other wrestlers are still under investigation, meaning {{it is unlikely that the}} Natsu tournament in May will go ahead.|$|E

500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was ever going to learn to surf – <b>no</b> <b>way!</b> Because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, however, Penderecki {{began to move}} away from the avant-garde movement, {{claiming}} in an interview in 2000, [...] "we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> move on." [...] Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, [...] "The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky."

5000|$|Damon's {{signing with}} the Yankees {{led to his}} being {{subsequently}} vilified by many Red Sox fans because of his previously professed loyalty {{to the city and}} Red Sox organization, including his now infamous statement in May 2005, where he claimed, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go play for the Yankees, but I know they're going to come after me hard.

There wasn't enough depth to maintain my interest every night. There’s <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> sing “My love is selfish” a hundred time and it continue to feel pure and true. I felt, in a very childish way, I had romanticised sadness, and I was using the music to wallow. Even the acoustic guitar started sounding terrible to me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just <b>no</b> <b>way.</b> Whether <b>I</b> <b>can</b> put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story.

I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn't specify the point. He's an extraordinary looking man, and yet <b>I</b> really <b>can</b> name nothing out of the <b>way.</b> <b>No,</b> sir; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make no hand of it; I can't describe him.

2500|$|Shore {{spent her}} last years in poverty. She {{had to sell}} her Weston {{photographs}} to survive and became increasingly depressed. Sometime in the late 1950s her neighbors had her institutionalized. Her very dear friend Jehanne Bietry Salinger said about the matter, [...] "some so-called 'do-gooders' went to her studio, found it disorganized, and had Henrietta committed to an asylum. If I had been in Carmel, I would never have permitted it, since she was in <b>no</b> <b>way</b> insane. <b>I</b> still <b>can</b> not think about this without being heartbroken." [...] Shore {{died at the age}} of 83 in a mental institution in San Jose, California in 1963.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of self-confidence - for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent {{is the only way}} to untangle themselves from demands.|$|E
5000|$|At the Louisville symposium, Pressler {{expressed}} {{satisfaction and}} gratitude at what Southern Seminary became {{in the more}} than two decades since the Conservative resurgence began:To come here today and to see this room filled, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> express my gratitude fully. ... We have 15,000 students in our seminaries. Every single one of our seminary presidents is a godly man who believes the Word and has a burden for souls. I literally weep for joy at what God has done and the future we have as Southern Baptists because of the victory that has been won.|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{guidance}} of the Vineyard Fellowship, Dylan was asked to attend a course held at the Vineyard School of Discipleship, which would run four days a week over the course of three months. [...] "At first I said, 'There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> devote three months to this,'" [...] Dylan would say in a 1980 interview. [...] "'I've got to be back on the road soon.'

5000|$|Lessig, {{upon his}} {{withdrawal}} from the campaign, {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "from the start it was clear that getting into the Democratic debates was the essential step in this campaign. I may be known in tiny corners of the tubes of the internets, but I am not well-known to the American public generally." [...] Lessig acknowledged that in order to raise the discussion of campaign finance reform in the 2016 election, getting into debates was key. [...] "But last week, we learned that the Democratic party has changed its rules for inclusion in the debate," [...] he said. The DNC debate-qualifying rule originally required a candidate to poll at least 1% in three national polls during the six weeks prior to a debate. Under the new rule, which Lessig stated was the reason for his campaign suspension, a candidate is required to poll at least 1% in three national polls at least six weeks before a debate. Lessig said that [...] "unless we can time travel, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> qualify." [...] He then announced the suspension of his campaign.|$|R
5000|$|When Ram came {{learns that}} {{the seed of}} a {{powerful}} tree of vanity has germinated, then he vows to uproot it immediately. He creates a town even more beautiful than his own abode, and there he {{takes the form of}} Vishwamohini, the beautiful princess of the town, who is seeking a husband. Kings come from far and wide as suitors, and of course so did Narada went to that town. When Narada beholds Vishwamohini's beauty, the sage forgets his Vairagya and cannot take his eyes off her. The sage resolved to marry the princess. He prayed to Ram and asked for his help in winning [...] "the girl" [...] over: — [...] "O Lord! Please give me your appearance as there is <b>no</b> other <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get that princess. O Lord! Whatever is beneficial to me, please do that quickly. I am your devotee." [...] Pleased that his Maya had worked so well, Ram responds— [...] "O Narada! Listen, whatever is the best for you, I will do only that, nothing else. My word is never untrue. O Yogi Rishi! Listen, if a patient distraught with disease asks for a poison the doctor does not prescribe it. Likewise I've resolved to help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Do they know, as we do, {{that their}} time must come? Yes, they know, at rare moments. <b>No</b> other <b>way</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> {{interpret}} those pauses of his latter life, when, propped on his forefeet, {{he would sit}} for long minutes quite motionless--his head drooped, utterly withdrawn; then turn those eyes of his and look at me. That look said more plainly than all words could: [...] "Yes, I know that I must go!" [...] If we have spirits that persist--they have. If we know after our departure, who we were they do. No one, I think, who really longs for truth, can ever glibly say which {{it will be for}} dog and man persistence or extinction of our consciousness. There is but one thing certain--the childishness of fretting over that eternal question. Whichever it be, it must be right, the only possible thing. He felt that too, I know; but then, like his master, he was what is called a pessimist.|$|R

Riggs was the fifth woman executed in the United States since the reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} in 1976. She was the first woman executed in Arkansas since 1845. Her statement before execution began: [...] "No words can express just how sorry I am for taking the lives of my babies. <b>No</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make up for or take away the pain I have caused everyone who knew and loved them."

Cam {{recalled}} the way fans reacted to the song: [...] "I get stopped all the time and people tell me they heard it on, in their car, they had to pull over and cry. So, it makes me so happy that a song that is very vulnerable for me, because I'm basically admitting that I was a jerk to someone else and that there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fix it in real life, and I'm stuck trying to fix it in my dreams." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{member of}} Anderson's junior varsity teams, Gottlieb was {{promoted}} to the varsity team in 2004-05 due to his strong work ethic and professional attitude.

[...] "I’ve got no choice, I can get up off my rear and go out and work or be at home in bed dying at age 45. It’s either live or die.

That’s been the biggest thing for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 11 July 2014, American weekly newsmagazine Newsweek {{reported}} that {{in an article published}} in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the journal American Renaissance, a publication condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the organ of a [...] "white nationalist hate group." [...] However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:When I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about Kevin Macdonald's theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send sic it to me, assuring me that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that - and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. ... As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of [...] "stealing ideas". I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.|$|R
60|$|When the {{turbulent}} waters had somewhat subsided {{and the sea}} had ceased to spew up wreckage, I ventured to swim back in search of something substantial enough to support my weight and that of Nobs as well. I had gotten well over {{the area of the}} wreck when not a half-dozen yards ahead of me a lifeboat shot bow foremost out of the ocean almost its entire length to flop down upon its keel with a mighty splash. It must have been carried far below, held to its mother ship by a single rope which finally parted to the enormous strain put upon it. In <b>no</b> other <b>way</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> account for its having leaped so far out of the water--a beneficent circumstance to which I doubtless owe my life, and that of another far dearer to me than my own. I say beneficent circumstance {{even in the face of}} the fact that a fate far more hideous confronts us than that which we escaped that day; for because of that circumstance I have met her whom otherwise I never should have known; I have met and loved her. At least I have had that great happiness in life; nor can Caspak, with all her horrors, expunge that which has been.|$|R
6000|$|After {{some moments}} of silence, she resumed: [...] "The father has said to-day {{that you came}} to us from an island where even the customs {{of the people are}} {{different}} from ours; and perhaps one of their unhappy methods is to seek to medicine a real misery by imagining some impossible and immeasurably greater one. In <b>no</b> other <b>way</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> account for your strange words to me; for I cannot believe that any race exists so debased as actually to practice the things you speak of. Remember that I do not ask or desire to be informed. We have a different way; for although it is conceivable that present misery might be mitigated, or forgotten for a season, by giving up the soul to delusions, even by summoning before the mind repulsive and horrible images, that would be to put to an unlawful use, and to pervert, the brightest faculties our Father has given us: therefore we seek no other support in all sufferings and calamities but that of reason only. If you wish for my affection, you will not speak of such things again, but will endeavor to purify yourself from a mental vice, which may sometimes, in periods of suffering, give you a false comfort for a brief season, only to degrade you, and sink you later in a deeper misery. You must now leave me." ...|$|R
