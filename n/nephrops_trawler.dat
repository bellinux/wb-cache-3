An array of 3 standard definition cameras and associated hardware were {{installed on the}} <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawler</b> MFV Supreme, fishing a dual-purpose 22 fathom single-rig net with 70 mm cod end, co-owned by Leo McGirr and Simon Wills (skippered by Leo McGirr). The aim {{of the project was}} to evaluate how effective CCTV technology was in assessing the cod bycatch {{as a percentage of the}} total catch in this fishery. In particular, the intention was to find a way of enhancing the monitoring of a sector of the fleet potentially excluded from cod recovery measures by virtue of that sector accounting for < 1. 5 % of cod in the total catch. Results from the first series of trials (9 – 11 September) showed that, where crew catch-handling was modified, accurate assessments of cod live weights and hence percentage cod in the total catch could be made by video analysis in a cost-effective manner.

40|$|International audiencePoor {{selective}} gears like bottom trawlers {{are known}} to induce joint productions ie catch of several categories of fish by targeting one category in particular. Joint productions can be inter-species or intra-species. They can be retained to be sold or discarded {{most of the time}} with high mortality rates when caught by trawlers. Joint productions make management more complicated as they make classical solutions known to reduce or negate the effects of negative externalities difficult to apply. In this paper, the bio-economic impact of changing gear to reduce joint productions and so limit the external effects is studied {{in the case of the}} Nephrops trawl fishery in the bay of Biscay. The example of the Nephrops pot fishery of Loch Torridon (Scotland) compared to the Nephrops trawl fishery in the bay of Biscay enables to discuss the exploitation conditions leading to the success of an alternative gear.

40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} subsidies on the profitability and ecological stability of the North Sea fisheries over the past 20 years. It shows the negative impact that subsidies can have on both the biomass of important fish species and the possible profit from fisheries. The study includes subsidies in an ecosystem model of the North Sea and examines the possible effects of eliminating fishery subsidies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Hindcast analysis between 1991 and 2003 indicates that subsidies reduced the profitability of the fishery even though gross revenue might have been high for specific fisheries sectors. Simulations seeking to maximise the total revenue between 2004 and 2010 suggest {{that this can be}} achieved by increasing the effort of <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawlers,</b> beam trawlers, and the pelagic trawl-and-seine fleet, while reducing the effort of demersal trawlers. Simulations show that ecological stability can be realised by reducing the effort of the beam <b>trawlers,</b> <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawlers,</b> pelagic- and demersal trawl-and-seine fleets. This analysis also shows that when subsidies are included, effort will always be higher for all fleets, because it effectively reduces the cost of fishing. Conclusions/Significance: The study found that while removing subsidies might reduce the total catch and revenue, it increases the overall profitability of the fishery and the total biomass of commercially important species. For example, cod, haddock, herring and plaice biomass increased over the simulation when optimising for profit, and when optimising fo...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Nephrops trawl {{fishery is}} one of the most {{important}} fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. <b>Nephrops</b> <b>trawlers</b> thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30 % survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e. g. rent) are examined and a cost–benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient. Regulating access to the fishery is also required to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and a better exploitation of the production potential...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} fishing {{activity}} and landings of the trawl and creel fisheries for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus (L.)) off the Portuguese coast, and evaluates the financial viability of two vessels typical of each fleet. Crustacean trawlers {{are part of}} an industrial fleet that, besides Nephrops, targets deep water shrimps. Creels are used by a multi-gear, multi-target artisanal fleet, fishing only in areas unavailable to trawlers and, when catching Nephrops, set specifically to target this species. Trawlers have in recent years contributed with 85 % of the landings in weight, but only 74 % in value (2005 - 2009 average). Despite smaller landings, the Nephrops creel fishery provides individuals of larger size and in better condition, thereby obtaining higher unit prices. Economic viability was also higher for the creel vessel, with trawling being only viable if major costs (such as labor and fuel) are covered by the revenue from other target species (e. g., the rose shrimp). At present, Nephrops populations on the South and SW coast are subject to intense fishing and to a recovery plan. The possibility of reallocation of some of the fishing effort directed at <b>Nephrops</b> from <b>trawlers</b> to creels is discussed in terms of the conservation of the resource and economic return...|$|R
