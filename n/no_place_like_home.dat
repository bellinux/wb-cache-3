25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Home,</b> in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Home</b> was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. <b>No</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Home</b> was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out.

[...] James Rocchi of The Wrap gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm." [...] Stephen Whitty gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that Home would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about." [...] Ben Sachs of the Chicago Reader gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable." ...|$|E

[...] Carbot also noted that the discussions about the episode may never end, saying [...] "Lost may be gone, but it will hardly be forgotten." [...] Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times also gave the finale a perfect score, stating [...] "Sunday's show was an emotional, funny, expertly measured reminder of what Lost has really centered on since its first moments on the prime time TV landscape: faith, hope, romance and the power of redemption through belief in the best of what moves mankind." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today rated the episode perfect as well, deeming the finale [...] "can stand with the best any series has produced."
