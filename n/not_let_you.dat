[...] "We thought, why <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E

[...] By the next day, however, Anonymous claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts, and by the third, more than 5,000, and to have doxxed recruiters. A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E

[...] Namrata Joshi from Outlook gave {{a rating of}} 4 out 5 and called Kaminey [...] "a strikingly anarchic, unusually energetic, quirky and frenetic film". Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu gave the film 4 stars and wrote, [...] "Kaminey takes the post-postmodern noir genre to a whole new level, to a sophistication the Indian audience isn't used to. Watch it at least twice to fully appreciate this masterpiece." [...] Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon described the film as a [...] "tasty cinematic masala that is energetically entertaining, if not consistently coherent".|$|E

Several people were hurt in skirmishes at the rally, attended by at least 3,000 people who defied a request by authorities to cancel the Monday night demonstration.
