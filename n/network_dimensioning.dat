We formulate an optimization problem that provides a unified framework to study static QoS budget allocation combined with <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning</b> and routing. Through the analysis of its optimality conditions, we examine the underlying mathematical structure for the model and give an economic interpretation on the optimal rules. ^ Two aspects {{of the advantages of}} optimal partitioning are shown: reducing the construction cost in <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning</b> and increasing revenue in network operation. In the context of <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning,</b> we show that optimal partitioning can bring large cost reductions as compared with equal partitioning. Along with its advantage in <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning,</b> we also find that optimal partitioning brings a significant revenue increase in network operation with given capacity. More importantly, optimal partitioning improves robustness in the presence of failed components and fairness when the traffic demand is different from the forecast, which had not been observed in previous work. We show these advantages of optimal partitioning with some numerical results based on theoretical analysis. ^ The concept of effective bandwidth is introduced to deal with both the QoS constraint and link blocking. We make an observation that the effective bandwidth model for the M/M/ 1 queueing system has an interesting property that the delay allocation can be done independently of traffic and routing. Based on the decomposition property of the M/M/ 1 case, a fast heuristic partitioning scheme is proposed for arbitrary traffic models, which can greatly reduce the computation effort. We then show that the heuristic gives a near-optimal partitioning for <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning</b> and that it can improve network robustness in network operation with given capacity. ^ We also examine the effect of optimal QoS budget partitioning on routing. We analyze the relation between optimal partitioning and optimal routing rules and show that optimal partitioning improves the effect of rerouting on maximizing revenue under traffic change scenarios. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the accuracy of <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning</b> in two different aspects. The first case {{is in terms of}} source modelling of different services of modern communication systems and second being with respect to mobility modelling distributions used in past and present networks. Finally impact of service and mobility modelling accuracy is investigated in <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning</b> aspects. First issue compares the impact of different burst distributions on MAC performance in Email sessions and WWW browsing applied to an example GPRS MAC mechanism. The results conclude high delay in Cauchy Email connection sizes and Pareto WWW burst sessions compared to exponential connections / bursts. Also this delay increase is mainly due to the congestion occurred by different types of bursts / connection distributions. Therefore the bursty traffic such as WWW browsing which demonstrates selfsimilarity at the aggregate level influence the MAC protocol performance than in traditional traffic models. As <b>network</b> <b>dimensioning</b> has to be carried out per cell basis, the residence time has great influence on the aggregate traffic. There are many work reported in the literature concerning the distribution of residence time in the cell. In the second issue investigation of the accuracy of common assumption of exponential cell residence times and the effect of that on channel holding time in terms of capacity evaluations is also studied. This work concludes cell residence time follows a shifted Gamma distribution not assumed as exponential distribution. Also the parameters of this shifted Gamma distribution relates to the user mobility variables velocity, cell radius and handover margin. It is revealed the assumption of exponential cell residence times underestimates the capacity.
