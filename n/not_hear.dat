5|$|Data, an android, and Jenna D'Sora {{are in the}} torpedo room {{configuring}} several probes {{with which}} the Enterprise will explore a nearby nebula. D'Sora explains that she just split up with her boyfriend and Data attempts to comfort her. Later they play together in a chamber concert along with Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao). D'Sora complains of her abilities as a musician, but Data insists that he could <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|Percy Bysshe Shelley was in Italy and did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> of the {{massacre}} until 5 September. His poem, The Masque of Anarchy, subtitled Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester was sent for publication in the radical periodical The Examiner but because of restrictions on the radical press, was not published until 1832, {{ten years after the}} poet's death.|$|E

5|$|The cast was {{announced}} on May 15, 1987. There {{was a certain}} degree of uncertainty regarding job security during the pilot for the main cast, as they did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> until after production had wrapped that the show had been picked up for a further thirteen episodes.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> the announcement of his death.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E

5|$|Corzine won {{his case}} on appeal. On March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled it would <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> {{arguments}} in the case, effectively ending the legal battle to make his e-mails with Katz public. Corzine spent approximately $127,000 of taxpayer funds to keep the e-mails secret. Nonetheless, on August 1, 2010, The Star-Ledger published 123 of the Corzine-Katz e-mails, revealing {{the extent of their}} personal contact during negotiations over a new state government workers contract in early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E

5|$|Muslims {{are obliged}} to follow the {{decisions}} of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected to follow the Shafi'i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia. The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Shariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> matters related to Islamic practices.|$|E
5|$|One of his few close companions was {{his niece}} Betsy (Elizabeth Etty), fifth {{daughter}} {{of his brother}} John. Betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than William, and became his housekeeper in 1824. She remained in his service {{for the rest of}} his life, and as he grew older William increasingly came to depend on her, suffering distress whenever they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic whenever he did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> from her. She became his companion and acted as his assistant, alongside his official assistant George Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Opinions of the Tribunal {{cannot be}} {{questioned}} by any court. This includes the Tribunal's {{view of the}} validity of any law, the bill of which {{has been the subject of}} a reference to a Tribunal. This means that although the Tribunal lies outside the normal hierarchy of the courts since it does <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> appeals from any courts, its opinions are binding on all other courts. It is technically open for the President, on Cabinet's advice, to refer the same matter to the Tribunal for its re-consideration.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do <b>not</b> <b>hear,</b> reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E
5|$|The duo of Hardcastle and Cage {{were known}} as Hard Impact before {{changing}} their name to The Suicide Blondes. They also worked in Japan under the name The Canadian Rockers. Copeland also wrestled briefly as Damon Striker against Kevin Sullivan and Meng on separate episodes of WCW Pro. In the summer of 1995, he worked a show in Ajax, Ontario, where Bret Hart's business manager, Carl De Marco, was watching. Impressed, he suggested Copeland send an audition tape to the WWF. Copeland did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> back from WWF, but some time later, De Marco was appointed President of WWF Canada and told Copeland that he'd put in a good word.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E

5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a {{hospital}} ship, and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was supported by several Japanese officers, {{both before and after}} the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible. Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of I-177 after Nakagawa. Orita did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and believed that if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have learned this from the crew's gossip.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Chintanda's {{affidavit}} {{caused the}} BSAC to become concerned about Clark's continued authority in North-Eastern Rhodesia {{and to begin}} investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the Company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no jurisdiction outside Southern Rhodesia and therefore could <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> any case brought against Clark. On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the Company's administrator in Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the Zambezi {{under the supervision of}} one of three chiefs friendly to the Company. Milner replied on 17 August that he could not legally sanction this, and that Lawley should pursue the matter further only when authority extended over Clark's area.|$|E
