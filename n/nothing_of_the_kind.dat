The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind.</b>|$|E

He continued the policy of improving relations with Austria-Hungary, which did not contribute to his popularity. After the Bosnian crisis and the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, his imprudently worded speech at Carate created the illusion that Italy was to be compensated, perhaps by the cession of the Trentino, and the disappointment when <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> materialized greatly weakened his prestige. He remained in office until the fall of Giolitti in December 1909.|$|E

2500|$|From 1733, Rameau {{dedicated}} himself {{almost exclusively}} to opera. On a strictly musical level, 18th-century French Baroque opera is richer and more varied than contemporary Italian opera, especially in the place given to choruses and dances {{but also in the}} musical continuity that arises from the respective relationships between the arias and the recitatives. Another essential difference: whereas Italian opera gave a starring role to female sopranos and castrati, French opera had no use for the latter. The Italian opera of Rameau's day (opera seria, opera buffa) was essentially divided into musical sections (da capo arias, duets, trios, etc.) and sections that were spoken or almost spoken (recitativo secco). It was during the latter that the action progressed while the audience waited for the next aria; on the other hand, the text of the arias was almost entirely buried beneath music whose chief aim was to show off the virtuosity of the singer. <b>Nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> {{is to be found in}} French opera of the day; since Lully, the text had to remain comprehensibleâ€”limiting certain techniques such as the vocalise, which was reserved for special words such as [...] ("glory") or [...] ("victory"). A subtle equilibrium existed between the more and the less musical parts: melodic recitative on the one hand and arias that were often closer to arioso on the other, alongside virtuoso [...] "ariettes" [...] in the Italian style. This form of continuous music prefigures Wagnerian drama even more than does the [...] "reform" [...] opera of Gluck.|$|E

60|$|The tavern at Shelburne Falls {{was about}} the worst I ever saw,--there being hardly {{anything}} to eat, at least <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meat <b>kind.</b> There was a party <b>of</b> students from <b>the</b> Rensselaer school at Troy, who {{had spent the night}} there, a set of rough urchins from sixteen to twenty years old, accompanied by the wagon-driver, a short, stubbed little fellow, who walked about with great independence, thrusting his hands into his breeches-pockets, beneath his frock. The queerness was, such a figure being associated with classic youth. They were on an excursion which is yearly made from that school in search of minerals. They seemed in rather better moral habits than students used to be, but wild-spirited, rude, and unpolished, somewhat like German students, which resemblance one or two of them increased by smoking pipes. In the morning, my breakfast being set in a corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same room with them, I saw their breakfast-table, with a huge wash-bowl <b>of</b> milk in <b>the</b> centre, and a basin and spoon placed for each guest.|$|R

5000|$|He was {{relatively}} less popular in France itself than abroad, {{where he was}} considered as <b>the</b> special painter <b>of</b> life in Paris.

60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> {{arrangement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper boughs, the Ã†sacus and Hesperie {{is perhaps}} the most consummate example, the absolute truth and simplicity and freedom from anything like fantasticism or animal form being as marked on the one hand, as <b>the</b> exquisite imaginativeness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines on the other: among the Yorkshire subjects the Aske Hall, Kirby Lonsdale Churchyard, and Brignall Church are most characteristic: among the England subjects the Warwick, Dartmouth Cove, Durham, and Chain Bridge over the Tees, where <b>the</b> piece <b>of</b> thicket on <b>the</b> right has been well rendered by the engraver, and is peculiarly expressive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aerial relations and play of light among complex boughs.

60|$|Seen {{from the}} deep indigo-blue water, that turns leek-green in the shallows, Cape GirÃ£o ('they turn') is a grand study of {{volcanic}} dykes.

I saw <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> this <b>kind.</b> <b>The</b> dykes <b>of</b> light grey material, sometimes hollowed out and converted into gutters by falling water, {{appeared to have been}} shot up in distinct lines, and the only crossing was where a slip or a fault occurred.|$|R
60|$|The {{crushing}} retort {{for which}} Ramsden has been visibly collecting his forces is lost for ever; for {{at this point}} Octavius returns with Miss Ann Whitefield and her mother; and Ramsden springs up and hurries {{to the door to}} receive them. Whether Ann is good-looking or not depends upon your taste; also and perhaps chiefly on your age and sex. To Octavius she is an enchantingly beautiful woman, in whose presence the world becomes transfigured, and <b>the</b> puny limits <b>of</b> individual consciousness are suddenly made infinite by a mystic memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race to its beginnings in the east, or even back to the paradise from which it fell. She is to him <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> romance, <b>the</b> leaner good sense <b>of</b> nonsense, <b>the</b> unveiling <b>of</b> his eyes, <b>the</b> freeing <b>of</b> his soul, <b>the</b> abolition <b>of</b> time, place and circumstance, <b>the</b> etherealization <b>of</b> his blood into rapturous rivers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very water <b>of</b> life itself, <b>the</b> revelation <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> mysteries and <b>the</b> sanctification <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> dogmas. To her mother she is, to put it as moderately as possible, <b>nothing</b> whatever <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind.</b> Not that Octavius's admiration is in any way ridiculous or discreditable. Ann is a well formed creature, as far as that goes; and she is perfectly ladylike, graceful, and comely, with ensnaring eyes and hair. Besides, instead of making herself an eyesore, like her mother, she has devised a mourning costume of black and violet silk which does honor to her late father and reveals <b>the</b> family tradition <b>of</b> brave unconventionality by which Ramsden sets such store.|$|R

60|$|The relic in {{question}} consists of certain pencilled pages, found among his papers, {{in which he}} speaks with only himself for listener. They {{belong to the same}} order as the notes for the unfinished novels, but they are even more informal and confidential. <b>Nothing</b> else <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> seems to have survived; the schemes and motives that must have swarmed in his brain, far too numerously for notation, have all vanished but this one. At Rye, some years before the end, he began one night to feel his way towards a novel which he had in mind--a subject afterwards abandoned in the form projected at first. The rough notes in which he casts about to clear the ground are mostly filled with <b>the</b> mere details <b>of</b> his plan--the division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action, the characters required, a tentative scenario. These I pass over in order to quote some passages where he suddenly breaks away, leaves his imaginary scene, and surrenders to the awe and wonder of finding himself again, where he has so often stood before, on the threshold and brink of creation. It is as though for once, at an hour of midnight silence and solitude, he opened <b>the</b> innermost chamber <b>of</b> his mind and stood face to face with his genius. There is no moment of all his days in which it is now possible to approach him more closely. Such a moment represented to himself <b>the</b> pith <b>of</b> life--the first tremor of inspiration, in which he might be almost afraid to stir or breathe, for fear <b>of</b> breaking <b>the</b> spell, if it were not that he goes to meet it with a peculiar confidence.|$|R

The finest way to protect ourselves and our credentials from phishing attack is to understand <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> phishing as well as to understand that how to determine a phishing attack. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phishing emails are sent from well-reputed organizations and they ask for your credentials such as credit card number, account number, social security number and passwords of bank account. Mostly the phishing attacks seen from the websites, services and organizations with which we do not even have an account. In this system we are using two classifiers to detect phishing. To recognize the phishing, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> website are firstly analyzed and then they are classified by using K-means classifier. If the answer is still suspicious then by using parsing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> webpage, its DOM tree is drawn and then the second classifier that is Naive Bayesian (NB) classifier classifies the web page...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, I cannot find any {{consensus}} among Biblical scholars as to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words, [...] "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." [...] Some {{say that the}} Hebrew word bara, which is translated [...] "create," [...] means [...] "made out of nothing." [...] I venture to object to that rendering, not on <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> scholarship, but of common sense. Omnipotence itself can surely no more make something [...] "out of" [...] nothing than it can make a triangular circle. What is intended by [...] "made out of nothing" [...] appears to be [...] "caused to come into existence," [...] with <b>the</b> implication that <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>kind</b> previously existed. It is further usually assumed that [...] "the heaven and the earth" [...] means <b>the</b> material substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe. Hence the [...] "Mosaic writer" [...] is taken to imply that where <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> a material nature previously existed, this substance appeared. That is perfectly conceivable, and therefore no one can deny {{that it may have}} happened. But there are other very authoritative {119} critics who say that the ancient Israelite[19] who wrote the passage was not likely to have been capable of such abstract thinking; and that, as a matter of philology, bara is commonly used to signify the [...] "fashioning," [...] or [...] "forming," [...] of that which already exists. Now it appears to me that the scientific investigator is wholly incompetent to say anything at all about <b>the</b> first origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material universe. <b>The</b> whole power <b>of</b> his organon vanishes when he has to step beyond <b>the</b> chain <b>of</b> natural causes and effects. No form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nebular hypothesis, that I know of, is necessarily connected with any view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nebular substance. Kant's form of it expressly supposes that the nebular material from which one stellar system starts may be nothing but <b>the</b> disintegrated substance <b>of</b> a stellar and planetary system which has just come to an end. Therefore, so far as I can see, one who believes that matter has existed from all eternity has just as much right to hold the nebular hypothesis as one who believes that matter came into existence at a specified epoch. In other words, the nebular hypothesis and the creation hypothesis, up to this point, neither confirm nor oppose one another.|$|R
