50|$|Initially, {{a script}} {{was written for}} the <b>news</b> <b>reporters</b> to act out; however, upon hearing the rehearsals, {{it was evident that}} the <b>news</b> <b>reporters</b> were not adept at scripted radio acting. So instead, Kaye wrote an outline based on the events that were to occur, and the <b>news</b> <b>reporters</b> were then asked to {{describe}} the events as they would covering an actual news story. The results were much more realistic for its time, and this was the process used for the actual broadcast.|$|R

City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations.

5|$|Khanna acted {{opposite}} Akshay Kumar in two action films: International Khiladi and Zulmi (both 1999). In {{the former}} {{she played a}} <b>news</b> <b>reporter</b> {{who falls in love}} with a criminal whom she interviews. Both performed poorly at the box office. She was paired with Daggubati Venkatesh in the Telugu film Seenu (1999). Khanna played the lead role in Baadshah (1999), featuring Shah Rukh Khan as a detective. In the same year, she acted opposite Saif Ali Khan in Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan, a romantic comedy directed by Mahesh Bhatt. She was paired opposite Aamir Khan in Dharmesh Darshan's Mela (2000). Similar to The Seven Samurai in story, it was an average grosser at the box office. In October 1999, along with Juhi Chawla, Shah Rukh and Salman Khan, she performed at Awesome Foursome concert held as Shah Alam Outdoor Stadium, Malaysia. Chal Mere Bhai (2000) featured her in a special appearance beside a leading role in the comedy Joru Ka Ghulam, opposite Govinda. She also acted in the David Dhawan-directed comedy Jodi No.1 (2001). Her acting in the film met with poor reviews. Film director Karan Johar admitted in an interview that Khanna was in his mind for the role of Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, but she refused it, and thus Rani Mukerji was signed. She left the industry after her marriage to Kumar in 2001, citing that she did not enjoy the acting profession anymore. Her last film was Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega (2001), a remake of the Telugu movie Money (1993). It featured her opposite Fardeen Khan and was an average grosser at the box office.|$|E
