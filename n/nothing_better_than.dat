The whole {{section of}} the vita dealing with Lucius' debaucheries (HA Verus 4.46.6) is an {{insertion}} into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source.

25|$|Hutton {{discouraged}} fraternisation {{with the}} West Indies players and this went decidedly against Trueman's grain, {{given that he}} was a gregarious character who liked <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to fraternise. Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was not alone in this and especially as Hutton gave no reason for it. Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E

[...] September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyoncé thought that the song would perfectly complete her album, which had nearly reached completion. The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyoncé to record the song. Warren {{was present at the}} recording sessions, which took place two days following her conversation with Beyoncé and Jay-Z on the phone.

500|$|Rowling {{has named}} {{communist}} {{and civil rights}} activist Jessica Mitford as her [...] "most influential writer" [...] saying, [...] "Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away {{at the age of}} 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was [...] "incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target". Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author, calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine. As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.|$|E

[...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> a good lie," [...] Lee says cheerily, through a smile. Scenes of Lee in her hotel room follow as she removes her makeup. Those scenes are followed by Lee with [...] "luxurious auburn tresses and dangling diamond earrings" [...] as she plays a glamorous spokesmodel who violently scribbles and scratches out her picture in magazines after the photo shoot has finished.

500|$|Originally modeled in Max Payne {{after the}} game's writer Sam Lake, Max's {{appearance}} was remodeled after professional actor Timothy Gibbs for Max Payne 2; James McCaffrey returned {{as the voice}} of Max. The game's plot was written by Lake, who decided to write it as a film noir love story, as he felt that it suited Max's persona the best. Lake hoped that the story would break new ground, noting, [...] "At least it's a step into the right direction. I'd like <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to see new and unexpected subject matters to find their way to games and stories told in games." [...] Lake remarked that basic, archetypal film noir elements found in many classics of the genre [...] "can go a long way" [...] when telling a story, and gave examples that included a hostile, crime-ridden city; a story that takes place late at night with heavy rain; and a cynical, hard-boiled detective down on his luck. Lake considered writing a sequel to Max Payne an [...] "art of [...] own". Since the setting and characters were already established, Lake decided that the primary goal of the sequel was [...] "to keep what's good and fix what was not so good", and to take the story in surprising directions. The screenplay for the sequel ended up being three times longer than the one for Max Payne. Lake predicted that the more complex story would add to the game's replay value.|$|E

2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> to be proved wrong, because I would like <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them. Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.|$|E
