2500|$|In an {{interview}} at the World Economic Forum in the Riviera Maya on May 7, Sandoval Díaz stated that the attacks of May 1 were [...] "acts of vandalism" [...] and not signs of <b>narcoterrorism.</b> He stated that the word [...] "narcoterrorism" [...] was not defined under Mexican law and thereby did not carry legal weight. He argued that the detainees arrested that day were {{under the influence of}} drugs and were paid between MXN$500 and MXN$1,000 to commit the attacks. When asked whether there was a leak information from the police's side to the CJNG, he stated that he was not aware of any illegal intelligence sharing between law enforcement and organized crime. A reporter asked him whether the helicopter attack counted as vandalism too, and he clarified that that attack was different from the roadblocks and arsons reported elsewhere in Jalisco. He also stated that it was not the government's intention to minimize the incidents of May 1 by not categorizing them as terrorist acts. Sandoval Díaz argued that the CJNG placed roadblocks to create chaos among the civil population and to cause confusion within law enforcement's mobility. He explained that the roadblocks forced security forces to divide their units to restore order and clear up the streets, thus allowing the CJNG members to escape persecution. He attributed the root cause of the violence to the balkanization of organized crime groups in Jalisco and the nearby regions. His remarks, however, drew criticism after the media considered that the government was being dismissive of the severity of the attacks.|$|E

Beginning in 1964, the FARC and ELN narcoterrorist groups were {{taking control of}} rural {{areas of the country}} {{by the beginning of the}} decade, while terrorist paramilitaries grew in other places as businesspeople and politicians thought the State would lose the war against guerrillas. However, after the failure of the peace process and the activation of Plan Colombia, Álvaro Uribe Vélez was elected president in 2002, starting a massive attack on terrorist groups, with cooperation from civil population, foreign aid and legal armed forces. The AUC paramilitary organization disbanded in 2006, while ELN guerrillas have been weakened. The Popular Liberation Army demobilized while the country's biggest terrorist group, FARC has been weakened and most of their top commanders have been killed or died during the decade. During the second half of the decade, a new criminal band has been formed by former members of AUC who did not demobilize, calling themselves Aguilas Negras. Although the Colombian State has taken back control over most of the country, <b>narcoterrorism</b> still causes pain in the country. Since 2008, the Internet has become a new field of battle.

The current counternarcotics methods used, interdiction and eradication, are also compared {{with the addition of a}} supplemental third method, alternative development, as well as legalization, a less traditional approach to The War on <b>Narcoterrorism.</b> This is a significant topic because the United States has sent more than 3 billion in the last ten years in military aid to Colombia in support of its counternarcotics missions (Forero). The majority of United States aid comes in the form of electronics technology. It is important for the people of the United States and Colombia to evaluate how successful their governments are in the war on narcoterrorsim. The information in this paper was gathered primarily through research using sources from the United States Congress, the State Department, independent books, newspapers, magazines, websites, and interviews. The conclusion of this paper states that the current methods used to combat <b>narcoterrorism</b> are ineffective and that two alternative options need further consideration. The first option involves supplementing the two current methods used, interdiction and eradication, with alternative development. The second option considers the possibility of world wide legalization of illicit drugs and is compared with the first option.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines the nexus that has evolved between {{terrorism and the}} illicit drug trade, threatening the sovereignty of countless nations worldwide. The "narcoterrorist" nexus is becoming ever more apparent as the transnational link between narcotics trafficking and terrorism has coerced Mexico into an on-going struggle for survival against powerful drug cartels that are ravaging the region. Does <b>narcoterrorism</b> pose {{a clear and present}} danger to America's national security? Is the current U. S. strategy to prosecute it effective? Moreover, are there any lessons that can be derived from the Latin American and Eurasian examples that would afford added insight into this phenomenon and assist U. S. policymaking efforts? This thesis endeavors to answer these questions through an investigation of two areas of study. First, an examination of the concepts and historical context associated with the nature of <b>narcoterrorism</b> are presented, highlighting numerous issues within the lexicon. Second, to ascertain if previous efforts can offer beneficial perspectives in confronting the current narcoterrorist threat, two in-depth case studies concerning Turkey and Columbia are accomplished.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe requirement to monitor a field operator’s vital signs and location was articulated through the Counter <b>Narcoterrorism</b> Technology Program Office. The initial concept was to equip a soldier {{with a blue}} force tracker like device, which {{would be able to}} monitor and transmit the person’s life signs, as well as their positional coordinates. This thesis focuses on the development of BioRAPIDS (Biomedical-Remote Automated Position Identification System), a capability within a broader sensor management, net-centric, system of systems to monitor, transmit, and display Heart Rate and GPS location. A spiral developmental model was implemented in order to select and integrate components, conduct testing, and provide feedback to the process. Based on system requirements, Commercial-off-the-Shelf/Government-off-the-Shelf COTS/GOTS components were chosen and adapted to meet the required interfaces. Component and subassembly interactions were then modeled using Integration Definition for Functional Modeling (IDEF 0) modeling language to ensure traceability between functions and components. The culmination of the 10 -month project was the creation of a system; starting at the idea phase through the delivery of a proof-of-concept prototype. Accompanying the created system is this thesis, which documents the development process, records testing analysis, and captures potential future courses of action.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the potential {{that exists in}} technologically advanced systems to assist the local law enforcement authorities in Thailand {{in their attempts to}} continue to effectively control the drug trafficking, despite the advent of newly appeared "threats," like the spread of the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). It also provides the pre-Concept of Operations (CONOPS) of such a system, funded by the DoD/CNTPO (Department of Defense/Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office). Even with opium seizures significantly reduced in the country, accompanied by a similar decline in heroin and morphine seizures, there is no space for complacency, especially given the fact that one of the neighboring countries, Myanmar, is placed among the top two opium producers around the globe. Illicit drug trafficking is a phenomenon that cannot be addressed autonomously. Rather, evidence strongly relates illicit drug trafficking to terrorism activity, in a relation that is highly reciprocal. In the past decade this common front is described by the term "narcoterrorism," stressing the correlation of these two areas of illegal activity, which until recently were independent of one another. Clearly, the only response to the sophisticated <b>narcoterrorism</b> networks must be based on advanced technological tools. The Flexible Architecture System and Topology License Plate Recognition (FAST LPR) system is a promising solution to this problem. Hellenic Air Force author...|$|E
40|$|Farming is, {{by its own}} nature, a risky enterprise. Farmers {{are subject}} to many {{exogenous}} risks, for instance, price and production volatility, and credit default risk. Although there exists insurance products that help mitigate these types of risks, {{most of them are}} offered in developed countries. Farmers in developing countries, in general, lack the financial instruments to cope with production uncertainty. Mexican farmers are no exception. Mexican farmers face multiple risks that have been largely understudied. Some of these risks are common to farmers in developed as well as in other developing countries, but a few of them are unique to Mexico due to its current state of events. The overall objective of this dissertation is to investigate risks faced by Mexican farmers. The specific objectives are: to provide a basic understanding of Mexican agriculture and the risks they face from production and markets; to investigate mechanisms for price risk management for Mexican farmers; to investigate the relationship between risk rationing and credit demand; and to investigate the impact of <b>narcoterrorism</b> on agriculture and rural life. This dissertation provides alternatives for risk management and new insights for understanding Mexican farmers ’ risks. These alternative solutions and analysis are based on financial engineering theory; on a novel approach to risk rationing; on the dual process and the ecological psychology theories to understand fear and risk perception. ii...|$|E
40|$|Homeland {{security}} {{relies heavily}} on analytical chemistry to identify suspicious materials and persons. Traditionally this role has focused on attribution, determining the type and origin of an explosive, for example. But as technology advances, analytical chemistry can and will {{play an important role}} in the prevention and preemption of terrorist attacks. More sensitive and selective detection techniques can allow suspicious materials and persons to be identified even before a final destructive product is made. The work presented herein focuses on the use of commercial and novel detection techniques for application to the prevention of terrorist activities. Although drugs are not commonly thought of when discussing terrorism, <b>narcoterrorism</b> has become a significant threat in the 21 st century. The role of the drug trade in the funding of terrorist groups is prevalent; thus, reducing the trafficking of illegal drugs can play a role in the prevention of terrorism by cutting off much needed funding. To do so, sensitive, specific, and robust analytical equipment is needed to quickly identify a suspected drug sample no matter what matrix it is in. Single Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (SPAMS) is a novel technique that has previously been applied to biological and chemical detection. The current work applies SPAMS to drug analysis, identifying the active ingredients in single component, multi-component, and multi-tablet drug samples in a relatively non-destructive manner. In order to do so, a sampling apparatus was created to allow particle generation from drug tablets with on-line introduction to the SPAMS instrument. Rules trees were developed to automate the identification of drug samples on a single particle basis. A novel analytical scheme was also developed to identify suspect individuals based on chemical signatures in human breath. Human breath was sampled using an RTube{trademark} and the trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were preconcentrated using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and identified using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Modifications to the sampling apparatus allowed for increased VOC collection efficiency, and reduced the time of sampling and analysis by over 25 %. The VOCs are present in breath due to either endogenous production, or exposure to an external source through absorption, inhalation, or ingestion. Detection of these exogenous chemicals can provide information on the prior location and activities of the subject. Breath samples collected before and after exposure in a hardware store and nail salon were analyzed to investigate the prior location of a subject; breath samples collected before and after oral exposure to terpenes and terpenoid compounds, pseudoephedrine, and inhalation exposure to hexamine and other explosive related compounds were analyzed to investigate the prior activity of a subject. The elimination of such compounds from the body was also monitored. In application, this technique may provide an early warning system to identify persons of interest in the prevention and preemption stages of homeland security...|$|E
