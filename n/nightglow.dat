40|$|Upper atmospheres {{of planets}} {{continuously}} emit photons in the UV, Visible, and IR {{regions of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. Some of these emissions are classified as airglow, which includes dayglow and <b>nightglow.</b> There are several mechanisms to create these emissions, but this presentation will focus on <b>nightglow</b> emissions resulting from photochemistry of neutral components. These neutral components originate on the dayside and are transported from the dayside to the nightside of a planet, where they subsequently undergo chemical reactions yielding <b>nightglow.</b> <b>Nightglow</b> emissions serve as effective tracers for planetary middle and upper atmosphere global wind systems due to their variable peak brightness and spatial distributions. The main planetary focus for this presentation will be on Mars and Venus’ atmospheres, due to the similar chemical constituents which populate their upper atmospheres. Currently, NO UV <b>nightglow</b> has been observed (e. g. Venus Express, Mars Express) on both Venus and Mars, while O 2 IR <b>nightglow</b> has only been observed on Venus but is predicted to be seen on Mars. The observations show variations in time and location (latitude, local time, and altitude). The locations of the maximum <b>nightglow</b> intensities on each planet are different, but are supportive of the general picture of these two planet’s global circulation patterns.

A statistical map has been created utilizing O[SUB] 2 [/SUB] IR <b>nightglow</b> VEX observations, and a statistical map for NO UV is being developed. A nightside warm layer near 100 km has been observed by VEX and ground-based observations.

40|$|Venus is {{a unique}} planet because its {{atmospheric}} dynamics are mainly driven by thermal heating and its very low rotation rate. Many details of {{the middle and upper}} atmospheric dynamics can be determined from observing nightside airglow emissions, which serve as effective tracers of Venus' middle and upper atmosphere global wind system. The purpose of this dissertation is to use the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Venus Thermospheric General Circulation Model (VTGCM) to examine the underlying processes that control the thermospheric circulation of Venus by comparing simulations to observations. Most recently, Venus Express (VEX) has been monitoring key atmospheric features (O 2 IR <b>nightglow,</b> NO UV <b>nightglow,</b> and nightside temperatures) of Venus. Statistical maps have been created utilizing these <b>nightglow</b> observations from VEX. Moreover, the O 2 IR statistical map has been used to deduce a three-dimensional atomic oxygen density map, which is used to examine the implications of atomic oxygen density distributions below 140 km on the nightside. The VTGCM model has been reconstructed and revised in order to address these key <b>nightglow</b> observations and provide diagnostic interpretation. Specifically, the VTGCM simulations capture the statistically averaged mean state of these three key observations. The correlation between the simulation results and the VEX data sets implies a weak retrograde superrotating zonal flow (RSZ) from ~ 80 km to 110 km with the emergence of modest RSZ winds approaching 60 m s- 1 above ~ 130 km. This RSZ flow is superimposed upon a strong subsolar-antisolar flow from day-to-night. VTGCM sensitivity tests were subsequently performed using two tunable parameters (nightside eddy diffusion and wave drag) to examine corresponding variability within the VTGCM and these <b>nightglow</b> distributions. The VTGCM also reproduces a nightside atomic oxygen density map and vertical profiles across the nightside. Both the simulated map and vertical profiles are in close agreement with VEX observations within a ~ 30 degree contour of the anti-solar point. The atomic oxygen vertical profiles are comparable to the data above 90 km, consistent with the corresponding O 2 IR <b>nightglow</b> intensities.

In its extended source mode, SPICAV {{has shown that the}} Venus <b>nightglow</b> in the UV contains essentially Lyman-αand Nitric Oxide (NO) emissions. In the stellar mode, when the slit of the spectrometer is removed, an emission is also observed at the limb in addition to the stellar spectrum. A forward model allows us to identify this feature as being an NO emission. Due to radiative recombination of N and O atoms produced on the dayside of Venus, and transported to the nightside, NO <b>nightglow</b> provides important constraints to the Solar-to-Anti Solar thermospheric circulation prevailing above 90 km. The forward model presented here allows us to derive the altitude of the peak of emission of the NO layer, found at 113. 5 ± 6 km, as well as its scale height, of 3. 4 ± 1 km and its brightness. The latter is found to be very variable with emissions between 19 Kilo-Rayleigh (kR) and 540 kR.

A comparison has been made between the simultaneous <b>nightglow</b> and the ionospheric parameters of virtual F-layer height and critical frequency of the F-layer at Ahmedabad (23.02 °N, 72.6 °E). In general, a good correlation (c.c. = 0.8 to 0.9) is found between the measured airglow emission and F-region peak electron densities during quiet periods but for intense magnetic disturbances the airglow fluctuations are mainly controlled by sharp changes in height variations of the h′ F layer. The period of airglow variation generally corresponds to periods of F-region height variation during magnetic disturbances.

New O 2 <b>nightglow</b> data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) star tracker (O 2 Herzberg II at 400 - 800 nm) and ground-based telescopes (O 2 IR at 1. 27 microns) yield additional model constraints for estimating Venus winds over 100 - 130 km. Atomic oxygen, produced by dayside CO 2 photolysis peaking near 110 km, and transported to the nightside by the global wind system, is partially destroyed through three-body recombination, yielding the O 2 Herzberg II visible <b>nightglow.</b> This emission is very sensitive to horizontal winds at altitudes between 100 and 130 km.

The processes responsible for the formation and destruction of vibrationally excited OH in the mesosphere are described; the seasonal/latitudinal evolution for the higher (v greater than 6) and lower (v = 1 - 6) levels is shown in graphs and maps and characterized in detail; and the theoretical results are compared with published observational data. The lower-level emission is shown to depend on both O and H, suggesting that the variation of the Meinel-band <b>nightglow</b> can provide important information on the roles of advection and diffusion in the transport of water vapor and odd oxygen near the mesopause...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{capabilities}} of the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph on the MAVEN mission are enabling new science ranging from Mars' lower atmosphere up though the escaping corona. After two years in Mars orbit, the instrument has yielded insights on the Mars dayglow, season cycles, <b>nightglow,</b> aurora, meteor showers, clouds, solar-planetary interactions and atmospheric escape. In this presentation we will highlight several new discoveries. First, IUVS has observed a third type of aurora not previously seen at Mars, indicative {{of a new kind}} of solar-planet interaction for non-magnetized planets. Second, spatial mapping of nitric oxide <b>nightglow</b> reveals regions of atmospheric downwelling necessitating substantial changes to global atmospheric circulation models. Finally, a new high-spatial-resolution UV imaging mode allows unprecedented determinations of Mars' low-altitude ozone, as well as detection of clouds from nadir to limb...|$|E
