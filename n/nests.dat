5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, <b>nests</b> can be very old as suggested in one study. Some <b>nests</b> may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite <b>nests</b> in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite <b>nests</b> may diverge from their parent <b>nests</b> to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different <b>nests</b> or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite <b>nests</b> emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite <b>nests</b> have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{eggs are}} usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate <b>nests,</b> {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird <b>nests,</b> however, are extremely primitive; albatross <b>nests</b> {{are no more than}} a scrape on the ground. Most birds build <b>nests</b> in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open <b>nests.</b> During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of <b>nests</b> is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.|$|E

50|$|Colonies are {{founded by}} swarming; a young queen {{and a small}} {{fraction}} of workers leave the mother <b>nest</b> for a new <b>nest</b> site. Before swarming, scout bees explore suitable cavities in the area surrounding the mother <b>nest.</b> This scouting often lasts between two days and two weeks. The new <b>nest</b> sites are within a few hundred meters of the mother <b>nest</b> to allow continued contact with the mother <b>nest,</b> which can last from a week up to six months for T. angustula, which is longer than many other bee species. Resources are transferred from the mother <b>nest</b> to the new <b>nest,</b> including pollen, honey, and cerumen, but the new <b>nest</b> continues to have very small stores compared to the mother <b>nest.</b> Cerumen, which comes from the mother <b>nest,</b> is a wax used to seal cracks and holes in the new <b>nest</b> site.|$|R

40|$|The <b>nested</b> {{universal}} relation (UR) model aims {{to provide}} logical data independence to the <b>nested</b> relational model by allowing users {{to view the}} database {{as if it were}} composed of a single <b>nested</b> relation. Moreover, non-technical users may find the <b>nested</b> relational model too complex to interact with, a problem we call herein the usability problem. The <b>nested</b> UR model solves the usability problem by allowing users to interact with the <b>nested</b> database without having to know its detailed structure, which may be complex. In order to formalise the <b>nested</b> UR model we extend the weak instance approach to the (classical) UR model to the <b>nested</b> weak instance approach to the <b>nested</b> UR model. The <b>nested</b> weak instance approach leads naturally to the definition of the underlying data structure for the <b>nested</b> UR model, namely the <b>nested</b> representative instance (NRI) over the <b>nested</b> universal relation scheme. We present two different definitions of the NRI and show that they are equivalent. First, we define the NRI declaratively as the greatest lower bound of the set of <b>nested</b> weak instances with respect to a natural ordering defined on <b>nested</b> relations. Second, we define the NRI constructively as the result of computing the extended chase on the underlying <b>nested</b> database. Finally, we show that the weak instance approach to the UR model is a special case of the <b>nested</b> weak instance approach to the <b>nested</b> UR model, thus allowing us to implement a flexible UR interface by using the <b>nested</b> UR model; this provides us with all the advantages of <b>nested</b> relations over flat relations...|$|R

5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its <b>nests</b> are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its <b>nests</b> are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker <b>nests.</b> The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite <b>nests,</b> {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it <b>nests</b> in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing <b>nests</b> in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused <b>nests</b> of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E
5|$|To {{build their}} <b>nests,</b> {{termites}} primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton <b>nests</b> (arboreal <b>nests</b> built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all <b>nests</b> are visible, as many <b>nests</b> in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are {{good examples of}} subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. <b>Nests</b> and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, {{as well as providing}} a fortification against predators. <b>Nests</b> made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>nested</b> {{relational}} model allows relations {{that are not}} in first normal form. This paper gives an extension of Datalog rules for <b>nested</b> relations. In our approach, <b>nested</b> Datalog is a natural extension of Datalog introduced for the relational data model. A <b>nested</b> Datalog program has a hierarchical structure of rules and subprograms to manipulate relation values of <b>nested</b> relations. We introduce a new category of predicate symbols, the variable predicate symbols to refer to tuples of subrelations. The notion of soundness, safety and consistency is defined to avoid undesirable <b>nested</b> Datalog programs.

40|$|Balanced <b>nesting</b> is {{the most}} usual form of <b>nesting</b> and originates, when used singly or with {{crossing}} of such sub-models, orthogonal models. In balanced <b>nesting</b> {{we are forced to}} divide repeatedly the plots and we have few degrees of freedom for the first levels. If we apply stair <b>nesting</b> we will have plots all of the same size rendering the designs easier to apply. The stair <b>nested</b> designs are a valid alternative for the balanced <b>nested</b> designs because we can work with fewer observations, the amount of information for the different factors is more evenly distributed and we obtain good results. The inference for models with balanced <b>nesting</b> is already well studied. For models with stair <b>nesting</b> it is easy to carry out inference because it is very similar to that for balanced <b>nesting.</b> Furthermore stair <b>nested</b> designs being unbalanced have an orthogonal structure. Other alternative to the balanced <b>nesting</b> is the staggered <b>nesting</b> that {{is the most}} popular unbalanced <b>nested</b> design which also has the advantage of requiring fewer observations.

40|$|Abstract Facultative {{shifts in}} <b>nesting</b> habitat {{selection}} {{in response to}} perceived predation risk may allow animals to increase the survival probability of sessile oVspring. Previ-ous studies on this behavioral strategy have primarily focused on single attributes, such as the distance moved or changes in <b>nesting</b> substrate. However, <b>nest</b> site choice often encompasses multiple habitat elements at both the <b>nest</b> site and <b>nest</b> patch scales. We studied the within-sea-son re-nesting strategy of a multi-brooded songbird, the Brewer’s sparrow (Spizella breweri), to determine whether pairs utilized a “win-stay, lose-switch ” decision rule with respect to inter-nest distance, <b>nest</b> substrate and/or <b>nest</b> patch characteristics in response to previous <b>nest</b> fate. Pairs moved sequential <b>nest</b> sites slightly farther following <b>nest</b> predation versus success. When inter-nest distance was controlled, however, pairs changed <b>nest</b> patch attributes (shrub height, potential <b>nest</b> shrub density) associated with probability of <b>nest</b> predation {{to a greater extent}} following <b>nest</b> predation than success. The strategy appeared to be adaptive; daily <b>nest</b> survival probability for previously dep-redated pairs increased with greater Euclidian habitat dis-tances between attempts, whereas previously successful pairs were more likely to Xedge second attempts when <b>nest</b> sites were similar to those of previous attempts. Our results suggest that <b>nesting</b> birds can use prior information and within-season plasticity in response to <b>nest</b> predation to increase re-nesting success, which may be a critical behav-ioral strategy within complex <b>nest</b> predator environments. Re-nesting site selection strategies also appeared to inte-grate multiple habitat components and inter-nest distances. The consideration of such proximate, facultative responses to predation risk may clarify often unexplained variation in habitat preferences and requirements...|$|R

They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally.

Two types of <b>nests</b> have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound.

40|$|Alexander Skutch {{hypothesized}} that increased parental activity {{can increase the}} risk of <b>nest</b> predation. We tested this hypothesis using ten open-nesting bird species in Arizona, USA. Parental activity was greater during the nestling than incubation stage because parents visited the <b>nest</b> frequently to feed their young during the nestling stage. However, <b>nest</b> predation did not generally increase with parental activity between <b>nesting</b> stages across the ten study species. Previous investigators have found similar results. We tested whether <b>nest</b> site effects might yield higher predation during incubation because the most obvious sites are depredated most rapidly. We conducted experiments using <b>nest</b> sites from the previous year to remove parental activity. Our results showed that <b>nest</b> sites have highly repeatable effects on <b>nest</b> predation risk; poor <b>nest</b> sites incurred rapid predation and caused predation rates to be greater during the incubation than nestling stage. This pattern also was exhibited in a bird species with similar (i. e. controlled) parental activity between <b>nesting</b> stages. Once <b>nest</b> site effects are taken into account, <b>nest</b> predation shows a strong proximate increase with parental activity during the nestling stage within and across species. Parental activity and <b>nest</b> sites exert antagonistic influences on current estimates of <b>nest</b> predation between <b>nesting</b> stages and both must be considered in order to understand current patterns of <b>nest</b> predation, which is an important source of natural selection...|$|R
