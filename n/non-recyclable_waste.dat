25|$|There {{are many}} actions along the {{recycling}} supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It {{begins with the}} waste producers who place non-target and <b>non-recyclable</b> <b>wastes</b> in recycling collection. This can {{affect the quality of}} final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can {{make it more difficult to}} separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.

40|$|Sweden {{has a large}} mining {{industry}} compared {{to the rest of}} Europe that results in large amounts of mine waste that must be taken care of in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. The mine waste consist of either of waste rock, that is unmineralized/uneconomic that have to be mined for practical reasons to get access to the ore, or tailings, which is a waste product from the enrichment process. The most common oretype to be mined is metal sulfide ore, out of 13 active metal ore mines in the end of 2009 sulfide ore was mined in 11 mines. The sulfide ore often have a metal content of a few percent that results in large amounts of tailings. The tailings are stored in large deposits at the mine site and when the tailings are exposed to oxygen in the air the sulfides in the tailings oxidize. The oxidation of sulfide minerals creates acid mine drainage with high metal content and is considered to be harmful to health and environment. In combination with Sweden’s more and more strict environmental legislation the demands have increased on the {{mining industry}} to find good and sustainable solutions to prevent oxidation of sulfide rich tailings. At the same time the heavy industry has become affected by increased costs for landfilling of <b>non-recyclable</b> <b>wastes</b> and has therefore started to search for new alternatives for reusing the waste instead of landfilling it. Two types of wastes that have become interesting to use as cover materials for landfills and tailing deposits are green liquor dregs and fly ashes. To evaluate how green liquor dregs and fly ash ages when used as cover materials in landfills the Rönnskär processing plant and smelter placed two covers on their tailings deposits as pilot study in 2006. One of the covers consisted of green liquor dregs from Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner AB and the other cover consisted of fly ashes from Skellefteå Kraft AB. This study is an evaluation of the two covers after being in use for 5 years. Due to a high water saturation degree both of the covers can be considered to decrease oxygen diffusion to the tailings via air. This has resulted in an oxygen level in the covers to be low according to the mobility of the elements interpreted from the chemical analysis. The covers also have a chemical impact on the tailings where the most noticeable change is the pH. The pH in the tailings under the covers have increased from ca pH 2 to ca pH 3 - 6 compared to the tailings without cover. The covers also {{have a negative impact on}} the tailings where the highest impact is that Zn is leaching from the covers and accumulated in the tailings below. Seen from a technical point of view the green liquor dregs and the fly ashes is not clearly suitable as covers since there are some qualities, for example permeability, that can be improved. But the materials does have several qualities that makes them suitable, for example water saturation degree, buffer capacity etc., and these qualities in combination with how the materials reacts to ageing gives room for additional studies for the purpose of making the materials more suitable to be used as covers.

Decrease in peak intensities of final vermicomposted samples at 2783 – 2879  cm− 1 in the aliphatic region confirms decomposition of aliphatic compounds. Deka et al.

The authors confirmed that the FT-IR spectra of final vermicomposted mixtures revealed increased nitrogen compounds and decreased aliphatic and aromatic compounds as compared to the pre-vermicomposted waste mixtures which indicate degradation of biowaste during vermicomposting process. In vermicomposted samples, the presence of less intensity of peak for CH 2 and CH 3 at 2915 and 2846  cm− 1 indicates the decrease of aliphatic compounds which indicates the stabilization or decomposition of biowaste material. Ali et al. (2012) applied FT-IR spectroscopy in vegetable waste, tree leaves, saw dust and cow dung mixtures using rotary drum composting process. The results confirmed that the seasonal variation and composting time determines the decrease in aliphatic and polysaccharide components. Lv et al. (2013) applied FT-IR spectra on water extractable organic matter (WEOM) extracted from vermicomposting process of cattle dung. The results indicated a decreasing trend of aliphatic C–H stretching at 2936 – 2958  cm− 1 that confirms lipids and carbohydrate degradation. In general, decrease of aliphatic compounds, N-containing groups, carbohydrates and enrichment of aromatic components in the WEOM confirmed the organics transformation and maturity during the vermicomposting of cattle dung.|$|R

Large quantities of <b>non-recyclable</b> plastic <b>waste</b> get collected in paper recycling plants in Muzaffamagar and other regions in India. The plastic waste is typically {{in the form of}} protective covers, thin film, binding coils etc., which gets separated from paper during the pulping process. Because of its low value in recycling markets, the plastic waste is currently being burned as a substitute fuel for biomass in meeting the steam generation needs in paper production. Though incineration of plastic along with other solid waste for energy recovery is a common practice in countries like Europe, low technology employed in grate boilers without proper environmental equipment are creating serious problems in this region due to combustion-generated pollution. Instead, pyrolysis technologies in combination with innovative catalysts are evolving in recent years for converting waste plastic into fuel oil, diesel, and LPG. These technologies are proven to be safe and environmental-friendly, while producing value-added products that are in high demand. The primary objective of this research study is to investigate suitable technologies to convert waste plastic that is generated in the Muzaffarnagar paper cluster into value-added products, while considering certain unique requirements such as the ability to handle large quantities of mixed plastic, availability of biomass heating sources, lack of skilled workers, and limited capital and operating costs that {{play an important role in}} new technology adoption. Moreover, implementation of a suitable technology subject to economic and social considerations in this region is explored at a system-level.

40|$|Traditionally, {{oxidation}} catalysis {{has used}} stoichiometric oxidants, often producing toxic and <b>non-recyclable</b> metal <b>waste.</b> Engineering catalyst active sites in heterogeneous catalysts which {{are capable of}} harnessing molecular oxygen from the air is greatly advantageous as it is benign, produces water as the by-product, is easy to handle and is cheap and readily available. This work examines the simultaneous isomorphous substitution of two transition metal centres into the inorganic framework positions of aluminophosphate (AlPO) structures. The two metal centres have a profound electronic influence on each other, displaying a synergistic effect to facilitate enhanced conversion and selectivity towards the desired product. For example in the ammoximation of cyclohexanone, when cobalt and titanium were simultaneously substituted into the AFI (CoTiAlPO- 5) framework greater activity was achieved than for the monometallic analogues, or a physical mixture of the two. Probing the transition metal active sites using DR UV/Visible spectroscopy and EXAFS showed that the titanium site displayed greater tetrahedral character when present in the same framework with cobalt, while the cobalt site showed {{a greater proportion of}} cycling between Co(II) /C (III) compared to previously reported estimates for monometallic CoAlPO- 5. Establishing the role of each metal in the CoTiAlPO- 5 system and contextualising this as either inherent structural synergy (as is suggested by the trends in the spectroscopic data), as mechanistic synergy (where the presence of the two different transition metals facilitates an alternative reaction pathway) or a combination of the two, has allowed structure-property correlations to be deduced. The ratio of the two transition metals substituted into the AFI framework were varied and screened in a model epoxidation reaction, showing that the system was most effective with a lower (as small as 1 atom %) loading of the (oxophilic) titanium centre – highlighting the importance of site isolation – while the cobalt active centre was most effective in slightly higher loadings (of up to 6 atom %) ...|$|R

40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{collection}} and removal of 'small amounts of special waste' (SAKM) from private households and small industries, statistic information up to now gave no coherent information about the practice and efficiency of collecting and removing SAKM. Therefore {{it was necessary to}} analyse the different systems available for collecting and removing SAKM all over Germany, and noting weak points and factors that may have an influence on the system. The aim of this work was to establish concepts for all over Germany and to find ways to put the concepts into practice. Procedure: - evaluation of literature {{in order to get a}} Germany-wide overview of the actual situation regarding collecting and removing SAKM; - choice of 10 systems examined locally referring to regional differences (city/country) as well as different systems (mobile/stationary); - analusis of the chosen systems by talking to the agencies doing the collection and removal, as well as to the communal authorities; -presentation of the actual situation also referring to weak points; -development of concepts in order to optimise the collection and removal of SAKM; - evaluation of the possibility of putting the concepts into practice with reference to costs and benefits. As a result it was found that in Germany there is a unique and all over net of collection and removal of SAKM. The dominating system is a combination of mobile and stationary collection. In nearly all the communities some kind of a bring-system is realised. In the country there are more mobile systems, and in the cities there are principal stationary systems. An optimised concept consists of a combination of a mobile collection in urban and country areas, as well as a call-system for suburban settlements referring to the SAKM from private households. SAKM from small industries are to be collected by a waste-specific pick-up system. The biggest potential for further optimising the removal-situation is within the small industries, and waste electronic apparatus.

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the optimum way of recovering energy from the biodegradable fractions of municipal waste. A part-life cycle study was carried out on the following wastes; paper, food waste, garden <b>waste,</b> wood, <b>non-recyclable</b> mixed municipal <b>waste</b> and refuse derived fuel. The energy recovery processes considered were incineration, gasification, combustion in dedicated plant, anaerobic digestion and combustion in a cement kiln. Methods. The LCA was carried out using WRATE, an LCA tool designed specifically for waste management studies. Additional information on waste composition, waste collection and the performance of the energy recovery processes was obtained from a number of UK-based sources. The results take account of the energy displaced by the waste to energy processes and also the benefits obtained by the associated recycling of digestates, metals and aggregates as appropriate. Results and discussion. For all the waste types considered the maximum benefits in terms of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion would be achieved by using the waste in a cement kiln as a substitute fuel for coal. When considering the impacts in terms of human toxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication, direct combustion with energy recovery was the best option. The results were found to be highly sensitive to the efficiency of the energy recovery process and the conventional fuel displaced by the recovered energy. Conclusions and recommendations. This study has demonstrated that LCA can be used to determine the benefits and burdens associated with recovering energy from municipal waste fractions. However, the findings were restricted by the lack of reliable data on the performance of waste gasification and anaerobic digestion systems and on the burdens arising from collecting the wastes. It is recommended that further work is carried out to address these data gaps. ...|$|R
