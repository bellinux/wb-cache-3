5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money {{in one of two}} outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E

Law was {{understood}} {{to reflect the}} moral universe, and a criminal or civil offense would throw that universe out of balance {{in a way that}} only just punishment could restore. The official Five Punishments (wu xing) prescribed under the Qing Code included beating with the light bamboo, beating with the heavy bamboo, penal servitude, exile, and execution. In calibrating punishment, the magistrate had to take into account not only the nature of the offense but the relation between the guilty party and the victim. An offense by a son against a father was far more serious than one by a father against a son, likewise an offense by a wife or other member of the family.|$|E

He served as general secretary under Health Minister Cantacuzino, between 1931 and 1933. He wrote articles arguing that the high mortality rate in Romania's rural areas was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> health, but had to do with lack of education, poverty, malnutrition, with political and administrative causes. Still a socialist, Slătineanu believed the 1923 land reform entrenched a form of neo-serfdom that did not address other issues plaguing the peasantry. He organized a model health system in Tomești plasă where he introduced various methods of health education. One of these consisted of a garden where the local peasants would learn how to cultivate vegetables with a rational system of nutrition in mind.|$|E

Thus, the nature of mystical experience could be tailored to the particular cultural and theological issues of the time.|$|R

Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: [...] "Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria".|$|E

The padres blessed the site, and with the aid of their military escort fashioned temporary shelters out of tree limbs or driven stakes, roofed with thatch or reeds.

No doubt you could get a sort of teacher for every score or even for every dozen children, a commonplace person who could be trained to do a few simple educational things, but I am speaking now of good teachers who have the mental subtlety, the sympathy and the devotion necessary for efficient teaching by the individualistic methods in use to-day. And since, using the methods that are used to-day, you can only hope to secure fully satisfactory results with one teacher to every score of pupils, or fewer, and since it is unlikely we shall ever be able to command the services of more than a tithe of the people who could teach well, it seems that we come up here against an insurmountable obstacle to an educated population.|$|E

40|$|I use {{the lens}} of the “critical traveler” to argue that the {{international}} border crossing of Palestine/Israel is both a settler colonial technology for the State of Israel, and a site of resistance for the transnational Palestinian solidarity movement. Israel deems certain travelers as critical to its settler colonial project. Israel marks Palestinian and Muslim travelers as racially critical to Israel that aims to be a Jewish majority state. Israel also marks travelers as critical because it suspects that these travelers espouse critical views of Israel’s settler colonialist ideology and practice. As such, Israel has established a border security system to identify and subject critical travelers; the system consists of segregated surveillance, intelligence collection, biopolitical techniques, and border expansion. Furthermore, Israel is an occupying power and critical travelers vary in nationalities; therefore, third states – states that are not Israel or Palestine – are also accountable to Israel’s treatment of critical travelers. As a third state, through policymaking and rhetoric, the United States has supported Israel’s unilateral control of international Palestine/Israel border crossings. However, the transnational Palestinian solidarity network harnesses the narratives written by critical travelers to inform the legal and cultural discourse of critique of Israel’s colonial past, present and future. The struggle between the critical traveler and Israel’s border security is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> between <b>an</b> individual traveler and a sovereign nation-state. Rather the struggle serves as an analytic for the global perpetuation of as well as the global resistance to Israel’s ongoing settler colonial project in Palestine.

We have gathered a corpus of 100 English titles and the corresponding Spanish and French titles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} gives {{a justification}} of judicial review, {{which is the}} institution of courts having final authority to interpret a constitution. Under the family of liberal democratic political theories, judicial review can be justified, even though it constricts popular control over important political decisions, {{as a means of}} protecting basic democratic liberties and perhaps promoting other important social goods. On this view, democracy is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> procedural <b>matter</b> of popularly-responsive government, but a form of sovereignty that requires a variety of substantive rights, potentially including rights unrelated to the political process. Since the rights judicial review might protect must be further articulated and specified to apply to particular cases, however, the democratic justness or legitimacy of judicial review requires that judges interpret constitutions using methods of interpretation that can themselves be democratically justified. This dissertation shows how a Rawlsian idea of public reason supplies the basis for just such a method of reasoning, one that proceeds based on reasons all reasonable persons could accept in their capacity as democratic citizens. This idea of public reason applies not only to judges or where matters of fundamental justice are at issue, but ideally can be extended to regulate much, if not all, public political debate in a democracy. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to determine whether}} people who live {{with each other for}} a long period of time grow physically similar in their facial features. Photographs of couples when they were first married and 25 years later were judged for physical similarity and for the likelihood that they were married. The results showed that there is indeed an increase in apparent similarity after 25 years of cohabitation. Moreover, increase in resemblance was associated with greater reported marital happiness. Among the explanations of this phenomenon that were examined, one based on a theory of emotional efference emerged as promising. This theory proposes that emotional processes produce vascular changes that are, in part, regulated by facial musculature. The facial muscles are said to act as ligatures on veins and arteries, and they thereby are able to divert blood from, or direct blood to, the brain. An implication of the vascular theory of emotional efference is that habitual use of facial musculature may permanently affect the physical features of the face. The implication holds further that two people who live with {{each other for a long}}er period of time, by virtue of repeated empathic mimicry, would grow physically similar in their facial features.
