5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no <b>nurse</b> <b>was</b> employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E

40|$|David E VanceThe University of Alabama School of Nursing, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USAAbstract: Many of {{us think}} of nurses as people who provide direct care to us and our loved ones. And that is true. Images of a selfless person such as Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War running from one wounded soldier to another {{providing}} care inspires the imagination of what a <b>nurse</b> <b>is</b> and can be. Based on that image, a <b>nurse</b> <b>is</b> anyone who cares (and from a spiritual or philosophical perspective, that may <b>be</b> true). But <b>nursing</b> as a profession is so much more. <b>nurse</b> <b>is</b> someone with a very selective skill set {{that can only be}} developed and honed by intense training, education, and discipline while being used in a proscribed ethical manner. With such a combination of skills, ethics, and caring, <b>nurses</b> <b>are</b> the backbone of health care settings, tending to the individual needs of the patients; however, many nurses also function outside such traditional settings and perform numerous functions. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> educators and provide data to the public designed to improve health literacy and promote physical and mental wellness. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> computer and organizational specialists who provide hospitals and institutions with the technologies for keeping, maintaining, and analyzing records. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> clergy, psychologists, and philosophers providing a direction and a moral compass in how to are for patients and each other. <b>Nurses</b> <b>are</b> researchers investigating everything from developing medication for Alzheimer&# 39;s disease to improving crop yields to reduce hunger.
