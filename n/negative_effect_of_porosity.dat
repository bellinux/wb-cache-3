40|$|Efforts {{have been}} made to analyze the Shliomis model based ferrofluid {{lubrication}} of a squeeze film between rotating rough curved circular plates where the upper plate has a porous facing. Different models of porosity are treated. The stochastic modeling of Christensen and Tonder has been employed to evaluate the effect of surface roughness. The related stochastically averaged Reynolds type equation is numerically solved to obtain the pressure distribution, leading to the calculation of load carrying capacity. The results presented in graphical form establish that the Kozeny-Carman model is more favorable as compared to the Irmay one from the design point of view. It is observed that the Shliomis model based ferrofluid lubrication performs relatively better than the Neuringer-Rosensweig one. Although the bearing suffers due to transverse surface roughness, with a suitable choice of curvature parameters and rotational ratio, the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> and standard deviation can be minimized by the ferrofluid lubrication at least in the case of negatively skewed roughness...|$|E
40|$|Additively {{manufactured}} (AM) 316 L steel exhibits extraordinary {{high yield}} strength, and surprisingly good ductility despite {{the high level}} of porosity in the material. This detailed study sheds light on the origins of the observed high yield strength and good ductility. The extremely fine cells which are formed because of rapid cooling and dense dislocations are responsible for the macroscopically high yield strength of the AM 316 L (almost double of that seen in annealed 316 L steel). Most interestingly, twinning is dominant in deformed samples of the AM 316. It is believed that twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) behaviour to be responsible for the excellent ductility of the steel despite {{the high level of}} porosity. The dominant twinning activity is attributed to Nitrogen gas used in 3 D printing. Nitrogen can lower the stacking fault energy of the steel, leading to the disassociation of dislocations, promoting the deformation twinning. Twinning induces large plasticity during deformation that can compensate the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> in AM steel. However, twinning does not induce significant hardening because (1) the porosity causes a negative effect on hardening and (2) twinning spacing is still larger than extremely fine solidification cells...|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to study and analyze the {{performance}} of a magnetic fluid based squeeze film between rotating porous transversely rough circular plates with concentric circular pockets. The porous housing is considered to be elastically negligibly deformable with its contact surface transversely rough. The stochastic film thickness characterizing the random roughness is assumed to be asymmetric with non zero mean and variance. The pressure distribution is obtained by solving the associated stochastically averaged Reynolds equation with appropriate boundary conditions. This results in the calculation of the load carrying capacity. All the results in graphical form establish that the transverse roughness in conjunction with the deformation has a strong <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> on the performance of the bearing system. The bearing suffers on account of transverse surface roughness in general which probably {{is due to the fact}} that the roughness of the bearing surfaces tends to retard the motion of the lubricant resulting in decreased load carrying capacity. However, this <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> roughness, <b>porosity</b> and deformation can be minimized by the positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the magnetization parameter in the case of negatively skewed roughness by choosing a suitable combination of pocket radius and rotational inertia. Lastly, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> radii ratio is noted to be quite significant...|$|R

The investigations demonstrate the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> wall shear stress and recirculating flow on the concentration distribution in the vessels lumen and on wall mass transfer keeping the porosity in view.

40|$|The {{graphite}} anode in {{lithium-ion batteries}} {{is vulnerable to}} capacity fade due to several mechanisms. Advancement in understanding of such capacity fade mechanisms has {{paved the way for}} selecting design parameters that consider these effects. This paper shows the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity,</b> thickness, and tortuosity of the anode on capacity fade mechanisms. Three main capacity fade mechanisms are analyzed in this paper: (1) solid electrolyte interface (SEI) side reaction, (2) lithium plating side reactions and (3) mechanical degradation due to intercalation induced stresses. Moreover, for a given thickness and <b>porosity</b> <b>of</b> anode, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> variation on capacity fade mechanisms is also presented. © The Author(s) 2015.
