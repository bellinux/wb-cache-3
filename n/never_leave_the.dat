5|$|Jill Abbott is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The longest-running (and only remaining original) character, Jill was created and introduced by William J. Bell. Originally portrayed by Brenda Dickson, when Dickson departed in 1980, the role was first recast with Deborah Adair. Dickson returned in 1983, {{and although she}} stated that she would <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> role again, she was replaced by Jess Walton in 1987, who continues in the role to present time.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's {{primary concern}} was {{to place the}} {{provision}} of food supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E

They usually <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> house, but have a rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy at the door and {{explains}} that the house is always kept at ‚àí3¬∞C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E

5|$|Lili ªuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Lili ªuokalani Trust. Lili ªuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in the}} political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Lili ªuokalani feared she would <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1987, the RSC staged the play in 2003, under the {{direction}} of Bill Alexander and starring David Bradley as Titus, Maureen Beattie as Tamora, Joe Dixon as Aron and Eve Myles as Lavinia. Convinced that Act 1 was by George Peele, Alexander felt he was not undermining the integrity of Shakespeare by drastically altering it; for example, Saturninus and Tamora are present throughout, they <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> stage; there is no division between the upper and lower levels; all mention of Mutius is absent; and over 100 lines were removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{maturation}} of {{the insect}} (from egg to adult) lasts between 24 and 45 days, varying {{according to the}} weather. Usually, the female drills the berry through the central disc, although it can enter through the side walls if the fruit is dry. Two days after the access, the beetle lays 35‚Äì50 eggs, which produce 13 females for each male. The lifespan for females is 35‚Äì190 days and for males 40 days. The new insects mate inside the seed. Some females lay the eggs in the same coffee plant, others colonise new ones. The males <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> fruit.|$|E

25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree she has seen on the grounds has been tall enough to hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against Beast's orders that she <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't there at all. When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} isospin {{symmetry}} and related {{methods such as}} the Eightfold Way come from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under {{the action of the}} Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the strong force behaves the same under the exchange of the up and down quark (and by extension the exchange of the proton and the neutron).|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{credentials}} as a player, {{there was some}} concern raised that Kubik had no real history as a coach, and he did little to endear himself to fans by bringing in Richard Hancox as coach. Torquay's dire form continued, and the club crashed {{to the bottom of}} the table on Boxing Day; they would ultimately <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> foot of the table after that. After the worst run of form in the club's history, Kubik eventually quit on 5 February, having won just one of his matches in charge, and Colin Lee was soon after appointed as the new director of football and Keith Curle was appointed as Head Coach on 7 February 2007. Roberts resigned amid growing pressure from supporters and the board of directors, all of whom were unhappy with his conduct as chairman, on 21 February 2007. Local hotel owner Keith Richardson was announced as the new chairman the following day. However, on 7 March 2007, former chairman Mike Bateson was reappointed as chairman, the move coming about due to Chris Roberts' company, Torquay United Holdings, being unable to meet the next payment to purchase the club from Bateson.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{marched into}} Prague on 15 March 1939. In mid-April, the Soviet Union, Britain and France began trading {{diplomatic}} suggestions regarding {{a political and}} military agreement to counter potential further German aggression. Poland {{did not participate in}} these talks. The tripartite discussions focused on possible guarantees to participating countries should German expansionism continue. The Soviets did not trust the British or the French to honour a collective security agreement, because they had already failed to react against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and protect Czechoslovakia from dismemberment. The Soviet Union also suspected that Britain and France would seek to remain on the sidelines of any potential Nazi-Soviet conflict. In reality however, Stalin had been conducting secret talks with Nazi Germany already since 1936 through his emissaries, and all along a deal with Hitler remained his first diplomatic choice, wrote Robert C. Grogin (author of Natural Enemies). The Soviet Union sought nothing short of an ironclad guarantee against losing its sphere of influence, and insisted on stretching the so-called buffer zone from Finland to Romania, {{in the event of an}} attack. The Soviets demanded the right to enter these countries in the event of a security threat. When the military talks began in mid-August, negotiations quickly stalled over the topic of Soviet troop passage through Poland if the Germans attacked. British and French officials pressured Polish government to agree to the Soviet terms. However, Polish officials bluntly refused to allow Soviet troops in Poland. They believed that once the Red Army entered Poland it might <b>never</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>The</b> Soviets suggested that Poland's wishes be ignored, and that the tripartite agreements be concluded despite its objections. The British refused to do so because they believed that such a move would push Poland into establishing stronger bilateral relations with Germany.|$|E
500|$|Olmstead {{split the}} 1950‚Äì51 season between four teams, playing {{for all but}} one of them. He began the season playing for the Black Hawks franchise, playing 15games in the NHL and 12 in the USHL, for the Milwaukee Sea Gulls. On December 2, 1950, Olmstead, with Vic Stasiuk, was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, in {{exchange}} for Lee Fogolin and Steve Black. [...] On December 19, 1950, 17days after the trade to Detroit, he was traded again, without ever suiting up for the Red Wings, to Montreal, for Leo Gravelle. Olmstead would <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> NHL until his retirement in 1962, playing 39games that season on a line with Maurice Richard and Elmer Lach, scoring 38 points. Olmstead also appeared in 11playoff games, collecting six points, as the Canadiens lost the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals to the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games.|$|E

As Gothel, Murphy lists several things for Rapunzel to fear, such as ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand, cannibals, snakes and the plague, {{in an attempt to}} deter her from leaving. Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow also observed that at one point the song contradicts itself, with its lyrics first implying that Rapunzel that can leave [...] "soon, but not yet", only to eventually conclude, [...] "Rapunzel will <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> tower ever." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed cited [...] "don't ever ask to leave this tower again" [...] as the song's [...] "most villainous lyric." [...] John Roebuck of ReelGood observed that the song's lyrics are essentially [...] "Snide remarks on [...] stolen daughter's appearance and abilities ... disguised as a mothers concern."
