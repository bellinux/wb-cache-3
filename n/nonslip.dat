25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys.

The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a <b>nonslip,</b> stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|E

40|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} at replication-blocking lesions {{requires the}} induction of proteins that {{are controlled by}} the SOS system in Escherichia coli. Of the proteins identified so far, UmuD′, UmuC, and RecA* were shown to facilitate replication across UV-light-induced lesions, yielding both error-free and mutagenic translesion-synthesis products. Similar to UV lesions, N- 2 -acetylaminofluorene (AAF), a chemical carcinogen that forms covalent adducts at the C 8 position of guanine residues, is a strong replication-blocking lesion. Frameshift mutations are induced efficiently by AAF adducts when located within short repetitive sequences in a two-step mechanism; AAF adducts incorporate a cytosine across from the lesion and then form a primer-template misaligned intermediate that, upon elongation, yields frameshift mutations. Recently, we have shown that although elongation from the <b>nonslipped</b> intermediate depends on functional umuDC+ gene products, elongation from the slipped intermediate is umuDC+-independent but requires another, as yet biochemically uncharacterized, SOS function. We now show that in DNA Polymerase III-proofreading mutant strains (dnaQ 49 and mutD 5 strains), elongation from the slipped intermediate is highly efficient {{in the absence of}} SOS induction—in contrast to elongation from the <b>nonslipped</b> intermediate, which still requires UmuDC functions...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the mode localization phenomenon associated with mistuning is presented for shrouded blade assemblies. The calculations {{are based on a}} generic finite element model, which permits modeling of arbitrary mistuning and both slipping and <b>nonslipping</b> shroud interfaces. The results presented indicate that interactions occur between mistuning and slip effects, with maximum mode localization occurring when the shrouds slip freely. Certain modes are found to be very sensitive to shroud slip, and in some cases completely change character when slip occurs. Mode localization is most pronounced in the predominantly bending modes, and varies considerably from mode to mode. As the ratio of interblade coupling strength to mistuning strength is increased, the effect of mistuning is observed to decrease significantly. This result has important implications for the flutter problem, since it suggests that the stabilization effect available from mistuning is significantly less for a shrouded rotor as compared to an unshrouded rotor...|$|R

40|$|Geochemical {{characteristics}} of sediments are responses to {{physical and chemical}} alteration in landslides. However, consequences of in situ interactions associated with landslides are difficult to distinguish from those related to long-term weathering in young soft sediments such as loess. In this study, geochemical {{characteristics of}} the Kulcs landslide in Hungary are studied to identify the provenance of the loess–paleosol–red clay sequence and geochemical signatures that can potentially {{be attributed to the}} effects of landsliding. Results indicate that sliding is largely initiated by the lithological changes within the landslide body. Sediments above the sliding zone closely resemble the <b>nonslipped</b> Pleistocene old loess deposits from Hungary. It is also confirmed that the sliding zone develops in old paleosols in the loess sequence and red clays at its base which are all characterized by the enrichment of Al, K, Na, H 2 O and considerable depletion in Ca and Mg associated with carbonates. Altogether, these geochemical characteristics indicate that chemical weathering trend of unconsolidated landslide sediments is slightly modified by the redistribution of carbonates and decomposition of plagioclase.

40|$|Mutations are {{permanent}} DNA sequence {{changes that}} can be induced when replication occurs on a damaged DNA template. In Escherichia coli, the process of translesion synthesis past a lesion that hinders replication requires the induction of SOS-controlled gene products, among which {{are those of the}} umuDC operon. To study translesion synthesis in vivo, we have constructed single-stranded vectors containing single 2 -acetylaminofluorene adducts located within − 1 and − 2 frameshift mutation hot spots formed by short repetitive sequences. These adducts strongly hinder DNA replication as only 2 – 5 % of the molecules give rise to progeny under non-SOS-induced conditions. Induction of the SOS response lead to a 10 -fold increase in survival. Adducts present within repetitive sequences trigger the formation of misaligned primer/template replication intermediates which, upon elongation, will result in the fixation of frameshift errors (mutagenic translesion synthesis). Surprisingly we find that elongation from the <b>nonslipped</b> intermediate depends upon functional umuDC+ gene products, whereas elongation from the slipped intermediate is umuDC+ independent but requires another, as yet biochemically uncharacterized, SOS function.

40|$|International audienceA novel nano-to-elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) multiscale approach, {{developed to}} integrate molecular-scale phenomena into macroscopic lubrication models {{based on the}} continuum hypothesis, is applied to a lubricated contact problem with a ceramic–steel interface and a nanometric film thickness. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to quantify wall slip occurring under severe confinement. Its dependence on the sliding velocity, film thickness, pressure, and different wall materials is described through representative analytical laws. These are then coupled to a modified Reynolds equation, where a no-slip condition applies to the ceramic surface and slip occurring on the steel wall is described through a Navier-type boundary condition. The results of this nano-to-EHL approach can contradict the well-established lubrication theory for thin films. In fact, slip can occur over the whole contact length, leading to a significant modification of the lubricant flow and consequently of the film thickness. If both walls move at the same velocity, the flow is reduced at the contact inlet and the film thickness decreases. If the <b>nonslipping</b> wall entrains the fluid, this one is accelerated resulting in a larger mass flow; nevertheless, the surface separation is reduced as the lubricant flows even faster in the contact center. The opposite effect occurs if the slipping surface entrains the fluid, causing a lower mass flow but higher film thickness. Finally, friction is generally smaller compared to the classical no-slip case and becomes independent of the sliding velocity as total slip is approached...|$|R

40|$|Background. A {{previous}} study found that, with repeated exposure to slipping during a sit-to-stand task, fall incidence decreased {{at a similar}} exponential rate in young and older adults. This study investigated the adaptations responsible for this decrease. Methods. Slips were induced, using bilateral low-friction platforms, during a sit-to-stand in 60 young and 41 older healthy safety-harnessed adults. Participants underwent 5 slips, then a 6 th slip (reslip) after 3 – 4 <b>nonslipping</b> trials. Between-trial adjustments in body center of mass state at seat-off were examined and correlated to the likelihoods of falling and stepping. Changes in reactive response between the first slip and reslip were investigated. Results. With repeated slipping, both young and older adults adjusted to increase their center of mass anterior position and forward velocity at seat-off (p,. 001), contributing to decreased fall incidence and changes in step incidence and direction (p,. 001). These proactive adjustments predicted fall incidence well in later trials, but underpredicted fall incidence upon the first slip by 9 %– 21 %, suggesting that reactive response deficiencies also initially contributed to falls by both age groups. Ten participants who initially fell without stepping adapted by stepping to recover upon the reslip.

40|$|Research {{on walking}} robots {{has shown that}} the process of walking, in itself, {{requires}} little energy. Indeed, many robots have been built that walk with high efficiency. General analysis and control tools for such efficient walkers, however, are lacking, and many results are based on engineering intuition and ad hoc solutions. This thesis aims to provide a framework for modeling, analysis, and efficient control of walking robots. The framework uses a port-Hamiltonian system description to express the dynamics of rigid mechanisms and their interaction with the ground. The structure of the resulting models forms the basis for the development of general analysis and control techniques. The proposed framework extends well-known modeling methods to a broad class of rigid mechanisms with a configuration space described by any combination of Euclidean components (such as linear joints), Lie group/algebra components (such as ball joints), and nonholonomic components (such as <b>nonslipping</b> wheels). Two different 3 D contact models are presented: one for compliant contact, and one for rigid contact. Using the structure of the models, the problem of finding efficient walking gaits is cast as a numerical optimization problem. This setting allows one to optimize not only the joint trajectories but also the mechanical structure of a walking robot. Finally, three control techniques for efficient walking are presented. The first technique uses the computed optimal trajectories to define a power-continuous asymptotic tracking controller. The second technique stabilizes an experimental kneed walking robot by means of a single controller on the hip joint. The third technique uses foot placement to increase the robustness of a three-dimensional walking robot...|$|R
