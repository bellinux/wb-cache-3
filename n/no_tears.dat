The fear for some Protestants, especially those part of the Protestant Ascendancy, was that Catholic emancipation would immediately follow any union. The artisans and merchants of Dublin also feared any union as it may have resulted in a loss of business.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} service, Hogan {{returned}} to the film industry, {{but only for a}} short time. In 1947 he appeared in a featured role in Blaze of Noon, starring Anne Baxter and William Holden. In 1948 he was featured in two more films: Beyond Glory, starring Alan Ladd and Donna Reed; and Shed <b>No</b> <b>Tears,</b> starring Wallace Ford and June Vincent. Even though it was the first film he worked on in 1948, his final on-screen performance was in Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. In it, Hogan played the crucial role of David Kentley, the erstwhile friend who is strangled {{at the beginning of the}} picture and whose body is hidden in a chest while the murderers' guests have dinner in the same room. Hogan's final acting appearance was on the Broadway stage, in the unsuccessful comedy, Time for Elizabeth, which ran for only 8 performances at the Fulton Theatre in September–October 1948.|$|E

2500|$|Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay then {{recounted the}} {{circumstances}} of Nilsen's arrest and his [...] "calm, matter-of-fact" [...] confessions, before reading to the court several statements volunteered by Nilsen following his arrest. In one of these statements, Nilsen had stated: [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>tears</b> for my victims; I have <b>no</b> <b>tears</b> for myself, nor those bereaved by my actions". Jay admitted it was unusual for anyone accused of such horrific crimes to be so forthcoming in providing information; conceding upon questioning by the defence counsel that Nilsen not only provided most of the evidence against himself, but also encouraged the discovery of evidence which could contradict {{his own version of}} events. Following the testimony of DCI Jay, Detective Superintendent Chambers recited Nilsen's formal confession to the court. This testimony included graphic descriptions of the ritualistic and sexual acts Nilsen performed with his victims' bodies, his various methods of storage of bodies and/or body parts, dismemberment and disposal, and the problems decomposition — particularly regarding colonies of maggots — afforded him. Several members of the jury were visibly shaken throughout much of this testimony; others looked at Nilsen with incredulous expressions on their faces as Nilsen listened to the testimony with apparent indifference. This testimony lasted until the following morning, when the prosecution included several exhibits into evidence. This included the cooking pot in which Nilsen had boiled the heads of the victims killed at Cranley Gardens, the cutting board Nilsen had used to dissect John Howlett, and several rusted catering knives which had formerly belonged to victim Martyn Duffey.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album in the Summer of 2000. Midian was based around the Clive Barker novel Cabal and its subsequent film adaptation Nightbreed.

Bradley's line [...] "Oh, <b>no</b> <b>tears</b> please" [...] from the song [...] "Her Ghost in the Fog" [...] is a quote of Pinhead's from the first Hellraiser ("No tears, please. It's a waste of good suffering..."), and Bradley would reappear on later albums Nymphetamine, Thornography and Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder.

2500|$|According to Lord Moran, {{during the}} war years Churchill sought solace in his tumbler of whisky and soda and his cigar. Churchill was also a very {{emotional}} man, unafraid to shed tears when appropriate. During some of his broadcast speeches it was noticed {{that he was trying to}} hold back the tears. Nevertheless, although the fall of Tobruk was, by Churchill's own account [...] "one of the heaviest blows" [...] he received {{during the war}}, there seem to have been <b>no</b> <b>tears.</b> Certainly, the next day Moran found him animated and vigorous. Field Marshal Alanbrooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had been present when President Roosevelt broke the news of the tragedy to Churchill, focused afterwards in his diary on the superbly well judged manner in which the President made his offer of immediate military assistance, despite Alanbrooke's being ever ready to highlight what he perceived to be Churchill's contradictory motivations and flawed character during the war.

After the wedding, George Harrison (who had arrived on a bicycle) jokingly said 'Two down, two to go', meaning that the only two Beatles who were not married were Harrison and McCartney. The Starrs had a brief honeymoon for three days at the holiday home of Epstein's lawyer, David Jacobs, in Prince's Crescent, Hove, but gave an interview in the back garden on their wedding day, as they were being besieged by numerous reporters, with 100 photographers. Starr then had to depart to the Bahamas for the filming of Help!, on 22 February. She made it clear from the start that she would not give interviews, as a Beatles spokesperson explained: 'She doesn't want to get mixed up in publicity, and Ringo doesn't want her to, either.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Though their 1989 {{debut album}} Blood, Sweat and <b>No</b> <b>Tears</b> was a {{moderate}} success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until later albums. After {{the release of}} their second album Just Look Around in 1992, East West Records saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All's third and major label debut album, Scratch the Surface, was released in 1994 to critical acclaim, and included the singles [...] "Scratch the Surface" [...] and [...] "Step Down" [...] (the video for the latter single would also be featured in the 1995 Beavis and Butt-head episode [...] "Premature Evacuation"). Their 1997 follow-up Built to Last was also highly acclaimed. Despite the success of Built to Last, Sick of It All was dropped from East West and signed to Fat Wreck Chords in 1998, who released the band's next three albums before being dropped from the label in 2005, when they signed to Abacus Records, a subsidiary of Century Media. This label released their eighth studio album Death to Tyrants in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band's next three albums). Sick of It All's latest album, The Last Act of Defiance, was released on September 30, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|On October 11, 1985, Alex Odeh, {{regional}} director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), {{was killed in a}} mail bombing at his office in Santa Ana, California. Shortly before his killing, Odeh had appeared on the television show Nightline, where he engaged in a tense dialogue with a representative from the JDL. Irv Rubin immediately made several controversial public statements in reaction to the incident: [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>tears</b> for Mr. Odeh. He got exactly what he deserved. [...] My tears were used up crying for Leon Klinghoffer." [...] The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee both condemned the murder. Four weeks after Odeh's death, FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner stated the FBI attributed the bombing and two others to the JDL. In February 1986, the FBI classified the bombing that killed Alex Odeh as a terrorist act. Rubin denied JDL involvement: [...] "What the FBI is doing is simple. [...] Some character calls up a news agency or whatever and uses the phrase Never Again [...] and on that assumption they can go and slander a whole group. That's tragic." [...] In 1987, Floyd Clarke, then assistant director of the FBI, wrote in an internal memo that key suspects had fled to Israel and were living in the West Bank urban settlement of Kiryat Arba. In 1988, the FBI arrested Rochelle Manning as a suspect in the bombing, and also charged her husband, Robert Steven Manning, whom they considered a prime suspect in the attack; both were members of the JDL. Rochelle's jury deadlocked, and after the mistrial, she left for Israel to join her husband. Robert Manning was extradited from Israel to the U.S. in 1993. He was subsequently found guilty of involvement in the killing of the secretary of computer firm ProWest, Patricia Wilkerson, in another, unrelated mail bomb blast. In addition, he and other JDL members were also suspected in a string of other violent attacks through 1985, including the bombing of Boston ADC office that seriously injured two police officers, the bomb killing of suspected Nazi war criminal Tscherim Soobzokov in Paterson, New Jersey, and a bombing in Long Island that maimed a passerby. William Ross, another JDL member, was also found guilty for his participation in the bombing that killed Wilkerson. Rochelle Manning was re-indicted for her alleged involvement, and was detained in Israel, pending extradition, when she {{died of a heart attack}} in 1994.|$|E

This study aims {{to evaluate whether}} PRP stays within the injected area by using ultrasonography, to improve understanding of the spreads of intratendinous injected PRP. Thirty-nine patients (15 males, 24 females; mean age, 49. 3 years), who had symptoms on their elbows (> 6 months) and diagnosed as lateral (25 elbows) or medial (14 elbows) tendinopathies of elbow, were included. The severity of tendon pathology was assessed by ultrasonography as <b>tear</b> or <b>no</b> <b>tear.</b> Immediately after ultrasound-guided PRP injection, ultrasound images were evaluated to assess the area of PRP distribution, which {{was defined as the}} presence of fluid or microbubbles. Ultrasound revealed that 13 elbows had tendon tear and 26 had <b>no</b> <b>tear,</b> respectively. Post-injection ultrasound confirmed the injected PRP was within the tendon in all cases. The mean distance of distribution from the injection site was 12. 6 mm (5. 0 – 26. 0 mm). There was no difference in the distance of PRP distribution between tendon <b>tear</b> and <b>no</b> <b>tear.</b> Injected PRP spread to soft tissue outside the tendon in 20 of 39 cases. Intra-articular extension of PRP was observed in 5 cases. Although PRP remained intratendinous after the injection in all cases, some portion tended to spread outside from the injection site in a short space of time.
