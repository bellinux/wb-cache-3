Extensive research has focused on the washing effects of micro-bubbles and nano-bubbles, and mechanical work has been found to account for 50 % of the washing effect. In the present research, a water/nano-bubble mixture and several types of surfactants were investigated in an alternating flow system. The <b>nano-bubble</b> water achieved a washing rate of about 5 % greater than that of ion exchanged water. In addition, nano-bubbles mixed with an aqueous solution of surfactant exhibited a washing rate that depended on the ionization of the surfactant: the mixture of nano-bubbles and anionic surfactant exhibited a washing rate that was 10 % higher than that of aqueous anionic surfactant solution without nano-bubbles. As measured by the du Noüy method, the surface tension of <b>nano-bubble</b> water and anionic surfactant/nano-bubble mixtures were lower than that of water and aqueous anionic surfactant solution, respectively. These results provide evidence of an enhanced washing effect for <b>nano-bubble</b> mixtures...|$|E

The helium retention in samples exposed to plasma at temperatures[*][*]> 1000 [*]K is strongly correlated with <b>nano-bubble</b> formation measured using grazing incidence small-angle x-ray scattering. The diameters of nano-bubbles were not found to increase with increasing helium concentration, indicating that additional helium must be accommodated by increasing the bubble concentration or an increase in bubble pressure.

In contrast to soap and emulsion films, whose surfaces are homogeneous, solid substrates of wetting films are heterogeneous as a rule, unless special measures for their homogenization are taken. Here we mean primarily heterogeneous distribution of surface energy leading to existence of hydrophobic domains on hydrophilic surfaces and vice versa. As is known, such hydrophobic domains could {{play the role of}} gas-phase nucleation centers and it is widely accepted nowadays that <b>nano-bubbles</b> can be formed there. The present paper reviews the effect of <b>nano-bubbles</b> adhered at solid surface on stability of wetting films.

However, especially with respect to <b>nano-bubbles,</b> mainly due to the difficulty of measurement, it seems rare that the process of their formation is examined. Notwithstanding, it is certain that such the bubbles arise from some defects as their embryos occurring in a liquid phase. From conventional nucleation theories, for the growth of the embryos up to <b>nano-bubbles,</b> at least to some extent, it is necessary for them to exist in stable or metastable state. When an electrolyte dissolves in a solution, it dissociates into cations and anions, yielding solvated ions. In a solid solution, vacancies of atoms and ions are simultaneously formed. In a liquid solution, due to the random thermal motion of solution particles, it has been thought that such vacancies, even if possible, do not stably exist. However, recently, in copper electrodeposition, using a new electrode system called gravity electrode [1. 2], it has been measured that minute vacancies are co-generated during the reaction. In electrodeposition, as shown in Fig. 1, metallic ions and counter anions are adsorbed at inner and outer Helmholtz planes in electrical double layer. Electron transfer from the electrode surface changes the polarity of the metallic ion from positive to zero, which repels the counter anions surrounding the metallic ion.

Coalescence of vacancies guarantees the same structure as a vacancy, so that the internal pressure of <b>nano-bubble</b> is kept low, almost equal to the atmospheric pressure.

The heat transfer phenomena have drawn a great attention in the past decades. In the thesis, classical molecular dynamic simulations are carried out to study thermal and dynamic properties, including thermal conductivities, specific heat capacity, and shear viscosity. Though water molecule only has three charged atoms, but a number of water molecule models exist in the literature field. In this thesis, several rigid water molecule models are selected to perform the simulation. Then a non-equilibrium molecular dynamic is conducted to study <b>nano-bubble</b> growth and annihilation in the liquid water with rigid TIP 3 P. A <b>nano-bubble</b> is successfully generated, and pressure and surface tension of the bubble is obtained. Contact angle of a water droplet is also getting attention from micro-cooling engineers. A non-equilibrium molecular dynamics on contact angle of nano-size water droplet on a single wall carbon nanotube plate is performed. The gap distance between nano-tube affects the contact angle somehow, and a critical distance value that achieve largest contact angle is found. Rapid boiling phenomena of thin water film on a hot copper plate is also studied due to its application in various industrial fields, such as laser cleaning, thermal ink-jet printer, medical surgery. The entire process of the boiling phenomena is observed, and a piston-like motion of the film is analyzed. To the end, due to the size limitation of classical molecular dynamics, a hybrid simulation coupling molecular dynamic and computational fluid dynamic is developed to extend the simulation size to micron based on open-source code LIGGGHTS and OpenFOAM.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) is a computational tool used {{to study}} physical systems by modeling the atomic-scale interactions between atoms. MD can accurately predict the properties of materials where models are well developed. For new materials, models may be in their early stages and may lack the ability to produce accurate results; however, MD can still {{provide insight into the}} physical properties of these new materials. This thesis will use MD to study two different systems. First, the Lennard-Jones (L-J) liquid is {{used to study}} how the intrinsic slip lengths of atomic sized surfaces add to produce an effective slip of a larger surface made up of these atomic constituents. The results show that the effective slip of a surface is dominated by its smallest slip, and these results show good agreement with a theory that predicts effective slip given the intrinsic slip and roughness of a surface. The L-J model is also used to investigate the rolling and sliding motion of viscous drops on super-hydrophobic surfaces. The effects of drop size, slip length, and gravity on drop velocities are investigated, and a model that predicts drop speed given the characteristics of a drop and a surface is proposed. The model shows good agreement with simulation results, especially for certain regimes. Second, graphene is studied with MD using various atomistic models. The energies of layers of graphene are reproduced using an Adaptive Intermolecular Reactive Empirical Bond Order (AIREBO) potential, and the energies required to exfoliate graphene from crystal graphite and nickel nano-particles are calculated. The calculations from MD show good agreement with literature and experiment, and these results demonstrate how simple models in MD can produce useful results to aid research and experiment. Finally, the formation of <b>nano-bubbles</b> in graphene grown on platinum is studied using the AIREBO and L-J potentials. The basic formation of graphene <b>nano-bubbles</b> is demonstrated by compressing the edges of graphene flakes.

40|$|Gushing is the {{spontaneous}} wild and uncontrolled overfoaming phenomenon {{that occurs in}} over-carbonated beverages. This phenomenon can only be disclosed after the opening of bottled or canned beverages and represents important commercial damages for the companies. Only few preventive and no curative techniques are currently available, but some detection methods such as the patented ELISA test exist or are in progress. The key factor for gushing is the CO 2 and mainly the bubbles sizes during the carbonation phase. There is a critical diameter for bubbles in a liquid above which they grow until they explode at the surface and under which they shrink in size until their complete dissolution except {{in the presence of}} a contaminant (in the latter case, the bubble becomes unable to solubilize because of the contaminant that adsorbs on the surface of the bubble). Hydrophobins are amphiphilic molecules produced by filamentous fungi, that are present when the weather conditions on barley fields are wet. These proteins can adsorb at hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces and it is widely recognized that they can be responsible for the gushing of beer and thus they can be defined as contaminants. A commercial Belgian beer produced with contaminated malt of the crop 2006 and the same commercial Belgian beer but produced with non-contaminated malt of the crops 2007 and 2008 were used to do a comparison between gushing and non-gushing beers. Two bottles of each kind of beer were opened and naturally degassed at atmospheric pressure for 3 days. Beers were then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 minutes to separate the yeasts, and afterwards Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was used to determine the size of particles or bubbles remaining in those beers. A clear difference appears between gushing and non-gushing beers. Particles with a mean diameter of 115 nm were detected in the gushing beer but not in the non-gushing. These new results are in agreement with the following mechanism proposed for gushing and that is also based on recent results published in Brewing Science. During the carbonation step, <b>nano-bubbles</b> of CO 2 with a diameter smaller than the critical diameter are formed and stabilized by the self-assembly of hydrophobins. In a closed bottle, the stabilized <b>nano-bubbles</b> are impermeable to CO 2 because of the pressure equilibrium and thus they cannot grow. At the opening, the drop of pressure allows the bubble size to increase until it reaches the critical diameter and creates gushing: the stabilized <b>nano-bubbles</b> then act as nanobombs. The detection of particles with a mean diameter of 115 nm after degassing could indicate that the hydrophobin-contaminated CO 2 bubbles remaining in beer after gushing may coalesce until the critical size of CO 2 bubbles at 1 ATU (= 100 nm) is reached and may form stable <b>nano-bubbles</b> with an internal pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure. The use of DLS allowed to get new results that confirm our model for primary gushing. status: publishe...|$|R

One critical component of a fusion reactor is the plasma facing material. Very little literature exists on the sustainability of tungsten as a plasma facing material (PFM). During operation, PFM must withstand harsh conditions with combined effects from high temperature, mechanical stress, irradiation, transmutation, and the production of hydrogen (H) and helium (He) from nuclear reactions. Therefore, this thesis will focus on co-implantation of H and He into tungsten to investigate the mechanical and microstructural material response. For {{the first part of this}} study, Molecular Dynamics (MD) was used to qualitatively understand defect migration and mechanical property changes in tungsten. A Brinell hardness test was simulated using MD in tungsten to study the dependence on void size and void density hardness. It was found that hardness changes vary as the square root of the void size and void density. Also the movement of dislocations and its interaction with voids were investigated. For the second part of the study, H and He were co-implanted into tungsten to look at the mechanical and microstructural changes. Hardness changes were measured using a nano-indenter ex-situ on post-irradiated specimen. Results show that the hardness of tungsten after co-implantation is proportional to the square root of the fluence. Additionally, the microstructure of irradiated tungsten samples was investigated by using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). It was observed that the defect microstructure in tungsten, after co-implantation, is quite complex, with a number of intriguing features, such as the presence of the <b>nano-bubbles</b> and dislocation loops.

40|$|AbstractThe {{collapse}} of a <b>nano-bubble</b> near a solid wall is addressed here exploiting a phase field model recently {{used to describe the}} process in free space. Bubble collapse is triggered by a normal shock wave in the liquid. The dynamics is explored for different bubble wall normal distances and triggering shock intensities. Overall the dynamics is characterized by a sequence of collapses and rebounds of the pure vapor bubble accompanied by the emission of shock waves in the liquid. The shocks are reflected by the wall to impinge back on the re-expanding bubble. The presence of the wall and the impinging shock wave break the symmetry of the system, leading, for sufficiently strong intensity of the incoming shock wave, to the poration of the bubble and the formation of an annular structure and a liquid jet. Intense peaks of pressure and temperatures are found also at the wall, confirming that the strong localized loading combined with the jet impinging the wall is a potential source of substrate damage induced by the cavitation...|$|E
40|$|By {{performing}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations {{to form a}} hydrate with a methane <b>nano-bubble</b> in liquid water at 250 K and 50 MPa, we report how different ensembles, such as the NPT, NVT, and NVE ensembles, affect the nucleation kinetics of the methane hydrate. The nucleation trajectories are monitored using the face-saturated incomplete cage analysis (FSICA) and the mutually coordinated guest (MCG) order parameter (OP). The nucleation rate and the critical nucleus are obtained using the mean first-passage time (MFPT) method based on the FS cages and the MCG- 1 OPs, respectively. The fitting results of MFPT show that hydrate nucleation and growth are coupled together, consistent with the cage adsorption hypothesis which emphasizes that the cage adsorption of methane is a mechanism for both hydrate nucleation and growth. For the three different ensembles, the hydrate nucleation rate is quantitatively ordered as follows: NPT > NVT > NVE, while the sequence of hydrate crystallinity is exactly reversed. However, the largest size of the critical nucleus appears in the NVT ensemble, {{rather than in the}} NVE ensemble. These results are helpful for choosing a suitable ensemble when to study hydrate formation via computer simulations, and emphasize the importance of the order degree of the critical nucleus...|$|E
40|$|The bubble {{nucleation}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in the boiling process. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon, a critical consideration on fluid-solid interaction at atomistic level is imperative. However, traditional Molecular Dynamics simulation requires prohibited amount of computational efforts to accomplish a full scale study. Hybrid atomistic-continuum method is a promising solution for this problem. It limits the atomistic region to a small scale where detailed information is preferable, while using continuum method {{for the rest of the}} domain. Nevertheless, none of the current hybrid method is suitable for solving a rapid expanding system like the {{bubble nucleation}}. In this study, a domain re-decomposition hybrid atomistic-continuum method is developed to conduct a multiscale/multiphase investigation on the bubble nucleation. In addition to the conventional coupling scheme, this method is capable to re-partition the molecular and continuum domain once it is necessary during the simulation. That is, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) regions are interchangeable on the fly such that the bubble is absolutely confined within MD region. Giving the fact that accurate modeling of interface tracking and phase change are still problematic for continuum mechanics on microscale, our coupling method directly avoids these issues since CFD domain takes care of a single-phase flow while the molecular domain simulates the bubble growth. With this idea in mind, this approach enables us to investigate the nucleate boiling on nanostructured surface with higher resolution than complete continuum mechanic model based simulation. In the present result, it is observed that bubble grows at a curved surface imposed with a constant super heat after nucleate boiling occurs. Meanwhile, the energy flux flows from solid to fluid is measured during the entire process. It is believed that this coupling method is very promising in studying <b>nano-bubble</b> related multiphase problems on microscale...|$|E
40|$|L'implantation d'hydrogène à forte dose est utilisée dans le procédé Smart Cut(tm) afin de transférer des couches de {{silicium}} assez épaisses (> 200 nm) sur un autre substrat. En utilisant l'implantation à très basse énergie, la co-implantation d'H et d'He pour des doses totales bien plus faibles que celles requises lorsque l'hydrogène est implanté seul ouvre la voie à un transfert de couches beaucoup plus minces (200 nm) Si layers from a donor substrate onto a host material. Hydrogen and helium co-implantation at low energies for a {{much lower}} total fluence opens the way for transferring extremely thinner (i. e. < 50 nm) layers. However, the phenomena and the mechanisms responsible for the interaction, close to a wafer surface, between H, He, silicon interstitials and vacancies they generate remain poorly understood. First, we studied the effect of reducing the ion energies during both H and He implantations onto the formation {{and the development of}} blisters during annealing. Blisters were formed from the micro-cracks since a stiffener was not bonded to the implanted wafer. An approach, based on the comparison between experimentally obtained size characteristics of blisters with the finite element method simulations, allowed us to deduce the pressure inside blister cavities and the fraction of the implanted fluences used to pressurize them. We showed that even when implanted at very low energy, H and He atoms do not exo-diffuse out of the implanted region during annealing. We were able to identify, and then relate the efficiency of blister coalescence to a variation in the elastic energy of blisters as a function of their depth position. In a second part, we studied the role of the damage, produced by He and H coimplantation, on the formation and the thermal evolution of the microstructure of the implanted silicon. These investigations were realized as a function of either the order of co-implantation, or the nominal position of the He profile with respect to the H one, or the ratio between He and H fluences. We showed that the H depth distribution was never affected by He co-implantation. Helium was always trapped at the depth where the damage was maximum. When the damage was highest within the H profile, He diffused and was trapped there in the <b>nano-bubbles</b> and /or the blister cavities. However, when the damage was higher within the He profile than within the H one, He remained trapped in the <b>nano-bubbles</b> outside the H profile. Helium contained in the <b>nano-bubbles,</b> whatever their depth distribution, did not contribute to a pressurization of blister cavities that slowed down their coalescence.

This interaction may be {{induced by the}} presence of <b>nano-bubbles</b> existing on the edges of clay crystals which may cause clay particles to flocculate. The following indirect evidence for such hydrophobic behaviour is presented. First, a clay platelet is shown attached to an oil drop by its edge; second, clay flocs were attracted by a vertically placed Teflon strip but not to the hydrophilic mica basal surface; third, a much thicker porous sediment occurred in CO 2 -saturated water solution compared with vacuum degassed water. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A continuum-scale, {{evolutionary}} model of helium (He) <b>nano-bubble</b> nucleation, growth and He release for aging bulk metal tritides is presented {{which accounts for}} major features of the experimental database. Bubble nucleation, modeled as self-trapping of interstitially diffusing He atoms, is found to occur {{during the first few}} days following tritium introduction into the metal and is sensitive to the He diffusivity and pairing energy. An effective helium diffusivity of 0. 3 x 10 {sup - 16 } cm{sup 2 }/s at 300 K is required to generate the average bubble density of 5 x 1017 bubbles/cm 3 observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Early bubble growth by dislocation loop punching with a l/radius bubble pressure dependence produces good agreement with He atomic volumes and bubble pressures determined from swelling data, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, and hydride pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) shifts. The model predicts that later in life neighboring bubble interactions may first lower the loop punching pressure through cooperative stress effects, then raise the pressure by partial blocking of loops. It also accounts for the shape of the bubble spacing distribution obtained from NMR data. This distribution is found to remain fixed with age, justifying the separation of nucleation and growth phases, providing a sensitive test of the growth formulation, and indicating that further significant bubble nucleation does not occur throughout life. Helium generated within the escape depth of surfaces and surface-connected porosity produces the low-level early helium release. Accelerated or rapid release is modeled as inter-bubble fracture using an average ligament stress criterion. Good agreement is found between the predicted onset of fracture and the observed He-metal ratio (HeM) for rapid He release from bulk palladium tritide. An examination of how inter-bubble fracture varies over the bubble spacing distribution shows that the critical Hem will be lower for thin films or small particle material. It is concluded that control of He retention can be accomplished through control of bubble nucleation...|$|E
40|$|Acute hepatopancreatic {{necrosis}} disease (AHPND) {{is caused}} by unique strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP AHPND) and V. harveyi that have transferrable plasmid carrying the virulent PirAB-like toxin genes. The genomes of VP AHPND strains and V. harveyi from Thailand and Viet Nam, respectively, have been characterized by our group. The genome of VP AHPND strains from Mexico, Viet Nam, and China have also been studied by other groups. We have developed a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods {{for the detection of}} AHPND using a primer set that targets the PirAB-like toxin genes of VP AHPND. We have characterized the toxin genes of VP AHPND strains and also constructed a recombinant plasmid (broad host range) carrying PirAB-like toxin genes. Non-VP AHPND strain N 7 which does not carry the plasmid and strain FP 11 which is carrying a plasmid not coding for the toxin genes were transformed with the plasmid carrying PirAB-like toxin genes. As a result, the transformed N 7 and FP 11 strains became virulent and killed whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) similar to or at par with the virulence of VP AHPND strain. We then fed the whiteleg shrimp with commercial feed containing the formalin-killed VP AHPND strain. After 2 days of feeding, all of the whiteleg shrimp died. These results clearly indicate that the PirAB-like toxin is the virulence factor of VP AHPND. We have been investigating the virulence mechanism of the PirAB-like toxin produced by VP AHPND strains. First, we calculated the copy number of plasmid encoding the PirAB-like toxin genes of several VP AHPND strains. The copy number of the plasmid varied, ranging from 1 to 36 copies. Interestingly, VP AHPND strains carrying low copy number of plasmid were more virulent than VP AHPND strains carrying high copy number of the plasmid. These results imply that the copy number of toxin genes is not an important factor responsible for the degree of virulence of the VP AHPND strains. We are also studying other factors associated with the virulence of PirAB-like toxin. Likewise, we are developing prevention methods against AHPND including the use of formalin-killed cell vaccine, IgY additive in feed, and <b>nano-bubble</b> treatment of rearing water.

40|$|The {{production}} of energy through nuclear fusion poses serious challenges related to the stability and performance of materials in extreme conditions. In particular, the constant bombardment of {{the walls of the}} reactor with high doses of He ions is known to lead to deleterous changes in their microstructures. These changes follow from the aggregation of He into bubbles that can grow and blister, potentially leading to the contamination of the plasma, or to the degradation of their mechanical properties. We computationally study the behavior of small clusters of He atoms in W in conditions relevant to fusion energy production. Using a wide range of techniques, we investigate the thermodynamics of the clusters and their kinetics in terms of diffusivity, growth, and breakup, as well as mutation into <b>nano-bubbles.</b> Our study provides the essential ingredients to model the early stages of He exposure leading up to the nucleation of He bubbles...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a proper {{contrast}} agent, the scope of molecular ultrasound imaging is restricted within blood vessels. Recently reported biogenic nano gas vesicle (NGV), 400 nm by 100 nm rod shape <b>nano-bubbles</b> encapsulated by a bilayer protein shell, may extend molecular ultrasound imaging capability and find substantial values in therapy. In this study, we investigated the fundamental acoustic characteristics, including attenuation and non-linear property of NGV. Resonance frequency was obtained by measuring the attenuation coefficient of NGV using pulse-echo system and found to be at high frequency region greater than 80 MHz. By testing the non-linear property of NGV, it shows significant second harmonic frequency when sonicated by 40 MHz ultrasound signal. The stability is well enhanced without significant broken for more than 6 hrs. With the advantage of nanometer size, good ultrasonic contrast and enhanced stability, it is believed to perform extravascular molecular imaging with ultrasound modality.

40|$|We {{simulated}} {{decomposition of}} structure I methane hydrate (H) with all cages filled {{in contact with}} two reservoirs (pools) of liquid water (W) which in turn are in contact with either two methane gas reservoirs (G), or with vacuum (V), under constant volume-constant energy conditions. By adding gas or empty spaces to the simulation box we allow the released methane to diffuse out of the liquid phase and into the gas phase similar to what happens during methane hydrate dissociation. The evolution of the released methane molecules during the hydrate dissociation process was carefully monitored. We found {{that some of the}} released methane gas reaches the gas phase and contributes to the increase of gas pressure on the hydrate phase. As the hydrate dissociates, liquid water phase becomes supersaturated with methane, methane molecules aggregate, and spherical regions of high concentration of methane form which we identify as "nano-bubbles". These <b>nano-bubbles</b> grew to a specific size range which depends on simulation conditions and remained stable in the liquid phase {{for the duration of the}} simulations (5. ns).

40|$|AbstractTungsten {{samples are}} exposed to 3 He plasma to {{quantify}} their helium retention behavior. The retention saturates quickly with helium fluence and increases only slightly from 4. 3 × 1019 He/m 2 at 773 K, to 7. 5 × 1019 He/m 2 at 973 K. The helium content increases dramatically to 6. 8 × 1020 He/m 2 when fuzz is formed {{on the surface of}} a sample exposed at 1173 K, but the majority of the retained helium (5. 1 × 1020 He/m 2) is found to reside below the layer of fuzz tendrils. Additional tungsten samples were exposed to either simultaneous, or sequential, D/He plasma, followed by TDS. Measurements show the majority of the D retained during simultaneous exposures is located in the near surface region of helium <b>nano-bubbles.</b> No deuterium was detected in any of the samples after the heating to 1273 K, but 67 % of the helium was released from simultaneously exposed samples, and only 23 % of the helium was released from the sequentially exposed samples...|$|R
