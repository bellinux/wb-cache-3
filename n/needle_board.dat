25|$|Yup'ik women roles {{included}} child rearing, {{food preparation}} and sewing. Skin sewing is artistic {{arena in which}} Yup'ik women and a few younger men excel. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly made today, but the elegant fancy parkas of traditional times are now rare. The proper sewing of skins requires considerable and varied traditional knowledge and an intact extended family whose members help in hunting gathering, and processing the various components in addition to sewing. Women's tools include ulu, scraper, scraping <b>board,</b> <b>needle,</b> needle case, thimble, and pattern. There are many regional differences {{in the design and}} function of these tools.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{commercial}} electrical telegraph [...] was co-developed by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. In May 1837, they patented the Cooke and Wheatstone system, which used {{a number of}} <b>needles</b> on a <b>board</b> that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. The patent recommended a five-needle system, but any number of needles could be used depending {{on the number of}} characters it was required to code. A four-needle system was installed between Euston and Camden Town in London on a rail line being constructed by Robert Stephenson between London and Birmingham. It was successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837. Euston needed to signal to an engine house at Camden Town to start hauling the locomotive up the incline. As at Liverpool, the electric telegraph was in the end rejected in favour of a pneumatic system with whistles.|$|R
50|$|In the United States of America, {{physical}} therapists {{in most states}} perform the technique. Physical therapists are prohibited from penetrating the skin or specifically from practicing dry needling in California, Hawaii, New York, and Florida, though many states have no regulations on dry <b>needling.</b> The Oregon <b>Board</b> of Appeals ruled in January 2014 that the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners {{did not have the}} statutory right to determine this in their scope of practice. But the Court made no ruling that chiropractors do not have the training needed to perform dry needling. Additionally, chiropractors are legally allowed to practice dry needling in many US states, as well as in many countries. There are however no established guidelines for the frequency a patient can receive dry needling for a specific location. Therefore, {{more research is needed to}} develop a set of safety guidelines.|$|R

50|$|The ancient Greeks had {{discovered}} that a dark stone metal could attract or repel objects of iron. Was {{the origin of the}} study of magnetism. At the time of the great sailing, the navigators could not find a ship at sea by the two coordinates, latitude and longitude, the determination of this required a clock on board to indicate the exact time at the meridian of reference, and the astronomical determination of longitude gave unacceptable errors. During the trip to India, D. João de Castro has carried out a series of experiments that succeeded in detecting the phenomena, in particular related to magnetism and the magnetic <b>needle</b> on <b>board.</b> It should be assumed that such knowledge comes from Pedro Nunes, of course the direct inspiration of all the observations he has done in his travels. When on 5 August 1538, D. João de Castro decided to determine the latitude of Mozambique, found the cause that dictated the astonishing uneasiness of needles; noted the deviation of the needle, discovering it 128 years before Guillaume Dennis (1666) of Nieppe, which is recorded in history of sailing {{as if he were the}} first to know about this phenomenon. His observation near Baçaim, on 22 December 1538, of a magnetic phenomenon, for which there were variations of the needle because of the proximity of certain rocks, confirmed four centuries later, called local attraction. D. João de Castro refuted the theory that the variation of magnetic declination is not formed by geographic meridians.|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of lymph node core-needle biopsy under imaging guidance requires validation. We employed power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) {{to select the}} lymph node most suspected of malignancy and to histologically characterize it {{through the use of}} large cutting <b>needle.</b> Institutional review <b>board</b> approval and informed consent were obtained for this randomized clinical trial. In a single center between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015, patients with lymph node enlargement suspected for lymphoma were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to biopsy with either standard surgery or PDUS-guided 16 -gauge modified Menghini needle. The primary endpoint was the superiority of sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy for core-needle cutting biopsy (CNCB). Secondary endpoints were times to biopsy, complications, and costs. A total of 376 patients were randomized into the two arms and received allocated biopsy. However, four patients undergoing CNCB were excluded for inadequate samples; thus, 372 patients were analyzed. Sensitivity for the detection of malignancy was significantly better for PDUS-guided CNCB [98. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 95. 9 - 99. 9] than standard biopsy (88. 7 %; 95 % CI, 82. 9 - 93; P <  0. 001). For all secondary endpoints, the comparison was significantly disadvantageous for conventional approach. In particular, estimated cost per biopsy performed with standard surgery was 24 -fold higher compared with that performed with CNCB. The presence of satellite enlarged reactive and/or necrotic lymph nodes may impair the success of an open surgical biopsy (OSB). PDUS and CNCB with adequate gauge are diagnostic tools that enable effective, safe, fast, and low-cost routine biopsy for patients with suspected lymphoma, avoiding psychological and physical pain of an unnecessary surgical intervention...|$|R

Indeed, this was the first commercial telegraph in the world. [...] This was a five-needle, six-wire system. The cables were originally installed underground in a steel conduit. However, the cables soon began to fail as a result of deteriorating insulation and were replaced with uninsulated wires on poles. [...] As an interim measure, a two-needle system was used with three of the remaining working underground wires, which despite using only two needles had a greater number of codes. [...] But when the line was extended to Slough in 1843, a one-needle, two-wire system was installed.|$|R
40|$|Despite some {{behaviour}} change {{a substantial number}} of injectors continue to share injecting equipment and engage in risky sexual practices. This study analyses data from the years 1990 - 1997. The number of injecting drug users who attended the Eastern Health <b>Board</b> <b>needle</b> exchange programme increased from 1990 - 1997, with a recent increase in the proportion of female attenders. The number of young injectors is increasing, and a large proportion of attenders are under twenty years of age. Almost one third of users have a very short duration of injecting, less than one year. Decreases in high risk behaviour at first attendance are seen over the time period. Attenders who have been injecting less than one year have less needle sharing than those injecting longer. The high risk behaviours of needle sharing and not using condoms are significantly related to one another. Female injectors have a significantly higher proportion of needle sharing than their male counterparts. The young injectors age group show an increase in numbers of attenders over the time period. Young males have decreased in number from a peak in 1995 whereas numbers of young females have steadily increased. Half of young injectors have been injecting less than one year. Very few of the young attenders have had any treatment; needle exchange may be the first contact with services for many. Young injectors are not significantly different in their proportion of needle sharing than injectors age twenty and over. Needle sharing is significantly lower in the recent onset injectors, especially those injecting less than one year. Young injectors are significantly more likely to use a condom during sexual encounters than the overall population of injectors, but young females are significantly less likely to have their partners use a condom during sexual encounters than young males. Young injectors with one partner are much less likely to use condoms during sex. High risk behaviours at first attendance show a decreasing trend and it appears that prevention messages are being heeded, though prevalence of high risk behaviour remains unacceptably high. The needle exchange programme is effective at attracting high risk, female and young injecting drug users. In Dublin, injectors appear to be coming to needle exchange very soon after initiation of injecting. This is very important in terms of the potential for prevention and intervention...|$|R
