40|$|INTRODUCTION: Titanium {{frameworks}} {{have for}} the last decade been discussed as an option to conventional gold alloy castings in implant dentistry. So far no reports have been made to show milled titanium frameworks and their difference in precision compared to conventional castings, and how laboratory handling andfusing of veneers to the titanium frames affect the precision of fit. PURPOSE: To investigate and compare the precision of fabrication in repeatedly produced Computer <b>Numeric</b> <b>Controlled</b> milled frameworks with conventional castings, and to analyze the distortion from application of different veneering materials (porcelain and acrylic resin veneers). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty identical titanium frameworks were fabricated by means of a Computer <b>Numeric</b> <b>Controlled</b> milling technique for one and the same master model. Five conventional frameworks were cast as a control group to the same model. The frames were measured with regard to fit in a coordinate measuring machine linked to a computer. Measurements were made during different stages of handling of the titanium framework, and after veneering materials had been applied. RESULTS: The Computer <b>Numeric</b> <b>Controlled</b> frameworks showed a statistically (p 0. 05) affect the fit of the titanium frameworks. CONCLUSION: It is possible to fabricate implant supported titanium frameworks by means of the present Computer <b>Numeric</b> <b>Controlled</b> technique with very high precision and repeatability...|$|R

Some model makers also use increasingly automated processes, for example cutting parts directly with digital data from computer-aided design plans on a CNC mill or creating the parts through rapid prototyping.

5000|$|The Air Force <b>Numeric</b> <b>Control</b> and Milling Machine {{projects}} formally {{concluded in}} 1953, but development continued at the Giddings and Lewis Machine Tool Co. and other locations. In 1955 {{many of the}} MIT team left to form Concord Controls, a commercial NC company with Giddings' backing, producing the Numericord controller. Numericord {{was similar to the}} MIT design, but replaced the punch tape with a magnetic tape reader that General Electric was working on. The tape contained a number of signals of different phases, which directly encoded the angle of the various controls. The tape was played at a constant speed in the controller, which set its half of the selsyn to the encoded angles while the remote side was attached to the machine controls. Designs were still encoded on paper tape, but the tapes were transferred to a reader/writer that converted them into magnetic form. The magtapes could then be used on any of the machines on the floor, where the controllers were greatly reduced in complexity. Developed to produce highly accurate dies for an aircraft skinning press, the Numericord [...] "NC5" [...] went into operation at G&L's plant at Fond du Lac, WI in 1955.|$|E

40|$|Jerk monitoring, {{defined as}} the first {{derivative}} of acceleration, {{has become a major}} issue in computerized <b>numeric</b> <b>controlled</b> (CNC) machines. Several works highlight the necessity of measuring jerk in a reliable way for improving production processes. Nowadays, the computation of jerk is done by finite differences of the acceleration signal, computed at the Nyquist rate, which leads to low signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR) during the estimation. The novelty of this work is the development of a smart sensor for jerk monitoring from a standard accelerometer, which has improved SQNR. The proposal is based on oversampling techniques that give a better estimation of jerk than that produced by a Nyquist-rate differentiator. Simulations and experimental results are presented to show the overall methodology performance...|$|R

The development of Computer <b>Numeric</b> <b>Controlled</b> (CNC) Machines, for example, has made us able to mass-produce and reproduce products, faster, with less waste, and often more complex in design than ever before.
