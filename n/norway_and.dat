5|$|In {{the eastern}} North Atlantic, {{porbeagle}} fishing has been illegal in {{waters of the}} European Union since 2011. From 1985 and until the EU ban, the Faroe Islands and Norway (which are not members of the EU) were allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons respectively from European Community waters. Although these quotas were lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for <b>Norway</b> <b>and</b> 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch {{in the region and}} thus had no practical effect. The species is included on the red list of <b>Norway</b> <b>and</b> it has been protected in their national waters since 2012. Any porbeagle caught in EU or Norwegian waters by accident must be released.|$|E
50|$|Since the United States was {{recognized}} as an independent country in 1783, it first established diplomatic relations with Norway in 1818 when Jonathan Russell was accepted as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden <b>and</b> <b>Norway.</b> From 1814 to 1905, Sweden <b>and</b> <b>Norway</b> were in a personal union. Although each country was fully sovereign, they had a common foreign policy and diplomatic service. The United States Ambassador to Sweden thus was the US representative to Norway as well as Sweden. In 1905 Sweden <b>and</b> <b>Norway</b> peacefully separated <b>and</b> <b>Norway</b> continued to be an independent constitutional monarchy. On November 14, 1905, the US State Department instructed Ambassador Charles H. Graves to handle affairs for Sweden <b>and</b> <b>Norway</b> separately <b>and</b> the Ambassador was thus commissioned to Norway equally with Sweden, though he remained in Stockholm.|$|R

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, <b>Norway,</b> <b>and</b> Denmark was a {{powerful}} influence on Wollstonecraft's daughter, Mary Shelley. In 1817, Shelley would publish History of a Six Weeks' Tour, a narrative of her travels through Europe and to Lake Geneva which was modeled after her mother's work.|$|E
5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, <b>Norway,</b> <b>and</b> Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, <b>Norway,</b> <b>and</b> Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} tension between <b>Norway</b> <b>and</b> the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949. The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard {{could not be}} under a NATO joint command, but this was rejected by <b>Norway,</b> <b>and</b> the issue laid at rest. A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed building an private airport at Ny-Ålesund, which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian government in order to not agitate the Soviet Union. New protests were issued against {{the establishment of the}} European Space Research Organization's Kongsfjord Telemetry Station, although the protests did not stop construction. A compromise about a Norwegian civilian airport was reached in 1971 and Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened in 1975, serving both Soviet and Norwegian towns.|$|E
5|$|Ull {{maintained}} its own ski jumping hill, Ullbakken, near Frognerseteren in Vestre Aker.

Ullbakken {{was the site}} of Husebyrennet in 1890, when Kastellbakken was unusable. The dinner after this race was attended by Crown Prince Gustaf of <b>Norway</b> <b>and</b> Sweden. Karl Roll had an especially close relationship with the Swedish royal family, being a ski tutor for the princes while stationed in Stockholm between 1898 and 1904. After Norway abolished the personal union in 1905 and elected its own king, Roll immediately became an aide-de-camp for the new monarch.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{undertook}} her tour of Sweden, <b>Norway,</b> <b>and</b> Denmark {{in order}} to retrieve a stolen treasure ship for her lover, Gilbert Imlay.

However, {{over the course of}} the three months she spent in Scandinavia, she realized that Imlay had no intention of renewing the relationship. The letters, which constitute the text, drawn from her journal and from missives she sent to Imlay, reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals. Letters Written in Sweden, <b>Norway,</b> <b>and</b> Denmark is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical memoir.|$|E
