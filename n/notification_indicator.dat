Loki was built atop the Ubuntu [...] "long-term support" [...] version released {{earlier in the year}} and its updated kernel (4.4). Loki revamped the operating system's notifications and added multiple new pieces of standard software. It let users set preferences for how their notifications display. Updated <b>notification</b> menu bar <b>indicators</b> began to display information from the notification—such as the title of an email—rather than a general alert. The operating system also added a system-wide integration for online accounts for Last.fm and FastMail, with other services in development.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss how {{interactive}} ceilings may improve productivity and collaboration in office environments. The ceiling of an office offers an unobtrusive und generally unobstructed display and input area which is accessible to all persons in the room. Therefore, enhancing ceilings with input and display capabilities allows {{for a range of}} new single- and multi-user applications such as status <b>indicators,</b> <b>notifications,</b> in-house navigation and collaborative work areas. However, ergonomic constraints limit the application space. To investigate such constraints we have built a working prototype of an interactive ceiling. Currently, we are conducting a study investigating which areas on the ceiling may be used for displaying notifications and content. 1 Interactive Ceilings Interactive surfaces support collaboration between co-located and remote co-workers. They allow multiple collaborators to simultaneously view and manipulate shared data. Beside personal displays and tablet devices, interactive tabletops and wall-mounted interactive whiteboards are commonly used. However, interactive tabletops and whiteboards suffer from several limitations that discourage quick, ad-hoc collaboration. All collaborators have to walk up to the table or wall to interact with them. Content on tabletops is only visible to users standing right next to the device. Content on wall-mounted displays gets occluded by other people or objects standing in the line-of-sight. Without proper software support, exchanging data between personal computing devices and collaborative interactive surfaces is cumbersome. Tabletops and walls offer only limited display space which often allows only a subset of all relevant data to be displayed at once. In our experience, these limitations make shared interactive surfaces so tedious to use that people rarely use them for ad-hoc collaboration and sharing of data. Most office spaces have a ceiling. It differs from other surfaces in the room in several characteristics: In general, ceilings offer large, uninterrupted flat white areas. Unlike walls, they are rarely occluded or interrupted by doors, windows and furniture and are visible fro...|$|R
40|$|Improving network {{performance}} {{in terms of}} efficiency, fairness in the bandwidth, and system stability has been a research issue for decades. Current Internet traffic control maintains sophistication in end TCPs but simplicity in routers. In each router, incoming packets queue up in a buffer for transmission until the buffer is full, and then the packets are dropped. This router queue management strategy {{is referred to as}} Drop Tail. End TCPs eventually detect packet losses and slow down their sending rates to ease congestion in the network. This way, the aggregate sending rate converges to the network capacity. In the past, Drop Tail has been adopted in most routers in the Internet due to its simplicity of implementation and practicability with light traffic loads. However Drop Tail, with heavy-loaded traffic, causes not only high loss rate and low network throughput, but also long packet delay and lengthy congestion conditions. To address these problems, active queue management (AQM) has been proposed with the idea of proactively and selectively dropping packets before an output buffer is full. The essence of AQM is to drop packets {{in such a way that}} the congestion avoidance strategy of TCP works most effectively. Significant efforts in developing AQM have been made since random early detection (RED), the first prominent AQM other than Drop Tail, was introduced in 1993. Although various AQMs also tend to improve fairness in bandwidth among flows, the vulnerability of short-lived flows persists due to the conservative nature of TCP. It has been revealed that short-lived flows take up traffic with a relatively small percentage of bytes but in a large number of flows. From the user’s point of view, there is an expectation of timely delivery of short-lived flows. Our approach is to apply artificial intelligence technologies, particularly fuzzy logic (FL), to address these two issues: an effective AQM scheme, and preferential treatment for short-lived flows. Inspired by the success of FL in the robust control of nonlinear complex systems, our hypothesis is that the Internet is one of the most complex systems and FL can be applied to it. First of all, state of the art AQM schemes outperform Drop Tail, but their performance is not consistent under different network scenarios. Research reveals that this inconsistency is due to the selection of congestion indicators. Most existing AQM schemes are reliant on queue length, input rate, and extreme events occurring in the routers, such as a full queue and an empty queue. This drawback might be overcome by introducing an indicator which takes account of not only input traffic but also queue occupancy for early congestion <b>notification.</b> The congestion <b>indicator</b> chosen in this research is traffic load factor. Traffic load factor is in fact dimensionless and thus independent of link capacity, and also it is easy to use in more complex networks where different traffic classes coexist. The traffic load indicator is a descriptive measure of the complex communication network, and is well suited for use in FL control theory. Based on the traffic load indicator, AQM using FL – or FLAQM – is explored and two FLAQM algorithms are proposed. Secondly, a mice and elephants (ME) strategy is proposed for addressing the problem of the vulnerability of short-lived flows. The idea behind ME is to treat short-lived flows preferably over bulk flows. ME’s operational location is chosen at user premise gateways, where surplus processing resources are available compared to other places. By giving absolute priority to short-lived flows, both short and long-lived flows can benefit. One problem with ME is starvation of elephants or long-lived flows. This issue is addressed by dynamically adjusting the threshold distinguishing between mice and elephants with the guarantee that minimum capacity is maintained for elephants. The method used to dynamically adjust the threshold is to apply FL. FLAQM is deployed to control the elephant queue with consideration of capacity usage of mice packets. In addition, flow states in a ME router are periodically updated to maintain the data storage. The application of the traffic load factor for early congestion notification and the ME strategy have been evaluated via extensive experimental simulations with a range of traffic load conditions. The results show that the proposed two FLAQM algorithms outperform some well-known AQM schemes in all the investigated network circumstances in terms of both user-centric measures and network-centric measures. The ME strategy, with the use of FLAQM to control long-lived flow queues, improves not only the performance of short-lived flows but also the overall performance of the network without disadvantaging long-lived flows...|$|R
