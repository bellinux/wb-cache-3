Mein and Ginsburg claim {{that it is the}} {{smallest}} known prosimian molar. The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cusps—the protocone, paracone, and metacone—are present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located {{at the back of the}} tooth, is closer to the protocone, which is on the front lingual corner (the side of the tongue), than it is to the paracone on the front labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back. On the front labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of the tooth a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. The tooth has a single, well-developed root, which contains a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves,</b> suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets.|$|E

By controlling the cross-sectional profile of the grooves, {{it is possible to}} concentrate most of the diffracted energy in a particular order for a given wavelength. A triangular profile is commonly used. This technique is called blazing. The incident angle and wavelength for which the diffraction is most efficient are often called blazing angle and blazing wavelength. [...] The efficiency of a grating may also depend on the polarization of the incident light. Gratings are usually designated by their groove density, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> per unit length, usually expressed in grooves per millimeter (g/mm), also equal to the inverse of the groove period. The groove period must be on the order of the wavelength of interest; the spectral range covered by a grating is dependent on groove spacing and is the same for ruled and holographic gratings with the same grating constant. The maximum wavelength that a grating can diffract is equal to twice the grating period, in which case the incident and diffracted light will be at ninety degrees to the grating normal. To obtain frequency dispersion over a wider frequency one must use a prism. In the optical regime, in which the use of gratings is most common, this corresponds to wavelengths between 100 nm [...] and 10 µm. In that case, the groove density can vary from a few tens of grooves per millimeter, as in echelle gratings, to a few thousands of grooves per millimeter.|$|E

50|$|The {{inherent}} technical {{limitations of}} the gramophone disc defined the standard format for commercial recordings in the early 20th century.

5000|$|The Reflection Grating Arrays are {{attached}} {{to two of the}} primary telescopes. They allow approximately 50% of the incoming X-rays to pass unperturbed to the EPIC system, while redirecting the other 50% onto the Focal Plane Cameras. Each RGA was designed to contain 182 identical gratings, though a fabrication error left one with only 181. Because the telescope mirrors have already focused the X-rays to converge at the focal point, each grating has the same angle of incidence, and as with the Focal Plane Cameras, each grating array conforms to a Rowland circle. This configuration minimises focal aberrations. Each 10 xx 20 cm grating is composed of 1 mm thick silicon carbide substrate covered with a [...] gold film, and is supported by five beryllium stiffeners. The gratings contain a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves,</b> which actually perform the X-ray deflection; each grating contains an average of 646 grooves per millimetre. The RGAs were built by Columbia University.|$|E

50|$|The next United States {{attempt at}} a rifle grenade was to return to and develop an {{improved}} rod-grenade. The Babbitt grenade, developed by Colonel E. B. Babbitt of the U. S.

The stem was calibrated with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> and a split ring, which allowed the user to set the grenade to slide a certain distance into the muzzle of the rifle. With the stem was inserted only part way, the chamber pressure upon firing was reduced, propelling the grenade a shorter distance. When fired at a 45-degree angle, ranges from 50 to 300 yards were possible; with the rifle angled at 80 degrees, ranges as short at 15 yards were possible. In addition to providing the force to propel the grenade, the gases from firing were directed through a hollow in the stem, and provided force to arm the grenade. Once armed, the grenade had a heavy plunger that would detonate the grenade upon impact.|$|E

50|$|The shorter {{of the two}} granite {{fixtures}} {{is called}} the transit stone; it stands about 3 ft tall, 2 ft wide, and 2 ft deep, and is oriented so that its sides align with the cardinal compass points. The top of the stone is incised with two channels, for aligning an astronomical transit and to accommodate the device's crank. The taller fixture {{is known as the}} clock stone, and about 1 ft square at its base, tapering to 8 in at its top 8 ft off the ground. It is located about 2 ft west of the transit stone, and has a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> and holes carved into it. The exact function of this stone is not documented, but its features are consistent with the mounting of a Hardy pendulum clock of the type used by the survey crews. The clock would have been removed from its case and mounted on this stone; the transit stone would not have accommodated the clock. In addition to the two stone fixtures, there are rough square pads carved out of the bedrock about 4.5 ft north and south of the transit stone, and there are two holes drilled into the bedrock, 20 ft and 36 ft west of the transit stone; the function of these features is not known.|$|E
40|$|Aortic cannula is one {{of major}} factors leading to adverse events such as {{thrombosis}} and atherosclerosis development during open heart surgery.

In this study, a novel design in which internal profile of the cannula was made to induce spiral flow were tested by way of numerical simulation, and compared against existing commercial cannula. Three designs were tested, which differed in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>groove</b> employed.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the rifle-musket and the {{widespread}} adoption of rifled barrels by military forces, the spherical projectile eventually died out — though the new elongated bullets were still called balls in the military (indeed, full metal jacket ammunition is called ball ammunition to this day). While both conical bullets and balls were used with rifles, both in cartridge and loose form for several hundred years, the mid 19th century Minié ball contained a number of important innovations that allowed rifled weapons to be adopted by the main infantry units, rather than being the preserve of elite skirmisher and rifle units as had been the case before. Minie balls were manufactured in a smaller diameter than the bore of the weapon it was to be used in, just like a normal musket ball; this allowed for easy loading, even when the gun was fouled, while a rifle ball had to be forced down the tight-fitting barrel by force, even using a mallet. When fired, the pressure of the gases would force the bullet to expand, fitting tightly into the rifling grooves, unlike the loose-fitting and inaccurate musket ball. This was achieved by including a deep cavity in the rear, into which fitted (initially) an iron hemispherical cup, later a conical clay or timber plug, which caused the base of the projectile to expand upon firing, sealing the skirt to the bore, allowing an undersized projectile to be used for ease of loading without a patch. (Eventually {{it was found that the}} pressure of the powder gases expanded the base to fit the bore, without any plug or filler.) Another was a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> around the projectile, the leading edges of which are intended to scrape out the fouling but were found better used making the projectile more accurate when filled with a lubricant (traditionally made of beeswax and rendered animal fat.) As noted before, this lubricant also serves to keep soft the black powder fouling, thus making the fouled barrel much easier to reload.|$|E

Johnny Winter released what would be the first three-sided rock album, Second Winter, on two 12-inch discs, with the flip side of the second disc being blank. In 1975, jazz artist Rahsaan Roland Kirk released The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color which apparently had only three sides. However, on closer inspection, there were a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> pressed on side four with a few short [...] "hidden" [...] conversation snippets (the CD reissue includes them all). A 1976 live concert recording by Keith Jarrett and his quartet was released as Eyes of the Heart by ECM Records in 1979, featuring three tracks covering three sides of the original double album, with the fourth left blank. Joe Jackson's 1986 release Big World and Pavement's Wowee Zowee are other examples. The 1992 Julian Cope album Jehovahkill, contained three sides or [...] "phases," [...] with a laser-etched fourth side which was unplayable. In 1982, Todd Rundgren and his band released the self-titled album Utopia featuring one full LP of 10 songs and a second 12-inch disc with five bonus tracks and the same five tracks on the flip side. The Monty Python album Matching Tie and Handkerchief was originally issued with two concentric grooves with different programs on the second side (this was done for comedic rather than practical reasons). The Stranglers, Elvis Costello and The Clash (amongst other 1970s/80s acts) would sometimes release early pressings of their albums with extra material on a 45 RPM single. Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life was released as two LPs and a 45 RPM 7" [...] disc. The Sunlandic Twins by Of Montreal features a third side officially called a [...] "bonus EP"), essentially offering an alternate definition of an EP, a single 33 1/3 RPM side instead of a two-sided 45 RPM record. In 2005, The Mars Volta released their album Frances the Mute, on which the vinyl pressing spans five sides of vinyl; the sixth is an etching of tree roots. In 1994, the Norwegian band Motorpsycho released their album Timothy's Monster, in a vinyl edition containing three LPs: five sides with music, and a sixth side with a drawing/etching. They used the same technique for Motorpsycho presents The International Tussler Society and Heavy Metal Fruit (four sides of vinyl, three with music and one with a drawing/etching). Excepter's 2014 album Familiar covers three sides (the third, with only one track, being shorter) with an etching on the fourth. Seattle band Alice in Chains released their first two EPs, Jar of Flies, and Sap (EP) on two vinyl discs in 1994. The two releases only took up 3 sides on vinyl, and the fourth side contained a laser etching of the Alice in Chains logo.

40|$|Abstract: A {{scheme for}} an {{electrohydraulic}} vibrator excited by a two-dimensional valve is proposed, which significantly extends the frequency range {{compared to that}} of vibrators excited by conventional servo valves. In the two-dimensional valve, the rotary motion of the spool coordinates the relative motion <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> on the spools area with respect to the windows on the sleeve which in turn, alternates the oil flowrate {{into and out of the}} chambers of the hydraulic cylinder (motor) and subsequently excites the piston (rotor) to vibrate. The linear motion of the two-dimensional valve spool is used to vary the peak flowrate and thus the amplitude of the output vibration. The frequency of the vibration excited by the two-dimensional valve is related to the rotary speed of the spool and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> on the spool area (windows on the sleeve). This configuration extends the frequency of the hydraulic vibrator by increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> on the spool area (windows on the sleeve) and the rotary speed of the spool which are in the perfect lubrication of oil. A model of the two-dimensional vibrator is developed and compared to its experimental counterpart.
