40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 59) The {{subject of}} this project was the feasibility of analytically predicting the steady state hydraulic performance within a complicated flow system such as the Secondary Control Assembly of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>reactor,</b> which {{is a part of}} its shutdown system. A digital computer program was written to solve the hydrodynamic equations and to calculate the flow and pressure distributions within a Secondary Control Assembly for selected boundary conditions. The analytical results were, then, compared with the experimental results obtained from the GE test facility. In general, the calculated values were found to be in good agreement with the measured data. However, in the regions where the flow area changes were close together, the wake effects tended to dominate and the agreement became relatively poor. The success of analytical predictions was shown to be dependent upon the availability of the hydraulic correlations developed empirically for certain unique parts of the subject system. When such information is not available, it will be difficult or impossible to make a reliable analytical prediction by the methods described here...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{scientific}} evidence {{for changes in the}} climate caused by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities, the world is in ever more desperate need of new, inexhaustible, safe and clean primary energy sources. A viable solution to this problem is the widespread adoption of <b>nuclear</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>reactor</b> technology. Innovative breeder reactor concepts using liquid-metal coolants such as sodium or lead will be able to utilize the waste produced by the current light water reactor fuel cycle to power the entire world for several centuries to come. Breed & burn (B&B) type fast reactor cores can unlock the energy potential of readily available fertile material such as depleted uranium without the need for chemical reprocessing. Using B&B technology, nuclear waste generation, uranium mining needs and proliferation concerns can be greatly reduced, and after a transitional period, enrichment facilities may no longer be needed. In this dissertation, new passively operating safety systems for fast reactors cores are presented. New analysis and optimization methods for B&B core design have been developed, along with a comprehensive computer code that couples neutronics, thermal-hydraulics and structural mechanics and enables a completely automated and optimized fast reactor core design process. In addition, an experiment that expands the knowledge-base of corrosion issues of lead-based coolants in nuclear reactors was designed and built. The motivation behind the work presented in this thesis is to help facilitate the widespread adoption of safe and efficient fast reactor technology...|$|E

5000|$|The solar breeder overcomes some {{of these}} problems. A solar breeder is a {{photovoltaic}} panel manufacturing plant which can be made energy-independent by using energy derived from its own roof using its own panels. Such a plant becomes not only energy self-sufficient but a major supplier of new energy, hence the name solar breeder. Research on the concept was conducted by Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia. The reported investigation establishes certain mathematical relationships for the solar breeder which clearly indicate that {{a vast amount of}} net energy is available from such a plant for the indefinite future. The solar module processing plant at Frederick, Maryland [...] was originally planned as such a solar breeder. In 2009 the Sahara Solar Breeder Project was proposed by the Science Council of Japan as a cooperation between Japan and Algeria with the highly ambitious goal of creating hundreds of GW of capacity within 30 years. Theoretically breeders of any kind can be developed. In practice, <b>nuclear</b> <b>breeder</b> <b>reactors</b> are the only large scale breeders that have been constructed as of 2014, with the 600 MWe BN-600 and 800 MWe BN-800 reactor, the two largest in operation.|$|R

50|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{is useful}} economically because chemical separation is much simpler to accomplish than the difficult isotope separation required to prepare nuclear fuel from natural uranium ore, {{so that in}} principle chemical separation yields more generated energy for less effort than mining, purifying, and isotopically separating new uranium ore.

In a closed nuclear fuel cycle utilizing <b>breeder</b> <b>reactors,</b> <b>nuclear</b> fuel could therefore be considered renewable.

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{control and}} {{operation}} {{in almost all}} advanced devices or machines involve use of various sensors and actuators, {{many of which are}} based on piezoelectric (PE) effect. Ferroelectric (FE) materials forming a sub-group of piezoelectric materials have additional applications. Subject to success in materials and related developments, PE and FE devices perform competitively with alternative devices but at lower cost in most cases. There is increasing commercial and technical interest for PE actuators (ranging from electronic muscles, fuel injectors and inkjet printers to various vibrators), PE sensors (pressure and other sensors and motion detection to energy recovery), and ultrasonic imaging devices. PE to non-PE transition temperature (Curie temperature for FE PE materials) and piezoelectric coefficients together decide the choice of the right material for any particular application. Since most of these applications, including medical ultrasonic imaging, are done at or near room temperature, low Curie temperature (but otherwise attractive) piezoelectric materials, based on barium titanate (BT), lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, have served us well.

Steels {{and liquid}} Pb-Bi are main {{materials}} in the <b>nuclear</b> fast <b>breeder</b> <b>reactor.</b> Corrosion phenomena of Stainless Steel in liquid Lead-Bismuth have been investigated experimentally, but the interaction mechanism of this material has not been clear yet. Therefore inter-atomic interaction between atoms which involved in the system will be studied. The diffusion process among atoms are the key issues to understand the corrosion mechanism microscopically. In order to simulate these diffusion processes, the inter-atomic potential between Fe-Fe, Pb-Pb, Bi-Bi, Cr-Cr and Ni-Ni are assumed to follow Lennard-Jones potential. The Lennard-Jones potential parameters have been derived by fitting the data available in the literature with the Lennard-Jones equation.
