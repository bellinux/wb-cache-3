The aim of this study was to investigate socially induced nocebo hyperalgesia and its relationship with pain catastrophizing, somatic complaints, hypochondriacal concerns, and empathy. Participants and methods: Ninety-seven women (43. 1 ± 15. 5 years) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Participants in the nocebo condition (NC) watched a video in which a female model displayed more pain when an ointment was applied and less pain when no ointment was applied. In the control condition (CC), the model demonstrated low pain with and without the ointment. Subsequently, all participants received three pressure pain stimuli (60 seconds) on each hand. On one hand, the ointment was applied prior to the stimulation. The order of the stimulation of the fingers (middle, index, or ring finger), the side of ointment application (left or right hand), and the side with which the stimulation began were randomized within each group and balanced across the groups. Depending on the randomization, the pressure pain application started with or without ointment and on the left or right hand. Pain ratings on a numerical rating scale (0 – 10) were collected. In addition, the participants completed questionnaires regarding body-related cognitive styles and empathy. Results: There was a significant difference in the pain ratings between the CC and the NC. The effect of ointment application was also significant, but no interaction between condition and ointment application was found. Only in the CC did the <b>nocebo</b> <b>response</b> correlate with hypochondriacal concerns and somatic complaints. Conclusion: Application of an ointment as well as the observation of a model demonstrating more pain after a treatment produced elevated pain ratings. Cognitive styles were not related to the socially induced <b>nocebo</b> <b>response,</b> but were related to the <b>nocebo</b> <b>response</b> in the CC.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{unwanted}} adverse events and symptoms reported by patients in clinical trials are not caused by the drug provided, since most of adverse events also occur in corresponding placebo groups. These nocebo effects also {{play a major role}} in drug discontinuation in clinical practice, negatively affecting treatment efficacy as well as patient adherence and compliance. Experimental and clinical data document a large interindividual variability in <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses,</b> however, data on psychological, biological or genetic predictors of <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> are lacking. Thus, with an established paradigm of behaviorally conditioned immunosuppressive effects we analyzed possible genetic predictors for <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses.</b> We focused on the genetic polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (Val 158 Met) and analyzed drug specific and general side effects before and after immunosuppressive medication and subsequent placebo intake in 62 healthy male subjects.

40|$|The placebo {{analgesic}} effect {{refers to}} the improvement in a group receiving an inert treatment compared to a group receiving no treatment. Conversely, nocebo hyperalgesia {{refers to the}} worsening in a group receiving an inert treatment compared to a no treatment control group. The hypothesis that active treatments, e. g. a drug, enhance the placebo effect has received some support but rarely been tested experimentally. In the present work this hypothesis was tested by administering caffeine or placebo to healthy subjects after induction of pain. Both caffeine and placebo were administered with information that they received a painkiller which would alleviate the pain or that they received a placebo with no effect. The effect of this manipulation was tested by comparing subjective and physiological responses to identical painful stimulation before and after treatment. It was predicted that the active drug would increase the placebo analgesic effect. The total treatment effect consists of the specific treatment response, e. g. {{the response to the}} pharmacological action of a drug, and the placebo response. Previous research indicate that the total treatment effect is modulated by placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses,</b> such that placebo responses increase the treatment effect and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> decrease it. The present work consists of two experiments that investigated the relation of placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> to the treatment effect. In both experiments, pain was induced in healthy subjects before and after administering a known analgesic treatment with information that it was analgesic, hyperalgesic or with no specific information about its effect. We predicted that treatment effects would be enhanced by placebo information and reduced by nocebo information. The role of stress in placebo and nocebo responding was investigated by including subjective and physiological measures of stress. It was predicted that placebo responses was mediated by reductions in stress, while <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> were mediated by increased stress. The results showed that a placebo response was only present when caffeine was administered. This supports the hypothesis that active drugs enhance placebo responses. It was further observed that the analgesic effect of a topical analgesic cream was reversed in the nocebo group and had a hyperalgesic effect. Placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> were related to reduced and increased anticipatory stress, respectively, and anticipatory stress was a predictor of subsequent pain. The present work is relevant for both the design and interpretation of clinical trials and for clinical practice. Clinical trials assume that the only difference between drugs and placebos are the pharmacological action of the drug. However, if placebo responses are larger {{in the presence of the}} active drug the assumption might not always hold. The modulation of treatment effects by placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> is relevant for maximizing treatment effects in clinical practice.

40|$|International audienceIdiopathic Environmental Intolerance {{attributed}} to Electromagnetic Fields (IEI-EMF) {{is a condition}} in which symptoms are {{attributed to}} electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. As electro-hypersensitive (EHS) people have repeatedly been observed, during provocation trials, to report symptoms following perceived rather than actual exposure, the hypothesis has been put forward that IEI-EMF originates from psychological mechanisms, especially <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses.</b> This paper examines this hypothesis, using data from a qualitative study aimed at understanding how EHS people come to regard themselves as such. Forty self-diagnosed EHS people were interviewed. A typified model of their attribution process was then elaborated, inductively, from their narratives. This model is linear and composed of seven stages: (1) onset of symptoms; (2) failure to find a solution; (3) discovery of EHS; (4) gathering of information about EHS; (5) implicit appearance of conviction; (6) experimentation; (7) conscious acceptance of conviction. Overall, symptoms appear before subjects start questioning effects of EMF on their health, which is not consistent with the hypothesis that IEI-EMF originates from <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> to perceived EMF exposure. However, such responses might occur at the sixth stage of the process, potentially reinforcing the attribution.

40|$|Placebo and nocebo {{effects are}} known to {{contribute}} significantly to the response to symptom control, including analgesia. Clinical trial methodologies using placebo controls are designed to identify the magnitude of these effects in the research context.

40|$|Abstract. Introduction:. Nocebo-induced algesic {{responses}} occurring within clinical contexts {{present a}} challenge for health care practitioners {{working in the field}} of pain medicine. Objectives:. Following the recent research on algesic nocebo effects, the scope of this review is to develop ethically acceptable strategies to help avoid, or at least reduce, <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> within clinical settings. Methods:. We reviewed relevant clinical studies that depict how patient-practitioner interactions may contribute to the reduction of <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses.</b> Results:. A strong algesic nocebo effect may adversely impact a patient's condition by causing decreases in both the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions, as well as by promoting treatment nonadherence and discontinuation. These effects may be triggered through multiple channels and can lead to significant alterations in a patient's perception of pain, consequently producing a weakening of the specific positive effects of pharmacological, psychological, or physical pain-management interventions. Conclusion:. To minimize nocebo effects in clinical settings, we identified and discussed five contextual aspects relevant to the treatment of patients with chronic pain: (1) negative patient–clinician communication and interaction during treatment; (2) emotional burden of patients during treatment with analgesic medication; (3) negative information provided via informational leaflets; (4) cued and contextual conditioning nocebo effects; and (5) patient's lack of positive information. Through an understanding of these elements, many preventive and ethically acceptable clinical actions can be taken to improve multidisciplinary pain treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|A double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten {{challenge}} {{has been}} proposed to confirm a diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) in patients without celiac disease who respond to a gluten-free diet. To determine the accuracy of this approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten challenge trials, comprising 1312 adults. The studies varied in {{the duration of the}} challenge (ranging from 1 day to 6 weeks), daily doses for the gluten challenge (ranging from 2 g to 52 g; 3 studies administered less than 8 g/day), and composition of the placebo (gluten-free products, xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch containing fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found gluten challenge to significantly increase symptom scores compared with placebo. However, only 38 / 231 of NCGS patients (16 %) showed gluten-specific symptoms. Furthermore, 40 % of these subjects had a <b>nocebo</b> <b>response</b> (similar or increased symptoms in response to placebo).

40|$|Despite {{treatments}} proven effective by sound study {{designs and}} robust end points, placebos remain integral to elicit effective medical care. The {{authenticity of the}} placebo response has been questioned, but placebos likely affect pain, functionality, symptoms, and quality of life.

Nocebo responses can explain some adverse clinical outcomes. A doctor may be an unwitting contributor to placebo and nocebo responses. Placebo and nocebo mechanisms, not well understood, are likely multifaceted. Placebo and nocebo use is common in practice.

40|$|In modern medicine, {{the placebo}} {{response}} or placebo effect {{has often been}} regarded as a nuisance in basic research and particularly in clinical research. The latest scientific evidence has demonstrated, however, that the placebo effect and the nocebo effect, {{the negative effects of}} placebo, stem from highly active processes in the brain that are mediated by psychological mechanisms such as expectation and conditioning. These processes have been described in some detail for many diseases and treatments, and we now know that they can represent both strength and vulnerability {{in the course of a}} disease as well as in the response to a therapy.

40|$|Nocebo effects, i. e., adverse {{treatment}} effects {{which are}} induced by patients' expectations, {{are known to}} contribute to the experience of physical symptoms such as pain and itch. A better understanding of how to minimize <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> might eventually contribute to enhanced treatment effects. However, little is known about how to reduce nocebo effects. In the current randomized controlled study, we tested whether nocebo effects can be minimized by positive expectation induction with respect to electrical and histaminic itch stimuli. First, negative expectations about electrical itch stimuli were induced by verbal suggestion and conditioning (part 1 : induction of nocebo effect). Second, participants were randomized to either the experimental group or one of the control groups (part 2 : reversing nocebo effect). In the experimental group, positive expectations were induced by conditioning with verbal suggestion. In the control groups either the negative expectation induction was continued or an extinction procedure was applied. Afterwards, a histamine application test was conducted. Positive expectation induction resulted in a significantly smaller nocebo effect in comparison with both control groups. Mean change itch NRS scores showed that the nocebo effect was even reversed, indicating a placebo effect. Comparable effects were also found for histamine application. This study is the first to demonstrate that nocebo effects can be minimized and even reversed by conditioning with verbal suggestion.

40|$|AbstractExpectation and {{previous}} experience are both well established key mediators of placebo and nocebo effects. However, {{the investigation of}} their respective contribution to placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> is rather difficult because most placebo and nocebo manipulations are contaminated by pre-existing treatment expectancies resulting from a learning history of previous medical interventions. To circumvent any resemblance to classical treatments, a purely psychological placebo-nocebo manipulation was established, namely, the “visual stripe pattern–induced modulation of pain. ” To this end, experience and expectation regarding the effects of different visual cues (stripe patterns) on pain were varied across 3 different groups, with either only placebo instruction (expectation), placebo conditioning (experience), or both (expectation + experience) applied. Only the combined manipulation (expectation + experience) revealed significant behavioral and physiological placebo–nocebo effects on pain. Two subsequent experiments, which, in addition to placebo and nocebo cues, included a neutral control condition further showed that especially <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> were more easily induced by this psychological placebo and nocebo manipulation. The results emphasize the great effect of psychological processes on placebo and nocebo effects. Particularly, nocebo effects should be addressed more thoroughly and carefully considered in clinical practice to prevent the accidental induction of side effects. PerspectiveEven purely psychological interventions that lack any resemblance to classical pain treatments might alter subjective and physiological pain correlates. A manipulation of treatment expectation and actual treatment experience were mandatory to elicit this effect. Nocebo effects were especially induced, which indicated the necessity for prevention of accidental side effects besides exploitation of placebo responses...|$|R

(It has been known that placebo analgesia depends upon the release in the brain of endogenous opioids since 1978.)

40|$|Chronic rheumatic {{diseases}} {{are complex and}} occur in different and changing social and cultural contexts. Linear cause and effect models may not be appropriate for their explanation or management. The placebo response has a powerful influence on symptoms such as pain, and {{is responsible for the}} majority of the beneficial effects seen from symptomatic therapy. Nocebos have very powerful negative effects on symptoms. Health anxiety is a key mediator of the <b>nocebo</b> <b>response.</b> Prior expectations and conditioning are important mediators of both placebo and nocebo responses. Placebo and nocebo administration can cause release of neurotransmitters and other changes in brain function (detected by fMRI) that may explain their actions. Caring, compassion, empathy and validation improve symptoms and can relieve pain. The polyvagal, nurturing (safety) response provides a neuro-regulatory theory to help explain the value of caring and relationships in health care. Humans live in stories (narratives) and have to find ways of including illness within those narratives. Helping them achieve this can reduce distress. Some medical narratives, (e. g. ‘you have medically unexplained symptoms’) are incompatible with the patient’s need to reduce health anxiety and make meaning of their problems. Beneficial, profound transformational changes are sometimes observed in patients. We call this the ‘healing response’. Positive human interactions appear to be a critical way of facilitating a healing response...|$|E

Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves cardinal PD motor symptoms including tremor whereas impairment of verbal fluency (VF) has been observed as a potential side-effect. Here we investigated how expectation modulates the effect of STN-DBS on resting tremor and its interaction with VF. In a within-subject-design, expectation of 24 tremor-dominant PD patients regarding the impact of STN-DBS on motor symptoms was manipulated by verbal suggestions (positive [placebo], negative [nocebo], neutral [control]). Patients participated with (MedON) and without (MedOFF) antiparkinsonian medication. Resting tremor was recorded by accelerometry and bradykinesia of finger tapping and diadochokinesia were assessed by a 3 D ultrasound motion detection system. VF was quantified by lexical and semantic tests. In a subgroup of patients, the effect of STN-DBS on tremor was modulated by expectation, i. e. tremor decreased (placebo response) or increased (<b>nocebo</b> <b>response)</b> by at least 10 % as compared to the control condition while no significant effect was observed for the overall group.

40|$|Despite {{worldwide}} increased prescription of a gluten-free diet (GFD) for gastrointestinal (GI) {{and other}} symptoms in individuals {{who do not}} have coeliac disease, there is minimal evidence that suggests gluten is a trigger. It is not known whether it is the removal of protein (gluten) or the carbohydrate (fructan) component in wheat responsible, given fructans are capable of provoking GI symptoms themselves. A series of studies were undertaken to provide an evidence-base for this so-called non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and make sense of the increasing avoidance of gluten- and wheat-containing products. The objectives of this thesis were: to evaluate the content of poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (termed FODMAPs) in a variety of grains and processed cereal products; to characterise patients who believed they have NCGS; and, to evaluate the effects of gluten in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in who coeliac disease was excluded (histology or gene typing) and who were symptomatically controlled on a GFD in three randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials on GI symptoms, fatigue and markers of potential mechanism. Carbohydrate analysis of 55 commonly consumed grain and cereal products found fructans to be the most common FODMAP present, further developing the FODMAP composition tables and expanding our understanding of natural food sources of prebiotics (galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides). Many high FODMAP-containing products were gluten-containing, and conversely many low FODMAP products were gluten-free, which may help explain the symptom improvement that individuals with IBS experience whilst following a GFD. A survey of 132 people who believe they had NCGS found the practice of initiation of a GFD without adequate exclusion of coeliac disease is common and nearly 25 % believed that they were gluten-sensitive despite having uncontrolled symptoms. The results from the initial double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial provided for the first time, high-quality evidence that gluten itself may trigger GI symptoms and fatigue in individuals {{who do not have}} coeliac disease (termed NCGS). A second trial used a cross-over design, controlling for other dietary triggers of symptoms, FODMAPs, and investigated more sensitive markers of possible immune mechanisms. Very limited evidence of gluten specificity was observed, but FODMAP restriction uniformly reduced residual symptoms. A strong <b>nocebo</b> <b>response</b> and an order effect were found. No clues to the mechanism were elucidated in either trial. The third trial invited previous participants to complete a rechallenge and did not show any protein specific changes in GI symptoms. Gluten did, however influence current feelings of depression, but had no influence on depression as a personality trait. A very high <b>nocebo</b> <b>response</b> was again found regardless of all background dietary triggers being controlled and reproducibility of symptom induction to gluten was poor. Either the patients did not have NCGS as self-reported or the trial design precluded its recognition because of a high nocebo effect. Clarification of the phenotype of NCGS patients, the mechanism(s) by which gluten induces symptoms and clinical significance is required. Standardised guidelines into the design and conduct of IBS dietary studies are needed. Patients who believe they have NCGS are likely to benefit from lowering their dietary intake of FODMAPs...|$|E

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{theories of}} human placebo effects {{rely on a}} notion that consciously perceptible cues, such as verbal information or distinct stimuli in classical conditioning, provide signals that activate placebo effects. However, growing evidence suggest that behavior can be triggered by stimuli presented outside of conscious awareness. Here, we performed two experiments in which the responses to thermal pain stimuli were assessed. The first experiment assessed whether a conditioning paradigm, using clearly visible cues for high and low pain, could induce placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses.</b> The second experiment, in a separate group of subjects, assessed whether conditioned placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> could be triggered in response to nonconscious (masked) exposures to the same cues. A total of 40 healthy volunteers (24 female, mean age 23 y) were investigated in a laboratory setting. Participants rated each pain stimulus on a numeric response scale, ranging from 0 = no pain to 100 = worst imaginable pain. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were found in both experiment 1 (using clearly visible stimuli) and experiment 2 (using nonconscious stimuli), indicating that the mechanisms responsible for placebo and nocebo effects can operate without conscious awareness of the triggering cues. This is a unique experimental verification {{of the influence of}} nonconscious conditioned stimuli on placebo/nocebo effects and the results challenge the exclusive role of awareness and conscious cognitions in placebo responses.

40|$|AbstractThe {{worldwide}} {{expansion of}} wind energy {{has met with}} opposition based on concerns that the infrasound generated by wind turbines causes health problems in nearby residents. In this paper we argue that health complaints {{are more likely to}} be explained by the <b>nocebo</b> <b>response,</b> whereby adverse effects are generated by negative expectations. When individuals expect a feature of their environment or medical treatment to produce illness or symptoms then this may start a process where the individual looks for symptoms or signs of illness to confirm these negative expectations. As physical symptoms are common in healthy people, there is considerable scope for people to match symptoms with their negative expectations. To support this hypothesis we draw on evidence from experimental studies that show that, during exposure to wind farm sound, expectations about infrasound can influence symptoms and mood in both positive and negative directions, depending on how expectations are framed. We also consider epidemiological work showing that health complaints have primarily been located in areas that have received the most negative publicity about the harmful effects of turbines. The social aspect of symptom complaints in a community is also discussed as an important process in increasing symptom reports. Media stories, publicity or social discourse about the reported health effects of wind turbines are likely to trigger reports of similar symptoms, regardless of exposure. Finally, we present evidence to show that the same pattern of health complaints following negative information about wind turbines has also been found in other types of environmental concerns and scares...|$|E
40|$|The {{nocebo effect}} is a {{negative}} outcome resulting from the belief that a desired treatment has either not been received, or that a received treatment is harmful (Hurst, Foad & Beedie, 2015). This effect has been empirically demonstrated to have negative effects on sporting performance and physical endurance. Expectation has been the foremost mechanism in producing the <b>nocebo</b> <b>response</b> and manipulation through verbal suggestions {{is arguably the most}} powerful way to generate expectation (Carlino, Benedetti & Pollo, 2014). The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate whether mindfulness practice can counteract the negative expectations given by potentially harmful nocebo effects, in this case verbal suggestions and a sham electrical stimulation. The majority of the published research on mindfulness has focused on the performance benefits (Gardner & Moore, 2012) and further evaluation is required to establish whether mindfulness can also prevent negative expectations on performance. Research combining the investigation of the nocebo effect and mindfulness is non-existent, both of which are already established topics in the field of sport and exercise psychology. The study hypothesises that mindfulness practice, at a low level of mastery, will combat, or even prevent, nocebo effects. The study contained 70 students from the University of Jyväskylä. The participants were randomly assigned into four groups: a) baseline; b) nocebo group; c) mindfulness intervention control; and d) mindfulness intervention and nocebo effect. Using a leg extension machine (Viveca Biomechanics Laboratory, Jyväskylä), performance was assessed through a combination of a 1 -repetition maximum (1 -RM) determination and subsequent exhaustion test (Pollo et al, 2012; Carlino et al., 2014). A two-ways mixed ANOVA was used to statistically analyse the data (Hurst, Foad & Beedie, 2015). Results indicated that it was not possible for mindfulness practice to counteract the nocebo effect. There was however further evidence for the efficacy of the nocebo conditioning protocol with nocebo conditions performing significantly worse in comparison the control conditions. The study suggests that combating the nocebo effect may play an important role, for example, in talent development for young athletes that have received negative verbal suggestions or have been rejected from sports academies. The study encourages future researchers to consider the use of single case study designs in the assessment and evaluation of mindfulness’s ability to combat the nocebo effect...|$|E

Similar to first-person experience, observational experience affects the effectiveness of subsequent treatments. Yet, it is still undetermined whether the influence of social observation on placebo and nocebo effects to subsequent treatments remains even if related experience occurred a few days ago. Methods: Eighty-two participants were recruited and each of them was randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups acquiring first-person or observational experience, which was either effective or ineffective. For the first-person groups, participants were presented with pain cues paired with pain stimuli in person. In the effective condition, low pain cues were paired with low pain stimuli, and high pain cues were paired with high pain stimuli. In contrast, the associations between cues and pain stimuli were not established in the ineffective condition. Similarly, for the observational groups, participants received effective/ineffective treatment through observation. Five or six days later, all participants underwent a conditioning phase followed by a test phase composed of two tests, where participants were asked to report their perceived pain. Results: Placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> to subsequent treatments can be affected by prior experience gained several days ago regardless of acquisition ways, and both placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> in the effective condition were significantly larger than those in the ineffective condition. Furthermore, once placebo and nocebo effects were elicited, the latter was more persistent, while the former was more likely to diminish. Conclusion: First-person and observational experience obtained a few days ago could affect the following treatments, which advance our understanding of the crucial and sustained influence of social observation on placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia, and provide insights into clinical applications.

40|$|Religion {{may affect}} {{personal}} health {{in at least}} two ways. First, religious prescriptions concerning matters such as diet, waste, sexual relationships and social support networks may have actual health consequences. Second, religious healing practices may induce placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses.</b> Through such mechanisms, religion can result in both positive and negative health effects, depending on prescriptions and rituals involved. Contingent on magnitude, health effects may constitute an underestimated component in understanding the prevalence and persistence of religions in human societies. Health aspects of religion may have become important in human societies through natural selection of susceptibility to placebo responses from religious healing rituals, or through cultural selection of components of religions that involve functioning health advice or that have piggy-backed on practices invoking placebo responses. What exact significance health effects have for understanding the persistence and ubiquity of religions remains to be thoroughly investigated, however...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Placebos are {{commonly}} used in experimental and patient populations and are known to influence treatment outcomes. The mechanism of action of placebos has been investigated by several researchers. This review investigates the current knowledge regarding the theoretical and biological underpinning of the nocebo and placebo phenomena. METHOD: Literature was searched using PubMed using the following keywords: nocebo, placebo, μ-opioid, dopamine, conditioning, and expectancy. Relevant papers were selected for review by the authors. FINDINGS: The roles of conditioning and expectancy, and characteristics associated with <b>nocebo</b> and placebo <b>responses,</b> are discussed. These factors affect <b>nocebo</b> and placebo <b>responses,</b> although their effect sizes vary greatly, depending on inter-individual differences and different experimental paradigms. The neurobiology of the nocebo and placebo phenomena is also reviewed, emphasizing the involvement of reward pathways, such as the μ-opioid and dopamine pathways. Neurobiological pathways have been investigated in a limited range of experimental paradigms, with the greatest efforts on experimental models of placebo analgesia. The interconnectedness of psychological and physiological drivers of <b>nocebo</b> and placebo <b>responses</b> is a core feature of these phenomena. IMPLICATIONS: Further {{research is needed to}} fully understand the underpinnings of the nocebo and placebo phenomena. Neurobiology pathways need to be investigated in experimental paradigms that model the placebo response to a broader range of pathologies. Similarly, although many psychological factors and inter-individual characteristics have been identified as significant mediators and moderators of <b>nocebo</b> and placebo <b>responses,</b> the factors identified to date are unlikely to be exhaustive...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{has reported that}} individual differences influence both placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses.</b> The present study examined how individual personality, as well as trust, influence placebo/nocebo belief and symptom reporting after receiving an inert capsule that for some was described as an active “cognitively-enhancing” trial medication. Individuals (N = 104) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three conditions: condition A participants were told they’d received the medication, condition B participants were told they’d received a placebo, and condition C participants were told, via random assignment, each would receive either the medication or placebo (after the experiment this condition listed the group – medication or placebo - each believed s/he was in). The study was completed in the UNT Student Health and Wellness Center to provide context in a medical setting. Of the 104 participants, 46 (44. 2 %) were either placed by experimental design or self-report in the medication group. Participants with a belief in medication ingestion, regardless of condition (i. e., A or C), reported significantly more symptoms (M = 16. 65, SD = 3. 178), than participants who believed they had ingested a placebo (M = 14. 21, SD = 2. 58), t (102) = 4. 32, p =. 001. Aspects of Neuroticism and Extroversion, as well as trust were correlated with symptom reporting and/or placebo/nocebo responses. It appears that that personality is part of a combination including trust, context and expectations. It is recommended that future research on personality and placebo effects consider the role of individual factors, context and communication of expectations...|$|R
40|$|Nocebo effect, {{originally}} denoting {{the negative}} counterpart of the placebo phenomenon, is now better {{defined as the}} occurrence of adverse effects to a therapeutic intervention because the patient expects them to develop. More commonly encountered in patients with a past negative experience, this effect stems from highly active processes in the central nervous system, mediated by specific neurotransmitters and modulated by psychological mechanisms such as expectation and conditioning. The magnitude of nocebo effect in clinical medicine is being increasingly appreciated and its relevance encompasses clinical trials as well as clinical practice. Although there is hardly any reference to the term nocebo in dermatology articles, the phenomenon is encountered routinely by dermatologists. Dermatology patients {{are more susceptible to}} <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> owing to the psychological concern from visibility of skin lesions and the chronicity, unpredictable course, lack of ′permanent cure′ and frequent relapses of skin disorders. While finasteride remains the prototypical drug that displays a prominent nocebo effect in dermatologic therapeutics, other drugs such as isotretinoin are also likely inducers. This peculiar phenomenon has recently been appreciated in the modulation of itch perception and in controlled drug provocation tests in patients with a history of adverse drug reactions. Considering the conflict between patients′ right to information about treatment related adverse effects and the likelihood of nocebo effect stemming from information disclosure, the prospect of ethically minimizing nocebo effect remains daunting. In this article, we review the concept of nocebo effect, its postulated mechanism, relevance in clinical dermatology and techniques to prevent it from becoming a barrier to effective patient management...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate if personality traits and fear of pain could predict experimental nocebo hyperalgesia. One hundred and eleven healthy volunteers (76 females) participated in an experimental study in which personality traits and fear of pain were measured prior to induction of thermal heat pain. Personality traits were measured by the Big-Five Inventory- 10. Fear of pain was measured by the Fear of Pain Questionnaire III. Heat pain was induced by a PC-controlled thermode. Pain was measured by a computerized visual analog scale. Stress levels during the experiment were measured by numerical rating scales. The participants were randomized to a Nocebo group or to a no-treatment Natural History group. The results revealed that pain and stress levels were significantly higher in the Nocebo group after nocebo treatment. Mediation analysis showed that higher levels of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire III factor “fear of medical pain” significantly increased stress levels after nocebo treatment and that higher stress levels were associated with increased <b>nocebo</b> hyperalgesic <b>responses.</b> There were no significant associations between any of the personality factors and the nocebo hyperalgesic effect.

40|$|Objective: The {{experiment}} tested {{whether the}} placebo and <b>nocebo</b> <b>responses</b> could be mediated via modulation of stress. Methods: Ischemic pain was induced in healthy volunteers (N 59). When pain reached “ 7 ” on a 10 -point scale, {{two groups of}} subjects received information that a pain relieving (the Placebo group) or a pain increasing (the Nocebo group) substance was injected. All injections contained physiological saline. A third group received no information and no injection (the Natural History group). Pain ratings and blood samples for analysis of cortisol and beta-endorphin were obtained every 5 minutes after pain equal to seven until the experiment was terminated. Results: Pain increased in all groups, but there were significantly lower pain ratings in the Placebo group at 15 minutes after the injection, compared {{with the other two}} groups. Cortisol increased in all groups, but mostly so in the Nocebo group. Circulating beta-endorphin increased in all groups. Pain-ratings were not correlated with beta-endorphins or cortisol. Conclusions: A placebo response, ie, a reduced pain level, was seen in the Placebo group at 15 minutes after the injection. The placebo response was not related to stress or to beta-endorphin. Expectation of a pain increase in the Nocebo group led to an increase in cortisol, but the expectation of pain increase and the resultant cortisol increase had no effect on pain.
