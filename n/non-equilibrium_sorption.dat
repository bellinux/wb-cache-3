40|$|Simulation of the {{increase}} of sorption in time {{is one of the}} options in higher tiers of pesticide regulatory leaching assessments to obtain more realistic leaching estimates. Therefore, accurate estimates of <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> parameters are required as input for the pesticide leaching scenarios. Usually, <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> is described with a two-site equilibrium/non-equilibrium model in which the <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> is described with two parameters (i. e. the desorption rate coefficient of the non-equilibrium site and the Freundlich sorption coefficient of this site). Estimates of these parameters can be obtained with inverse modelling techniques. At the moment, there is little understanding about whether the confidence intervals provided by inverse modelling can be used as measure of the likely accuracy (i. e. how close the estimated value is to the true value) of these estimates. We set up a semi-global inverse modelling exercise for a large number of parameter sets (Le. different pesticides) using simulated datasets. Inverse modelling of non-equilibrium parameters demonstrated decreasing accuracy of the estimates for decreasing values of the <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> parameters and the equilibrium sorption coefficient. Furthermore, we found a relationship between the accuracy of a parameter estimate and its CV (coefficient of variation) provided by the inverse modelling technique. Using this relationship we calculated the likelihood of rightly or wrongly accepting or rejecting a parameter estimate as a function of this CV. We recommend to use this likelihood as the basis of communication with decision makers on how to decide on accepting or rejecting parameter estimates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Gas-polymer systems, where gas is {{dissolved}} in the polymer matrix, have been intensively investigated {{in the last}} decades, since {{they are involved in}} a number of industrial processes and everyday applications, as the membrane separation, the foaming process, etc. The experimental study of the gas uptake by the polymer, the polymer swelling and the sorption induced glass transition is very important for understanding these processes and for their rational design. In addition, the application of appropriate theoretical mathematical models leads to the estimation of such parameters without the need of expensive and time-consuming experimental procedures. Within the frame of this thesis, binary and ternary systems of gases and glassy polymers were experimentally investigated in a broad range of temperatures and pressures. Both total and partial sorption, when two gases were involved, was studied, as well as the incipient swelling. Six different experimental setups were used and results were derived both from their independent use and from appropriate combinations. New experimental methods are proposed, compared to each other and evaluated. As far as the theoretical part is concerned, the equation-of-state models QCHB and NRHB were applied. The NRHB model was for the first time extended to ternary systems with or without strong intermolecular interactions, for thermodynamic equilibrium and <b>non-equilibrium</b> conditions. <b>Sorption,</b> swelling and glass transition were calculated. The predictive ability of the model was thus tested, both for the behavior of the binary systems at different pressures and temperatures {{as well as for the}} behavior of ternary systems, where the appropriate adjustable parameters were based only on binary systems data. The results provided with important sorption and swelling data for the investigated systems, significant indication of the efficiency of the suggested experimental methods and a very satisfactory agreement between the experiment and the model predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{suspensions}} of engineered nanoparticles {{have been}} studied in recent years for waste water and in-situ groundwater remediation. However, the use of zerovalent iron micro- and nanoparticles for groundwater remediation is hindered by colloidal instability, causing aggregation and sedimentation of the particles. The use of viscous shear-thinning fluids based on biopolymers dispersions was shown to significantly increase mobility of iron particles in porous media. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} numerical model, namely E-MNM 1 D, able to describe the transport of highly concentrated suspensions of iron particles, in particular during their injection in the subsurface, and {{in the early stages of}} migration through the porous matrix. The model is intended to be used as a tool in the development of an efficient injection technology for field-scale applications of nano- and microscale iron suspensions. The model is based on a numerical solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations simulating the transport of the iron particle in the liquid phase and the interaction with the porous medium. The deposition/release and straining phenomena have been simulated by means of dual site <b>non-equilibrium,</b> reversible <b>sorption</b> sites (Tosco and Sethi 2010). Clogging of the porous medium due to the progressive retention of iron particles is described by a decrease in porosity and permeability. Finally, the shear-thinning properties of the suspensions are included introducing an apparent viscosity, which is function of polymer and suspended iron particle concentrations. Therefore, the transport equations for the concentrations of deposited and suspended colloids, the pressure losses and the constitutive equations for porosity, permeability and viscosity are coupled. The set of equations and boundary conditions are solved for monodimensional geometries using a finite-differences approach. An iterative scheme is used to solve the coupling of the equations.

The problem is modeled with nonlinear system of partial differential equations coupled through sorption and biodegradation terms. The operator splitting technique was employed to approximate the problem solution in two steps: initially the advectiondispersion transport problem for the contaminant and oxygen were solved. Then, employing this first step approximation as initial condition we solved the ordinary differential equations for reactions. The finite element method and Crank-Nicolson scheme were respectively used in the spatial and time discretization of the first step. The differential equations for the reactions were approximated by fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Applications for 1 D problems were compared with other solutions obtained in the literature and some 2 D results were also considered. Numerical results obtained in this work are in good agreement with solutions presented by other authors.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to water saturated systems, unsaturated porous media are less frequently but increasingly assessed (see for instance, [115]). Relative to water saturated porous media, unsaturated systems have often a higher retention potential [e.g. 116], while Fang et al. [117] found only marginal differences regarding {{the retention of}} TiO 2 NP between saturated and unsaturated porous media. This pattern {{may be explained by}} the <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> to solid–water interface and equilibrium sorption to air-water interface [118]. Moreover, the water film straining during drying could increase NP retention [116] and is thus of potentially high relevance in unsaturated porous media. The impact of ionic strength, type of cations, NOM but also pH on NP fate is comparable among aquatic systems and porous media irrespective of whether the latter is saturated or unsaturated. Therefore, we refer to the subchapters above for a more detailed description.|$|E

To determine mobility and transport of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (ICD), batch sorption and column leaching experiments were performed using soils collected from cropland (crop), grass vegetative buffer strips (VBS), and riparian VBS. Single-point, solid-to-solution partition coefficients (Kd) were determined by reacting soil collected from the vegetation treatments at six sites with radiolabeled (14 C) ICD. For the column experiments, soils from the three vegetation treatments collected at one site were packed into individual glass columns and water flow was characterized by applying Br - as a nonreactive tracer. A single pulse of 14 C-ICD was applied, and ICD leaching was monitored for up to 45 days. Bromide and ICD breakthrough curves for each column were simulated using CXTFIT, a convection/dispersion-based transport equilibrium model, and HYDRUS- 1 D, a multisite <b>sorption</b> chemical <b>non-equilibrium</b> transport model. <b>Sorption</b> results indicated that ICD sorbs more strongly to soil from riparian VBS (Kd= 22. 6 L kg- 1) than crop (Kd= 11. 3 L kg- 1; p = 0. 04) and soil organic carbon (OC) was the strongest predictor of ICD sorption (p less than 0. 0001). The column transport study found peak concentrations of ICD at 5. 83, 10. 84 and 23. 8 pore volumes for crop, grass VBS, and riparian VBS, respectively. HYDRUS- 1 D results indicated that the two-site, one-rate linear reversible model best-described results of the breakthrough curves, indicating the complexity of ICD sorption and demonstrating its mobility in soil.

40|$|We {{consider}} colloid facilitated radionuclide transport by steady {{groundwater flow}} in a heterogeneous porous formation. Radionuclide binding on colloids and soil-matrix {{is assumed to}} be kinetically/equilibrium controlled. All reactive parameters are regarded as uniform, whereas the hydraulic log-conductivity is modelled as a stationary random space function (RSF). Colloid-enhanced radionuclide transport is studied by means of spatial moments pertaining to both the dissolved and colloid-bounded concentration. The general expressions of spatial moments for a colloid-bounded plume are presented for the first time, and are discussed in order to show the combined impact of sorption processes as well as aquifer heterogeneity upon the plume migration. For the general case, spatial moments are defined by the aid of two characteristic reaction functions which cannot be expressed analytically. By adopting the approximation for the longitudinal fluid trajectory covariance valid for a flow parallel to the formation bedding suggested by Dagan and Cvetkovic [Dagan G, Cvetkovic V. Spatial Moments of Kinetically Sorbing Plume in a Heterogeneous Aquifers. Water Resour Res 1993; 29 : 4053], we obtain closed form solutions. For illustrative purposes, we consider the case when sorption/desorption between solution and moving colloids is a linear <b>non-equilibrium</b> process, whereas <b>sorption</b> onto the soil-matrix is a linear equilibrium process. Based on the flow and transport parameters pertaining to the alluvial aquifer at the Yucca Mountain Site (Nevada), we investigate the potential enhancing role of colloidal particles by comparing radionuclide spatial moments with and without colloids, and mainly investigate the sensitivity to the reverse rate parameter. The most potentially significant effects are obtained when radionuclide attachment to colloidal particles is irreversible.

For sorption measurements, {{a range of}} concentrations of pesticide solutions in 0. 1 M calcium chloride were shaken with soil samples at a soil:solution ratio of 1 : 10 for 4 h at 25 °C. The movement of pesticides was examined using re-packed soil columns following a step input of 2, 4 -D and tritiated water (3 H 2 O) and a pulse input of 2, 4 -D, atrazine, phorate and terbufos. A convection-dispersion equation (CDE), either with an equilibrium or a bicontinuum <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> process, was used to simulate the measured effluent breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained by simultaneous displacement of a non-sorbed solute (3 H 2 O) and a sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). The Patua soil sorbed more pesticide than did the Tokomaru soil. This is attributed to the larger amounts of organic matter {{and the presence of}} short-range order clays (allophane) in the former soil compared to the latter. Kinetic sorption data for pesticides showed an initial rapid rate followed by a slower rate of sorption. In column experiments, the pesticide in the leachate appeared later in the Patua than in the Tokomaru soil. Movement of pesticides in soils decreased with an increase in Kd values. The step-function experiments showed a symmetrical BTC for the non-sorbed solute (3 H 2 O) with a sigmoidal shape, whereas there was an asymmetrical BTC with extensive tailing for the sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). The CDE with an equilibrium sorption process adequately described the 3 H 2 O BTC, but failed to simulate the BTC for 2, 4 -D. The CDE with a bicontinuum <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> process provided a good description of the BTC for 2, 4 -D.

40|$|<b>Non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> of {{contaminants}} in ground water systems is examined {{from the perspective}} of sorption rate estimation. A previously developed Markov transition probability model for solute transport is used in conjunction with a new conditional probability-based model of the sorption and desorption rates based on breakthrough curve data. Two models for prediction of spatially varying sorption and desorption rates along a one-dimensional streamline are developed. These models are a Markov model that utilizes conditional probabilities to determine the rates and an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) applied to the conditional probability method. Both approaches rely on a previously developed Markov-model of mass transfer, and both models assimilate the observed concentration data into the rate estimation at each observation time. Initial values of the rates are perturbed from the true values to form ensembles of rates and the ability of both estimation approaches to recover the true rates is examined over three different sets of perturbations. The models accurately estimate the rates when the mean of the perturbations are zero, the unbiased case. For the cases containing some bias, addition of the ensemble Kalman filter is shown to improve accuracy of the rate estimation by as much as an order of magnitude...|$|E

Since that time a number of questions had arisen concerning these scenarios. Also this earlier work group did not provide overall guidance for higher tiers of the entire assessment scheme (field and monitoring studies, lysimeter studies and higher tier modelling approaches).

40|$|Groundwater {{transport}} of contaminants undergoing rate-limited or <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> onto the solid matrix {{is often described}} by the dual-porosity or two-domain model, whereby the rate-limited reaction occurs between a mobile and an immobile region. When the sorption reaction is represented by a first-order kinetic relationship, the equation {{takes the form of}} a convection–dispersion partial differential equation with an integral term describing the mass transfer between the two regions. An efficient solution algorithm for this type of problems consists in the transformation of the original equation into the Laplace space and subsequent numerical solution of the resulting steady-state equation in the complex space. The exploitation of the Laplace transform to solve the time dependency restricts the application of the technique to linear advection and dispersion terms, while non-linear reactions can be accommodated in particular cases only. This approach has the advantage that it is easily parallelizable, and is therefore proposed in this paper as an efficient algorithm for the parallelization in time of these types of integrodifferential equations.

40|$|Irregular pagination. Missing p. 89 in Vault copy too. There is {{a growing}} concern about the {{persistence}} of pesticide residues in soils and their subsequent movement to groundwater and surface water. Sorption of pesticide by soil particles {{is one of the key}} processes affecting the fate of pesticides in soil. The overall objective of this research was to examine the sorption and movement of ionic (2, 4 -D, atrazine and metsulfuron methyl) and non-ionic (phorate and terbufos) pesticides in a range of allophanic and non-allophanic soil materials of New Zealand. Firstly, the methods of measuring pesticide in the soil solution were evaluated. The results suggested that radiotracer techniques can be used to measure low concentrations of pesticide in the soil solution during sorption studies. Based on this, the sorption and movement of pesticides was examined using 14 C-labelled compounds. Complete recovery of 14 C pesticide residues in soils was achieved by direct extraction of soils with a scintillation cocktail, which contained an organic solvent. The effect of drying soils on the sorption and leaching of an inorganic anion (phosphate; P) and organic pesticides (2, 4 -D and phorate) was examined using field-moist, freeze-dried, air-dried and oven-dried soil samples. Compared to field-moist and freeze-dried, both air-drying and oven-drying of soil increased the sorption of P, but decreased the sorption of pesticides. Solubilization of organic carbon during air-drying and oven-drying may have increased the accessibility of P to sorption sites on the mineral surfaces and thereby increased the sorption. In contrast, the addition of water soluble organic carbon bound onto pesticides in solution and decreased the apparent sorption onto the soil; thereby increasing leaching. Pesticide sorption was measured in a range of allophanic and non-allophanic topsoil and subsoil samples using a batch equilibrium technique. In general, pesticide sorption, as measured by the distribution coefficient (Kd), increased with an increase in octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) of the pesticide and followed the order: terbufos > phorate > 2, 4 -D > atrazine > metsulfuron methyl. The Kd values increased with increasing organic carbon content of the soils and when the sorption was normalised to organic carbon (Koc) there was less variation in Koc values between the soils. Removal of organic carbon decreased the sorption of pesticides and the effect was more pronounced with non-ionic than with the ionic pesticides. The results suggest that organic carbon is the principal sorbent for non-ionic pesticides, whereas clay is also contributing to the sorption of ionic pesticides. Multiple regression models were developed to predict pesticide sorption based on soil properties. The existing empirical equations based on Kow values gave unsatisfactory predictions of pesticide sorption in the soils examined. The contribution of different particle size fractions of soils to sorption and desorption of pesticides was examined using two soils with contrasting characteristics. The Kd values decreased in the order: clay > silt > sand. Organic carbon accounted for most of the variation in Kd values between the particle size fractions, and the removal of organic carbon decreased the Kd values of the pesticides. Following four successive extractions with 0. 01 M CaCl 2, 65 - 90 % and 22 - 75 % of the initially sorbed ionic and non-ionic pesticides, respectively were released from the particle size fractions. Greater amounts of pesticides were released from the soil fractions from which organic carbon had been removed than from natural soil fractions and the difference was greater for the non-ionic than the ionic pesticides. Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of different sources of added carbon (peat, sludge, mushroom compost, pig manure and poultry manure), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the sorption and movement of pesticides in soils. Added carbon sources increased the sorption of pesticides and followed the order: peat > sludge > pig manure > mushroom compost > poultry manure. The differences in the effect of carbon addition on the sorption of pesticides may be related to the differences in their effect on DOC and pH of the soil. Premixing DOC with the pesticide solutions decreased the pesticide sorption whereas premixing DOC with soil increased the pesticide sorption. Column studies showed that pesticide mobility was enhanced by the presence of DOC. Column leaching experiments were conducted to examine the movement of pesticides through repacked soil cores (step-function and pulse inputs) and intact cores (step-function input) using two soils with different pesticide sorption capacities. In repacked soil columns, the step-function experiments showed a symmetrical breakthrough curve (BTC) for a non-sorbed solute (3 H 20) with a sigmoidal shape, whereas there was an asymmetrical BTC with extensive tailing for a sorbed solute (2, 4 -D). In the pulse experiments the leaching of pesticides decreased with an increase in the Kd values and leaching decreased in the order: terbufos > phoratc > 2, 4 -D > atrazine. The results from the intact core experiments suggested that both the sorbed (2, 4 -D) and non-sorbed (3 H 20) solutes move preferentially through macropores such as worm holes and root channels.

The governing partial differential equation describing the various processes is solved numerically via the Numerical Method of Lines (NMOL) technique, and the computer programs are written in FORTRAN 77. The resulting computer code (PESTFADE), is run on a microcomputer and has been implemented for interactive simulation on IBM PC or compatible microcomputers. The model was tested and validated using actual data measured from field plot experiments involving herbicide atrazine which was post-emergently applied in a corn field on a loam soil. Various analytical solutions were used to check {{the accuracy of the}} different components of PESTFADE, and parametric sensitivity analyses were performed to determine how the model output reacts to changes in some selected input parameters. Results indicate that model predictions generally agreed with measured concentrations of atrazine and compared closely with the analytical solutions. Moreover, model performance tests showed that predicted values are within acceptable ranges of model accuracy and bound of experimental uncertainties. It was also found that the model is very sensitive to degradation rate constant (k), sorption coefficient (K$ sb{ rm d}) $ and soil temperature and slightly sensitive to management practice (CN) and sorption site fraction (F). Finally, the various field scenarios and pathways for non-point source contamination evaluated in the study have demonstrated the wide applicability and flexibility of PESTFADE...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{is known}} that under {{unsaturated}} conditions, the transport of solutes can deviate from ideal advective–dispersive behaviour even for macroscopically homogeneous porous materials. Causes may include physical <b>non-equilibrium,</b> <b>sorption</b> kinetics, non-linear sorption, and the irregular distribution of sorption sites. We have performed laboratory experiments designed to identify the processes responsible for the non-ideality of radioactive Sr transport observed under unsaturated flow conditions in an Aeolian sandy deposit from the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Miscible displacement experiments were carried out at various water contents and corresponding flow rates in a laboratory model system. Results of our experiments have shown that breakthrough curves of a conservative tracer exhibit {{a higher degree of}} asymmetry when the water content decreases than at saturated water content and same Darcy velocity. It is possible that velocity variations caused by heterogeneities at the macroscopic scale are responsible for this situation. Another explanation is that molecular diffusion drives the solute mass transfer between mobile and immobile water regions, but the surface of contact between these water regions is small. At very low concentrations, representative of a radioactive Sr contamination of the pore water, sorption and physical disequilibrium dominate the radioactive Sr transport under unsaturated flow conditions. A sorption reaction is described by a cation exchange mechanism calibrated under fully saturated conditions. The sorption capacity, as well as the exchange coefficients are not affected by desaturation. The number of accessible exchange sites was calculated on the basis that the solid remained in contact with water and that the fraction of solid phase in contact with mobile water is numerically equal to the proportion of mobile water to total water content. That means that for this type of sandy soil, the nature of mineral phases is the same in advective and non-advective domains. So sorption reaction parameters can be estimated from more easily conducted saturated experiments, but hydrodynamic behaviour must be characterized by conservative tracer experiments under unsaturated flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{transport}} of pesticides to groundwater {{is assumed to}} be impacted by flow processes and geochemical interactions occurring in the vadose zone. In this study, the {{transport of}} S-metolachlor (SMOC) and its two metabolites ESA-metolachlor (MESA) and OXA-metolachlor (MOXA) in vadose zone materials of a glaciofluvial aquifer is studied at laboratory scale. Column experiments are used to study the leaching of a conservative tracer (bromide) and SMOC, MESA and MOXA under unsaturated conditions in two lithofacies, a bimodal gravel (Gcm,b) and a sand (S-x). Tracer experiments showed water fractionation into mobile and immobile compartments more pronounced in bimodal gravel columns. In both lithofacies columns, SMOC outflow is delayed (retardation factor > 2) and mass balance reveals depletion (mass balance of 0. 59 and 0. 77 in bimodal gravel and sand, respectively). However, complete mass elution associated with retardation factors close to unity shows that there is no adsorption of MESA and MOXA in either lithofacies. SMOC transport is characterized by <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> and sink term in both bimodal gravel and sand columns. Batch experiments carried out using agitation times consistent with column water residence times confirmed a time-dependence of SMOC sorption and high adsorption rates (> 80 %) of applied concentrations. Desorption experiments confirm the irreversibility of {{a major part of the}} SMOC adsorption onto particles, corresponding to the sink term in columns. In the bimodal gravel column, SMOC adsorption occurs mainly on reactive particles in contact with mobile water because of flow regionalization whereas in the sand column, there is pesticide diffusion to the immobile water. Such results clearly show that sorption mechanisms in the vadose zone solids below the soil are both solute and contact-time-dependent and are impacted by hydrodynamic conditions. The more rapid transport of MESA and MOXA to the aquifer would be controlled mainly by water flow through the unsaturated zone whereas SMOC transport is retarded by sorption processes within the vadose zone...|$|E
40|$|Production of coal-bed methane from a {{reservoir}} {{is a function}} of several parameters, including in situ gas content, the permeability of the coal, and the thickness of the coal seams. Such coal seams usually have low sorption time and there is an easy release of methane from coal upon pressure depletion due to water extraction. Coals with high sorption time are usually not suitable from an economical point of view. This study investigates the role of sorption time in the production behavior of coal under carbon dioxide injection using numerical simulation. A thick coal seam at an intermediate depth of 1600 ft was modeled with two production wells and one injection well between them. Sorption time was varied and the water/methane production and CO 2 injection behavior were monitored up to a period of 4000 days. It was found that coals with <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption</b> time have high CO 2 adsorption capacity. Therefore, they can be considered for the enhanced recovery of methane with gas injection. A large quantity of water is released from this type of coal until the start of methane desorption, and despite CO 2 injection the onset of gas release remains delayed. At {{the end of the first}} year, a reduction of nearly 50 % water production was computed for coal with sorption time tau = 0. 1 day, while water release reduced by only 23. 5 % for coal with tau = 50 days. The rate of CO 2 injection after six months duration increased to 41. 6 mscfd in the case of high sorption time coal, while it rose to only 20 mscfd for low sorption time coal, indicating almost double the rate of gas injection in the former case. The first year methane production from a coal with tau = 0. 1 day was 90 mscf, and that for tau = 300 days was 42 mscf. At the end of the fifth year, the cumulative gas production was 842 mscf and 613 mscf respectively for the respective varieties, showing that the difference slowly reduced. Possible mechanisms to understand the behavior of coals with different sorption times are proposed. It is also established that coals with sorption time less than 10 days follow an equilibrium trend in typical Indian Gondwana settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|FOREWORD BY THE FOCUS STEERING COMMITTEE Since its {{beginning}} in 1993, FOCUS (FOrum for the Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their USe) {{has established a}} number of work groups to develop procedures for estimating concentrations of plant protection products and their metabolites in various environmental compartments (ground water, surface water, soil, sediment, and air) and for performing kinetic analyses. The procedures for assessing potential movement to ground water became effective in December 2000 and have been used since then {{as part of the}} EU registration process. A few years after the release of the scenarios, scientific progress in the field of leaching models as well as experience {{with the use of the}} scenarios resulted in questions being raised regarding changes to the scenarios, harmonization of the different leaching models, the role of more advanced assessment approaches (for example, graphical information systems and <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption),</b> how to use the results of simulations and experimental studies (lysimeter and field studies) in the assessment, and the coverage of new EU member states by the FOCUS scenarios. Therefore FOCUS established a work group of experts from regulatory authorities, research institutes, and industry to develop revised scenarios and an overall framework for assessing leaching potential. This FOCUS group met as a whole 16 times between February 2004 and June 2008 and also many times in various subgroups. This report is the result of extensive deliberation on the numerous issues that arose after conducting a survey of the opinions of the member states. The output of the work group also includes a completely revised set of models, input and output shells, and scenarios which will become available at the FOCUS web site after approval of this report. The version control process does not allow access to the models for regulatory use prior to their official release date. Therefore, the FOCUS Steering Committee recommends the revised models can be used for leaching assessments immediately after release, but that registrants may use the models released in 2000 for submissions up to one year following the release of these models on the FOCUS web site. One of the specific details in the remit of the work group was that the revision of the scenarios would include harmonisation of the models (dispersion length, water balance, etc.). This effort was largely successful and the Steering Committee recommends that the ground water assessments can now be performed with any of the models (PEARL, PELMO, and PRZM) and there is no need to perform the assessments with more than one model...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to mathematically simulate the ability of bioaugmented microorganisms to aerobically cometabolize a mixture of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon (CAH) compounds during in-situ treatment. Parameter values measured from laboratory experiments were applied to the transport model with biotransformation processes included. In laboratory microcosm studies, a butane-grown, enriched culture was inoculated in soil and groundwater microcosms and exposed to butane and several repeated additions of 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA), 1, 1 -dichioroethylene (DCE), and 1, 1 -dichloroethane (DCA) at aqueous concentrations of 200 μg/L, 100 μg/L, and 200 μg/L, respectively. Microcosms containing the bioaugmented culture showed 1, 1 -DCE to be rapidly transformed, followed by slower transformation of 1, 1 -DCA and 1, 1, 1 -TCA. After most of the butane had been consumed, transformation of these latter CAHs increased, indicating strong inhibition by butane. With repeat biostimulations, butane utilization and CAH transformation accelerated, showing the increase in cell mass. These trends occurred in two sets of microcosm triplicates. No stimulation was observed in controls containing only the microorganisms indigenous to Moffett Field, confirming that activity seen in the bioaugmented microcosms was a result of the introduced culture's activity. Batch reactor results were simulated using differential equations accounting for Michaelis-Menten kinetics, transformation product toxicity, substrate inhibition, butane utilization, and CAH transformation. The equations were solved simultaneously by Runge-Kutta numerical integration with parameter values adjusted to match the microcosm data. Having defined the parameter values from laboratory studies, the biotransformation model was combined with 1 -D advective-dispersive transport to simulate behavior of the culture and the substrates within an aquifer. The model was used to simulate the results of field studies where the butane-utilizing culture was injected into a 7 m subsurface test site and exposed to alternating pulses of oxygen and butane, along with the contaminant mixture studied in the microcosms. Monitoring wells spaced at 1 m, 2. 2 m, and 4 m from the injection well allowed temporal and spatial changes in substrate concentrations to be determined. Model simulations of the field demonstration were performed to determine how well the biotransformation/solute transport model predicted actual field observations. To model the influences of solute transport, simulations were run and compared to breakthrough test data (prior to bioaugmentation) to determine the values for advection, dispersion, and sorption. The simulations showed that flow ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 5 m³/day (average linear velocity of 2. 0 m/day). Dispersion was estimated as 0. 31 m²/day. Sediment sorption partitioning coefficients for 1, 1 -DCE, 1, 1 -DCA, and 1, 1, 1 -TCA were determined to be approximately 0. 69, 0. 50, and 0. 50 L/kg, respectively. It was more difficult to determine an appropriate value of the mass transfer rate coefficient for <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>sorption,</b> so simulations were run to compare equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases. Results indicated that non-equilibrium (with mass transfer rate coefficient of approximately 0. 2 day⁻¹) better simulated the field data. Using these transport parameters and the biotransformation values determined from the laboratory experiments, simulations of the field data showed that the model was capable of simulating the effects of transformation rates, butane inhibition, and 1, 1 -DCE product toxicity. Simulations for varying pulsing cycles and durations provided possible improvements for future field demonstrations. Overall, this work proved that there is good potential in extrapolating laboratory based kinetics to simulate biotransformation at a field scale. Although the complexity of such systems makes modeling difficult, such simulations are useful in understanding and interpreting field data...|$|E
