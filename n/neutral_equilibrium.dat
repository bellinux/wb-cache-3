60|$|The second {{effect is}} {{scarcely}} less patent. How slow their progress has been, if for centuries now {{it can be}} called progress at all, is world-known. Chinese conservatism has passed into a proverb. The pendulum of pulsation in the Middle Kingdom long since {{came to a stop}} at the medial point of rest. Centre of civilization, as they call themselves, one would imagine that their mind-machinery had got caught on their own dead centre, and now could not be made to move. Life, which elsewhere is a condition of unstable equilibrium, there is of a fatally stable kind. For the Chinaman's disinclination to progress is something more than vis inertiae; it has become an ardent devotion to the status quo. Jostled, he at once settles back to his previous condition again; much as more materially, after a lifetime spent in California, at his death his body is punctiliously embalmed and sent home across five thousand miles of sea for burial. With the Japanese the condition of affairs is somewhat different. Their tendency to stand still is of a purely passive kind. It is a state of <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> stationary of itself but perfectly responsive to an impulse from without. Left to their own devices, they are conservative enough, but they instantly copy a more advanced civilization the moment they get a chance. This proclivity on their part is not out of keeping with our theory. On the contrary, it is precisely what was to have been expected; for we see the very same apparent contradiction in characters we are thrown with every day. Imitation is the natural substitute for originality. The less strong a man's personality the more prone is he to adopt the ideas of others, on the same principle that a void more easily admits a foreign body than does space that is already occupied; or as a blank piece of paper takes a dye more brilliantly for not being already tinted itself.|$|E

50|$|As the {{axial load}} on a {{perfectly}} straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a lateral force, applied {{between the two}} ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed. If the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> and a small lateral force will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed. The load at which <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.|$|E

Ab initio electronic structure methods that include electron correlation (at levels up through QCISD(T) / 6 - 31 ++G**// MP 2 (fu 11) / 6 - 31 ++GS * + ZPE) are shown to be essential to achieving a proper description of such bonding.

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA is an {{important}} tool for inference of population history in animals. A variety of mitochondrial loci have been sampled for this purpose, but many studies focus on the non-coding D-loop or control region (CR), which {{in at least some}} species appears hypermutable. Unfortunately, analyses of this region are sometimes complicated by segmental duplications, as well as by difficulties in sequencing through repeat expansions, driving many researchers to favor single-copy protein-coding or ribosomal RNA genes. Without systematic comparison, it is unclear if, how much, and what sort of information might be lost by focusing on coding regions, or conversely whether such regions might offer significant advantages over the CR. In this study, we compare the information content, both in terms of genealogy and tests of <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> of the mitochondrial CR and protein-coding ND 2 gene of the red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and its close relative the tricolored blackbird (A. tricolor). Both gene regions violate the standard infinite sites assumption central to moment-based population genetic inference, as well as exhibiting considerable among-site rate heterogeneity, obscuring significant departures from <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Given the ubiquity of rate heterogeneity in mtDNA, use of more sophisticated tests that account for this should be obligatory.

Such an auction describes e. g. the situation of a country were stabilisations are achieved through tax increases that eliminate a budget deficit.

We find (1) under-dissipation and not over-dissipation of rents which is in contrast to other all-pay auction experiments. (2) Underdissipation decreases with increasing cost of distortionary taxation and increases with bidding cost. (3) Bidding is closer to the equilibrium on the individual than on the aggregate level.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{sequence}} data {{is often}} used to reconstruct the demographic history of Pleistocene populations in an effort to understand how species have responded to past climate change events. However, departures from <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium</b> conditions can confound evolutionary inference in species with structured populations or those that have experienced periods of population expansion or decline. Selection can affect patterns of mitochondrial DNA variation and variable mutation rates among mitochondrial genes can compromise inferences drawn from single markers. We investigated the contribution of these factors to patterns of mitochondrial variation and estimates of time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for two clades in a co-operatively breeding avian species, the white-browed babbler Pomatostomus superciliosus. Both the protein-coding ND 3 gene and hypervariable domain I control region sequences showed departures from neutral expectations within the superciliosus clade, and a two-fold difference in TMRCA estimates. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of departure from a strict clock model of molecular evolution in domain I, leading to an over-estimation of TMRCA for the superciliosus clade at this marker. Our results suggest mitochondrial studies that attempt to reconstruct Pleistocene demographic histories should rigorously evaluate data for departures from <b>neutral</b> <b>equilibrium</b> expectations, including variation in evolutionary rates across multiple markers. Failure to do so can lead to serious errors in the estimation of evolutionary parameters and subsequent demographic inferences concerning the role of climate as a driver o...|$|E
