Recently, {{the quality of}} assets of the Tunisian banking sector has been enormously deteriorated. Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans are steadily increasing from 11.3 % in 2011 to 14.5 % in 2015.6 This deterioration is mainly {{due to the lack}} of effective supervisory instruments and rigorous prudential regulation. The majority of all Tunisian banks are small, even compared to banks in African countries. Total assets of all banks is TND 74589.359 million. 7 Total equity is TND 6484.61 million Tunisian dinars 8 showing their low capitalization, as their capital adequacy ratio is 8.69 %.

40|$|EVA (Economic Valued Added) is {{a modern}} {{financial}} measurement tool that determines if a business is earning more than its true cost of capital. Including a cost {{for the use of}} equity capital sets EVA apart from more popular measures of bank performance, such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), <b>net</b> <b>banking</b> <b>income</b> and the efficiency ratio, which do not consider the cost of equity capital employed. As a result, these measures may suggest a bank is performing well, when in fact it may be diminishing its value to its shareholders. EVA is a tool that focuses on maximizing shareholder wealth. EVA is an appropriate tool for motivation system and in this way it motivates managers to think like owners; and provides a common language within the corporate culture. The EVA application in banks is relatively new (it started to be implemented in U. S. in 1994) and is not as well known as other measures of bank performance.

In fact, Tunisian banks continue to maintain long-term relationships with their customers, who remain loyal to their banks, despite the emergence of new banking service providers. Customer deposits did not fall even during and after the popular revolution of January 2011. They were valued in 2015 at 59556.580 Million Tunisian dinars 13 against 60, 905.717 Million Tunisian dinars 14 for the credits granted; representing a coverage rate of 97.78 %. Tunisian Banks did not know the problem of the race of depositors to branch offices to withdraw their deposits. The risk of bank runs did not raise an issue for Tunisian banking sector, which has not suffered from global liquidity crisis. Tunisian banks invest heavily in new information and communication technologies. They can now follow their customers around the world without limiting themselves to national borders and without fear of time zones. The three main productivity ratios of Tunisian banks evolved positively even after the revolution.

40|$|Abstract: The {{allocation}} of IBRD net income is the {{lens through which}} the burdensharing issue in the World Bank Group is viewed. The paper concludes that (1) the distribution of voting power {{does not reflect the}} contribution to IBRD equity made by its borrowing members as the share of retained earnings has risen while the share of paid-in capital has declined over the years; (2) the major shareholders have used their control rights to allocate portions of IBRD net income to serve their interests in ways that have been {{at the expense of the}} borrowing members and (3) a continuation of a stagnating loan portfolio in nominal terms and a declining one in inflation-adjusted terms is likely to constrain the <b>Bank’s</b> <b>net</b> <b>income</b> from lending operations and to render it increasingly dependent for its continuing profitability on its role as a financial trader and arbitrageur. In order to regain its competitiveness as an international development lending intermediary, it is important to review the pricing of loans and the conditions attached to them as well the restraints that have applied on the purposes for which the Bank lends.

40|$|The {{issue of}} CEO {{compensation}} {{has become a}} controversial staple of media dialogue and academic pondering, especially after a crisis such as the 2007 mortgage market meltdown. CEOs, through stock options, stock grants, and cash bonuses, are supposedly paid to maximize long-term shareholder value. This desired result, however, often fails to come to fruition. In this study, from a sample of twenty-seven US commercial banks, I look for a correlation be-tween the share of a CEO’s compensation that is designated “long-term ” and two metrics of effective long-term strategy. I find no statistically significant {{evidence to suggest that}} the long-term portion of a CEO’s pay is correlated with the percentage change in either a <b>bank’s</b> <b>net</b> <b>income</b> or its allowance for loan losses, taken as a percentage of total loans. Nevertheless, I do find some evidence that long-term compensation plans that incorporate preset perfor-mance goals may improve the chances of long-term stability. 1 Ryan Krause is a senior at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University-Bloomington majoring in finance and public policy analysis.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} risk {{mitigation}} of interest rate margins {{related to a}} bank’s demand deposits. We assume the demand deposit evolution {{to be related to}} both interest rates and some exogenous factor which can be interpreted as business risk or model risk. We subsequently discuss the tradeoff between the alleviation of interest rate risk and the excess return due to investing in longer term assets. We take the viewpoint of an asset and liability manager, dealing with interest rate derivatives and focusing on the <b>bank’s</b> <b>net</b> operating <b>income.</b> We firstly derive static hedging strategies in a mean-variance framework. Then we compare them with dynamic investment strategies. Applying Duffie and Richardson’s (1991) approach, we firstly study the case of demand deposits bearing a rate which is an affine function of the market rate. We prove that the optimal hedging risk profile involves a semi-static replication of Libor exotic options, thus revealing the hidden optionality in demand deposits and paving the way for low transaction cost hedging strategies. Finally, we derive dynamic optimal strategies when the deposit rate follows some more complex function of the market rate and we show their robustness with respect to other risk measures...|$|R
