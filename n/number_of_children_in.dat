5|$|In a {{preliminary}} survey of nearly 400 seven-year-olds, 45% chose even over odd when asked the parity of zero. A follow-up investigation offered more choices: neither, both, and don't know. This time the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> {{the same age}} range identifying zero as even dropped to 32%. Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50% in Years 3 to 6. For comparison, the easiest task, identifying the parity of a single digit, levels off at about 85% success.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the {{congregation}} {{changed its name}} to Temple Israel. Its membership grew rapidly, from 914 families in 1944 to over 1,100 by late 1949, together with an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> line with the post-war post–World War II baby boom. In 1951 the temple added a new education building, which had 22 classrooms, offices, and a library. That year {{the congregation}} also updated the synagogue's kitchen, added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium, and the same for the sanctuary in 1953.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{demographic}} shift in Union-Miles Park was largely complete. The heart of this community was centered at Aetna Road and E. 93rd Street, where the majority of Poles and Slovaks began settling about 1890. Whereas once the area had been dominated by descendants of New England Yankees and by Irish, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly populated by immigrant Poles and Slovaks by 1900. To accommodate the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> these immigrant families, the Miles School (not {{to be confused with the}} Miles Park School) opened in September 1899 just outside the southeast boundary of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood at E. 119th Street and Miles Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Remarkable is, for example, the {{increase}} in non-occupational activities with obligation character, which include mainly house and garden work, maintenance and support of family members or volunteer activities. All this {{can contribute to the}} perception of a chronic lack of time. This time pressure is, amongst others, influenced by their own age, the age and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the household, marital status, the profession and level of employment as well as the income level. The psychological strain, which in turn affects the health, increases due to the strong pressure of time, but also by the complexity of work, growing responsibilities, concern for long-term existential protection and more. The mentioned stresses and strains could lead in the long term to irreversible, physical signs of wear as well as to negative effects on the human cardiovascular and immune systems.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, {{the town}} began to {{experience}} problems resulting from increasing urbanization. It {{had to deal}} with sewage disposal, water quality, and schools for the growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the area. There was also friction with the neighboring City of Green Bay. Although many citizens felt a change in government was necessary, heated debate arose about what steps to take. The town had three possibilities: remain as a town and be annexed piece-by-piece by the City of Green Bay, incorporate as a village or city that would give Preble definite boundaries, or consolidate with the city. While few supported remaining as a town, two large groups formed in support of the other two options. One group argued that Preble was a logical part of the city and could benefit overall by consolidating with Green Bay, while the other group saw Preble as a self-sufficient community that could thrive on its own. Preble tried to incorporate as a city in the 1950s, but the Wisconsin Circuit Court and the State Planning Commission barred the town from doing so. Ultimately, on November 3, 1964, the consolidation with Green Bay was approved by referendum.|$|E
500|$|... Longyearbyen had a {{population}} of 2,144 people. The largest regional group of Norwegians are from Northern Norway, particularly Nordland and Troms, which make more than 40 percent of the population. Roughly 300 people (16 percent) are non-Norwegian citizens, with the largest nationalities being from Thailand, Sweden, Russia and Ukraine. Because of {{the dominance of the}} mining industry, the gender distribution is skewed with 60 percent of adults being males. Longyearbyen has an over-average share of its population between 25 and 44 years old, but nearly no residents over 66. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> relation to the population is at the national average, but Longyearbyen has significantly fewer teenagers than the national average.|$|E

500|$|As a young boy, Howe {{may have}} been sent to England to obtain an education, {{although}} several sources doubt that Howe made the journey. [...] At some point between 1751 and 1754, after completing his education, Howe married Sarah Grange, who was heiress to a large fortune. [...] Howe had numerous affairs, fathering an unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> and out of wedlock, including a son, Robert; two daughters, Mary and Ann; and up to four additional daughters whose mothers' names are not recorded. Howe was widely considered a womanizer by contemporaries; by 1772 he became estranged from Grange, and the two separated. [...] In the year of their formal separation, Howe recorded a deed for the support of his wife.|$|E
500|$|Gregory {{was born}} around 335, {{probably}} {{in or near}} the city of Neocaesarea, Pontus. His family was aristocratic and Christian - according to Gregory of Nazianzus, his mother was Emmelia of Caesarea, and his father, a rhetorician, has been identified either as Basil the Elder or as a Gregory. Among his eight siblings were St. Macrina the Younger, St. Naucratius, St. Peter of Sebaste and St. Basil of Caesarea. The precise <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the family was historically contentious: the commentary on 30 May in the Acta Sanctorum, for example, initially states that they were nine, before describing Peter as the tenth child. It has been established that this confusion occurred due to the death of one son in infancy, leading to ambiguities in Gregory's own writings. [...] Gregory's parents had suffered persecution for their faith: he writes that they [...] "had their goods confiscated for confessing Christ." [...] Gregory's maternal grandmother, Macrina the Elder is also revered as a saint and his maternal grandfather was a martyr as Gregory put it [...] "killed by Imperial wrath" [...] under the persecution of the Roman Emperor Maximinus II. Between the 320's to the early 340's the family rebuilt its fortunes, with Gregory's father working in the city of Neocaeaseria as an advocate and rhetorician.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, in 1978, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) {{was passed}} in {{response}} to attempts to destroy the Native Americans by taking large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Native American <b>children,</b> separating them from their tribes and placed in foster care or sending them to far away schools where they were maltreated, lost and sometimes died. This legislation not only {{opened the door for}} consideration of cultural issues while stressing ideas that children should be with their families, leading to the beginnings of family preservation programs. In 1980, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act was introduced as a way to manage the high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> placement. Although this legislation addressed some of the complaints from earlier pieces of legislation around destroying due process for parents, these changes were not designed to alleviate the high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> placement or continuing delays in permanence. This led to the introduction of the home visitation models, which provided funding to private agencies to force parents into intensive services in cases where the children were not favorable on the adoption market.|$|R
