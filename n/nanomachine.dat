Looking {{for information on the}} pathogen, Spike is given a sample by a man named Rashid, who was the former lead on its development. Spike also encounters Elektra Ovilo, an agent of Cherious Medical. Upon examination, the [...] "pathogen" [...] proves to be a type of protein-based <b>nanomachine</b> that mimics human lymphocytes then breaks down into protein after death, making it undetectable. Attempting to infiltrate Cherious Medical, Spike fights with Elektra, planting a listening device on her. Elektra, who is sent by Cherious Medical to kill Vincent, is tailed by Spike, who attempts to take down Vincent on a train. Vincent easily defeats Spike, severely wounding him and throwing him from the train before releasing another cloud of the nanomachines: everyone in the train dies except Elektra, who was unknowingly immunized when she had been in a relationship with Vincent prior to the test on Titan. She secretly gives a friend in the company a sample of her blood to prepare a stock of vaccine. During this time, Faye relocates Sampson, who has been working with Vincent, but fails to catch him. Ein and Ed manage to find him again, but the two run off before Faye can get there. She arrives just as Vincent breaks one of the <b>nanomachine</b> containers with him, killing Sampson. Although Faye is also infected, Vincent gives her some of his blood through a kiss, immunizing her.|$|E

Afterward, Billy, an Ethos worker onboard Thames, allows Fei to use the Ethos' advanced medical technology. Bishop Stone, Ethos' leader, reveals to the party Ethos's true purpose of controlling the land dwellers, or [...] "Lambs", for Solaris. The group follows Stone to Zeboim, an excavation site. They discover a young girl composed of nanomachines, which is what Krelian, a Solarian leader, seeks. Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id, the mysterious red gear's pilot, who wants the girl, but is stopped by Wiseman. The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at his gear with a case of anterograde amnesia. Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat, the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris, joined by Shevat locals Maria and Chu-Chu. During this time, Bart regains his throne and initiates peace {{between the two countries}} and Stone is destroyed. Upon entering Solaris, they encounter Emeralda, the <b>nanomachine</b> colony. She attacks at first, but recognizes Fei, referring to him as [...] "Kim", much to Fei's confusion. In Solaris, Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain, though he's actually a double agent on their side, and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of recycled humans in the Soylent System facility. The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive God and achieve eternal life, while Krelian seeks to possess Elly. Back at Shevat, Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei's split personality, with Fei's gear turning red when he switches to Id due to their connection.|$|E

Molecular communication provides a mechanism for <b>nanomachines</b> to communicate over a short distance (adjacent <b>nanomachines</b> to tens of micrometers) using molecules as a communication carrier. Current research focuses on understanding biological <b>nanomachines</b> and also on artificially creating counterparts of biological <b>nanomachines.</b> No current research focuses on communication aspects of <b>nanomachines.</b> Communicating nano machines can spur the creation of entirely new applications. The class of molecular communication systems considered in this paper consists of sender <b>nanomachines,</b> receiver <b>nanomachines,</b> carrier molecules, and the environment that these operate in. Senders and receivers include biological (such as cells) and biologically derived (such as molecular motors or sensors taken from biological systems) <b>nanomachines</b> {{that are capable of}} emitting and capturing carrier molecules (such as proteins, ions, or DNA).

2500|$|In {{the graphic}} novel Star Trek: The Manga, the Borg {{resulted}} from {{an experiment in}} medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository satellite containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and DNA of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the anomalous states of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting {{them as part of}} the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the Enterprise under the command of James T. Kirk. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the Enterprise with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion like assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt <b>nanomachine</b> programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the manga Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, [...] "Resistance is futile." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{engineered}} biological <b>nanomachines</b> {{to communicate with}} biological systems {{at the molecular level}} is anticipated to enable future applications such as monitoring the condition of a human body, regenerating biological tissues and organs, and interfacing artificial devices with neural systems. From the viewpoint of communication theory and engineering, molecular communication is proposed as a new paradigm for engineered biological <b>nanomachines</b> to communicate with the natural biological <b>nanomachines</b> which form a biological system. Distinct from the current telecommunication paradigm, molecular communication uses molecules as the carriers of information; sender biological <b>nanomachines</b> encode information on molecules and release the molecules in the environment, the molecules then propagate in the environment to receiver biological <b>nanomachines,</b> and the receiver biological <b>nanomachines</b> biochemically react with the molecules to decode information. Current molecular communication research is limited to small-scale networks of several biological <b>nanomachines.</b> Key challenges {{to bridge the gap between}} current research and practical applications include developing robust and scalable techniques to create a functional network from a large number of biological <b>nanomachines.</b> Developing networking mechanisms and communication protocols is anticipated to introduce new avenues into integrating engineered and natural biological <b>nanomachines</b> into a single networked system. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art in the area of molecular communication by discussing its architecture, features, applications, design, engineering, and physical modeling. We then discuss challenges and opportunities in developing networking mechanisms and communication protocols to create a network from a large number of bio-nanomachines for future applications.

The influences of <b>nanomachining</b> experimental parameters (lateral feed and velocity) on the properties of engineering surface, material removal and chip formation were studied. Results indicated that the cutting depth of <b>nanomachined</b> surface increased as the lateral feed decreased. Insensitivity of cutting depth to velocity at same normal load was revealed. The different chip behaviors of <b>nanomachined</b> surface were investigated through scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results indicated that different lateral feeds caused different chip behaviors. Three typical chip behaviors were characterized as the lateral feed increased. In addition, the chip behavior and the volume of material removed were observed having no evident linear transformation with {{the evolution of the}} velocity by SEM graphics. Furthermore, it was concluded from the chip behaviors in <b>nanomachining</b> process that the material at high loads was removed by plastic deformation with no fracture or crack happened...|$|R

The subnanomachining experiments were carried out on a 5 -nm-thick polystyrene thin film using AFM under sample UV conditions.
