40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed model of nasal challenge, we have obtained data that clearly demonstrate, {{for the first}} time, kinin generation during a local allergic reaction in vivo. Allergic individuals (n = 8) and matched nonallergic controls (n = 8) were challenged intranasally with the appropriate antigen and <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> were taken before and after challenge. Washes were assayed for kinin, histamine, and [3 H]-N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME) -esterase activity. Increased kinin generation was found by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in the <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> of all the allergics (5, 560 +/- 1, 670 pg/ml) but in none of the controls (38 +/- 16 pg/ml). The presence of kinin was highly correlated with that of histamine and TAME-esterase activity and {{with the onset of}} clinical symptoms (P less than 0. 001). Serial dilutions of <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> produced RIA displacement curves that paralleled the standard curve, and recovery of standard kinins that were added to <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> was 100 +/- 4 % (n = 14). Kinin recovery was identical in both allergics and controls and did not vary significantly with antigen challenge. The immunoreactive kinin in <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> was stable to boiling and not precipitated by ethanol, but completely destroyed by carboxypeptidase B. It was evenly distributed between the sol and gel phases of <b>nasal</b> <b>washes.</b> High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the immunoreactive kinin in <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> showed it to be a mixture of lysylbradykinin and bradykinin.

Split-product of influenza virus A/California/ 7 / 2009 (H 1 N 1) pdm hemagglutinin vaccine (HAv) at 15 μg with or without SF- 10 and the adjuvant alone were instilled intranasally three times every 2 weeks.

Significant cross-neutralizing activities of <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> after the third vaccination to several other H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 strains were observed.

40|$|Background. Influenza virus {{infection}} {{is a major}} public health burden worldwide. Available vaccines include the inactivated intramuscular trivalent vaccine and, more recently, an intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). The measure of successful vaccination with the inactivated vaccine is a systemic rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, but for the LAIV no such correlate has been established. Methods. Seventy-nine subjects were given the LAIV FluMist. Blood was collected prior to vaccination and 3 days and 30 days after vaccination. <b>Nasal</b> <b>wash</b> was collected 3 days and 30 days after vaccination. Responses were measured systemically and in mucosal secretions for cytokines, cell activation profiles, and antibody responses. Results. Only 9 % of subjects who received LAIV seroconverted, while 33 % of patients developed at least a 2 -fold increase in influenza virus–specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies in <b>nasal</b> <b>wash.</b> LAIV induced a localized inflammation, as suggested by increased expression of interferon-response genes in mucosal RNA and increased granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and IP- 10 in <b>nasal</b> <b>wash.</b> Interestingly, patients who seroconverted had significantly lower serum levels of G-CSF before vaccination. Conclusions. Protection by LAIV is likely provided through mucosal IgA and not by increases in systemic IgG. LAIV induces local inflammation.

40|$|Persistent {{infection}} following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) {{for chronic}} rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a frustrating entity {{for the patient}} and rhinologist alike. Mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> have been proposed as an efficacious treatment in such patients. Two small studies have reported excellent short-term posttreatment outcomes; however, the long-term microbiological outcomes following treatment are not known; likewise, the rate of mupirocin-resistance following treatment has not been explored. This was a retrospective chart review of 61 patients with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) -positive surgically-recalcitrant CRS having undergone 0. 05 % mupirocin nasal rinse treatment, twice daily for 4 weeks. Specific outcomes reported included posttreatment culture results, time to first posttreatment S. aureus culture, and mupirocin-sensitivity following treatment. Of 57 patients meeting minimal posttreatment follow-up criteria, 42 (73. 7 %) progressed to microbiological failure by subsequently cultured S. aureus. Mean time to first positive culture was 144 days. Of the 42 patients who progressed to microbiological relapse, full antibiotic sensitivity data was available for 41; of these, only 1 was found to subsequently harbor a mupirocin-resistant strain of S. aureus, thus yielding a posttreatment resistance rate of 2. 4 %. Treatment with mupirocin <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> in S. aureus-positive, surgically recalcitrant CRS has a high microbiological failure rate, with 73. 7 % of patients subsequently re-culturing S. aureus.

However, effects of serostatus and gender on the HRV-induced immune response have not been clarified. 40 healthy seropositive and seronegative (1 : 1) male and female (1 : 1) subjects were inoculated with HRV- 16. HRV infection increased viral load in <b>nasal</b> <b>wash,</b> which {{tended to be more}} pronounced in seronegative subjects. Furthermore, HRV infection increased levels of IP- 10, IL- 6, and IL- 10 and leukocyte numbers in <b>nasal</b> <b>wash</b> of seronegative, but not of seropositive subjects. No differences in any of the parameters were found between both sexes. The HRV-induced local immune response is diminished in seropositive subjects compared with seronegative subjects, while gender does not influence this response. These results have important implications for the design of future experimental cold studies: seronegative subjects, from both sexes can be included...|$|E
30|$|In this randomized, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} study, 40 healthy, non-smoking, non-asthmatic {{male and}} female (1 : 1) subjects (seronegative: n = 22, seropositive: n = 18) were inoculated with HRV- 16 (HRV-A) (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20). One week later, all subjects were inoculated with HRV- 16. <b>Nasal</b> <b>wash,</b> blood samples and peak expiratory flow were obtained daily.|$|E
40|$|The susceptibilities of five zanamivir-resistant and six oseltamivir-resistant {{influenza}} viruses {{were assessed}} against four neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, including peramivir and A- 315675, by a fluorometric NA activity inhibition assay. The enzyme activity {{of a majority}} of the variants was effectively inhibited by either A- 315675 or both peramivir and A- 315675 (50 % inhibitory concentration, < 10 nM). A novel oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus B variant carrying substitution at residue 198 (Asp→Asn) (N 2 numbering) retained susceptibility to peramivir and A- 315675. In vivo, the Asn 198 variant showed no apparent fitness impairment as judged by its recovery on day 5 from the <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> of ferrets coinfected with equal doses of the wild-type virus and the Asn 198 variant. Based on the sequence analysis of the virus in the <b>nasal</b> <b>washes,</b> oseltamivir treatment (5 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days) did not provide growth advantage to the Asn 198 variant. Nevertheless, treatment with A- 315675 (prodrug A- 322278) reduced the number of the animals (two of seven) shedding the Asn 198 variant. These studies indicate that different patterns of susceptibility and cross-resistance between NA inhibitors may prove important if antiviral resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir were to emerge...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an {{emerging}} virus associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in young children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate virologic and clinical features of hMPV infection during 2 consecutive winter-spring seasons. METHODS: <b>Nasal</b> <b>washes</b> {{were obtained from}} children younger than 5 years of age hospitalized for ARI. Specimens were tested for hMPV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The hMPV F gene amplification products were sequenced, and phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: A high incidence of hMPV infection (25. 3...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{events have}} {{heightened}} {{the need for}} the rapid development of vaccines directed against pandemic influenza H 1 N 1 viruses circulating during 2009 to 2010. The current study was conducted to establish a virus challenge dose for a subsequent CA/ 04 vaccine efficacy study in 3 -mo-old domesticated ferrets. An additional consideration in using CA/ 04 in ferrets is the selection of endpoints on which to base the challenge dose, given the potential nonlethality of this particular model. Four doses ranging from 104 to 107 TCID 50 units of CA/ 04 per animal were administered by intranasal instillation to groups of male and female ferrets, and virus titers in <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> obtained 1, 3, and 5 d thereafter were determined in MDCK cells. Dosed ferrets developed clinically mild infections. Peak virus titers occurred on day 3 after instillation regardless of dose. Virus-treated ferrets had less weight gain than did untreated ferrets. In conclusion, 3 -mo-old ferrets can be infected with doses as low as 104 TCID 50 units of CA/ 04, and virus titers in <b>nasal</b> <b>washes</b> and decreased body weight gain can be used to assess the course of nonlethal infection of 3 -mo-old ferrets by CA/ 04...|$|R
