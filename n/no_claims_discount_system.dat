50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to transfer auto insurance from country to country. <b>No</b> <b>claims</b> <b>discount</b> (NCD) or <b>no</b> <b>claims</b> bonus (NCB) may be transferred, however, and offer substantial discounts for expatriates worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the {{agreement}} between the insurers, once the client makes a claim or the insurer pays the client from his/her policy the insurer has to reinstate the client's <b>No</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Discount</b> (NCD) hence, the claim won't and should not affect the client policy especially if that client was not at fault.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{illustration}} of the application of this equitable principle was in connection with motor vehicle insurance. A policyholder was provided with coverage {{on the basis that}} she was entitled to a [...] "no claims" [...] discount from her previous insurer. Confirmation to this effect from the previous insurer was required. When that was not forthcoming, her coverage was cancelled by the brokers who had issued the initial coverage note. This was done without reference to the insurer concerned whose normal practice in such circumstances would have been to maintain coverage and to require payment of the full premium until proof of the <b>no</b> <b>claims</b> <b>discount</b> was forthcoming. Such proof was eventually obtained by the policyholder, but only after she had been involved in an accident after the cancellation by the brokers of the policy. Here again, the fair outcome was to look at {{what would have happened if}} the insurer's normal practice had been followed. In such circumstances, the policyholder would plainly have still had a policy at the time of the accident. The insurer itself had not acted incorrectly at any stage. However, in the circumstances, it was equitable for it to meet the claim.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} a research work on Bonus-Malus (BM) systems in insurance portfolios, featuring designing pricing strategies and examining associated solvency risks. The {{first piece of}} work proposed two different pricing models via the Bayesian approach. Results imply adverse attitudes towards policyholders having a history of many small claims, when the modelling for claim severities takes different forms. On the other hand, {{the rest of the}} work dedicated to embedding a BM structure under a risk analysis framework, where the focus lies in measuring the underlying ruin probabilities. It was necessary to initially investigate a discrete model where such probability could be obtained through recursions. As for a continuous model, BM feature was reflected by a Bayesian estimator for premium adjustment. Such construction normally brings in a dependence structure to the risk model thus violating classical assumptions. One way was to inspect how different it is from a classical risk model. Then through some conditional arguments one could find accordingly a solution based on results in literature. From another perspective, it has been found that for a <b>No</b> <b>Claim</b> <b>Discount</b> (NCD) or a Bonus system, an alteration in premium rates could be transformed equivalently to an interchange of distribution between inter-claim times. Then some Markov properties were able to be diagnosed under higher dimensions, which leads to a further possibility of computations. Results {{can be found in the}} form of simulations...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} longitudinal {{modeling of}} detailed, micro-level automo-bile insurance records. We consider 1993 - 2001 {{data from the}} General Insurance Association of Singapore, an organization of insurance companies. By detailed micro-level records, we refer to experience at the individual vehicle level. The data consists of vehicle characteristics, insurance coverage (including the pre-mium) and claims experience, by year. The claims experience consists of de-tailed information {{on the type of}} insurance claim, such as whether the claim is due to injury to a third party, property damage to a third party or claims for damage to the insured, as well as the corresponding claim amount. We propose statistical models for three components, corresponding to the frequency, type and severity of claims. The first is a random effects Poisson regression model for assessing claim frequency, using the policyholder file to cal-ibrate the model. Vehicle type and <b>no</b> <b>claims</b> <b>discount</b> turn out to be important variables for predicting the event of a claim. The second is a multinomial logit model to predict the type of insurance claim, whether it is third party injury, third party property damage, insured damage or some combination. Premiums turn out to be important predictors for this component. Our third model for the severity component is the most innovative. Here, we use a Burr XII long-tailed distribution for claim amounts and also incorpo-rate predictor variables. Not surprisingly, we show that there is a significant dependence among the different claim types; we use a t-copula to account for this dependence. The three component models provide justification for assessing the impor-tance of a rating variable. When taken together, the integrated model allows an actuary to predict automobile claims more efficiently than traditional methods. We demonstrate this by developing predictive distributions via simulation. ∗Keywords: Insurance claims, long-tail regression, random effects models and copulas...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} statistical {{modeling of}} detailed, micro-level automobile in-surance records. We consider 1993 - 2001 {{data from a}} major insurance company in Singapore. By detailed micro-level records, we refer to experience at the individual ve-hicle level, including vehicle and driver characteristics, insurance coverage and claims experience, by year. The claims experience consists of detailed information {{on the type of}} insurance claim, such as whether the claim is due to injury to a third party, property damage to a third party or claims for damage to the insured, as well as the corresponding claim amount. We propose a hierarchical model for three components, corresponding to the fre-quency, type and severity of claims. The 8 ̆ 5 rst is a negative binomial regression model for assessing claim frequency. The drivers gender, age, and <b>no</b> <b>claims</b> <b>discount</b> as well as vehicle age and type turn out to be important variables for predicting the event of a claim. The second is a multinomial logit model to predict the type of insurance claim, whether it is third party injury, third party property damage, insureds own damage or some combination. Year, vehicle age and vehicle type turn out to be important predictors for this component. Our third model is for the severity component. Here, we use a generalized beta of the second kind long-tailed distribution for claim amounts and also incorporate predictor variables. Year, vehicle age and a persons age turn out to be important predictors for this component. Not surprisingly, we show that there is a signi 8 ̆ 5 cant dependence among the di¤erent claim types; we use a t-copula to account for this dependence.

Key words: bonus–malus, crop insurance, discounts, good experience, insurance rating. The issue of providing premium rate discounts based on favorable insurance experience {{has been in the}} economic literature since the early 1980 s. 1 These premium rate discounts are usu-ally justified by the presence of asymmetric in-formation between the policyholders and the insurers (i. e., adverse selection and moral haz-ard). Premium rate discounts based on past insurance performance are a way of adjust-ing the insurance contract to better reflect the policyholder’s risk and reduce asymmet-ric information problems due to adverse se-lection (Boyer and Dionne, 1989; Dionne and Vanasse, 1989, 1992). A premium rate <b>discount</b> <b>system</b> based on favorable experience also makes it possible to maintain proper incentives (over time) to reduce the inefficiencies associ-ated with moral hazard (Arnott, 1992; Winter...|$|R

40|$|In {{insurance}} risk theory, dividend and aggregate claim amount are of great research interest as {{they represent the}} insurance company's payments to its shareholders and policyholders respectively. Since the analyses of these two quantities are performed separately in the literature, the companion paper Cheung et al. (2015) generalized the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function (Gerber and Shiu (1998)) by further incorporating the moments of the aggregate <b>discounted</b> <b>claims</b> until ruin and the discounted dividends until ruin. While Cheung et al. (2015) considered the compound Poisson model with a dividend barrier in which ruin occurs almost surely, the present paper looks at this generalized Gerber-Shiu function under a threshold dividend strategy where the insurer has a positive survival probability. Because the Gerber-Shiu function is only defined for sample paths leading to ruin, we will additionally study the joint moments of the aggregate <b>discounted</b> <b>claims</b> and the <b>discounted</b> dividends without ruin occurring. Some explicit formulas are derived when the individual claim distribution follows a combination of exponentials. Numerical illustrations involving the correlation between aggregate <b>discounted</b> <b>claims</b> and <b>discounted</b> dividends are given. For the case where ruin occurs, we additionally compute {{the correlations between the}} time of ruin and the above two quantities. postprin...|$|R

50|$|Second {{home and}} holiday home owners {{used to be}} able to <b>claim</b> <b>discounts</b> in their council tax in the United Kingdom, as the {{property}} is vacant for much of the year. This is no longer true in many areas, including Carmarthenshire; if the property is empty (but furnished) no discount is permitted and the owner will be liable to pay the tax in full. But, In Cornwall, since 2004 second home owners can <b>claim</b> a 10% <b>discount</b> in their council tax. Prior to 2004, they could <b>claim</b> a 50% <b>discount</b> in Cornwall, they are still able to claim 50% in many other areas in England. The Welsh movement, Cymuned, promote the principle that owners of holiday homes should pay double the standard rate of council tax, as they do not otherwise invest in the local community. Testimony of this is to be seen in a report on the effect of holiday homes in Scotland, which found that those who went on holiday to Scotland spent an average of £57 a day, in comparison to just £32 a day spent by those visiting their holiday or second homes.|$|R
