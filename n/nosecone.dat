5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a <b>nosecone</b> instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the <b>nosecone</b> on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E
5|$|Once {{in front}} of Schumacher, Hill was able to {{gradually}} extend his lead to 3.4seconds by lap30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear {{during the course of}} that lap, and then spun off at turntwo on lap31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car's damaged <b>nosecone.</b> Schumacher thus assumed the lead as a result of Hill's retirement, leading by 11.5seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top sixpositions. Schumacher made his secondpit stop on lap37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over thirdposition until lap39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighthposition. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his secondstop on lap43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving {{in front of}} Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap47, the gap between him and Schumacher not big enough to allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead {{to such an extent that}} when he made his own final stop on lap52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of third gear, thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team's first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken battery cable on lap41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue's car caught fire on lap48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a spin on the circuit.|$|E

25|$|The AAM-A-1 Firebird was a {{two-stage}} weapon, {{fitted with}} cruciform wings and tailfins. Control was by differential {{motion of the}} wings; the tailfins were fixed. The missile's fuselage was constructed from aluminum alloy, while the <b>nosecone</b> and control fins were molded from plastic. Firebird was fitted with a solid-fuel booster rocket providing initial thrust, before a liquid-fuel sustainer rocket ignited for a 15-second powered flight time.|$|E
50|$|For {{exceptional}} requirements, such as {{the curing}} of ablative composite rocket engine nozzles and missile <b>nosecones,</b> a hydroclave can be used, but this entails extremely high equipment costs and elevated risks in operation.

50|$|During World War II, J. Chein & Company {{suspended}} toy production, instead producing <b>nosecones</b> {{and tail}} units for bombs and casings for incendiary devices. After the War, Chein returned to toy production with considerable success. However, as the 1940s {{drew to a}} close, they encountered increasing competition from Japanese manufacturers who produced mechanical tin toys for lower prices.|$|R
50|$|The AEREON III was {{succeeded by}} the AEREON 26, which had an entirely different, deltoid shape. The new {{aircraft}} inherited its predecessor's McCulloch engine, along with aluminum tubing from {{the structure of}} AEREON III and several of its instruments. One of the <b>nosecones</b> from AEREON III is reportedly in the Lighter-than-Air Society's collection in Akron, Ohio.|$|R
25|$|From its inception, Livermore {{focused on}} new weapon design concepts; as a result, its first three nuclear tests were unsuccessful. The lab persevered and its {{subsequent}} designs proved increasingly successful. In 1957, the Livermore Lab {{was selected to}} develop the warhead for the Navy's Polaris missile. This warhead required numerous innovations to fit a nuclear warhead into the relatively small confines of the missile <b>nosecone.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the , Räikkönen {{qualified}} ninth after a damp session. In {{the race}} however he {{collided with the}} Force India of Adrian Sutil like {{in the previous year}} in Monte Carlo, as the German was emerging from a pitstop.

25|$|The Beagle was {{initially}} {{powered by a}} 460hp (340kW) Bristol Jupiter VIIIF radial engine mounted in a smooth and rather pointed <b>nosecone,</b> leaving {{the tops of the}} nine cylinders exposed. After the competitive trials it was re-engined with a supercharged 590hp (440kW) Jupiter XF, though the extra power seems not to have led to significant performance improvement. This installation had a more pointed cowling, with more cylinder heads exposed for better cooling.|$|E
40|$|Osage Plant and Bagnell Dam impounds the Osage River {{forming the}} Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri. Since {{it is nearly}} 100 feet deep, the lake stratifies {{during the summer months}} causing low DO water to be {{discharged}} into the Osage river below the dam. To supplement DO, the turbines are vented during the low DO season. AmerenUE is continually researching new methods of DO enhancement. New turbines, manufactured by American Hydro Corporation, were installed in Units 3 & 5 during the spring of 2002. Additional vent capacity and new <b>nosecones</b> were included in the new turbine design. The retrofit aeration system is an attempt to further enhance the DO in the tailrace by installation of additional venting capability on Unit 6 (not upgraded with new turbine) and refining design on special <b>nosecones</b> which will be mounted on both Unit 3 (upgraded turbine) and Unit 6. Baseline DO testing for Units 3 & 6 was conducted mid August, 2002. This data wascompared to further tests planned for the summer of 2003 and 2004 after installation of the retrofit aeration system...|$|R
50|$|The Jupiter-C was an American {{research}} and development vehicle developed from the Jupiter-A. Jupiter-C was used for three sub-orbital spaceflights in 1956 and 1957 to test re-entry <b>nosecones</b> that were later to be deployed on the more advanced PGM-19 Jupiter mobile missile.A member of the Redstone rocket family, Jupiter-C was designed by the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), {{under the direction of}} Wernher von Braun. Three Jupiter-C flights were made followed by three satellite launches (Juno I). All were launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|R
50|$|The {{first five}} {{launches}} of the Saturn I had carried Jupiter-C <b>nosecones,</b> a proven design which allowed engineers {{to focus on}} development of the rocket. To verify the launch aerodynamics of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM), AS-101 carried BP-13, a boilerplate spacecraft which weighed 17000 lb and duplicated {{the size and shape}} of the CSM, and a dummy Launch Escape System (LES) tower. A flight-weight Command Module weighed around 12000 lb. The boilerplate spacecraft was instrumented with 116 sensors reading strain, pressure, and acceleration.|$|R
25|$|Noda {{pulled in}} to retire, and Mansell {{eventually}} {{had to come}} in for a new <b>nosecone,</b> ruining his race and denting his reputation. Noda's luck would then get no better at his home race in Japan, where he qualified 23rd, once again only one spot off Comas, although this time he was only 0.013s behind the Frenchman. His experience at Suzuka was obviously paying rich dividends, but when torrential rain drenched the circuit on race day, it would suddenly be a whole new ball game.|$|E
25|$|The F110 was liveried in dark grey, with a white, {{yellow and}} red stripe running down each sidepod and meeting at the <b>nosecone.</b> The car had no title sponsor, with small {{stickers}} for Embratel, the Banco Cruzeiro do Sul and the Murcia tourist board. The sidepods were liveried with the drivers' first names.

25|$|Nolan filmed Interstellar with {{anamorphic}} 35 mm and IMAX 70 mm photography. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema {{was hired}} for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer {{on all of}} his past films, was working on his directorial debut, Transcendence. IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar more than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery, the director had practical locations built, such as {{the interior of a}} space shuttle. Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be handheld for shooting interior scenes. Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the <b>nosecone</b> of a Learjet.|$|E
50|$|Eight Mosquitos were {{primarily}} used, five airworthy {{and others that}} could be taxied on runways or used as set dressing. The airworthy TT 35 Mosquitos were converted to resemble a fighter-bomber variant (FB Mk VI). The TT 35 models had their clear <b>nosecones</b> and side windows painted over and dummy machine gun barrels fitted. One airworthy Mosquito was a T3 with a solid nose, which only required the fitting of dummy gun barrels. It lacked the two-stage Merlin engines, V-shaped windscreen and bulged bomb bay of the TT 35s. At least one surplus Mosquito was destroyed in a simulated crash scene.|$|R

25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster <b>nosecone</b> with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E

25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque <b>nosecones,</b> as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|R
40|$|Don Stookey was {{a special}} person by any measure: an unassuming optimist, eminent {{scientist}} and inventor, adventurer, and a beloved family man. Don Stookey, the father of glass-ceramics, was a pioneer in inducing and understanding internal nucleation phenomena in glass. His early work on dense opal glasses and photosensitive precipitation of gold and silver in glass led to an amazing series of inventions: Fotalite®, a photosensitive opal, chemically machined Fotoform® and Fotoceram®, and TiO 2 -nucleated Pyroceram™ products including missile <b>nosecones</b> and oven-proof cookware. He received a basic patent on glass-ceramics which was contested and affirmed in court.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The ram {{accelerator}} is a hypervelocity launcher with direct space launch applications {{in which a}} sub-caliber projectile, analogous to the center-body of a ramjet engine, flies through fuel and oxidizer that have been premixed in a tube. Shock interactions in the tube ignite the propellant upon entrance of the projectile and the combustion travels with it, creating thrust on the projectile by stabilizing a high pressure region of gas behind it. Conventional {{ram accelerator}} projectiles consist of aluminum, magnesium, or titanium <b>nosecones</b> and bodies. An experimental program has been undertaken to determine the performance of polycarbonate projectiles in ram accelerator operation. Experimentation using polycarbonate projectiles has been divided into two series: determining the lower limit for starting velocity (i. e., less than 1100 m/s) and investigating the upper velocity limit. To investigate the influence of body length and starting velocity, a newly developed "combustion gun" was used to launch projectiles to their initial velocities. The combustion gun uses 3 - 6 m of ram accelerator test section as a breech and 4 - 6 m of the ram accelerator test section as a launch tube. A fuel-oxidizer mix is combusted in the breech using a spark plug or electric match and bursts a diaphragm, accelerating the ram projectile to its entrance velocity. The combustion gun can be operated at modest fill pressures (20 bar) but can only launch to relatively low velocities (approximately 1000 m/s) without destroying the projectile and obturator upon launch. Projectiles were successfully started at entrance velocities as low as 810 m/s and projectile body lengths as long as 91 mm were used. The tests investigating the upper Mach number limits of polycarbonate projectiles used the conventional single-stage light-gas gun because {{of its ability to}} reach higher velocities with a lower acceleration launch. It was determined that polycarbonate projectiles have an upper velocity limit in the range of 1500 - 1550 m/s which is lower than that of magnesium projectiles...|$|R
