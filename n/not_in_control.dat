5|$|Domnall mac Causantín's {{nickname}} was dásachtach. This simply meant a madman, or, {{in early}} Irish law, a man <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of his functions and hence without legal culpability. The following long reign (900–942/3) of his successor Causantín {{is more often}} regarded {{as the key to}} formation of the Kingdom of Alba.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{original}} Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's faction, a rival playable faction, or the non-playable Eleutheroi faction, which represents the world's minor kingdoms, regional powers and rebel states. If a faction should at any point find itself <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn-based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of {{the original}} Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' moves. A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy. Once a faction has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city {{at the same time as}} undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction), whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E

While the penalty is delayed, the attacking team can add a sixth skater to the ice by pulling their goalie. This player can enter the play zone as the fourth attacker.|$|E
25|$|Scholar Andrew Whitehead {{states that}} Kashmiris view Kashmir {{as having been}} ruled by their own in 1586. Since then, they believe, it has been ruled in {{succession}} by the Mughals, Afghans, Sikhs, Dogras and, lately, the Indian government. Whitehead states that this is only partly true: the Mughals lavished much affection and resources on Kashmir, the Dogras made Srinagar their capital next only to their native Jammu city, and {{through much of the}} post-independence India, Kashmiri Muslims headed the state government. Yet Kashmiris bear an 'acute sense of grievance' that they were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of their own fate for centurues.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Ajzen {{expanded}} {{upon the}} theory of reasoned action, formulating {{the theory of}} planned behaviour, which also emphasises the role of intention in behaviour performance but is intended to cover cases {{in which a person}} is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of all factors affecting the actual performance of a behaviour. As a result, the new theory states that the incidence of actual behaviour performance is proportional to the amount of control an individual possesses over the behaviour and the strength of the individual's intention in performing the behaviour. In his article, Further hypothesises that self-efficacy is important in determining the strength of the individual's intention to perform a behaviour. In 2010, Fishbein and Ajzen introduced the reasoned action approach, the successor of the theory of planned behaviour.|$|E

He joined the United States Army Air Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant on May 2, 1929. At Mitchel Field, he worked with the Guggenheim Fog Flying Laboratory. As stipulated by Harry Guggenheim, Kelsey flew as Lieutenant Jimmy Doolittle's safety pilot during the first fully 'blind' instrument flight on September 24, 1929, showing observers that he was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> by keeping his hands visible outside the cockpit.

40|$|Purpose: Evidence of {{intervertebral}} mechanical markers in chronic, non-specific {{low back}} pain (CNSLBP) is lacking. This research used dynamic fluoroscopic studies to compare intervertebral angular motion sharing inequality and variability (MSI and MSV) during continuous lumbar motion in CNSLBP patients and controls. Passive recumbent and active standing protocols were used and the relationships of these variables to age and disc degeneration were assessed. Methods: Twenty patients with CNSLBP and 20 matched controls received quantitative fluoroscopic lumbar spine examinations using a standardised protocol for data collection and image analysis. Composite disc degeneration (CDD) scores comprising the sum of Kellgren and Lawrence grades from L 2 -S 1 were obtained. Indices of intervertebral motion sharing inequality (MSI) and variability (MSV) were derived and expressed in units of proportion of lumbar range of motion from outward and return motion sequences during lying, (passive) and standing (active) lumbar bending and compared between patients and controls. Relationships between MSI, MSV, age and CDD were assessed by linear correlation. Results: MSI was significantly greater in the patients throughout the intervertebral motion sequences of recumbent flexion (0. 29 vs 0. 22, p= 0. 02) and when flexion, extension, left and right motion were combined to give a composite measure (1. 40 vs 0. 92, p= 0. 04). MSI correlated substantially with age (R= 0. 85, p= 0. 004) and CDD (R= 0. 70, p= 0. 03) in lying passive investigations <b>in</b> patients and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls.</b> There were also substantial correlations between MSV and age (R= 0. 77, p= 0. 01) and CDD (R= 0. 85, p= 0. 004) in standing flexion <b>in</b> patients and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls.</b> Conclusion: Greater inequality and variability of motion sharing was found in patients with CNSLBP than <b>in</b> <b>controls,</b> confirming previous studies and suggesting a biomechanical marker for the disorder at intervertebral level. The relationship between disc degeneration and MSI was augmented <b>in</b> patients, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> during passive motion and similarly for MSV during active motion, suggesting links between in vivo disc mechanics and pain generation...|$|R
