5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum.

5|$|In {{addition}} to epitheliomuscular, <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm ("stomach skin") contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes.

5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes.

5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The infrahyoid muscles lie {{in front}} of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two carotid arteries. The trachea, laryngx, lower pharynx and {{esophagus}} all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the recurrent laryngeal <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} clinical {{consequences of the}} presence of an axillary arch including confusing the identification and palpation of enlarged or tumorous lymph nodes, the trapping of axillary structures including the axillary <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the axillary vein and causing potential problems in axillary surgery or breast reconstruction. There have also been reported instances of the axillary arch being involved in the development of deep vein thrombosis.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid follicles {{are small}} spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in {{diameter}} that play the main role in thyroid function.

5|$|Tubular veins {{run through}} the two-layered {{membranous}} wing. Veins {{are connected to the}} haemocoel and in theory allow haemolymph to flow through them. In addition, a <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> trachea may pass through the veins.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

Just one game into his second-round match against Tommy Robredo, Raonic called for a medical timeout due to a right foot injury. Although {{he went on to}} win the match, Raonic's manager {{indicated}} that Raonic had made a pre-existing injury worse by playing. In his quarterfinal match against Berdych, he complained of numbness in his right foot during a medical timeout, and retired while trailing 2–5 in the opening set. It was diagnosed as a pinched <b>nerve,</b> <b>and</b> Raonic was expected to be healthy for the Madrid Open.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response.

However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E
