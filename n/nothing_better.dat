5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> to do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of idioms.|$|E

25|$|This, at least, {{is how the}} biographer has it. The whole {{section of}} the vita dealing with Lucius' debaucheries (HA Verus 4.46.6) is an {{insertion}} into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others take and elaborate something from the original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> than his own imagination.|$|E
25|$|Rizal was a {{contemporary}} of Gandhi, Tagore and Sun Yat Sen who also advocated liberty through peaceful means {{rather than by}} violent revolution.

In the Noli he stated that if European civilization had <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> to offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed.|$|E

25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{meaningful}} alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work {{because they have}} <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.|$|E

After one more night and a hurried wash in a horse trough, Riis went for an interview.

Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E
