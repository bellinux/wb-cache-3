The locals, who formerly regarded the birds as pests, <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> storks as special and take pride in protecting them and the trees in which they breed. Locals have even added prayers {{for the safety of the}} storks to hymns, and included stork designs to the motifs used in traditional weaving. Similar measures have been used with success in other parts of India where adjutants breed.|$|E
500|$|The Imperial army, {{although}} smaller, was {{not much}} better, and certainly not the battle-hardened army the Prussians had faced at Kolin. This was the Reichsarmee, an army consisting of units sent by the constituent members of the Holy Roman Empire. [...] Their commander had {{reported that they were}} defective in training, administration, armaments, discipline and leadership. The same might be said of their commander, Saxe-Hildburghausen, an indolent and slow-moving man. The Imperial regimental officers often lacked even basic garrison training. [...] These units had little experience working together, much less fighting together, a problem that expressed itself most evidently in the disastrous wheeling pivot. Furthermore, the Reichsarmee contingents came from many principalities, some of which were Protestant, and many of which were unhappy about any alliance with the French; most were more adverse to the French than they were to the Prussians. Once news of the battle's uneven resolution spread, some Germans felt satisfaction; the battle could be seen as retribution for the years of suffering under the French atrocities in the Rhineland and Palatinate during the Palatinate campaign and the subsequent invasions and occupation of Louis XIV. Mostly, though, Rossbach was significant for the strengthening of Prussia's relationship with Frederick's uncle, King George, and George's other subjects. The British could <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> advantage of keeping the French occupied on the Continent while they continued their expansion in North America.|$|E

500|$|After a {{few days}} delay caused by heavy snowfalls, the attack {{commenced}} at 02:45 on 12 February. During the approach march {{to the foot of}} the Cuklahöhe, some men disappeared up to their neck in snow due to the many snow-filled depressions and the depth of the snow. This meant that the march to the bottom of the channel took two hours instead of the thirty minutes Mikl had estimated. When they reached the bottom of the channel, they had to climb a [...] high smooth ice wall to enter the gutter, which even highly experienced climbers were unable to scale. Around 06:00, the whole company had assembled at the bottom of the channel, but dawn was beginning to break, threatening to expose the assembled force to flanking Italian positions. Schlatte then came forward, carrying the trunk of an alpenrose, a shrub that grows just above the tree-line in the Alps. He used the trunk to reach the channel ledge, and the troops were able to enter the gutter with his help. The troops could <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> glow of the candles in the Italian position. The assault took the Italians completely by surprise, and three officers and 84 soldiers surrendered, for the loss of four dead, including one officer, and four wounded. The Italian response was to concentrate all available artillery fire on the position. The dugout was exposed to direct Italian fire, and was therefore unusable. The Austrians were in an exposed position in deep snow and with extremely cold winds at an altitude of , and during the first day Mikl's company lost 20 dead and 60 seriously wounded. On the night of 15 February, the Italians commenced two days of unsuccessful counterattacks, some carried out in four or five consecutive waves. For several weeks starting on 17 February, Benito Mussolini, then a member of the Italian 11th Bersaglieri Regiment, was on the front line near the Cuklahöhe, and described some of his experiences in his diary. On 5 March, prior to the withdrawal of his company from the Cuklahöhe, Mikl was wounded in the face by an Italian hand grenade. When his company was relieved on the Cuklahöhe on 12 April, it had shrunk to just 44 men. For his leadership of the assault on the Cuklahöhe, Mikl was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class. On 10 May, the Cuklahöhe was retaken by the Italians from three companies of Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry, who lost 250 men. The assault force, consisting of four battalions of the Italian 24th Infantry Division lost 18 officers and 516 men.|$|E

2500|$|Arguably {{its biggest}} change to date, in 1959 Guinness changed its whole {{composition}} by introducing nitrogen. The introduction of nitrogen changed the fundamental texture and flavour of Guinness {{of the past}} as nitrogen bubbles are much smaller than CO2, giving a [...] "creamier" [...] and [...] "smoother" [...] consistency over a sharper and traditional CO2 taste. This arguably pivotal moment in Guinness' 258 year history started in 1959 when Michael Ash – a mathematician turned brewer – after an extensive four year journey of experimentation, discovered the mechanism to make this possible. As a result of this, when a pint of Guinness is poured today, you <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> classic [...] "surge and settle" [...] effect (nitrogen bubbles cascading {{down the side of}} the pint glass) which is ultimately the extensive work and genius of Michael Ash.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:15, {{the eight}} Russian {{guns on the}} Causeway Heights opened up on the Light Brigade, whose front line was now more than halfway down the valley; for the next 400 yards (~365 m) the men also came under fire from the guns to their front. At a {{distance}} of 250 yards (~ 230 m) from Obolensky's battery, Cardigan ordered his bugler to sound the 'Gallop'. [...] "And so we went through this scene of carnage," [...] reported Paget, [...] "wondering each moment which would be our last … It required a deal of closing in, by this time, to fill up the vacant gaps." [...] Cardigan now ordered the 'Charge'. Some amongst the gun crews now doubted they could stop the advance – they could <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lowered lances of the 17th Lancers.

2500|$|If {{the above}} theory is true, {{the next stage}} of {{development}} ought to be triple algebra and if [...] truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was [...] although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that [...] De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it {{has been found to be}} the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{writers on}} sexual orientation usually understood {{it to be}} intrinsically linked to the subject's own sex. For example, {{it was thought that}} a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa. This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations. An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities <b>now</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> [...] "gender-conforming heterosexual" [...] and the [...] "gender-nonconforming homosexual" [...] as negative stereotypes. Nevertheless, studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years.|$|E
