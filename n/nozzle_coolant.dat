40|$|Abstract. A {{floating}} nozzle {{is characterized}} by the property of intercepting airflow around a superabrasive grinding wheel and supplying coolant to a grinding point surely by adhesion of the coolant to the wheel surface. In this method, a small clearance between the wheel surface and the nozzle tip is automatically adjusted. This is mainly by the coolant pressure and a spring force pressing the nozzle toward the wheel. In grinding difficult-to-machine materials, it has been discovered that the grinding performance of superabrasive wheel improves, when the coolant is supplied using this nozzle. In this research, the basic behavior of the coolant adhering to the surface of a rotating wheel is investigated experimentally. The results confirmed that the coolant forms a thin layer on the wheel surface. Compared with a conventional <b>nozzle,</b> the <b>coolant</b> effectively reaches the grinding point by the floating nozzle, even at a low flow rate.

There was an anomaly {{at the end}} of the launch in that the main engines shut down 0. 16 second early because sensors detected a low level of oxidizer in the LOX tank (actually the duct from the tank to the vehicle). This resulted in a cutoff velocity for the vehicle that was 16 ft/sec low. It should have been 25872 ft/sec. The OMS engines were subsequently used to achieve the proper orbit. An investigation was immediately initiated into the cause of this LOX tank low level cutoff. It was noticed during the launch that the turbine temperatures for Main Engine 3 (E 2019) were approximately 100 F higher than the preflight prediction.

The following aspects of the sub-scale coolant delivery system were analyzed with CFD: 1) a design trade study of a mechanical flow splitting device for uniform distribution of the subsonic cavity flow, 2) a design trade study of the subsonic cavity lip to achieve film integrity, and 3) an analysis of the primary flow interaction with the core/secondary coolant streams. All design calculations were performed with the Generalized Aerodynamic Simulation Program (GASP), a 3 -D, multi-block, generalized Navier-Stokes code capable of solving with frozen, finite-rate or equilibrium chemical kinetics. The initial design of the subsonic cavity flow used square posts to distribute the sonic orifice jets into a uniform flow. Calculations for this design indicated that an unacceptable mal-distribution of film occurred. Design modifications involving curved and slotted posts were computed in an effort to uniformly distribute the secondary coolant flow. Analysis of these configurations showed that although the flowfield improved in uniformity, it was still unacceptable, especially at higher feed pressures. Results from these studies were then incorporated into a design that resulted in the insertion of a porous metal ring into the subsonic cavity. Subsequent water flow model studies showed that this concept was successful in uniformly distributing flow exiting the cavity. In addition to the design of the subsonic cavity, CFD was also used to analyze the secondary coolant lip and the primary flow interaction with the core/secondary coolant streams. A series of calculations were first performed to modify the subsonic cavity lip contour. The flow over the modified lip was then computed simultaneously with the primary injectors to determine the impact of the subsonic coolant stream on the primary slot jets. Pressure, temperature, velocity, and coolant mass fraction contours are presented for these configurations. Information is given in viewgraph form...|$|E

40|$|High-speed deep {{grinding}} (HSDG) technology was developed based on high-speed and creep-feed grinding techniques. What mainly distinguishes HSDG from creep-feed grinding is its employment of {{a significantly higher}} wheel speed. Because the higher wheel speed results in {{a decrease in the}} undeformed chip thickness, HSDG is thus capable of achieving high stock removal rates and producing a high surface quality throughout the workpiece. However, the increase in wheel speed leads to the formation of a strengthened air barrier around the grinding wheel periphery, which is a great obstacle to the impinging of coolant into the grinding zone. Additionally, the higher wheel speed will also generate greater grinding heat in the grinding zone, thus resulting in a higher temperature. 2 ̆ 7 This increases the risk of thermal damage on the workpiece, such as burns and cracks, especially when grinding metals and alloys.

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) {{are working}} {{together}} to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of the dual bell nozzle concept. Dual bell nozzles are a form of altitude compensating nozzle that consists of two connecting bell contours. At low altitude the nozzle flows fully in the first, relatively lower area ratio, nozzle. The nozzle flow separates from the wall at the inflection point which joins the two bell contours. This relatively low expansion results in higher nozzle efficiency during the low altitude portion of the launch. As ambient pressure decreases with increasing altitude, the nozzle flow will expand to fill the relatively large area ratio second nozzle. The larger area ratio of the second bell enables higher Isp during the high altitude and vacuum portions of the launch. Despite {{a long history of}} theoretical consideration and promise towards improving rocket performance, dual bell nozzles have yet to be developed for practical use and have seen only limited testing. One barrier to use of dual bell nozzles is the lack of control over the nozzle flow transition from the first bell to the second bell during operation. A method that this team is pursuing to enhance the controllability of the nozzle flow transition is manipulation of the film coolant that is injected near the inflection between the two bell contours. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is being run to assess the degree of control over nozzle flow transition generated via manipulation of the film injection. A cold flow dual bell <b>nozzle,</b> without film <b>coolant,</b> was tested over a range of simulated altitudes in 2004 in MSFC's nozzle test facility.

40|$|Heat {{generation}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in grinding because high temperature can limit wheel life and also induce defects such as residual stress and micro cracks in workpieces. Coolant is therefore extensively used in order to reduce the heat effect. In order to deal with the problems associated with the existing cooling methods, an ultrasonic <b>coolant</b> <b>nozzle</b> system was designed and examined in this project. Variable ultra high frequency vibration strength can be obtained and delivered to coolant during grinding by the proposed system. Characteristic studies were carried out to find relationships between the input and output parameters. Via the preliminary tests, the effects of coolant flow rate on surface roughness of ground samples were investigated by using the proposed system. Under the normal coolant temperature of 22 °C and a cooled coolant temperature of 4 °C, experimental results show that, without use of activation, an increase in the number of nozzle nnzl leads to a reduction in surface roughness of ground samples up to approximately 8. 5 %. In addition, the effects of interaction of coolant flow rate and vibration strength on surface roughness of ground samples were examined through the tests. Based on the experimental results, it is found that an increase in coolant amount with activation leads to a reduction in surface roughness of ground samples up to approximately 13 %. Through the factorial orthogonal test, the order of importance of four input parameters in relation to surface roughness was obtained. Key input parameters were selected for further studies. With a fixed coolant flow rate, the effects of the parameters on loading current I, surface roughness Ra, Rq, Rz and Rt were obtained. The results show that the proposed cooling method can effectively improve workpiece surface quality. With a reduction in coolant temperature tc from the normal coolant temperature of 22 °C to a cooled coolant temperature of 4 °C, the surface roughness value was reduced by up to 22 %. The grinding force was increased by approximately 21 %. With an increase in activation, the surface roughness value was reduced by up to approximately 14 %.

40|$|The Mechanical Engineering Department at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo {{currently}} {{maintains a}} lab-scale hybrid rocket motor for which nitrous oxide is utilized as the oxidizer in the combustion system. Because of its availability, the same two-phase (gas and liquid) nitrous oxide {{that is used}} in the combustion system is also routed around the throat of the hybrid rocket’s converging-diverging <b>nozzle</b> as a <b>coolant.</b> While this coolant system has proven effective empirically in previous tests, the physics behind the flow of the two-phase mixture is largely unexplained. This thesis provides a method for predicting some of its behavior by modeling it using the classic gas dynamics scenarios of Rayleigh and Fanno flows which refer to one-dimensional, compressible, inviscid flow in a constant area duct with heat addition and friction. The two-phase model produced utilizes a separated phase with interface exchange model for predicting whether or not dryout occurs. The Shah correlation is used to predict heat transfer coefficients in the nucleate boiling regime. The homogeneous flow model is utilized to predict pressure drop. It is proposed that a Dittus-Boelter based correlation much like that of Groeneveld be developed for modeling heat transfer coefficients upon the collection of sufficient data. Data was collected from a series of tests on the hybrid rocket nozzle to validate this model. The tests were first run for the simplified case of an ideal gas (helium) coolant to verify the experimental setup and promote confidence in subsequent two-phase experimental results. The results of these tests showed good agreement with a combined Rayleigh-Fanno model with a few exceptions including: (1) reduced experimental gas pressure and temperature in the annulus entrance and exit regions compared to the model and (2) reduced experimentally measured copper temperatures uniformly through the annulus. These discrepancies are likely explained by the geometry of the flowpath and location of the copper thermocouples respectively. Next, a series of two-phase cooled experiments were run. Similar trends were seen to the helium experiment with regards to entrance and exit regions. The two-phase Rayleigh homogeneous flow model underpredicted pressure drop presumably due to the inviscid assumption. Ambiguity was observed in the fluid temperature measurements but the trend seemed to suggest that mild thermal non-equilibrium existed. In both cases, the dryout model predicted that mist flow (a post-CHF regime) occurred over most of the annulus. Several modifications should be implemented in future endeavors. These include: (1) collecting more data to produce a heat transfer coefficient correlation specific to the nitrous oxide system of interest, (2) accounting for thermal non-equilibrium, (3) accounting for entrance and exit effects, and (4) developing a two-phase Fanno model...|$|R
