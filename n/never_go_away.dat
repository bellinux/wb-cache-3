500|$|Lewington's own {{assessment}} of the relationship is that: [...] "Maddy doesn't have anyone in her life that she can count on. Dan was her family and that's what hurt so bad. I guess to have Dan as a lover would mean that he would <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> She wouldn't have to share him. Dan loved Maddy sincerely {{which is why he}} didn't want to risk hurting her [...] than he already had. He was too messed up to be good for anyone and he knew it." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{determine}} the cause of death, the coroner, Gavin Thurston, ordered a post-mortem examination on Hendrix's body, which was performed on September 21 by Professor Robert Donald Teare, a forensic pathologist. Teare reported that Hendrix was [...] "well nourished and muscular", and he identified a quarter-inch scar on Hendrix's left wrist. He said that there were [...] "no stigmata of [...] drug addiction. Once these marks are there , they <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> In this case, there were no marks at all." [...] Although Teare observed that the right side of Hendrix's heart was widely dilated, he found no evidence of valvular heart disease. He discovered a partially collapsed left lung and 400 ml of fluid in Hendrix's chest. Both lungs were congested, and vomit was found in the smaller bronchi. According to Teare, Hendrix's stomach [...] "contained a medium-sized partially digested meal in which rice could be distinguished." [...] Teare concluded that Hendrix's kidneys were healthy, and his liver was congested. His [...] "bladder was half full of clear urine." [...] He stated that Hendrix's blood alcohol content was 100mg per 100 ml, [...] "enough to fail a breathalyzer test... the equivalent of about four pints of beer." [...] Teare reported that analysis of Hendrix's blood [...] "revealed a mixture of barbiturates consistent with those from Vesparax", and he estimated that drug concentrations translated to ingestion of 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20mg of amphetamine, and 20mg of cannabis. Teare gave the cause of death as: [...] "Inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication." [...] He did not attempt to determine Hendrix's time of death.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor {{would fight}} over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: [...] "We cannot look comfortable with each other. [...] We need to look like {{we are in a}} place of competition." [...] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were [...] "crossing swords once again for the same man". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with [...] "more intelligence" [...] this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as [...] "long as it wasn't over Ridge" [...] again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: [...] "I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'" [...] The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the [...] "feeling that will <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> which is, 'It's not fair'". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.|$|E
