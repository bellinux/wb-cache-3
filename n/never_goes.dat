5|$|In {{addition}} to the main plot, there are two side plots: the Redwing Arc and the Judge Arc. The Redwing Arc centers around the Redwings clan, a foreign crime ring, their subordinate clan Borzoi, and their smuggled foreign monsters. The other is the Judge Arc, unlockable after beating the main three hundred missions. This serves as an alternative ending where Marche <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> on his quest and stays in Ivalice, overthrows several corrupt judges, and becomes next in line for Cid's judge sword.|$|E
5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Gale's murder, Gus brings both Walt and Jesse to the lab, and kills his associate Victor {{right in front of}} them in a gruesome show of force. The tension of working under tighter security creates a rift between Walt and Jesse, and Gus uses the opportunity to bring Jesse to his side by having Mike train him in hopes of eventually replacing Walt. Walt figures out what Gus is up to and gives Jesse homemade ricin with which to poison Gus, but Jesse <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> through with it. Meanwhile, Walt buys the car wash where he used to work and uses it to launder his drug money.|$|E
25|$|A Hungarian team {{proposed}} that a sun compass artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings {{to guide their}} boats at night too. A type of crystal they called a sunstone can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship was used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> completely dark. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast) a sunstone {{would have been a}} more reliable guide than a magnetic compass.|$|E
500|$|Another theme {{prevalent}} in the novel is death, influenced {{in part by the}} death of Miller's father, to whom the book is dedicated. Miller stated that [...] "after the age of fortysomething, death is a taste in your mouth, and <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> away again". The reviewer for The Australian called the novel [...] "a meditation on death and the frailty of the body and spirit".|$|E

500|$|However, Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot {{was less}} {{enthusiastic}} about the track, musing that [...] "the references to luxury cars and private jets quickly lose their escapist luster, grossly {{out of step with}} a summer in which joblessness and foreclosure are becoming all too common for many Americans" [...] and that [...] "just as disappointing is that the Redding sample – a thrilling burst of agitated vocals, classic Memphis horns, organ and drums – <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> anywhere." [...] In an interview with Redding's widow, Zelma Redding, Us Weekly reported that Mrs. Redding approved the song, saying [...] "We are proud that Otis' legacy continues to inspire some of today's popular artists. We like 'Otis' and thank Kanye and Jay-Z for honoring our Otis through their music." ...|$|E

While the film earned mixed reviews, Kaif was generally praised for her portrayal. The book Mother Maiden Mistress called Dimple {{one of the}} more interesting female characters of the year and Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times said the film was watchable because of [...] "Katrina's live-wire energy wherein she <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> overboard and keeps bustling with vivacity through the runtime". For this performance, Kaif received her second Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category.|$|E

In {{his review of}} the album, Chung Ah-young of The Korea Times described the single as [...] "one of the best tracks [...] with impressive piano sounds harmonized with [...] powerful vocals". Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy gave a mixed review to the double A-side. He called the single a [...] "placid affair" [...] with [...] "its plinky-plonky piano and R groove resting uncomfortably next to Lewis's creamy vocal style". The BBC's reviewer Fraser McAlpine gave [...] "Better in Time" [...] three stars out of five commenting that [...] "The tune's quite nice, fairly hummable without ever actually going anywhere and despite the floaty, Mariah-esque qualities of Leona's vocals, it <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> completely mental in the throat-breakdancing department".|$|E
500|$|I Thought It Was You, {{his second}} album, was {{released}} in August 1991.

The label scrapped Freedom and instead chose to release an extended play titled Hits and More: Life Beside a Gravel Road, which would have included past hits and three new songs. Its first single, [...] "While You're Still Young", peaked at number 32 in mid-2010. On September 17, 2010, a day before the extended play's slated release, Montgomery Gentry exited the label, and Hits and More was shelved.

500|$|Many of the {{arrangements}} on Silent Alarm are strongly percussive. The leading song, [...] "Like Eating Glass", {{was inspired by}} a remix of The Smiths' [...] "There Is a Light That <b>Never</b> <b>Goes</b> Out" [...] Okereke heard in 2002. Its drum track was deliberately mixed louder than usual to add emphasis to the album's opening. [...] "Helicopter" [...] has a quick tempo of 171beats per minute, while [...] "Positive Tension" [...] begins with a solitary bassline and builds up pace, first with a rhythmic drumming pattern, and then with a guitar solo towards its conclusion. [...] "Banquet" [...] involves lead guitar and rhythm guitar playing in syncopation, while [...] "Blue Light" [...] has a slower tempo and a crescendo towards the end. During the studio sessions, the Bloc Party EP version of [...] "She's Hearing Voices" [...] was reworked to include reverberation and stereo separation of the instrumental parts.

Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly awarded the song a B+ rating, stating that: [...] "Remember when {{the thought of}} Jennifer Lopez releasing good music was as likely as a sequel to Angel Eyes?

Now she unites with Gaga pal RedOne for this appropriately named piece of pop pleasure: Once the club banger hits your ears, good or bad, you won't {{be able to get}} it out of your head." [...] Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, gave a positive review of the song, stating that between [...] "On the Floor" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] Lopez is [...] "really made a glittery return to her extreme club/"Waiting for Tonight" [...] roots".

[...] And yet I never found myself suffering from cuteness overload. In fact, I laughed and smiled the entire way through." [...] Starpulse named [...] "The Rain King" [...] as the ninth best X-Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal, saying that the episode was an [...] "ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Despite criticizing the show for [...] "filming {{in the land of}} sunshine and lemon drops" [...] and [...] "border on that overly twee independent movie vibe", Handlen noted that [...] "the episode’s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from our heroes [...] that it <b>never</b> <b>goes</b> completely off the rails." [...] He did, however, note that the episode's placement, after a string of several humorous episodes, hurt its reception; he argued that, had it appeared in an earlier, darker season, the entry would now be viewed as [...] "a cock-eyed classic".|$|E
