50|$|Artificial lift {{refers to}} the use of {{artificial}} means to increase the flow of liquids, such as crude oil or water, from a production well. Generally this is achieved by the use of a mechanical device inside the well (known as pump or velocity string) or by decreasing the weight of the hydrostatic column by injecting gas into the liquid some distance down the well. A newer method called Continuous Belt Transportation (CBT) uses an oil absorbing belt to extract from marginal and idle wells. Artificial lift is needed in wells when there is insufficient pressure in the reservoir to lift the produced fluids to the surface, but often used in <b>naturally</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>wells</b> (which do not technically need it) to increase the flow rate above what would <b>flow</b> <b>naturally.</b> The produced fluid can be oil, water or a mix of oil and water, typically mixed with some amount of gas.|$|R

50|$|Until the 1970s {{there was}} a {{commercial}} watercress industry, run by the now-defunct Greatford Gardens Watercress Company, using water pumped from artesian bores reaching deep within the limestone strata of the Lincolnshire Wolds. In some years, the bores became <b>naturally</b> <b>flowing</b> artesian <b>wells</b> when pressure was sufficient to allow the water to reach the surface {{without the aid of}} pumps. Spring water with a slight alkalinity, such as that imparted by the limestone strata, is especially suitable for watercress. Some remnants of this industry can be found {{to the west of the}} old sluice gates, approximately eight hundred yards south of the Haven Inn. Other watercress beds owned by the company were located to the east of Ferry Road but have now been ploughed over and little evidence remains of their existence. At the eastern location, there were approximately twenty five watercress beds each ten yards wide by one hundred yards long. The beds were built with a slight gradient and water was directed through a channel into the highest end and then allowed flow gently down the length of the bed before leaving through a narrow opening at the lower end. The water then flowed into a channel which directed it into the Beck approximately fifty yards to the east of the Clew Gates. The watercress was gathered by hand and put onto wooden trays before being taken to a packing shed where it was divided into bundles, labelled and then the roots cut off. The bunches were then packed into wooden baskets, known as chips and transported by road to the rail and ferry centre at New Holland for delivery to customers. The severed roots were returned to the watercress bed where they were replanted. The company had similar watercress farms at Healing, Lincolnshire, Stamford, Lincolnshire and Fordingbridge, Hampshire. The company ceased its operations in Barrow Haven when it lost its water rights.|$|R

25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which <b>naturally</b> <b>flow</b> from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, {{although}} not <b>naturally</b> <b>flowing</b> from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} model for predicting the pressure {{at any point}} in a flow string is essential in determining optimumproduction string dimension and in the design of gas-lift installations.
