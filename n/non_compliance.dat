25|$|First, {{citizens}} must {{support the}} Government's policy, thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion {{and the target}} whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences. For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange {{in violation of the}} country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the <b>non</b> <b>compliance.</b>|$|E

The activities, undertaken between 2008 and 2010, are related to an audit programme planning, implemented with 2 official controls for each plant, in 48 premises recognized under the Regulation (CE) 854 / 2004, among those, 34 processing plants (cutting and processing of food of animal origin) and 14 abattoirs. Data included in audit reports have been analyzed with Excel software, classifying detected <b>non</b> <b>compliances</b> (n. c.) in 8 categories linked to specific food safety risk factors (structure, operative hygiene, personnel hygiene, pest control, temperature control, management of by-products, traceability, HACCP/records). By the time of the audit 83 % of the inspected premises showed structural n. c.; structural aspects are the most critical point (121 n. c. out of 264), followed by operative hygiene (25 % of total n. c.) and pest control (13. 6 %). By the time of the second audit series, however, occurred a significant reduction of n. c. in both processing plants and abattoirs, falling from 264 to 152, with a reduction of n. c. detection of more than 40 %. The best response capacity among operators is related to pest control and HACCP plan/records. The audit procedure implemented, a part from providing a comprehensive and objective evaluation method of the food safety management system put in place by the operators, allowed, if compared to former procedures, a more objective and comprehensive evaluation of the n. c. trend and therefore of the food safety risk factors, estimating the efficacy of the control activity...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: due to {{increasing}} development of electricity transmission {{in the country}} and <b>non</b> – <b>compliance</b> with privacy standard residential lines in some cities, many problems for the residents of these areas have been established. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and assess risks in the area of power transmission lines by using William Fine method in hasyrabad and provide a solution is to reduce the effects. Materials & Method: in order to determine the risks, processes and equipment required for power transmission through field visits and interviews with experts, are identified. Since the magnetic field emitted from the power lines as if it is illegal, can be considered as a risk, this parameter is measured in the study area based on the NIEHS standard with 3 D EMF TESTER by four of the 91, 61, 30, 15 meters from the 230 kv tower, And eventually performed with the standard values can be compared. The identified risks by the parameters of William Fine method were scored and prioritization methodology was based on the placement table. Finally, to reduce the risk level, corrective control measures, were presented. Findings: measuring the magnetic field intensity in the study area, showed that field intensity at any desired distance from the most is above the permissible limit and can be considered as a risk. Finally, 41 risk in four categories: health, environmental, safety – technical and natural event by using William Fine method for 13 elements were identified. The highest risk to the wire and electrical transmission line with priority number 900 and minimum risk to the tower, wire guards, wire ground and span were obtained with a risk priority number 25. Discussion & Conclusion: according to the results, the highest levels of safety at risk – health RPN are 900 and 400 respectively that in most cases the cause of risk is <b>non</b> – <b>compliance</b> with privacy standards of electricity transmission lines in residential areas. so, the proposed control strategy to reduce the effects, compliance with the standards of offshore electricity transmission and prevent people from advancing and construction of urban space is provided for the risk...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{development}} process {{is characterized by}} high complexity and ever-decreasing lead times throughout for shortening time-to-market as an outcome. Development delays experienced in single systems, systems integration and the occurrence of design oscillations (design <b>non</b> <b>compliances</b> identified during flight tests that demand re-design and new test campaign) represent the main threats for the aeronautical industry to accomplish the market and certifying boards schedules. It is usual that the precedent phases to flight tests experience some delays, but the dead line for the certification phase remains unchanged. Consequently, the flight tests campaign is compressed {{in terms of time}} length for avoiding the delays in the certification schedule. Planning and managing activities in this highly dynamic scenario are very difficult tasks. The choice of the correct approach is ultimately related to cost, time, quality and safety optimization. A tool that provides the flight-test managers with the possibility to simulate campaign scenarios is extremely welcome. This tool has {{to take into account the}} inherent characteristics of the flight-test, which are concomitant, asynchronous, parallel and non deterministic. Besides, this tool has to have a graphical, user-friendly interface, in order to make possible a visual modeling technique of the concurrent activities of the tests campaign. It has been searched and found that a previous analysis based in Operation Research followed by the implementation of models based in Colored Petri Net (CPN) and Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) allow for modeling the necessary characteristics mentioned above. This work describes a method based on Petri Nets theory for modeling the problem of flight tests process management for the aircraft certification. Essentially, there is a set of processes, which share a common pool of resources such as prototypes, flight test instrumentation and systems availability. Every process, by its turn, has a subset of processes (test points) that characterizes a hierarchical net. The simulation tool is therefore, an adaptation of the general Petri Net theory for flight test campaign planning and management. This work shows the necessary steps to render the adaptation possible. The designed planning tool has been used in a demonstration environment that represents the basic problems of a real certification flight test program as a case study. Comparing the conditions with and without the tool, it is possible to conclude that the risk of severe mistakes caused by faulty assumptions for time, cost value and safety can be reduced significantly, since a great number of "what if" scenarios can be checked...|$|R

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{considered}} to be a major public health issue worldwide. Despite the large number of effective medication regimens available, patients’ non-compliance in treatment is one of the most common obstacles when attempting to achieve best therapeutic results against osteoporosis. The purpose of this review is to analyze the parameters concerning compliance of osteoporotic patients and to highlight health professionals’ role. Many studies are shown that the compliance in long-term anti-osteoporotic therapeutic schemes is low in developed countries, while it is estimated to be even less in developing countries. Compliance rates are usually lower when the disease is asymptomatic or when the therapy has side effects. There are many factors which lead to <b>non</b> – <b>compliance</b> to treatment regimens, and various techniques that a health professional could utilize in order to improve anti-osteoporotic therapeutic results are presented in this paper. Early identification of potential non-compliant patients is an important first step for health professionals, when aiming at resolving the issue of non-compliance and achieving better therapeutic results. A multi-factor model such as Fracture Liaison Service (FLS), which includes specialized nurses, could optimize the chances of better education, monitoring and achieving treatment compliance for the patient...|$|R
40|$|M Development and Management (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 The dawn of {{democracy}} and adoption of the new constitution heralded in a new political dispensation for South Africa. These development set local government in a new path as various pieces of legislations and policies were passed to transform local government from fragmented and racially – based municipalities into democratic and non – racial entities. Transformation did not end on amalgamation of racial municipal entities and change to racial composition of the administration staff but has to transcend beyond to ensure accountability, transparency, responsive and participation of communities {{in the affairs of}} local government to promote good governance. The Sedibeng District Municipality (SDM) established various structures, systems and processes intend on promoting transformation. However, its process of transformation is limited only to the structure and composition of the administration. Little was done to transform the reigning culture which {{has its roots in the}} apartheid past, despite the existence of policies including the White Paper on the Transforming Public Service Delivery (Batho Pele). Accordingly, the existence of new structures, systems and processes failed to curb corruption in the ranks of Sedibeng District Municipality. Currently, a number of staff members are facing various charges of fraud and corruption. The Auditor – General have found that millions of rands have spent without proper procedure being followed. The state of affairs give indications that existing structures, systems and processes are not solid enough to curb corruption. Furthermore, the situation is accentuated by the municipality’s failure to involve communities in the affairs of the local government. Communities are only used to rubber – stamp processes and programmes that are imposed by the municipality. This renders communities and community organisations useless and ineffective in holding the councillors accountable. Against the background of the problem statement, the hypotheses of the study were formulated as follows: * There is a <b>non</b> – <b>compliance</b> of municipal regulations required for transformation and good governance at Sedibeng District Municipality. * The leadership of the municipality does not possess adequate knowledge and the political will to monitor and ensure consistent adherence to regulations as required by law to promote transformation and good governance. The study utilized both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The study involved a number of techniques to gather information which includes literature study and empirical research. The findings of the study prove that there is a high level <b>non</b> – <b>compliance</b> of municipal regulations required to promote good governance at Sedibeng District Municipality. The responses of senior management also prove that there is a clear lack of leadership in the Sedibeng District Municipality. The study offers significant recommendations to improve the situation. The intend of the study was to explore and open avenue for further research in the field of change management (transformation of behaviour and culture), impact of cadre deployment in municipal performance and idea of public participation and involvement in the affairs of local government.

One of the fields that we absorb is the appearance of modernism and the transition from autocracy to constitution al government and formation of the National Assembly. But constitutionalism in Iran failed, and was replaced with dictatorship. The key question is why did this happen? In this paper we try to answer this question. Perhaps {{one of the most}} important factors in the failure of constitutional was disputes between Parliament and legislative institution. We try to release the context of these disputes. One of the most importan t reseone for challenge between two institutions was the legal context. The legal context means: both sides had no clear conception of their duties and each side accused the other to involvement in the field of their authorities because when the rules had wrote, the duty of each other wasn’t clear. We classify these problems in seven titles. 1 - Separation of powers. 2 - Occupation of Ministers and representatives. 3 - Removal and installation of Ministers. 4 - Undefined political responsibility of ministers. 5 - Law enforcement. 6 - Dissolution of the National Assembly. 7 - Contracts and agreements. In conclusion, it’s very clear that the constitution couldn’t create a balance between powers and due to the weakness and lack of principles integrity, increased confl icts. Besides these problems, the Government and Parliament with <b>non</b> - <b>compliance</b> of legal principles increased the context of the challenges...|$|R
