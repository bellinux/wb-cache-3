50|$|Scale {{modeling}} also {{occurs in}} O and S scales, {{just like in}} HO or <b>N</b> <b>scales,</b> where the <b>modeler</b> tries to create a miniature world that is as realistic as possible. <b>Scale</b> <b>modelers</b> in O and S scales will often avoid, or at least make limited use of, traditional American Flyer and Lionel locomotives and rolling stock since it sometimes was not very true to scale, was lacking in detail, and used oversized knuckle couplers. <b>Scale</b> <b>modelers</b> use O gauge track, but with two rails rather than the three rails used by Lionel, and the trains run on direct current. Numerous standards for track that is more true to scale exist for both O and S scales.|$|R

25|$|In {{the recent}} years {{there has been}} a {{movement}} called 3-Rail Scale. It is three-rail trains on high-rail track, but with scale couplers and other more prototypical details, like fixed pilots and scale wheels. Most 3-Rail <b>scale</b> <b>modelers</b> use Kadee brand scale couplers.|$|R

25|$|<b>N</b> <b>scale</b> {{has a large}} {{worldwide}} following. Models {{are made}} of very many standard gauge prototypes from every continent. <b>N</b> <b>scale's</b> popularity {{is second only to}} that of HO. In Japan, where space in homes is more limited, <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> is the most popular scale, and HO scale is considered large. Not all modellers select N because they have small spaces; some use <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> to build more complex or more visually expansive models.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of railway modeling, some O <b>scale</b> <b>modelers</b> (the {{dominant}} <b>scale</b> at the time), made use of an outside third rail and a shoe pickup system for power. This system had the benefit of being more realistic by removing the central third rail common to O scale track, while retaining an effective power source. As technology progressed, later developments in locomotive and track design would allow for two rail operation, and ultimately obsoleted the practice.|$|R
2500|$|<b>N</b> <b>scale</b> in Australia {{has become}} more popular over the years. Modellers use mainly US, British, and European prototypes because for a long time, the Australian market had no <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> models of local prototype. The {{creation}} of local prototypes is now a flourishing [...] "cottage" [...] industry, making Australia <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> modelling more popular each year.|$|R
5000|$|The Dugu museum models' {{packaging}} {{is intriguing}} and apparently done to mimic other 1:43 <b>scale</b> <b>modelers,</b> {{but also to}} be appropriate for museum sales. The Cisitalia's box panels alternate in blue and yellow {{with the name of}} the museum on the blue sides. The round seal of the museum appears on the end flaps with a representation of the 1899 'first' FIAT. The flat yellow sides of the box show the Cisistalia in profile and the opposite side names the car with bookman-like type font in blue. The overall packaging effect looks more like something from the 1950s than the 1970s.|$|R
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> {{is that it}} allows hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track runs into the same amount of space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they are in HO <b>scale</b> (1:87). While <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> is quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as [...] Z scale is smaller yet at 1:220 and T scale is 1:450 or 1:480. <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> is considered generally compatible with [...] for miniature wargaming.|$|R

25|$|N gauge {{track and}} {{components}} {{are also used}} with larger scales, in particular H0e and 00-9 scale for modelling narrow gauge railways. <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> models on Z scale track are used to model metre gauge (Nn3). A small amount of 2' industrial narrow gauge modelling in <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> using custom track is done, but suppliers of parts are few. Nn18 layouts use T scale track and mechanisms to represent minimum gauge railways. <b>N</b> <b>scale</b> trains and structures are often used on HO or larger layouts to create forced perspective, or the illusion that an object is further away than it actually is.|$|R
