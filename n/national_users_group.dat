It explored opinions of four groups: hikers vs. hunters and pre-designation users vs. post-designation users. Responses of these groups were compared for attribution of perceived resource damage, feelings of crowding, acceptability of management action, and importance of identified monument values to their visit. In addition, characteristics of the users were examined to determine if demographic characteristics accounted for differences in perception toward the resources. Finally, how these groups perceived grazing livestock and multiple uses on the monument was examined. Significant differences were found between most categories in hunters and hikers. Predesignation visitors and post-designation visitors differed only in a few categories...|$|R

50|$|Tim Hartnell (1951-1991) was an Australian journalist, self-taught {{programmer}} {{and extremely}} prolific, bestselling author {{of books and}} magazines on computer games. He set up The <b>National</b> ZX80 <b>User</b> <b>Group</b> with Trevor Sharples in 1980 producing a more-or-less monthly magazine entitled Interface. This <b>User</b> <b>Group</b> then expanded to include the ZX81, Acorn Atom and Spectrum computers, and provided a springboard for Tim and Trevor to launch the first of their home computing books. His company, Interface Publications (set up with Elizabeth North), produced titles {{for all of the}} machines in the home computer market, including Sinclair machines. Hartnell wrote several compendiums of computer games, which typically had several categories of games, with several games in each category. Each category had tips for writing enjoyable games in that genre. Each game had a description of the program and an explanation of its implementation, sometimes with ideas for modifications; this was followed by the raw code, which the reader had to enter into the computer. Some long games, such as Bannochburn Legacy, had more than 500 lines of code.|$|R
50|$|From its launch until June 1986, Dragon User {{appeared}} on the shelves of major newsagents such as WHSmith in a full-colour glossy picture cover. A number of different editors were involved during this initial period, including Brendon Gore, Martin Croft and John Cook. From July 1986, the magazine was available only by subscription and the cover changed to a simple red and black print with a contents listing on the front. Hereafter, Dragon User was edited by Helen Armstrong. In June 1988, publication moved from Sunshine at Little Newport Street, London to Dragon Publications, an operation set up by software producer Bob Harris specifically to continue the magazine. Helen Armstrong remained Editor. This new venture did not last long, however. By the new year, only 1500 {{or so of the}} subscribers had renewed compared to about 2400 the year before. Insufficient money was available to send any further issues to print and so the final Dragon User was the January 1989 issue. Armstrong seemed genuinely surprised by the sudden lack of interest and her final editorial column was a slightly bitter apology to the remaining user base, urging them to support the <b>National</b> Dragon <b>Users</b> <b>Group</b> (NDUG) and the other remaining independent Dragon publications.|$|R

40|$|Script aficionado, {{but most}} of all a warm and gen-erous man who made friends {{wherever}} he went, and who will be remembered with deep affection by all who had the pleasure and privilege of knowing him. In 1988, Kees was {{one of the founders of}} the NTG (Nederlandstalige TEX Gebruikersgroep). He gathered together many other TEX enthusiasts and worked hard on building a network of people and organisations using and experimenting with TEX. Many activities were organised, such as meetings, courses and workshops. Kees persuaded several peo-ple to join him on his trips to BachoTEX and even to Russia, where lots of TEX activity was develop-ing. Bringing together kindred spirits in order to generate even better ideas and develop them into new projects and new products was always on Kees’s mind. He was a true TEX evangelist, and was made an Honorary Life Member of NTG in recognition of the quality and quantity of his contributions to the TEX world at large (his early work included TEX code for typesetting crosswords, Bridge and the Towers of Hanoi; the implementation of stacks and queues in TEX; TEX algorithms for sorting and searching; and many many other ideas as well). In the Netherlands, he (and the NTG) actively supported a project to develop the very first plug & play CD-ROM with TEX software. This turned out to be a giant leap forward by providing a consistent TEX set-up for use both by beginners and experts alike that worked right out of the box. In Poland, Kees was guest of honour at one of the very first GUST (“(Polska) Grupa Użytkowników Systemu TEX ”) conferences, and was formally made an Honorary Life Member of GUST at the AGM which took place during that meeting. Until then, <b>national</b> TEX <b>user</b> <b>group</b> meetings had tended to be just that — national — but BachoTEX set out to be a truly INTERnational <b>user</b> <b>group</b> meeting, and succeeded beyond its wildest dreams. At that time, Kees was working on some exten-sions to manmac, and his talk at the 1994 BachoTEX meeting was entitled “Manmac BLUes”. By 1995, Kees’s work on extending manmac had grown into a complete format, “BLUe’s format”, as Kees called it...|$|R
