The route was designated along County Route 626's length along with County Route 604 as a county-maintained highway, remaining the same until January 1, 1953. On that day, State Highway Route S4C was decommissioned during the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. <b>No</b> <b>number</b> was designated to replace the highway's former number.|$|E

25|$|Other than a {{treatise}} on squares in arithmetic progression by Fibonacci ‚Äî who lived and studied in north Africa and Constantinople during his formative years, ca. 1175‚Äì1200 ‚Äî <b>no</b> <b>number</b> theory {{to speak of}} was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late Renaissance, thanks to a renewed study {{of the works of}} Greek antiquity.

25|$|In mathematics, {{division}} by zero is division {{where the}} divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as a/0 where a is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, {{as there is}} <b>no</b> <b>number</b> which, multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming a‚â†0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 is also undefined; when it is {{the form of a}} limit, it is an indeterminate form. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to a/0 is contained in George Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in The Analyst ("ghosts of departed quantities").|$|E

Representatives denied these allegations by showing a video that showed an untampered signal during the Armenian performance. However, a subsequent EBU investigation found that the Azerbaijani broadcaster, Ictimai TV, had blurred out the number for Armenia's entry and distorted the TV signal when the Armenian contestants were performing on stage. The EBU fined Ictimai TV an undisclosed sum and is said to have threatened to exclude the broadcaster from the competition for up to three years if further infractions of the Eurovision Song Contest rules are made.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have argued}} that self-verification {{processes}} are relatively rare, manifesting themselves only among people with terribly negative self views. In support of this viewpoint, critics cite hundreds of studies indicating that people prefer, seek and value positive evaluations more than negative ones. Such skeptical assessments overlook three important points. First, because most people have relatively positive self-views, evidence of a preference for positive evaluations in unselected samples may in reality reflect a preference for evaluations that are self-verifying, because for such individuals self-verification and positivity strivings are indistinguishable. <b>No</b> <b>number</b> of studies of participants with positive self-views can determine whether self-verification or self-enhancement strivings are more common. Second, self-verification strivings {{are not limited to}} people with globally negative self-views; even people with high self-esteem seek negative evaluations about their flaws. Finally, even people with positive self-views appear to be uncomfortable with overly positive evaluations. For example, people with moderately positive self-views withdraw from spouses who evaluate them in an exceptionally positive manner.|$|E
25|$|The inaugural All-Ireland senior hurling final {{was played}} on Easter Sunday 1888 in Birr, County Offaly. Tipperary and Galway were the opponents, {{with both sides}} vigorously contesting the game from start to finish. Early in the game one of the Thurles players {{received}} facial injuries when he fell on his hurley and had to retire from the game. In a sporting gesture of unrivalled magnitude Galway representatives Meelick withdrew {{one of their own}} players to level the teams. Thurles, the Tipp representatives, scored a point after eleven minutes and led by that score at half-time. With <b>no</b> <b>number</b> of points equaling a goal in those days the destination of the very first All-Ireland hurling title was wide open. At a crucial stage in the second-half, Jim Stapleton lead a charge down the field. The Thurles captain spotted an opening and passed the ball to Tom Healy. Healy made no mistake in sending a low, hard drive {{to the back of the}} Galway net. The game ended shortly afterwards with Tipperary winning on a score line of 1 goal, 1 point and 1 forfeit point to Galway‚Äôs no score.|$|E
