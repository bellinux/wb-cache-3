40|$|For many, Canada’s {{health care}} system is a {{hallmark}} of the Canadian identity. While the Canada Health Act (1984) lays out national standards for hospital and physician services and provides the foundation for Canada’s {{health care system}}, the increasing prominence of <b>non-core</b> <b>services</b> is changing the health policy landscape. While provinces and territories have provided reasonably comparable core services with limited federal leadership, this paper presents evidence revealing significant inter-jurisdictional variability in <b>non-core</b> <b>services.</b> By demonstrating how variations in access to <b>non-core</b> <b>services</b> jeopardize national values of equality and fairness, this paper presents arguments in support of an expanded federal role in the provision and standardization of <b>non-core</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} outsourcing motives, supplier–customer relationship and perceived customer value in <b>non-core</b> <b>services</b> outsourcing. 1, 757 companies were randomly selected. 234 valid questionnaires were returned (13. 4  % response rate). The structural equation method was used to obtain the best fit model. The most significant contribution {{of this study is}} that ‘relationship interaction’ (communication, cooperation, coordination, collaboration, conflict resolution and integration activities) has a greater impact on customer perceived value than ‘relationship quality’ (loyalty and trust) in services outsourcing. The perceived customer value is reflected in improved services quality, reliability and agility rather than the expected cost savings. 28 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|A {{value-added}} service (VAS) {{is a popular}} telecommunications industry term for <b>non-core</b> <b>services,</b> or, in short, all services beyond standard voice calls and fax transmissions. However, {{it can be used}} in any service industry, for services available at little or no cost, to promote their primary business. In the telecommunications industry, on a conceptual level, {{value-added service}}s add value to the standard service offering, [...] subscribers to use their phone more and allowing the operator to drive up their ARPU. For mobile phones, technologies like SMS, MMS and data access were historically usually considered value-added services, but in recent years SMS, MMS and data access have more and more become core services, and VAS therefore has begun to exclude those services.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} growth of the online {{business-to-business}} marketplaces and proposes that intense competition between and among horizontal hubs and vertical exchanges will lead to consolidation. Financial collaborative trading networks (CTNs) would follow as a consequence. CTNs allow collaboration among providers to ensure that customers receive only the best service from network members. To become best-of-breed in their core services, many financial institutions will outsource their <b>non-core</b> <b>services</b> to business service providers (BSPs). BSPs focus on providing best-of-breed back- and middle-office management, freeing institutions to focus on meeting client needs. The ability to outsource will significantly lower barriers to entry into this industry. Consequently, most large financial institutions will find themselves competing with many new financial services industry entrants.

40|$|The {{procurement}} {{of corporate}} property has undergone significant {{change as a}} result of economic reform {{at the end of the}} 1990 ’s. The changing economic climate led business and governments to focus on their property assets.

Australia readily adopted the new market approach. The Federal Government undertook a major property strategy review implementing a user pays market system followed by a comprehensive outsourcing of office property.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the results of}} a research carried out in the outsourced service sector of Facility Management (FM). The objective of the research was to develop a new management model for FM able to enhance the business process performance. The case study of Azienda Servizi Sanitari 1 (ASS 1), a medical service authority, and of the ATI, a temporary joint enterprise which provides <b>non-core</b> <b>services</b> to ASS 1 highlights a discrepancy between the level of service perceived and provided. The research focused on the in-depth analysis of the application of a performance measurement system in the FM. The authors propose the introduction of a Performance Measurement System (PMS), which shares some indicators between the FM service provider and customer in a so-called Global Service (GS) contract. The proposed PMS is an integration of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Service BSC (SBC) suited for the Facility Management service industry...|$|R
