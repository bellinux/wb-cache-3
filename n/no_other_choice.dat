5|$|By {{the early}} third century, {{the balance of}} power had shifted from the Senate to the army, and the {{position}} of the Senate was considerably weakened. The emperor of Rome was appointed by the support of the military, while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority. Both Macrinus and later Elagabalus secured the support of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate. Macrinus was in dire circumstances after Elagabalus' rebellion and had <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>choice</b> but to turn to the Senate for assistance. While in Antioch, Macrinus made one final attempt at securing support, this time from Rome.

Li Shimin led a siege on the city of Luoyang, seat of the self-declared emperor Wang Shichong, who solicited help from Dou Jiande from the east. However, Dou Jiande delayed and when he finally arrived, Li Shimin brought forces to meet the new threat. Li Shimin's army avoided conflict until the troops of Dou Jiande were exhausted and then led a cavalry charge, breaking the opposing army and capturing Dou Jiande. Afterwards, Wang Shichong, seeing <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>choice,</b> surrendered Luoyang, and both his and Dou Jiande's states were absorbed by the Tang.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} in the interest of road pricing. Most studies adopt the static modeling paradigm, typically using either separable monotone or backward-bending link travel time functions for the analysis. In this study, through the shockwave analysis, we show that separable backward-bending functions are not appropriate for modeling hyper-congestion and hence road pricing. In the absence of queue spillback, link travel time is a monotone increasing function of inflow. However, in the presence of queue spillback, we show that the static paradigm even with a monotone travel time function cannot adequately portray the congestion phenomenon. In some cases, the tolls determined by the static paradigm can be even detrimental, worsening rather than alleviating the congestion problem. In the end, to model congested networks properly, perhaps one has <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>choices</b> but to adopt a modeling paradigm that faithfully captures both the temporal as well as the spatial dimensions of traffic queuing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{beginning}} of time magic, religion, medicine and social thought blended into one. Even today, with the highly advanced technologies and techniques, mankind still believes in the methods applied and procedures followed or prescribed by the medical practitioner. This belief in the doctor is {{regarded as one of the}} main reasons why the utilisation patterns of consumers and suppliers of services can often lead to overuse, misuse and abuse. The health care market is complex and differs from the ordinary market for goods and services. The consumers of health care lack full information when decisions are made for them to acquire certain procedures, operations, medicines or any other treatment. The doctor decides what the patient should have or not have and the third-party is responsible for the account. It is therefore essential and in the interests of the patient (the member of the medical scheme), the prescriber of services (the doctor) and the supplier of services (the pharmacist) as well as the third-party payer (the medical scheme) for all these services and goods that the items or services pres­cribed in the first place must be supplied and charged for. Free market principles must be allowed in this highly sophisticated and competitive market where there are <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>choices</b> <b>other</b> than that of demand and supply.
