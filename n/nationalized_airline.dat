It flew {{domestic}} routes until the German invasion of Greece in April, 1941 destroyed the fleet. T.A.E. resumed service {{after the end}} of World War II and flew DC-3 Dakotas until 1951 when the Greek government forced the consolidation of three extant airlines into one new <b>nationalized</b> <b>airline</b> which was called TAE Greek National Airlines.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} operate a {{worldwide}} air logistics system, maximum use {{would have to be}} made of the planes, men, and facilities of the civil airlines. The Ferrying Command was in no position to expand its own military transport services. The Air Corps and the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), representing the domestic carriers, had developed a mobilization plan between 1936 and 1939 to provide this support through contract services. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8974 on 13 December 1941, which gave the Secretary of War authority to <b>nationalize</b> the <b>airlines,</b> but except for several instances early in 1942 to meet specific emergencies, the order was not invoked. ATA president Edgar S. Gorrell, a colonel in the Air Service during World War I and the driving force behind pre-war creation of the mobilization plan, delivered immediate full cooperation of the airlines from {{the first day of the}} war and is credited with persuading Roosevelt not to <b>nationalize</b> the <b>airlines.</b>|$|R

In June, low-cost carrier EasyJet expressed interest in purchasing the airline.|$|R

50|$|When the Government <b>nationalized</b> all <b>airlines</b> {{to create}} NAC in 1947, the Electra service was {{replaced}} by de Havilland DH.89s. Once the new paved runway was created in 1956 along with a new substantial but temporary terminal, Douglas DC-3s began operating. Meanwhile, a local airline, Amphibian Airways had started the Stewart Island route in the early 1950s, using Grumman Widgeons. The amphibians also serviced isolated coastal lighthouses and their settlements. Stewart Island Air Services took over in the late 1970s, and was then taken over by Southern Air in 1981, which still provides the air service to Stewart Island as Stewart Island Flights.|$|R
25|$|Negotiations {{between the}} three flag {{carriers}} started in Copenhagen on 2 February 1946. For Sweden, Aerotransport and SILA had partially opposing opinions about a Scandinavian cooperation. In {{the government and the}} state-owned Aerotransport, it was considered desirable that Sweden operate the route on its own, because of the country's size and its established airline. There was also a conflict, where forces were wanting to merge Aerotransport and SILA, in part to <b>nationalize</b> the intercontinental <b>airline,</b> in part to achieve economy of scale.|$|R
5000|$|The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) {{has been}} making efforts to <b>nationalize</b> the country's <b>airlines.</b> It has {{completed}} mergers with the [...] "Big 3" [...] (Air China, China Eastern and China Southern) and China's smaller, less profitable airlines. The CAAC is concentrating on expanding the number of smaller, single aisle aircraft while phasing out additional wide-body, twin aisle aircraft in the Chinese fleet. CAAC expects the new airlines to improve operating efficiencies and concentrate on developing a modern [...] "hub-and-spoke" [...] air routing system.|$|R
50|$|After the war Aeroput renewed work on 2 July 1945, and {{a general}} meeting of {{shareholders}} elected the first post-war management of the company. The meeting was attended by delegates {{of the new government}} of Democratic Federative Yugoslavia (DFY), and with the participation of then the Head of State Ivan Ribar, who was a pre-war shareholder and board member. However, the later communist government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia adopted a decree prohibiting private joint-stock companies, and on 24 December 1948 Aeroput was liquidated. Its assets were <b>nationalized</b> and the <b>airline</b> continued as Jat Airways.|$|R
50|$|Iambakey {{considered}} his most {{significant contribution to}} the independence process getting elected to the House to assure the needed majority, and helping to persuade other, especially Highlands, Parliamentarians to vote for self-government. Iambakey became the first Minister of Agriculture, where he initiated legislation nationalizing the primary industries, starting with the coffee industry, thus working to reverse the colonial dynamic. His strategy was to reserve a segment of the industry for citizens through legislation; later this strategy was also applied to vegetable marketing and public transportation. When he became Minister for Transport, he <b>nationalized</b> the <b>airlines,</b> Air Niugini, by first initiating the purchase of shares from Ansett, TAA, and Qantas, and then moving to localize the management. He started programs to train citizens for the technical and skilled positions then held by expatriates; he felt the program which was the most symbolic of self-reliance and self-determination was his pilot training program. Because of his aggressive localization efforts, Iambakey was reshuffled three times within one term of office and finally resigned from the administration he had served under when Papua New Guinea gained its independence.|$|R
