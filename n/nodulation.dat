25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} evolution of the genes needed for <b>nodulation</b> is that they were recruited from other pathways after a polyploidy event. Several different pathways have been implicated as donating duplicated genes to the pathways need for <b>nodulation.</b> The main donors to the pathway were the genes associated with the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis genes, the pollen tube formation genes and the haemoglobin genes. One of the main genes shown to be shared between the arbuscular mycorrhiza pathway and the <b>nodulation</b> pathway is SYMRK and it is involved in the plant-bacterial recognition. The pollen tube growth is similar to the infection thread development in that infection threads grow in a polar manner that is similar to a pollen tubes polar growth towards the ovules. Both pathways include the same type of enzymes, pectin-degrading cell wall enzymes. The enzymes needed to reduce nitrogen, nitrogenases, require a substantial input of ATP {{but at the same time}} are sensitive to free oxygen. To meet the requirements of this paradoxical situation, the plants express a type of haemoglobin called leghaemoglobin that is believed to be recruited after a duplication event. These three genetic pathways are believed to be part of a gene duplication event then recruited to work in <b>nodulation.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume <b>nodulation</b> {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the myc factor, which activates the <b>nodulation</b> factor's inducible gene MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing, rhizobial bacteria (Kosuta et al. 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization. Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the nodulations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{information}} is available concerning the mechanisms leading to <b>nodulation.</b> No equivalent of the rhizobial Nod factors have been found, but several genes known {{to participate in the}} formation and functioning of Legume nodules (coding for heamoglobin and other nodulins) [...] are also found in actinorhizal plants where they are supposed to play similar roles. The lack of genetic tools in Frankia and in actinorhizal species was the main factor explaining such a poor understating of this symbiosis, [...] but [...] the recent sequencing of 3 Frankia genomes [...] and the development of RNAi and genomic tools in actinorhizal species [...] should help to a far better understanding in the following years.|$|E
2500|$|As in legumes, <b>nodulation</b> {{is favored}} by {{nitrogen}} deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending {{on the plant}} species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in [...] casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a root hair and {{is followed by the}} formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule. The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in Discaria species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on Frankia becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called actinorhizae. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by Frankia filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.|$|E
2500|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation (BNF, {{performed by the}} organisms called diazotrophs) is a very old process that probably originated in the Archean eon when the primitive atmosphere lacked oxygen. [...] It is only carried out by Euryarchaeota and just 6 {{of the more than}} 50 phyla of bacteria. Some of these lineages co-evolved together with the flowering plants establishing the molecular basis of a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. BNF is carried out in nodules that are mainly located in the root cortex, although they are occasionally located in the stem as in Sesbania rostrata. The spermatophytes that co-evolved with actinorhizal diazotrophs (Frankia) or with rhizobia to establish their symbiotic relationship belong to 11 families contained within the Rosidae clade (as established by the gene molecular phylogeny of rbcL, a gene coding for part of the RuBisCO enzyme in the chloroplast). This grouping indicates that the predisposition for forming nodules probably only arose once in flowering plants and that it can be considered as an ancestral characteristic that has been conserved or lost in certain lineages. However, such a wide distribution of families and genera within this lineage indicates that <b>nodulation</b> had multiple origins. Of the 10 families within the Rosidae, 8 have nodules formed by actinomyces (Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Coriariaceae, Datiscaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Myricaceae, Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae), and the two remaining families, Ulmaceae and Fabaceae have nodules formed by rhizobia.|$|E
50|$|Over 55 {{genes are}} known to be {{associated}} with <b>nodulation.</b> NodD is essential for the expression of the other nod genes. The two different nodD genes are: nodD1 and nodD2. Only nodD1 is needed for successful <b>nodulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Nodulation</b> is {{controlled}} {{by a variety of}} processes, both external (heat, acidic soils, drought, nitrate) and internal (autoregulation of <b>nodulation,</b> ethylene). Autoregulation of <b>nodulation</b> controls nodule numbers per plant through a systemic process involving the leaf. Leaf tissue senses the early <b>nodulation</b> events in the root through an unknown chemical signal, then restricts further nodule development in newly developing root tissue. The Leucine rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases (NARK in soybean (Glycine max); HAR1 in Lotus japonicus, SUNN in Medicago truncatula) are essential for autoregulation of <b>nodulation</b> (AON). Mutation leading to loss of function in these AON receptor kinases leads to supernodulation or hypernodulation. Often root growth abnormalities accompany the loss of AON receptor kinase activity, suggesting that nodule growth and root development are functionally linked. Investigations into the mechanisms of nodule formation showed that the ENOD40 gene, coding for a 12-13 amino acid protein 41, is up-regulated during nodule formation 3.|$|E

50|$|William Albrecht first theorised that crops {{grown on}} 'unbalanced' soils are of lower {{nutritional}} value, based on studying {{the habits of}} grazing cattle - noting in particular their avoidance of the lush grass that grew on dung patches. A study he conducted with G.E. Smith is cited by proponents of BCSR theory, but has been criticised {{for a variety of}} reasons, chief of which being that the pH of the soil was not controlled, since Albrecht did not believe pH to be important. Thus, the increases in root <b>nodulation</b> of legumes (and subsequent increases in yield) that he associated with calcium levels were likely due to the increases in pH, which is known to free up Molybdenum, a micronutrient essential for root <b>nodulation</b> to occur. Legumes are an important source of protein in grazing animals, hence, other studies that show an increase in cattle health from calcium applications to pastures are likely due to the increase in pH and the subsequent increase in legume populations.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} Gleditsia to fix {{nitrogen}} is disputed. Many scientific sources clearly state that Gleditsia does not fix nitrogen.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of harvest, seeds show high {{nitrogen}} contents, but some remains in leaves, providing a nitrogen-rich straw {{which can be used}} for animal feeding or as fertilizer, if the plant material is incorporated into the soil. In one season, 67 kg N/ha were taken up by roots and seeds. This nitrogen is mainly provided by the inoculation with efficient bacterial strains. The P. ahipa plant is therefore able to form an efficient symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, and is able to fix 58-80 kg nitrogen per hectare. No further supply of nitrogen fertilizer is needed. [...] If the vegetative aboveground parts are left in the field, a substantial amount of the fixed nitrogen is returned to the soil, about 12-80 kg N/ha. The enrichment is very important if a sustainable land-use system is desired. During <b>nodulation,</b> an increased phosphorus supply is advantageous, because <b>nodulation</b> can be improved. Further, it promotes the root and seed yield in P. ahipa plants. The final recipients of P are the pod shells, as well as the seeds. In total, about 7-9.6 kg P/ha were extracted from the soil. At harvest, the highest potassium contents can be found in pod shells and the roots. The removal of K at harvest was about 20.2 kg K/ha.|$|E
50|$|The dual {{inoculation}} of S. rostrata with Glomus mosseae and Azorhizobium caulinodans {{has been}} shown to increase plant height, as well as concentration and uptake of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in shoots and roots. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAM) increases P uptake in plants even in soils low in P. The symbiosis between a leguminous tree, Rhizobium and mycorrhizal fungi, increases <b>nodulation,</b> nitrogen fixation, and growth. N-fixation needs an optimal and constant supply of P to the root and nodules. Due to the low P availability in tropical soils this application would be especially useful in the tropics.|$|E

They proved that some nod genes encode enzymes that synthesize Nod Factor. They discovered that plant root hair cells show rapid ionic changes including calcium spiking in response to specific Nod Factors.

50|$|Smr35B {{expression}} was first assessed by del Val et al. in S. meliloti 1021 under different biological conditions; i.e. bacterial growth in TY, minimal medium (MM) and luteolin-MM broth and endosymbiotic bacteria (i.e. mature symbiotic alfalfa nodules). Expression of Smr35B in free-living bacteria {{was found to}} be growth-dependent, being the gene down-regulated when bacteria entered the stationary phase. Supplementation of MM with luteolin, the plant flavone that specifically induces transcription of the S. meliloti <b>nodulation</b> genes, stimulated the expression of Smr35B by ~4 fold. In contrast, the Smr35B transcript was not detected in mature nodule tissues. Schl√ºter et al. further described up-regulation of Smr35B upon an osmotic upshift.|$|E
