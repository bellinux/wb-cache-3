5|$|The band's {{record deal}} was {{relatively}} poor for the time: a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and <b>no</b> <b>free</b> studio time.

5|$|North Korea {{has set up}} {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is a}} national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is <b>no</b> <b>free</b> of charge smoking cessation quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in cessation, including cessation programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking cessation aids.|$|E

5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing <b>no</b> <b>free</b> creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
5|$|Gulfton {{residents}} are zoned to Margaret Long Wisdom High School (formerly Robert E. Lee High School), {{which opened in}} 1962 to relieve Lamar High School, with Lamar and Westside high schools as options. Most Gulfton high school-aged residents attend Wisdom High School. When it opened, Wisdom High School had mainly affluent white students; its demographics shifted to a mostly Hispanic and immigrant student body. In September 1991 Wisdom was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments, and excess students had to attend other schools. When Westside opened in 2000, residents of the Wisdom attendance boundary gained the option to attend Westside instead of Wisdom, with <b>no</b> <b>free</b> transportation provided. By 2004 three {{out of every four}} Wisdom students were born to non-English-speaking households.|$|E
5|$|NYC Ferry {{was officially}} {{announced}} by the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015. It was planned to launch in two phases. The first phase launched on May 1, 2017, with service along the East River and to the Rockaways. Routes to Bay Ridge and Astoria respectively started in June and August of that year. A second phase, in 2018, will launch to the Lower East Side and Soundview. A ferry to Coney Island and Stapleton is under consideration. Single-ride trips on the system cost $2.75, with monthly and bike fares also available, but there is <b>no</b> <b>free</b> transfer to other modes of transport in the city. NYC Ferry also provides free shuttle buses in the Rockaways, connecting to the ferry stop there.|$|E

40|$|The main {{result of}} the paper is {{a version of the}} {{fundamental}} theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) for large financial markets based on an asymptotic concept of <b>no</b> market <b>free</b> lunch for monotone concave preferences. The proof uses methods from the theory of Orlicz spaces. Moreover, various notions of no asymptotic arbitrage are characterized in terms of <b>no</b> asymptotic market <b>free</b> lunch; the difference lies in the set of utilities.

5|$|Tour dates {{were limited}} to cities in Europe and North America. This {{decision}} caused some resentment among fans {{in other parts of}} the world. Drowned World became the first (and only) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely. For many weeks prior to the launch of the tour dates, Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between the Sunrise, Atlanta, and Detroit dates, though <b>no</b> <b>free</b> bookings were available. In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto, to the disappointment of many Canadian fans. Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25, as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in record time– six shows in six hours. Madonna made history with the fastest-selling show ever at Earl's Court, as 97,000 tickets were sold.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping {{because it was the only}} available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with <b>no</b> <b>free</b> computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E
