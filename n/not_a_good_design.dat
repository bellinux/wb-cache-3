40|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} technical college is those teachers own sufficient practical experiences, especially {{in most of}} the developed countries. But there is no such requirement for staffing a new teacher in the technical colleges in Taiwan. Therefore the formal training which is held by the government becomes a necessary tool for teachers. This paper explores the following research questions:(1) What are the characteristics of formal training for the teachers in technical colleges in Taiwan?(2) What are the related problems for such training process? Some representative results include:(1) Only provide 300 to 350 persons per year for all of the 18, 400 teachers. (2) Only provide 3 to 5 days training courses, not include long time professional training one. (3) Those activities is not suitable for the trend of economic in Taiwan. (4) There is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> of curriculum, especially lack of mechanism of assessment. Key words:formal training, technical college I...|$|E
40|$|In many service, production, {{and traffic}} systems there are {{multiple}} types of customers requiring different types of servers, i. e., different services, products, or routes. Often, however, a proportion of the customers are flexible, i. e., {{they are willing to}} change their type in order to achieve faster service, and even if this proportion is small, ithas the potential of achieving large performance gains. We study partial flexibility in multi-server queueing systems. Some (dedicated) arrivals are obliged to use a particular station, while others (flexible) have the ability to use any of the stations. We first consider the optimal routing policy for the flexible customers under various settings. Flexible customers should be routed by the decision maker to one of queues upon arrival. When the only information available upon arrival is the queue lengths, then "Join the Shortest Queue" (JSQ) {{has been shown to be}} optimal in a variety of contexts. We generalize earlier results on the optimality of "Join the Shortest Queue" for flexible arrivals to the following: arbitrary arrivals where only a subset are flexible, multiple-server stations, and abandonments. Our optimality results are very strong; we minimize the queue length process in the weak majorization sense. When the actual workload at each queue is known upon arrival but the required work of the arriving customer is unknown, we show that routing flexible customers to the queue with the shortest workload, known in the literature as the "Join the Shortest Work" (JSW) policy, is optimal for general arrival and service processes. Secondly, we study the scheduling problem in an alternate design where the flexible customers have a separate queue to wait. We show that the optimal scheduling policy is "Dedicated Customers First" (DCF) policy under various settings. This design is better than the routing design in terms of system performance; however it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> in terms of fairness, because flexible customers face long waiting times. Finally we consider the marginal impact of customer flexibility. We present our new results showing that the stationary expected waiting time is decreasing and convex in the proportion of flexible customers. Although convexity in the proportion of flexible customers is intuitive, it does not hold in the strong sense that monotonicity holds, and it is surprisingly difficult to prove. We develop a new approach that combines marginal analysis with coupling to show convexity in the stationary mean waiting time. Our results reinforce the idea that a little flexibility goes a long way...|$|E

50|$|For {{those who}} are {{electronically}} inclined, the low-power and fairly simple nature of the headphone amplifier has made it a popular DIY project. There are many designs for headphone amplifiers posted on the Internet varying considerably in complexity and cost. A key example is the simple opamp-based CMoy design, {{one of the most}} popular headphone amplifier designs available. The simplicity of the CMoy makes it an easy build, while it can be made small enough to fit inside a tin of breath mints (including batteries). On the other hand, it is often built using op-amps that are not designed to drive loads as low as headphones, leading to poor performance and audible differences between op-amps that would <b>not</b> exist in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design.</b>|$|R
40|$|Walking and bicycling are {{relatively}} easy ways {{for the growing}} group of older adults to be physically active. The built environment may facilitate or restrict participation in walking and bicycling trips. A study was done to describe aspects of participation in walking and bicycling activities and to explore their role for various segments of the aging population. Specifically, the effect of environmental characteristics, various types of land use, and degree of urbanization on participation in walking and bicycling, for both leisure and transportation, was examined. Detailed individual travel data were correlated with objectively defined environmental attributes. The results show that people make more walking trips in more highly urbanized areas, whereas they use their bikes more often in less-urbanized areas. A significant effect was found {{for the impact of}} total surface of recreation areas on both types of physical activity. Specifically, highly urbanized neighborhoods with a low percentage of recreation and green areas are related to physical inactivity.

40|$|Software can be {{considered}} a live entity, as it undergoes many alterations throughout its lifecycle. Furthermore, developers do <b>not</b> usually retain <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>design</b> in favor of adding new features, comply with requirements or meet deadlines. For these reasons, code can become rather complex and difficult to understand. More particularly in object-oriented systems, classes may become very large and less cohesive. In order to identify such problematic cases, existing approaches have proposed the use of cohesion metrics. However, while metrics can identify classes with low cohesion, they cannot identify new or independent concepts. Moreover, these methods require a lot of human interpretation to identify the respective design flaws. In this paper, we propose a class decomposition method using an agglomerative clustering algorithm based on the Jaccard distance between class members. Our methodology is able to identify new concepts and rank the solutions according to their impact on the design quality of the system. Finally, our method has been evaluated by two independent designers who were asked to comment on the suggestions produced by our technique on their projects. The designers provided feedback on the ability of the method to identify new concepts and improve the design quality of the system in terms of cohesion. 1...|$|R
