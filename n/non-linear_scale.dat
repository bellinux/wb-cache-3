40|$|AbstractAccurate muscle {{geometry}} for musculoskeletal {{models is}} important to enable accurate subject-specific simulations. Commonly, linear scaling is used to obtain individualised muscle geometry. More advanced methods include <b>non-linear</b> <b>scaling</b> using segmented bone surfaces and manual or semi-automatic digitisation of muscle paths from medical images. In this study, a new <b>scaling</b> method combining <b>non-linear</b> <b>scaling</b> with reconstructions of bone surfaces using statistical shape modelling is presented. Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) of femur and tibia/fibula were used to reconstruct bone surfaces of nine subjects. Reference models were created by morphing manually digitised muscle paths to mean shapes of the SSMs using non-linear transformations and inter-subject variability was calculated. Subject-specific models of muscle attachment and via points were created from three reference models. The accuracy was evaluated by calculating {{the differences between the}} scaled and manually digitised models. The points defining the muscle paths showed large inter-subject variability at the thigh and shank – up to 26 mm; this was found to limit the accuracy of all studied scaling methods. Errors for the subject-specific muscle point reconstructions of the thigh could be decreased by 9 % to 20 % by using the <b>non-linear</b> <b>scaling</b> compared to a typical linear scaling method. We conclude that the proposed <b>non-linear</b> <b>scaling</b> method is more accurate than linear scaling methods.

40|$|We propose an {{alternative}} to particle dark matter that borrows ingredients of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) while adding new key components. The first new feature is a dark matter fluid, {{in the form of}} a scalar field with small equation of state and sound speed. This component is critical in reproducing the success of cold dark matter for the expansion history and the growth of linear perturbations, but does not cluster significantly on <b>non-linear</b> <b>scales.</b> Instead, the missing mass problem on <b>non-linear</b> <b>scales</b> is addressed by a modification of the gravitational force law. The force law approximates MOND at large and intermediate accelerations, and therefore reproduces the empirical success of MOND at fitting galactic rotation curves. At ultra-low accelerations, the force law reverts to an inverse-square-law, albeit with a larger Newton’s constant. This latter regime is important in galaxy clusters and is consistent with their observed isothermal profiles. We present an explicit relativistic theory in terms of two scalar fields. The first scalar field is governed by a Dirac-Born-Infeld action and behaves as a dark matter fluid on large scales. The second scalar field also has single-derivative interactions and mediates a fifth force that modifies gravity on <b>non-linear</b> <b>scales.</b> Both scalars are coupled to matter via an effective metric that depends locally on the fields. The form of this effective metric implies the equality of the two scalar gravitational potentials, which ensures that lensing and dynamical mass estimates agree. ...|$|R

We proceed firstly by identifying the necessary operators which need to be included in the effective field theory Lagrangian in order to go beyond the linear order in perturbations and then we construct the corresponding non-linear action. Moreover, we present the complete recipe to map any single field dark energy and modified gravity models into the non-linear effective field theory framework by considering a general action in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. In order to illustrate this recipe we proceed to map the beyond-Horndeski theory and low-energy Horava gravity into the effective field theory formalism. As a final step we derived the 4 th order action in term of the curvature perturbation. This allowed us to identify the non-linear contributions coming from the linear order perturbations which at the next order act like source terms. Moreover, we confirm that the stability requirements, ensuring the positivity of the kinetic term and the speed of propagation for scalar mode, are automatically satisfied once the viability of the theory is demanded at linear level.

This addresses a possible deficiency in uses of PT to compute clustering on the weakly non-linear scales that will be critical for probing dark energy. Specifically, I show how to derive a non-negligible value for the (initially tiny) velocity dispersion of dark matter particles,, where δ v is the deviation of particle velocities from the local bulk flow. The calculation is essentially a renormalization of the homogeneous (zero order) dispersion by fluctuations 1 st order in the initial power spectrum. For power law power spectra with n>- 3, the small-scale fluctuations diverge and significant dispersion can be generated from an arbitrarily small starting value [...] the dispersion level is set by an equilibrium between fluctuations generating more dispersion and dispersion suppressing fluctuations. For an n=- 1. 4 power law normalized to match the present <b>non-linear</b> <b>scale,</b> the dispersion would be 100 km/s. This n corresponds roughly to the slope on the <b>non-linear</b> <b>scale</b> in the real Universe, but contains much less initial small-scale power [...] not enough to bootstrap the small starting dispersion up to a significant value within linear theory (viewed very broadly, structure formation has actually taken place rather suddenly and recently, in spite of the usual "hierarchical" description).

The linguistic hedges are used and applied on the tuned MFs as discussed in [40 – 42]. The main linguistic hedges are as follows: very, more-or-less, extremely, very-very, positively, and negatively. Linguistic hedges are playing the role of adjectives and adverbs in the languages responsible for changing the qualitative linguistic statements.|$|R
40|$|I discuss new results {{concerning}} {{the evolution of}} the bispectrum due to gravitational instability from gaussian initial conditions using one-loop perturbation theory (PT). Particular attention is paid to the transition from weakly <b>non-linear</b> <b>scales</b> to the <b>non-linear</b> regime at small scales. Comparison with numerical simulations is made to assess the regime of validity of the perturbative approach.
