5|$|Ernest and Ruth {{promoted}} millennialist teachings, {{holding that}} higher beings were {{to transform the}} Earth and bring devotees to a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of existence; the couple held that this growth would allow people to travel through space. Zeller compares their millennialist doctrines to those of Christian dispensationalism, noting their shared utopian views.|$|E
5|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} one of Hitchcock's best films and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars. Often ranked among the greatest films of all time, it set a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films, and is widely {{considered to be the}} earliest example of the slasher film genre.|$|E

5|$|As the {{character}} progresses through the game, experience points (XP) are earned from accomplishing various actions, such as completing a quest, killing an enemy, and so forth, with a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> granted upon reaching the necessary amount of XP. A <b>new</b> <b>level</b> grants the player {{the ability to}} allocate points to the various Skills available and thus improve upon them, making them more effective; for instance, a higher lock-picking skill allows the player {{to be able to}} tackle more difficult locks on doors and containers, while a higher medicine skill increases the amount of health recovered with Stimpaks. Once {{the character}} achieves their second level, they can be granted a Perk, which offers advantages of varying quality and form, such as being able to carry more items, finding more ammo in containers, and having a higher chance to perform a critical hit. Many Perks have a set of prerequisites that need to be satisfied, often requiring a certain Skill level to acquire them, while a new Perk can be granted for every two levels earned by the character. Additional improvements to Skill levels can be made by finding Skill books, which confer a permanent boost to levels, while players can also search for and find a series of around 20 bobbleheads that also confer a bonus to these and also primary attributes.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in India, Mauritius, and Scotland, {{this was}} Karan Johar's directorial debut. One of his {{goals for the}} film was to set a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> for style in Hindi cinema. The plot {{combines}} two love triangles set years apart. The first half covers friends on a college campus, while the second {{tells the story of}} a widower's young daughter who tries to reunite her dad with his old friend.|$|E

A number of other applications and downloads are available at the official LaserTank website.|$|R
5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, {{and the use of}} glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} to a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists {{almost entirely of}} the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the band}} was joined by vocalist Mark Lanegan, and {{released}} their third album, Songs for the Deaf in 2002. The album brought the band to a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of commercial success, and a full-fledged tour followed {{in support of the}} album. Queens of the Stone Age released a follow-up album, Lullabies to Paralyze, in 2005. The album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 97,000 copies during its first week. Two years later, the band released its fifth studio album, Era Vulgaris, which debuted and peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard 200.|$|E

5|$|In April–May 1970, Fischer won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10−1=6), by a {{two-point}} margin, {{ahead of}} Gligorić, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian. In July–August, Fischer crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3½-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13−0=4). Fischer then played first {{board for the}} U.S. Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8−1=4), with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky. Right after the Olympiad, Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen. Fischer had taken his game to a <b>new</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Oblivion, {{released}} in 1992, brought the band to a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of commercial success, and the Screaming Trees found itself amidst the sudden {{popularity of the}} Seattle music scene. In 1996, the band released its seventh studio album, Dust; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by Sweet Oblivion. Screaming Trees disbanded in 2000 due to conflicts among the members regarding the band's creative direction.|$|E

5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four more freely structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions to a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines {{the structure of the}} work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{entered a}} <b>new</b> <b>level</b> {{following}} {{the release of}} Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{reached a}} <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of {{visibility}} during 1993 {{as part of}} a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal of a tree on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage of the protest was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security blunder, became occupied by squatters.|$|E

There are a total of 24 extra levels to unlock.|$|R

The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Twin Peaks {{centers on}} the {{investigation}} into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named. In this episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) tells Sheriff Truman (Ontkean) and his deputies about a unique method of narrowing down the suspects in Palmer's death. Meanwhile, Cooper's cynical colleague Albert Rosenfield (Ferrer) arrives in town, and Cooper has a strange dream that elevates the murder investigation to a <b>new</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, there was a <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, {{as well as in}} his public appearances and interviews.|$|E
