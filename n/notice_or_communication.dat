50|$|Hand-waving is an idiomatic metaphor, derived in {{part from}} the use of {{excessive}} gesticulation, perceived as unproductive, distracting <b>or</b> nervous, in <b>communication</b> <b>or</b> other effort. The term also evokes the sleight-of-hand distraction techniques of stage magic, and suggests that the speaker or writer seems to believe that if they, figuratively speaking, simply wave their hands, no one will <b>notice</b> <b>or</b> speak up about the holes in the reasoning. This implication of misleading intent has been reinforced by the pop-culture influence of the Star Wars franchise, in which mystically powerful hand-waving is fictionally used for mind control, and some uses of the term in public discourse are explicit Star Wars references.|$|R
