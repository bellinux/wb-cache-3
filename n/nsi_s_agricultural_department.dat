The documents are concurrently used for the Agriculture Incentive Grant review process at Indio High School conducted by representatives of the California Department of Education. The curriculum and supporting documents created during the internship validate the science curriculum taught within the Agriculture Department. All curricula was written and aligned to both the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core Standards as well as keeping the California Career Technical Education Standards in mind. Part 1 of this project involves an in-depth study of Indio High School 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Department</b> as to how well the department meets the Quality Criteria.

40|$|As {{stated in}} "Global Models and Global Mechanisms I," the {{situation}} of social science [...] described for the economic sector in H. Leontieff's amazing paper, "Theoretical Assumptions and Nonobserved Facts," [...] {{is reflected in the}} state-of-the-art of world models. An impressive, intellectual effort and highly sophisticated mathematical methods are applied to handle complex sets of some hundred or thousand equations, while the structure of the whole model is mainly based on "theoretical assumptions and unobserved facts. " The corresponding, poor empirical evidence is not even improved by the use of some ten thousand or hundred thousand statistical data structured according to nonverified assumptions. For example, at the Third IIASA Global Modeling Conference on Food and Agriculture, decisive questions remained unresolved, i. e., diminishing returns of fertilizer in agricultural production; human capital as an important source of increasing productivity; the ecological capacity of rivers for agro-chemical pollutions. The reason for this being a lack of empirical observations, or even a lack of knowledge of existing empirical observations (e. g. observation of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Department</b> on diminishing returns of fertilizers). The deficiencies in the Models caused by the lack of behavioral equations, which should be sufficiently based on empirical observations, cannot be offset even by the highest sophisticated theoretical methods if the model builder claims that the model reflects the part of reality relevant for the question which is asked and if the decision makers should apply this to their questions. This is no way to solve their problems without an intensive effort in empirical investigations for interaction with theoretical considerations. Applied systems analysis also needs the hard empirical work. The learning process in an iterative empirical [...] theoretical research-strategy leading to a step-by-step approximation between model and reality is described in Part I of "Global Models and Global Mechanisms: Methodological Considerations. " The results of an application of this methodology to the question of long term economic development is presented in Part II. The following paper outlines how the methodology can be applied to other questions and how these questions are connected to the concept of the General Production Function as a basis for interdisciplinary research, leading to a framework of consistent global mechanisms which can be used as empirically tested behavioral equations for global models...|$|R

40|$|Negotiations {{to create}} the largest single market in the world, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), are in progress. Such an {{agreement}} could have significant effects on U.

The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> trade with Western Hemisphere countries and to determine the effects of hemisphere-wide trade liberalization. The Western Hemisphere contains important sources for U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> imports and important markets for U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> exports, though the hemisphere has been more important as a source for imports than as a market for exports. Results suggest that U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> exports within the hemisphere are positively influenced by real GDP in the importing country and negatively influenced by the strength of the U. S. dollar and tariffs in importing countries. U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> imports are positively affected by the strength of the U. S. dollar and negatively affected by U. S. tariffs. A reduction in tariffs under the FTAA would have a greater effect on U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> exports than it would on U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> imports because tariffs are generally larger in other countries and food consumption is more price sensitive in other countries.

Thus, any biotech policy changes by key importing countries may affect U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> biotech product exports. This article identifies key markets for U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> exports including biotech commodities and discusses current and proposed biotech policies in key markets for U. <b>S.</b> <b>agricultural</b> exports focusing on Canada, Mexico, Japan, the European Union (EU), and China. Among these markets, labeling of biotech products is voluntary in Canada and Mexico but is mandatory in Japan, the EU, and, most recently, in China. For the EU, U.
