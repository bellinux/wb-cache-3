5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E

[...] Or he might say, [...] "Having <b>nothing</b> particular <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to-morrow--why shouldn't we get the marriage license?" [...] Would he put it in that way?

5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It {{is argued that}} {{the teaching of evolution}} degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with its objective empirical reality.|$|E
5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels.

5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated {{it might be}} an arrowhead {{that had been embedded}} in its back.

5|$|The smaller {{of the two}} cocks-of-the-rock, {{the male}} Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is {{polygynous}} and has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it.
