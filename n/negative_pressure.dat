5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an air leak, various options are available. <b>Negative</b> <b>pressure</b> suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E

5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E

The police fear that a cult-involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them know he would die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} carried out in order to study the single and dual {{rectangular}} crossflow jets injected from a flat plate perpendicular to a free stream. The length-to-width ratio of the jets was 3. 97, and the spacing between the center lines was 4. 7 times {{the width of a}} single jet. Surface pressure distributions were obtained for jet-to-freestream velocity ratios of 2. 2 and 4, respectively. The following conclusions are offered {{on the basis of the}} experimental results: (1) the downstream extension of the <b>negative</b> <b>pressures</b> is extended to the dual jets in comparison to the single jet; (2) by increasing the jet-to-freestream velocity ratio the downstream extension of <b>negative</b> <b>pressures</b> is reduced, but <b>negative</b> upstream <b>pressures</b> become larger; (3) very high peak <b>negative</b> <b>pressures</b> occur at the front side edges of the rectangular jets compared to round jets.

5|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{believed}} to be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface tension}} of water {{explains}} why the water does not drain out of a wet sand castle or a moist ball of clay. <b>Negative</b> water <b>pressures</b> make the water stick to the particles and pull the particles to each other, friction at the particle contacts make a sand castle stable. But {{as soon as a}} wet sand castle is submerged below a free water surface, the <b>negative</b> <b>pressures</b> are lost and the castle collapses. Considering the effective stress equation, , if the water <b>pressure</b> is <b>negative,</b> the effective stress may be positive, even on a free surface (a surface where the total normal stress is zero). The <b>negative</b> pore <b>pressure</b> pulls the particles together and causes compressive particle to particle contact forces. <b>Negative</b> pore <b>pressures</b> in clayey soil can be much more powerful than those in sand. <b>Negative</b> pore <b>pressures</b> explain why clay soils shrink when they dry and swell as they are wetted. The swelling and shrinkage can cause major distress, especially to light structures and roads.|$|R

5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their {{evolutionary}} {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
30|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{is a vital}} tool {{to simulate}} and characterize the importance of disjoining force effects {{on the existence of}} <b>negative</b> <b>pressures</b> in liquids at the nanoscale. It can also provide means to compare the strength of disjoining and capillary forces at such small scales, which has not yet been possible via experiments. Although <b>negative</b> liquid <b>pressure</b> has been experimentally shown for water, it should theoretically exist in other liquids as well. With this aim, we simulated two cases of nanoscale meniscus evaporation of liquid argon on platinum wall using molecular dynamics simulation.

5|$|The typical hunting {{strategy}} of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor, landing atop any prey encountered. It then quickly levers its body up-and-down with its disc, producing <b>negative</b> <b>pressure</b> to extract the prey from its burrow. This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water, so as to uncover buried prey. Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes, including Mexican hogfish (Bodianus diplotaenia), Galapagos porgies (Calamus taurinus), greybar grunts (Haemulon sexfasciatum), spinster wrasses (Halichoeres nichols), and long-spine porcupinefish (Diodon holocanthus), which {{take advantage of the}} invertebrates stirred up by the ray's activities. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi, A. dasi, A. rajivi, and A. soberoni, Anthocephalum currani, Parachristianella tiygonis, and Pseudochristianello elegantissima, the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana, and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni.|$|E
