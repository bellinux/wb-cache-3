5|$|Altar 6 is a plain {{monument}} {{that was}} found in Group 21 together with Stela 10. Like its associated stela it had been moved from its original location in antiquity but was probably <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> far.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the {{government}} went before Moskowitz seeking summary judgement. The case turned {{on whether the}} KD II was a fishing vessel under the SFPA. Early in 2005 he issued his ruling, holding that while it was not directly engaged in fishing it was nevertheless engaging in activities supporting fishing and thus also subject to the SFPA. He did not grant the forfeiture as NOAA had <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> for it yet.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson {{exercised}} an option of his lease allowing him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand was {{a complex}} plan, {{involving}} misinformation and extensive physical deception. The underlying plot was the Allied forces had been {{surprised to find}} the Germans had <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> forces from the Mediterranean to re-inforce Normandy. Therefore, plans to invade southern France and the Balkans were looking less appealing. Instead the Allied commanders had decided to focus all of their resources on the Italian campaign. The real force assigned to Dragoon, the US VI Corps, would land in Genoa. Meanwhile, notional formations, such as the Seventh Army and the British 5th Airborne Division would support pushes along the Italian front and threaten targets in the Balkans. Ferdinand also recycled some of Zeppelin's threats against Turkey with the fictional British Ninth and Twelfth Armies.|$|E

5|$|In {{denial about}} the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the units {{commanded}} by Waffen-SS General Felix Steiner, the Armeeabteilung Steiner ("Army Detachment Steiner"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner {{to attack the}} northern flank of the encircling Soviet salient and ordered the German Ninth Army, south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a pincer attack. By that evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin. At his afternoon situation conference on 22 April, Hitler was told Steiner's forces had <b>not</b> <b>moved.</b> Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack {{was not going to}} be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lostâ€”and blamed his generals. He announced he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.|$|E
5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area. Those that were <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} initial routes to be routed through the Metro Bus Tunnel in Downtown Seattle, but due to a delay in the {{production}} of special dual-mode buses for the tunnel, route 41 was <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> into the tunnel until 1991. Route 41 ran primarily during peak hours, with some limited midday service, and was supplemented by route 307, which ran from Downtown Seattle to Northgate and Bothell on weekends and nights. The northern terminus of route 41 was moved from Magnuson Park to 5th Avenue NE and NE 125th Street in 1997, eliminating service to Sand Point and Lake City.|$|E

5|$|The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) {{selected}} Chicago over Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco as its candidate city to {{host the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympics on April 14, 2007. This is the city's third failure, after two failed attempts for the 1952 and the 1956 Summer Olympics (and fourth overall attempt, as Chicago won the 1904 Olympics, but they were moved to St Louis as the World's Fair was there and threatened to host a competing competition if the Olympics were <b>not</b> <b>moved).</b> Numerous Olympic Games in North America, including the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hurt Chicago's bid. It {{would have been the}} ninth Olympics hosted in the United States, after the 1904, 1932, 1984 and 1996 Summer Olympics; and the 1932, 1960, 1980 and 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|School ran {{at various}} times at localities near Meander including: Montana; Golden Valley; Western Creek; and Jacky's Marsh. A school opened on a {{property}} known as Cheshunt in 1907, as the Springdale School. In 1919 it was moved to Montana, and renamed Montana School in 1923. The building burned down December 1926. During rebuilding some students were educated at the Montana Baptist church, others at the school at Meander. The school closed in 1944, by which time there were only seven students. The Montana school building was moved {{to be part of}} the Meander School in 1947â€“48. A school was run at Golden Valley from 1870 to 1945, initially as a 1/2-day school. During most of its life it had around 30 students. After closing the school building was relocated to Meander School. Western Creek had a school from 1893 to 1938. After it closed some students attended Meander's school, but others moved to schools at Mole Creek and Deloraine. Unlike other schools in the area the building was <b>not</b> <b>moved</b> to Meander but instead to Mole Creek's school. Children from Jacky's Marsh travelled to Meander for schooling until 1900 when the Jacky's Marsh school opened. The school was closed 1910â€“22 and finally closed in 1937. The school building was moved to Meander c1940. From the 1940s school buses brought children from Jacky's Marsh, Montana, Huntsman, Western creek and other nearby areas.|$|E

5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4â€“14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were <b>not</b> <b>moved,</b> and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E
