However, after a few poorly attended games showed that fans had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league, Ottawa and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA. Ottawa, the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and Ottawa won in 1911 and 1915.|$|E

5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations {{but to do so}} when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance.

5|$|When the 20-year-old Sue Ellen Shepard {{wins the}} title of Miss Texas in 1967, she meets her future husband, J.R. Ewing, who is a judge for the pageant. After a courtship, they marry on February 15, 1970, but after several years, their {{marriage}} deteriorates, {{due in large part}} to J.R.'s numerous extramarital affairs and his disinterest in her. In 1978, a lonely Sue Ellen begins an affair with J.R.'s nemesis, Cliff Barnes. Shortly thereafter, Sue Ellen finds herself pregnant and believes that Cliff is the father because she and J.R. had been married for years without conceiving, and by this point, they barely had marital relations. Sue Ellen believes she loves Cliff, but is unable to leave J.R. To console herself, she starts drinking heavily during her pregnancy. Worried about the safety of her unborn child, J.R. has Sue Ellen committed to a sanitarium in 1979, to gain sobriety. However, Sue Ellen manages to continue drinking and escapes from the sanitarium drunk and crashes a car. While in the hospital, she gives birth to a son, John Ross Ewing III. After her son's birth, Sue Ellen becomes severely depressed and shows <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> child.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Kabuto's defeat and needing answers, Sasuke exposes Orochimaru's survival as the Cursed Seals are revealed to hold a copy of Orochimaru's consciousness in it along with the cells of Orochimaru that Kabuto injected into himself and subjugated. Using the Cursed Seal Orochimaru placed on his former student, Anko Mitarashi, Sasuke releases Orochimaru and gives him a new body which Jugo provides with an absorbed part of Kabuto's flesh. Despite expressing <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ongoing war and still desiring to claim Sasuke's body, Orochimaru then joins Sasuke in his quest for answers over the nature of ninja, taking him and Taka to the Nara Shrine where he undoes the Reaper Death Seal and regains the use of ninjutsu before transferring his being {{into one of the}} White Zetsu clones placed on Sasuke. In his new body, Orochimaru then brings the first four Hokage back to life with the Reanimation Jutsu to give Sasuke the answers he wants. Once Sasuke got his answer from Hashirama, out of curiosity to see his former apprentice's new path while the actions of Madara and Obito jeopardize his laboratories, Orochimaru offers to help the Allied Shinobi Forces by first coming to the aid of Tsunade and the Kage and assist in subduing the Shinju. After the Fourth Great Ninja War ended, among those caught under Madara's Infinite Tsukiyomi before being freed, Orochimaru resumes his experiments with Team Taka (minus Sasuke who returns to Konoha) supporting him as lab assistants, though Konoha remains suspicious of him and keeps tabs on him in case he resumes his former human experimentation activities.|$|E
5|$|Royal marriages of the 19th {{century were}} {{arranged}} to secure alliances {{and to maintain}} blood ties among the European nations. As early as 1851, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her German-born husband, Prince Albert, were making plans to marry their eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, to Frederick. The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband. The monarchs desired to maintain their family's blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage {{would lead to the}} liberalization and modernization of Prussia. King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of the British monarch and consort, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured Baron Stockmar's idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia. Frederick's father, Prince William, had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arrangement, hoping instead for a Russian Grand Duchess as his daughter-in-law. However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain. In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the Great Exhibition but in truth she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert's daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a few words of English, while Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.|$|E
5|$|There is {{much debate}} amongst historians about Henry's {{accession}}, {{in part because}} some {{see it as a}} cause of the Wars of the Roses. For many historians, the accession by force of the throne broke principles the Plantagenets had established successfully over two and a half centuries and allowed any magnate with sufficient power and Plantagenet blood to have ambitions to assume the throne. Richard had attempted to disinherit Henry and remove him from the succession. In response Henry’s legal advisors, led by William Thirning, dissuaded Henry from claiming the throne by right of conquest and instead look for legal justification. Although Henry established a committee to investigate his assertion that his mother had legitimate rights through descent from Edmund Crouchback, whom he said was the elder son of Henry III of England but was set aside because of deformity, no evidence was found. The eight-year-old Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the heir general to Richard II by being the grandson of Edward III's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and also the son of Richard's last nominated heir. In desperation, Henry's advisors made the case that Henry was heir male to Henry III and this was supported by thirteenth-century entails. Mortimer's sister Anne de Mortimer married Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, son of Edward III's fourth son Edmund of Langley, consolidating Anne's place in the succession with that of the more junior House of York. As a child Mortimer was not considered a serious contender and as an adult he showed <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> throne, instead loyally serving the House of Lancaster. Mortimer informed Henry V when Conisburgh, in what was later called the Southampton Plot, attempted to place him on the throne instead of Henry's newly crowned sontheir mutual cousinleading to the execution of Conisburgh and the other plotters.|$|E
