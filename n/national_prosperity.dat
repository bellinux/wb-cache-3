5|$|A {{period of}} <b>national</b> <b>prosperity</b> {{followed}} {{the end of}} the War of 1812. In Kentucky, rapid population growth and strong demand for the state's goods led to land speculation becoming a popular enterprise. The charter of the Kentucky Insurance Company in 1802 and the Bank of Kentucky in 1806 made currency for loans plentiful. The establishment of branches of the Second Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington further augmented the availability of credit. In 1818, the General Assembly chartered 40 more state banks, and later added six more.|$|E
5|$|The 1880s was {{a decade}} of growing <b>national</b> <b>prosperity,</b> and {{increasing}} numbers of families from the expanding middle classes were sending their sons to boarding schools. The B.O.P. editor, George Hutchison, felt that such schools would provide the ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero (or heroes) could display Christian principles and strength of character {{in the face of}} temptations, and planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a boarding school, was not the obvious choice as the writer. However, the skill and imagination he had displayed in his short school stories convinced Hutchison that Reed should be given the assignment.|$|E

25|$|Poverty was tackled {{through an}} {{agricultural}} policy which resettled 250,000 Malays on newly cleared farmland, more investment in rural infrastructure, {{and the creation}} of free trade zones in rural areas to create new manufacturing jobs. Little was done to improve the living standards of the low-paid workers in plantation agriculture, although this group steadily declined as a proportion of the workforce. By 1990 the poorest parts of Malaysia were rural Sabah and Sarawak, which lagged significantly behind the rest of the country. During the 1970s and ‘80s rural poverty did decline, particularly in the Malayan Peninsula, but critics of the government’s policy contend that this was mainly due to the growth of overall <b>national</b> <b>prosperity</b> (due {{in large part to the}} discovery of important oil and gas reserves) and migration of rural people to the cities rather than to state intervention. These years saw rapid growth in Malaysian cities, particularly Kuala Lumpur, which became a magnet for immigration both from rural Malaya and from poorer neighbours such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand and the Philippines. Urban poverty became a problem for the first time, with shanty towns growing up around the cities.|$|E

500|$|Opinion {{about the}} value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others thought it a gift from God for <b>national</b> <b>prosperity.</b> In 1838 {{comments}} in The Army and Navy Chronicle supported future development of southern Florida: [...] climate [...] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, [...] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden. It is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season; but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these obstructions.|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone, {{says his}} biographer, [...] "totally {{rejected}} the widespread English {{view that the}} Irish had no taste for justice, common sense, moderation or <b>national</b> <b>prosperity</b> and looked only to perpetual strife and dissension". The problem for Gladstone was that his rural English supporters would not support home rule for Ireland.

2500|$|As a {{committed}} [...] "wet," [...] or anti-Prohibition, candidate, Smith attracted not only drinkers but also voters {{angered by the}} corruption and lawlessness that developed alongside prohibition.

Most importantly, {{this was a time}} of <b>national</b> <b>prosperity</b> under a Republican White House. Smith lost in a landslide to Republican Herbert Hoover, who gained electoral support from six southern states. Four years later Smith sought the 1932 nomination but was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, his former ally and successor as Governor of New York. Smith entered business in New York City and became an increasingly vocal opponent of Roosevelt's New Deal.|$|E

2500|$|Keynesian {{economic}} theory has {{played an important}} role in the economic philosophy of modern American liberals. Modern American liberals generally believe that <b>national</b> <b>prosperity</b> requires government management of the macroeconomy, in order to keep unemployment low, inflation in check, and growth high. They also value institutions that defend against economic inequality. In The Conscience of a Liberal Paul Krugman writes: [...] "I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That makes me a liberal, and I'm proud of it." [...] Liberals often point to the widespread prosperity enjoyed under a mixed economy in the years since World WarII. They believe liberty exists when access to necessities like health care and economic opportunity are available to all, and they champion the protection of the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Innovation also {{extended}} to Birmingham's products, which were increasingly tailored to its merchants' {{national and international}} connections. During {{the first half of}} the century growth was largely driven by the domestic market and based on increased <b>national</b> <b>prosperity,</b> but foreign trade was important even in the mid-century and was the dominant factor from the 1760s and 1770s, dictated by the markets and fashions of London, France, Italy, Germany, Russia and the American colonies. The adaptability and speed to market of the Birmingham economy allowed it to be heavily influenced by fashion – the market for buckles collapsed in the late 1780s, but workers transferred skills to brass or button trades. Birmingham manufacturers sought design leadership in fashionable circles in London or Paris, but then priced their goods to appeal to the emerging middle class consumer economy; [...] "for the London season the Spitalfields silk weavers produced each year their new designs, and the Birmingham toy-makers their buttons, buckles, patchboxes, snuff boxes, chatelaines, watches, watch seals... and other jewellery." [...] Competitive pressure drove Birmingham manufacturers to adopt new products and materials: the town's first glasshouse opened in 1762, manufacture in papier-mâché developed from the award of a patent to Henry Clay in 1772, foreshadowing the Birmingham invention of plastics the following century, the minting of coins grew from 1786.|$|E
