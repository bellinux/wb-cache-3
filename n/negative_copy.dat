50|$|When this {{metal master}} {{was removed from}} the lacquer (master), it would be a {{negative}} master or master matrix, since it was a <b>negative</b> <b>copy</b> of the lacquer. (In the UK, this was called the master; note the difference from soft master/lacquer disc above). In the earliest days the negative master was used as a mold to press records sold to the public, but as demand for mass production of records grew, another step was added to the process.|$|E

5000|$|Cane River premiered in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1982. The New York Times {{said at the}} time, it was [...] "already a rarity: a drama by an {{independent}} black filmmaker, financed by wealthy black patrons and dealing with race issues untouched by mainstream cinema". Jenkins sought to have a national distribution of the film and its soundtrack, but he died on December 3, 1982 at age 42. Cane River was scheduled to screen in New York City in February 1982, but with his death, the film went unreleased. Richard Pryor, who saw a screening of Cane River before Jenkins's death, had offered to place the film with the studio Warner Bros., {{with whom he had}} an agreement to distribute films made by African-Americans, but its producers declined the offer.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the number and}} ratio of <b>negative</b> homothetic <b>copies</b> of a d-dimensional convex body C sufficient for the covering of C.

It is proved that every planar convex body can be covered by two copies of ratio − 4 (this ratiocannot be lessened 3 if C is a triangle). Every convex body C in Euclidean d-space E d can be covered by a homothetic copy of C of ratio −d. This immediately follows from the papers of Neumann [10] for d = 2, and Süss [12] in the general case.

We use this idea to prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for the partition function Z(G) on 3 -regular directed graphs G, where each edge is given a complex-valued binary function f: { 0, 1 }^ 2 →C.

40|$|The {{micromachining}} of GaAs {{with three}} different truly three-dimensional (3 D) molds were performed by the confined etchant layer technique (CELT). The etched patterns were found, approximately, to be the <b>negative</b> <b>copy</b> of the 3 D molds. The general comparison of CELT with the existing micromachining techniques, such as two-dimensional (2 D) projection lithography and electro-discharge machining, was made. The replication of the complex microstructures down to micrometer scale {{has been done by}} CELT in a single step. The photoresist layer, together with the procedures of exposure, developing and removal of resist, could be eliminated. The advantages of CELT over the existing lithography techniques and its potential applications are discussed briefly. It has been shown that CELT could be developed as a complementary technique to the existing micromachining techniques in fabricating microdevices for microsystems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Micromachining of {{magnesium}} alloy by confined etchant layer technique (CELT) was investigated. The variation of hydrogen ion concentration on the electrode surface during the electrochemical process was explored for some thermodynamically available "etchant-scavenger" systems, and their corrosion rate to magnesium alloy was measured. An effective electrochemistry "etching-scavenging" system was selected. Using NaNO 2 as precursor for electrochemically generating etchant HNO 3, NaOH as scavenger, and {{small amount of}} Na 2 SiO 3 as inhibitor, 3 -D microstructure lattice on a mold was replicated onto the magnesium alloy surface. The microstructures processed were approximately the <b>negative</b> <b>copy</b> of {{the ones on the}} mold. Sub-micrometer scale resolution was reached. The result suggested that CELT could be applied to machine the 3 -D microstructure on magnesium alloy surface, which had potential to be used for the fabrication of micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{implementation}} {{model for a}} retrieval and inference system based on the theory of conceptual graphs is presented.

These symmetries include those between formation and inference rules, AND and OR, positive and <b>negative,</b> <b>copy</b> and restrict, general and specific, etc. Topics taken up include the implementation of Sowa's formation rules, the storage of a conceptual graph hierarchy involving contexts and negation as a conjunctive normal form (CNF) lattice, the extension of existing retrieval algorithms, such as Levinson's Method III and UDS, to handle complex referents and nested contexts, the checking of consistency, and the definition of Peirce's inference rules in terms of formation rules.

40|$|Three-dimensional microstructures were {{fabricated}} and duplicated on {{copper and}} nickel substrates, respectively, using a confined etchant layer technique (CELT). The key {{feature of this}} technique is that the outer boundary of the diffusion layer of the etchant can retain the three-dimensional fine micro-pattern of the mold electrode. The etched patterns of copper and nickel were therefore approximately the <b>negative</b> <b>copy</b> of the gear-like three-dimensional mold and the duplication could reach a precision of (sub) gm. The design of an appropriate chemical etching system {{is one of the}} key issues to successful fabrication of microstructures on the bulk metal. The different processing parameters including the electrochemical current density and electrolyte concentration have strong influences on the smoothness of the fabricated surface. Our preliminary results demonstrate that CELT has the potential to be developed as an effective technique for micromachining three-dimensional metal microstructures, which can be applied for the fabrication of micro electromechanical systems.
