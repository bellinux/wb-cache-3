40|$|The Burenstam Linder {{hypothesis}} {{is a well}} established and empirically tested hypothesis. In this study we introduce a new method of measuring the Linder effect. Our approach focuses on the income distribution within a country. We identify the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between trading partners by calculating the income overlap. The size of the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is then related {{to the size of}} the home market to form the new Linder-variable. We also consider the scale effect of the <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> Results show a positive and significant effect of the Linder variable on export intensity.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the endogenous formation of a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> in a three-country, n factor political economy model. Ex ante policies {{in each of the}} prospective members are the result of direct democracy, and equilibrium outcomes may include both import restrictions as well as subsidies. The decision to join a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is modelled as a simultaneous move game between the two prospective members. Several interesting results emerge. First, ex ante differences in subsidies do not affect the attitude of the median voter. Second, for a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> to emerge, ex post factor flows between prospective members have to be balanced. Third, the likelihood that a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> emerges increases with the number of factors enjoying ex post enhanced protection. This last result highlights the potential tension between social desirability and political feasibility of the <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a setting of two firms and one capacity agent. Each firm serves a primary market, {{and the capacity}} agent sustains a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> to draw demand for capacity from the external firms. The firms can partner with the capacity agent under her contract to serve the <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> When they use the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> mainly as an outlet for their unused capacities, the capacity agent will only specify a variable fee for each capacity unit deployed through her, and prefer to partner with one firm in most circumstances. When the firms adjust capacities to accommodate the businesses created by serving the <b>common</b> <b>market,</b> the capacity agent will specify a lump-sum payment and a variable fee, and {{will be more likely}} to incentivize only one firm to partner with her, when the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is sufficiently large or the demands in the <b>common</b> and primary <b>markets</b> are strongly correlated. She will always use a fixed fee to extract, while not necessarily all, the profit gains to the firms serving the <b>common</b> <b>market,</b> but will use a variable fee only when partnering with both firms. The key results are robust with respect to market configuration and contract type. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between two or more countries improves overall well-being, but it creates winners and losers in each country. Recent empirical findings also show that the overall impact of a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> on per capita income depends on the similarity of economic development between member countries. A <b>common</b> <b>market</b> among developed countries results in the convergence of per capita income while a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> among developing countries results in the divergence of per capita income. The difference in outcome, some economists suggest, is due to variations in comparative advantage between member states {{and the rest of}} the world. But the theory of comparative advantage does not fully explain the results of the de facto <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between Ethiopia and Eritrea (1991 - 1998). The empirical findings of this study demonstrate that the Ethio-Eritrea preferential trade arrangement benefited Eritrea and harmed Ethiopia. The main reason for these asymmetric consequences was acceptance by the Ethiopian government of the unfavourable terms of the preferential trade arrangement between the two countries...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a symmetric three-stage game {{played by a}} pair of regulator-firm hierarchies to capture the scale and technology effects. Each firm produces one good sold on the market. The production process generates pollution characterized by a fixed emission/output ratio, and cross-borders. Firms can invest in R&D in order to lower their emission/output ratio, and this activity is characterized by positive R&D spillovers. We show that R&D spillovers and the competition of firms on the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> help non-cooperating countries to internalize transboundary pollution more efficiently. Consequently, in most cases, when the positive externality increases, the levels of R&D and production increase while pollution decreases, implying an increase of the social welfare. However, in some other cases, pollution under <b>common</b> <b>market</b> increases with the R&D externality implying a decrease of the social welfare. Opening markets to the international trade leads to more investment in R&D and more production. In most cases, pollution under <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is lower than under autarky, implying a greater social welfare. Nevertheless, in some other cases, pollution under <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is higher than under autarky implying that opening markets deteriorates social welfare.
