30|$|Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation of distal humeral shaft fractures is increasingly becoming an acceptable treatment modality. [5, 11, 12, 13, 14] Options for internal fixation include intramedullary nailing and plate osteosynthesis either with double-column plating {{or a single}} column plate applied on the posterior or posterolateral side. Biomechanical studies have shown superior bending properties of humeral fractures fixed with a plate and screw system versus intramedullary devices. Also, the distal fragment is short and the medullary canal is narrow, rendering it difficult to perform <b>nail</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> in distal third fractures [15].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Elastic Stable {{intramedullary}} Nailing (ESIN) of dislocated diaphyseal femur fractures {{has become}} an accepted method for the treatment {{in children and adolescents}} with open physis. Studies focused on complications of this technique showed problems regarding stability, usually in complex fracture types such as spiral fractures and in older children weighing > 40 kg. Biomechanical in vitro testing was performed to evaluate the stability of simulated spiral femoral fractures after retrograde flexible titanium intramedullary nail fixation with and without End caps. Methods Eight synthetic adolescent-size femoral bone models (Sawbones ® with a medullar canal of 10 mm and a spiral fracture of 100 mm length identically sawn by the manufacturer) were used for each group. Both groups underwent retrograde fixation with two 3. 5 mm Titanium C-shaped nails inserted from medial and lateral entry portals. In the End Cap group the ends of the nails of the eight specimens were covered with End Caps (Synthes Company, Oberdorf, Switzerland) at the distal entry.

40|$|Introduction: Intramedullary nailing is {{synthesis}} and  {{consolidation of}} fracture fragments {{with the main}} goal to gain strength and permanent placement of the implants. Two techniques of intramedullary osteosynthesis are used: with dynamic or with static intramedullary nail. Dynamization include conversion of static nail by removing screws from the longest fragment. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine whether there is a difference in the speed and quality of healing of the type A and B fractures of the femur and tibia treated by static or dynamic intramedullary nails and to compare the results. Methods : The study was conducted on a total of 129 patients with closed fractures of the diaphysis of the femur and tibia type A and type B. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the applied operating method, static or dynamic intramedullary osteosynthesis. Results: The average number of weeks of healing femoral and tibial fractures was slightly in advantage of static intramedullary osteosynthesis, it was 17. 08 weeks (SD= 3. 382). The average number of weeks of healing in 23 patients with fractures of the femur, treated by dynamic intramedullary osteosynthesis was 17. 83 (SD= 2. 978). Conclusion: We can conclude that static intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> unable movements between fragments which directly stimulates bone formation and formation of minimal callus. Static intramedullary ostesinthesys resolve the problem of stabilizing the fracture, limb shortening and rotation of fragments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{determine}} the autonomy and mortality of elderly patients submitted to proximal femoral osteosynthesis with cephalomedullary nail after hip fracture. Methods Retrospective study with 61 patients with proximal femoral fractures submitted to cephalomedullary <b>nail</b> <b>osteosynthesis.</b> The authors analyzed {{the medical records}} and collected information from the preoperative period. Patients were questioned regarding pain, postoperative autonomy, and degree of satisfaction. The {{total number of deaths}} was verified. The results were then correlated. Results The mean age was 84 years, predominantly female (82 %). In the postoperative evaluation, 45 % of the patients presented worsened levels of autonomy. The majority of patients presented mild pain (61 %) on the VAS scale. The mortality rate was 24. 6 %, and the mean time of preoperative hospitalization was three days. The factors that presented statistical significance regarding postoperative autonomy were the time elapsed from the trauma until the moment of surgery, ASA score, fracture stability, and previous functional status of the patients. The mortality rate was associated with three main factors: advanced age, ASA score, and preoperative hospitalization time. Conclusion The patient's previous autonomy positively influenced the functional outcome and postoperative recovery. Unstable fractures presented worse results for pain and ambulation in a follow-up of 27 months. Hip fracture is a risk factor associated with mortality and decreased independence in patients over 65 years of age...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Complication of {{conventional}} open reduction and internal fixation of fraktures {{are believed to}} be in part due to disruption of perfusion by the surgical approach and/or implant. Recently, an internal fixator has been developed wtch has only punctual contact to the periosteum and does not further damage the fracture healing process. Furthermore, the internal fixator can be applied through minimal invasive approach. This study compares the ease of fracture healing ater internal fixator stabilisation to that after closed undreamed intramedullary nailing in a simple diaphyseal sheep tibial fracturemodel from the histological point of view. Methods: A reproducible simple sheep tibial mid-shaft fracture combined with a soft tissue contusion was used. Twelf sheep underwent surgery on both hind legs by the same surgeon, randomized left/right to fixator/nail. All sheep were allowed to immediately bear weight but prevented from reclining by a loos suspension sling for six weeks. For intravital staining xylenolorange and calceingreen were administered subcutaneously during the 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th, 6 th in the 6 week group as well as during the 5 th, 6 th and 7 th, 8 th in the 12 weeks group. Six sheep were sacrificed after 6 weeks the rest after 12 weeks. Following hardware removal, tibiae were sliced and stained (van Kossa/Safranin O) for histological examination and non-stained slices were obtained for fluoroscopy. The difference in the histological parameters between each fixator and nail group was compared using the paired t-test. Significance level, p< 0. 05 was used to reject the null hypothesis. All procedures were carried out under permission of the Animal Experimentation Commission of the Veterinarian Office of Canton Graubuenden. Results: Quantitative histological evaluation of the stained slices exhibited no appreciable difference in the time of callus initiation, growth, bridging or initial resorption after 6 weeks. However, fluoroscopy revealed a higher mineralization signal within the fracture gap in the fixator group compared to the nail group. Furthermore, after 12 weeks showed the fracture of both groups histological signs of advanced healing in the stained slices. Concerning the fluoroscopy, even after 12 weeks the mineralization signal in the fracture gap was higher in the fixtor group. Conclusion: Comparing treatment with an internal fixator to that with an undreamed <b>nail</b> <b>osteosynthesis</b> in a tibial mid-shaft fracture combined with a soft tissue contusion fixator stabilisation resulted in a higher mineralization activity in the fracture gap, {{there was no significant difference}} in the histological evaluation of bone healing between both groups at 6 and 12 weeks post-op...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} - {{to evaluate}} long-term results and survival rates of «Universal» condylar knee prosthesis. Material and methods. There were {{a total of}} 121 total knee joint replacements in the set with 107 patients aged 71. 3 years on average (52 - 86 years). A total of 115 knees diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the 3 - 4 th degree were indicated for the surgery, and there were 6 patients with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Knee Society Score (KSS), Results. The assessment of the knee state on a scale KSS average clinical section KSS (knee score) was 48. 2, and functional (function score) - 46, 8 points. After surgery, the indices increased to 87. 4 points and 85. 8 points, respectively. One complication was described during the surgery, namely - the fracture of the medial tibia condyle (0. 8 %). In the early post-surgery period, peroneal nerve paresis was observed in two patients (1. 6 %). In the postoperative period, disorders of the wound healing were observed in 6 patients (4. 9 %), which were healed successfully in a conservative way. In the late post-surgery period, there were infectious complications in the knee joint in 4 knee joints (3. 3 %). Aseptic loosening was observed in 4 cases out of 117 endoprostheses (3. 4 %). It always concerned the loosening of tibial component. The loosening of the femoral component was not observed. In the period from the implantation until June 2014, which is 16 - 22 years after the implantation, there are 16 patients in total surviving, who had a total of 21 implanted endoprostheses. Among them {{there are no signs}} of a loosening only in 4 patients (19 %); there was an apparent radiolucent line up until 2 mm with a sclerotic rim under the tibial component. All the patients were without clinical symptoms for the loosening. Six female patients (28. 5 %) state troubles {{in the area of the}} femoro-patellar joint, where there is a lateralization of the patella, apparent on the X-ray images.

40|$|Interlocking nails (ILN) are {{effective}} tools for the fixation of long bone fractures, including humeral, femoral and tibial fractures. An interlocking nails are a steel rods which {{are placed in}} medullary canal of fractured bone. They have transverse openings which are use to put inside a transcortical screws. Those screws block the nail relative to the main bone fragments. Interlocking nails counteract all forces at the fractured site, thus they are an alternative to bone plates. Simultaneously, the intramedullary nail is placed in a natural position relative to the bone's biomechanical axis and neutralizing bending forces across bone fragments. Unlike bone plates that are eccentrically positioned, the nail has an intramedullary position which makes it much more resistant to compressive, torsional and bending force. This technique requires a relatively low surgical approach to compare with plate osteosynthesis. Most importantly, interlocking <b>nails</b> support biological <b>osteosynthesis</b> and fracture management with minimal surgical intervention. The first application in veterinary medicine of the interlocking nail was at the late 1980 s. Since this moment, the technique still evolves providing the next generations of interlocking nails. At these days we have several generations of it. This paper discusses the use of interlocking nails in fracture stabilization in veterinary practice and overviews the development of nail implants and their applications. The advantages of the analyzed technique and the associated complications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lack of {{availability}} of interlocked <b>nails</b> made plate <b>osteosynthesis</b> {{the first choice}} of treatment of forearm fractures inspite of more surgical exposure, periosteal stripping and big skin incision subsequent scar along with higher risk of refracture on implant removal. We hereby report the first 12 cases with 19 forearm bone fractures internally fixed by indegenous interlocked nail. Materials and Methods: Existing square nails were modified to have a broad proximal end of 5. 5 mm with a hole for locking screw of 2. 5 mm. The nail has a distal hole of 1 / 1. 2 / 1. 5 mm in 2. 5 / 3 / 3. 5 mm diameter nail, respectively. A new method of distal locking with a clip made of k wire is designed. The clip after insertion into the bone and hole in nail and opposite cortex snuggly fits the bone providing a secure locking system. Twelve skeletally mature patients, mean age 32 years (range 24 - 45 years) with 19 diaphyseal fractures of the forearm were treated with this indigenously made new nail. The patient were evaluated for fracture union, functional recovery and complications. The functional outcome was assessed by disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH score). Results: Time to radiographic union ranged between 12 and 28 weeks, with a 100 % union rate. Complications were minimal, with mild infection in open fracture (n= 1) and delayed union (n= 1) in patient with comminuted fracture of the ulna only. The clinical results were excellent. The DASH score ranged between 0 and 36 points. Conclusion: This new interlocking nail may be considered as an alternative to plate osteosynthesis for fractures of the forearm in adults. The advantages are benefit of closed reduction, smaller residual scar, reduced cost and early union with allowance of immediate movements...|$|R
