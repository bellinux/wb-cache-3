25|$|In 2003, the LIRR and Metro-North {{started a}} pilot program in which {{passengers}} traveling within the city limits were allowed to buy one-way tickets for $2.50. The special reduced-fare CityTicket, proposed by the New York City Transit Riders Council, was formally introduced in 2004. On weekends, the railroad offers the CityTicket for passengers who travel within Zones 1 and 3 (i.e. within New York City). CityTickets can only be bought from ticket agents or machines and used {{on the day of}} purchase. They are <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> travel to Far Rockaway because it is in Zone 4 and the Far Rockaway Branch passes through Nassau County. It is also <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> travel to the Belmont Park station, which is only open for special events.|$|E

25|$|Single Journey Fares {{are valid}} only for single trip between any two points. They are issued on paper ticket by the bus conductor. All fare {{payments}} {{must be made}} in cash. The fare depends on distance of the destination. Single Journey fare are <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> transfers. Ordinary and Limited bus service have same fares.|$|E
25|$|Tickets can {{be bought}} for {{specific}} fare zones, or multiple zones. Most passengers who live in Berlin buy AB fare zone tickets, while commuters {{coming in from the}} suburbs need ABC fare zone tickets. If a ticket <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> travel in a tariff zone is checked by a ticket inspector, the passenger is subject to a fine.|$|E

25|$|Random {{generation}} of gamma variates {{is discussed in}} detail by Devroye, noting that none are uniformly fast for all shape parameters. For small values of the shape parameter, the algorithms are often <b>not</b> <b>valid.</b> <b>For</b> arbitrary values of the shape parameter, one can apply the Ahrens and Dieter modified acceptance–rejection method Algorithm GD (shape k ≥ 1), or transformation method when 0 < k < 1. Also see Cheng and Feast Algorithm GKM 3 or Marsaglia's squeeze method.|$|E

Reduced-Fare MetroCards (in any variety) are also not accepted at PATH stations. Reduced fare customers {{who do not have}} a MetroCard may purchase a full-fare round trip MetroCard from a subway station agent by presenting proof of eligibility.|$|E
25|$|Chinese visas {{are issued}} both outside China, by the Chinese {{diplomatic}} missions, and in China, by the Exit and Entry Administrations (EEAs) of the county-level Public Security Bureaus (PSBs). In order to enter China, however, a non-Chinese national should {{apply to the}} visa-issuing authorities outside China for a Chinese visa. Because Hong Kong and Macau maintain their independent border control policies, ordinary Chinese visas are valid for Mainland China only and are <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> Hong Kong or Macau, so travelers must apply for separate visas for Hong Kong or Macau should they require one for travelling to these regions.|$|E

25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems. The questionnaire takes less than one minute to administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick screening tool {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E
25|$|The French {{overseas}} departments of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion, and the overseas collectivity of Saint Martin {{are part of}} the European Union but do not form part of the Schengen Area. The EU's freedom of movement provisions apply, but each territory operates its own visa regime for non-European Economic Area (EEA), non-Swiss nationals. While a visa valid for one of these territories will be valid for all, visa exemption lists differ. A Schengen visa, even one issued by France, is <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> these territories. A visa for Sint Maarten (which is valid for travelling to the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin) is also valid for the French side. France also has several territories which are neither part of the EU nor the Schengen Area. These are: French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, New Caledonia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{congestion}} pricing was also implemented in urban segments of three major expressways, {{starting with the}} East Coast Parkway (ECP). The RPS, as it was called, also operated manually with paper licences to enter the expressways. In 1997, the RPS was implemented in the Central Expressway and the Pan Island Expressway. After the implementation of RPS, the Central Expressway Average speed at peak hour went to 67km/h from the previous average of 31km/h. This extension was necessary because some through traffic was diverted by the ALS to routes that bypassed the RZ, increasing demand on these arterials and creating a need for expanding {{the capacity of the}} road network outside the RZ. Because of heavier demand, only the Central Expressway required a separate licence, <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> the RZ. During this time, a more modern system was being planned, to charge every time a user entered the RZ, and thus, charges would reflect the true cost of driving at congested times.|$|E

500|$|Von Neumann's {{abstract}} treatment permitted him also {{to confront}} the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics {{could not possibly be}} averages of an underlying set of determined [...] "hidden variables," [...] as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1966, John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid. However, in 2010, Jeffrey Bub argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and pointed out that the proof, though <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> all hidden variable theories, does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.|$|E
500|$|The line {{is solely}} {{served by a}} {{tourist-oriented}} service operated by the Norwegian State Railways on behalf of Flåm Utvikling. From May through September, there are nine or ten departures in each direction per day. In {{the rest of the}} year, there are four. Fares do not follow the normal fares for NSB and are considerably higher than on other train routes. InterRail tickets are <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> free travel, but give a 30 percent discount. Travel time varies between 50 and 59 minutes between the end stations. In 2007, the line was the third-most visited tourist attraction in Norway and carried 547,000 passengers in 2010. The service is provided by push–pull trains consisting of an El 17 at each end and with B3 carriages. The locomotives were built by Henschel in 1987, with electrical equipment from NEBB. They have a power output of [...] and a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement.|$|E
500|$|In April 1902, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{overruled}} {{an earlier}} {{decision by the}} Court of Common Pleas and upheld the reserve clause in contracts between players and NL clubs. President of the Chicago National League Club Jim Hart said the state Supreme Court's decision had dealt [...] "a fatal blow to the rival league" [...] and NL clubs [...] "have won a great victory." [...] The Phillies' Rogers obtained an injunction barring Lajoie from playing baseball for any team other than his team. However, a lawyer discovered the injunction was only enforceable {{in the state of}} Pennsylvania. The courts ruled the reserve clause was <b>not</b> <b>valid</b> <b>for</b> players who signed with an AL team. Mack responded by trading Lajoie and Bill Bernhard to the then-moribund Cleveland Bronchos, whose owner, Charles Somers, had provided considerable financial assistance to the A's in the early years. Lajoie was also pursued by Charles Comiskey, owner of the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
