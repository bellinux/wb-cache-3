5|$|The North End Halifax <b>neighbourhood</b> of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was {{considered}} a working-class <b>neighbourhood</b> and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban <b>neighbourhood.</b> The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone <b>neighbourhood</b> consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale <b>neighbourhood</b> and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E
40|$|Two {{explanations}} {{of differences in}} undercoverage and nonresponse between <b>neighbourhoods</b> in a telephone survey among {{the inhabitants of the}} City of Groningen were studied: differences in population composition between <b>neighbourhoods</b> or in their social disorganization. Logistic multilevel analyses were performed on a sample of 7, 000 inhabitants and all 14 city <b>neighbourhoods.</b> Differences in undercoverage and nonresponse between <b>neighbourhoods</b> could be attributed for the greater part to variations in the population composition of the <b>neighbourhoods.</b> Social disorganization had no effect on nonresponse and only a small one on undercoverage: people in <b>neighbourhoods</b> in decay (indicated by prolonged vacancies and relatively frequent criminal offenses) more often had no telephone or an unlisted number than people in other <b>neighbourhoods.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The Plateau Mount Royal borough was {{a working}} class francophone area. The largest <b>neighbourhood</b> is the Plateau (not to be {{confused}} with the whole borough), which is undergoing considerable gentrification, and a 2001 study deemed it as Canada's most creative <b>neighbourhood</b> because artists comprise 8% of its labour force. The <b>neighbourhood</b> of Mile End in the northwestern part of the borough, has been a very multicultural area of the city, and features two of Montreal's well-known bagel establishments, St-Viateur Bagel and Fairmount Bagel. The McGill Ghetto is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough, its name being derived from the fact that it is home to thousands of McGill University students and faculty members.|$|E
5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each <b>neighbourhood</b> is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and each has a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for <b>neighbourhood</b> shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the <b>neighbourhood</b> parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each <b>neighbourhood,</b> the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green <b>neighbourhood</b> to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
