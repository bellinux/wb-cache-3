40|$|Abstract. In the {{processing}} of manufacturing, the rising of temperature caused by friction heat, cutting heat, ambient temperature and other factors will lead to thermal deformation of the driving components of <b>machine</b> <b>tool,</b> so that the correct position between the tool and work piece will be changed. And at the same time, <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> will lose its intrinsic accuracy and reduce its reliability. Especially in the precision cutting processing, machining errors caused by the thermal deformation of driving system will not be ignored, almost accounting for 40 %~ 70 % of the total errors.

40|$|This paper {{makes it}} {{possible}} to predict the output motion of a parallel mechanism and proposes a method for generating a tool path of a <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> consisting of the parallel mechanism. As a <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> generally processes a work by interpolating an ideal shape with linear lines, a deviation between a path of tool and the ideal shape can be estimated easily. However, an input-output relation of the parallel mechanism is nonlinear, and accordingly an output pose of the parallel mechanism can be hardly determined by the direct kinematics. A prediction of the deviation of the parallel mechanism <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> is therefore extremely difficult, so that a generation of its tool path that ensures a given allowance is not easy. Thus the present study proposes a simple method to predict the tool path of the parallel mechanism by approximating its motion with a spiral path.
