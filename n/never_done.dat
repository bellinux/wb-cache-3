5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E
5|$|However, {{instead of}} {{being used as a}} coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to be {{converted}} into a target vessel, although this was <b>never</b> <b>done.</b> She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holsteins main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near {{the end of the war}} the two ships were both sunk.|$|E

5|$|The British {{took over}} the Maltese islands as a {{protectorate}} in 1800, and later as a colony in 1813. They initially used the Hospitaller fortifications without any alterations. Under the military theory of the time, the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion, {{and in fact the}} British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, wanted to demolish the majority of Valletta's fortifications in 1801, although this was <b>never</b> <b>done.</b> During the British period, the various forts of the Order were rearmed, refitted and altered a number of times {{to keep up with the}} latest military technology.|$|E
5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was the Albanian flag. The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was <b>never</b> <b>done</b> in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

60|$|It was {{an answer}} that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt {{individually}} that {{in the presence of}} such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> tombs look so ghastly white. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously. <b>Never</b> <b>did</b> bough creak so mysteriously, and <b>never</b> <b>did</b> the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.|$|R
25|$|Integrating {{with respect}} to another {{variable}} is the nearly exclusive province of mechanical analog integrators; it is almost <b>never</b> <b>done</b> in electronic analog computers.

25|$|Full flight {{trials and}} {{performance}} measurements were <b>never</b> <b>done,</b> so the figures remain estimates, {{but there is}} clear evidence that the empty weight had increased by about 33% from the 1938 estimates {{by the time the}} 161 was flying, with a corresponding 16% increase in gross weight.|$|E

25|$|Although most gold mining {{has ceased}} in the Black Hills and was <b>never</b> <b>done</b> {{in or near}} Rapid City, mining of sand and gravel, {{as well as the}} raw {{materials}} for lime and Portland cement (including chemical-grade limestone, taconite iron ore, and gypsum) remains {{an important part of the}} economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} towers of the bridge called {{for them to be}} encased in concrete and granite. However, because of cost considerations during the Great Depression and favorable aesthetic critiques of the bare steel towers, this was <b>never</b> <b>done.</b> The exposed steel towers, with their distinctive criss-crossed bracing, have become one of the bridge's most identifiable characteristics.|$|E

This proved more challenging than expected, and despite his best intentions, he served as producer on three albums in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected testicle (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost <b>never</b> <b>done,</b> as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.|$|E
25|$|There is, for example, the ALA-LC / U.S. Library of Congress system, {{based on}} MR {{but with some}} deviations.
