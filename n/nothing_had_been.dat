5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E
5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people.

However, they found that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unloaded.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Jones wrote {{a letter}} to Indian Agent James Givins {{regarding}} the year's delivery of gifts (due from various land purchases) to the Mississaugas. The letter was the first Givins had received that had been written by an Indian. Givins arranged a meeting with Jones during the second week of July. Jones arrived at the Humber River at the prescribed time, leading the approximately 50 Christian Indians, and his former adoptive father Captain Jim arrived leading the approximately 150 non-Christian Indians. At this meeting, a further 50 of the approximately 200 Indians of Jones' band were converted. Givins was accompanied by several members of Upper Canada's aristocracy, including Bishop John Strachan. The Christian dress and style of Jones' band of converts, including their singing of hymns, which had been translated into Ojibwe by Jones, created a favourable impression of the group with Strachan and the other political leaders present. Although Strachan, an Anglican, had strongly denounced the Methodists, he saw in Jones the opportunity to Christianize the Indians of Upper Canada. He hoped to convert Jones (and thereby his followers) to Anglicanism later. The Crown had previously agreed to build a village on the Credit River for the Mississaugas in 1820, but <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done. Strachan told Jones he would make good on this agreement, and after a short meeting, all of the Christian Indians agreed to accept it. Construction of the settlement, called the Credit Mission, was soon underway and Jones moved there in 1826. By the summer of 1826, with construction of the settlement well under way, the rest of the band had joined the Methodist church and settled at the Credit Mission. Among the last holdouts was Jones' former adoptive father, Captain Jim, and his family. At about this time Methodist Reverend Egerton Ryerson was assigned to the Credit Mission, and Jones quickly struck up a friendship with him. Ryerson's work at the camp freed Jones to begin taking lengthy missionary expeditions to other parts of Upper Canada. During the period 182527, Jones undertook missionary missions to Quinte, Munceytown, Rice Lake and Lake Simcoe. He preached in the native language, a key factor to helping the Indians understand and accept Christianity; small groups of Indians in these areas soon converted to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{official}} version released by the Spanish government, the withdrawal was due to bad weather, an excuse not credible, given that the weather conditions in the Mediterraneanare favorable to navigation in the summer. Among the measures used to present the bombing as a success, the most significant was that of numerous promotions among the participants. The Spanish 'victory' was sung by numerous poems, most of them exaggerated and of bad taste, but in fact <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> achieved. Two months later, five Algerian privateers captured two Spanish merchant vessels near Palamós {{as a gesture of}} defiance, and a new, far bigger expedition had to be assembled to attack Algiers again the following year.|$|E
25|$|By 1865 {{when the}} China Inland Mission began, {{there were already}} thirty {{different}} Protestant groups at work in China, however the diversity of denominations represented did not equate to more missionaries on the field. In the seven provinces in which Protestant missionaries had already been working, there were an estimated 204 million people with only 91 workers, while there were eleven other provinces in inland China with a population estimated at 197 million, for whom absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> attempted. Besides the London Missionary Society, and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, there were missionaries affiliated with Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Episcopalians, and Wesleyans. Most missionaries came from England, the United States, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland, or the Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. One reason is that drinking water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, {{a study by the}} Ministry of Health showed that drinking water for half a million people in Asiut was unfit for human consumption. As of June 2011, <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years ago because high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents.|$|E
25|$|Long {{discussed}} {{but so far}} unresolved is {{the question}} of how many artists participated in producing the Gigantomachy. Just as disputed {{is the extent to which}} the character of individual artists can be identified in this work of art. There is agreement that at least the basic design of the frieze was the work of a single artist. In view of its consistency down to the level of details, the plan must have been worked out to its smallest elements; <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> left to chance. Already in the arrangement of the fighting groups it can be noted that each group is unique and, for example, that the hairstyle and the footwear of the goddesses always differ. Each of the pairs of fighters is individually arranged. Thus, the figures in themselves reveal their distinctive character rather than this being the result of the artists’ personal styles.|$|E
25|$|The Agadir {{crisis of}} 1911 was again between France and Germany over Moroccan interests, but Asquith's {{government}} signalled its friendliness towards France in Lloyd George's Mansion House speech on 21 July. Late that year, the Lord President of the Council, Viscount Morley, brought {{the question of}} the communications with the French {{to the attention of the}} Cabinet. The Cabinet agreed (at Asquith's instigation) that no talks could be held that committed Britain to war, and required cabinet approval for co-ordinated military actions. Nevertheless, by 1912, the French had requested additional naval co-ordination and late in the year, the various understandings were committed to writing in an exchange of letters between Grey and French Ambassador Paul Cambon. The relationship with France disquieted some Liberal backbenchers and Asquith felt obliged to assure them that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> secretly agreed that would commit Britain to war. This quieted Asquith's foreign policy critics until another naval estimates dispute erupted early in 1914.|$|E
