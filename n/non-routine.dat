5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and <b>non-routine</b> work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E

25|$|Research on high-risk {{settings}} {{such as oil}} platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting {{and nuclear}} power plants has related distrust to failure avoidance. When <b>non-routine</b> strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better, while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better. This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner. They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling <b>non-routine</b> situations in high-risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs {{were more likely to}} survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection, and more analysis. Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment. He concluded that distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events, {{and are more likely to}} engage control mechanisms. Similarly, Gudmundsson and Lechner found that distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.|$|E
25|$|Acute disseminated {{encephalomyelitis}} (ADEM), or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, {{is a rare}} {{autoimmune disease}} marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation {{in the brain and}} spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. It is often triggered after the patient has received a viral infection or, perhaps exceedingly rarely specific <b>non-routine</b> vaccinations.|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{individuals}} with autism regarding learning {{is in the}} imitation of skills. This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills. Individuals with autism tend {{to be dependent on}} the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new <b>non-routine</b> tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge. As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.|$|E
500|$|Cotterman filed {{a motion}} to {{suppress}} all evidence seized by Customs officials and argued that the search of his laptop 170 miles from the port of entry {{over a period of}} four days was a <b>non-routine</b> border search requiring reasonable suspicion." [...] The motion was granted by the District Court in Cotterman's favor. The government appealed, and stated that the border search doctrine justified the initial search and the transport of the computer to Tucson to adequately conduct the search. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's ruling, in favor of the Government.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{propose that}} the purpose of PAs and the frequency of their feedback are contingent upon the nature of the job and characteristics of the employee. [...] For example, employees of routine jobs where performance maintenance is the goal would benefit sufficiently from annual PA feedback. [...] On the other hand, employees of more discretionary and <b>non-routine</b> jobs, where goal-setting is appropriate and there is room for development, would benefit from more frequent PA feedback. Non formal performance appraisals may be done more often, to prevent the element of surprise from the formal appraisal.|$|E

50|$|Executive {{functions}} are a cognitive apparatus that controls and manages cognitive processes. Norman and Shallice (1980) proposed a model on executive functioning of attentional control that specifies how {{thought and action}} schemata become activated or suppressed for routine and <b>non-routine</b> circumstances. Schemas, or scripts, specify an individual's series of actions or thoughts {{under the influence of}} environmental conditions. Every stimulus condition turns on the activation of a response or schema. The initiation of appropriate schema under routine, well-learned situations is monitored by contention scheduling which laterally inhibits competing schemas for the control of cognitive apparatus. Under unique, <b>non-routine</b> procedures the supervisory attentional system (SAS) controls schema activation. The SAS is an executive monitoring system that oversees and controls contention scheduling by influencing schema activation probabilities and allowing for general strategies to be applied to novel problems or situations during automatic attentional processes.|$|E
