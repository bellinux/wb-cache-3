Both physical, through a neo-Hookean constitutive law to describe the non-linear elastic deformation of the material, and geometrical <b>non-linearities</b> are accounted for. The deflections of a thin initially flat plate are described by the von Karman non-linear plate theory. A method for building a local model, which approximates the plate behavior around a deformed configuration, is proposed.

25|$|Capacitance {{may also}} change with applied voltage. This effect is more {{prevalent}} in class 2 ceramic capacitors. The permittivity of ferroelectric class 2 material depends on the applied voltage. Higher applied voltage lowers permittivity.

25|$|Although several {{versions}} of many-worlds {{have been proposed}} since Hugh Everett's original work, they all contain one key idea: the equations of physics that model the time evolution of systems without embedded observers are sufficient for modelling systems which do contain observers; in particular there is no observation-triggered wave function collapse which the Copenhagen interpretation proposes. Provided the theory is linear {{with respect to the}} wavefunction, the exact form of the quantum dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, relativistic quantum field theory or some form of quantum gravity or string theory, does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a metatheory applicable to all linear quantum theories, and there is no experimental evidence for any <b>non-linearity</b> of the wavefunction in physics.

GameDaily listed {{the game as}} one of the [...] "Most Influential Video Games" [...] and stated it [...] "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings". GamesTM noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to Super Mario 64. Nintendo's first party developer, Rare, reflected in 2013 that during the development of 2001's Conker's Bad Fur Day, they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of Super Mario 64: [...] "We were just copying Mario, weren't we? Which, to this day, is still the best 3D camera." [...] Super Mario 64 is notable for its sense of freedom and <b>non-linearity.</b> A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design is an inspiration for other game designers. Martin Hollis, who produced and directed GoldenEye 007, says [...] "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from Super Mario 64".
