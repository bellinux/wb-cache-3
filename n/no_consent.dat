5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, <b>no</b> <b>consent</b> was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E

25|$|Nazi Physicians {{and their}} assistants forced prisoners into participating; {{they did not}} willingly {{volunteer}} and <b>no</b> <b>consent</b> was given for the procedures.

25|$|On November 30, 1938, Siegel {{pitched the}} idea for the {{character}} of Superboy to Detective Comics (the corporate forerunner to DC Comics), but the company declined the offer. Siegel pitched the idea again in December 1940, but again the company declined to use the material. Siegel enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1943. While he was stationed overseas, Detective Comics directed Joe Shuster to draw a Superboy comic strip for publication in More Fun Comics. No notice was given to Siegel, and <b>no</b> <b>consent</b> from him was granted. Siegel sued for copyright infringement, and won. A court-appointed special referee declared the character of Superboy unique, and not derivative from the character of Superman. But appeals by both Siegel and National Comics Publication (the new name of Detective Comics) led to a consent decree in which the parties agreed that Superboy was the sole property of National Comics.|$|E
25|$|Within the European Union, organ {{donation}} is regulated by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries {{have some form}} of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates. In the United Kingdom {{organ donation}} is voluntary and <b>no</b> <b>consent</b> is presumed. Individuals who wish to donate their organs after death can use the Organ Donation Register, a national database. The government of Wales became the first constituent country in the UK to adopt presumed consent in July 2013. The opt-out organ donation scheme in Wales went live on December 1, 2015 and is expected {{to increase the amount of}} donors by 25%. In 2008, the UK discussed whether to switch to an opt-out system in light of the success in other countries and a severe British organ donor shortfall. In Italy if the deceased neither allowed nor refused donation while alive, relatives will pick the decision on his or her behalf despite a 1999 act that provided for a proper opt-out system. In 2008, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted for an initiative to introduce an EU organ donor card in order to foster organ donation in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Some anarcho-communists {{oppose the}} {{majoritarian}} nature of direct democracy, {{feeling that it}} can impede individual liberty and opt in favour of a non-majoritarian form of consensus democracy, similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy. Henry David Thoreau, who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for [...] "a better government" [...] and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people {{should not be in}} the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is <b>no</b> <b>consent.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By {{the morning}} of Tuesday 11 July, a {{compromise}} was reached. The Orangemen {{would be allowed to}} march along Garvaghy Road on condition that they did so silently and without accompanying bands. Ronnie Flanagan (Deputy Chief Constable of the police) told the GRRC that residents should peacefully remove themselves from the road because [...] "an angry scene between police and protesters could worsen the Ormeau marching dispute and even destabilise the ceasefires". When GRRC member Breandán Mac Cionnaith asked protesters to clear the road, some heckled him and refused. Flanagan was told there would be a better chance of the protesters moving if they knew there would be no march there next year. Flanagan replied that [...] "there was no question of marches going where there was <b>no</b> <b>consent</b> from the community". The residents were then persuaded to clear the road. This was all confirmed by the Mediation Network. The Orangemen then marched along the road with Paisley and Trimble {{at the head of the}} march. As they reached the end of Garvaghy Road, Paisley and Trimble held their hands in the air in what appeared to be a gesture of triumph. Trimble claims that he only took Paisley's hand to prevent the DUP leader from taking all the media attention.|$|E

There are <b>no</b> <b>consents</b> to take, use or dam water on the river or its tributaries, however a mini-hydro power station is expected to be operating in 2012 on a small stream in the catchment area.|$|R

60|$|And now began {{all those}} Difficulties to bear, which long before by the General had been apprehended. The Troops had continu'd under a State of Inactivity for the Space of three Weeks, all which {{was spent in}} {{perpetual}} Contrivances and Disputes amongst our selves, not with the Enemy. In six several Councils of War the Siege of Barcelona, under the Circumstances we then lay, was rejected as a Madness and Impossibility. And though the General and Brigadier Stanhope (afterward Earl Stanhope) consented to some Effort {{should be made to}} satisfy the Expectation of the World, than with any Hopes of Success. However, <b>no</b> <b>Consent</b> at all could be obtain'd from any Council of War; and the Dutch General in particular declar'd, that he would not obey even the Commands of the Earl of Peterborow, if he should order the Sacrifice of the Troops under him in so unjustifiable a Manner, without the Consent of a Council of War.|$|E
6000|$|We cannot {{afford the}} least {{narrative}} of Gortz and his courses: imagination, {{from a few}} traits, will sufficiently conceive them. He had gone first to Karl Theodor's Minister: [...] "Dead to it, I fear; has already signed?" [...] Alas, yes. Upon which to Zweibruck the Heir's Minister; whom his Master had distinctly ordered to sign, but who, at his own peril, gallant man, delayed, remonstrated, had not yet done it; {{and was able to}} answer: [...] "Alive to it, he? Yes, with a witness, were there hope in the world!"--which threw Gortz upon instant gallop towards Zweibruck Schloss, in search of said Heir, the young Duke August Christian; who, however, had left in the interim (summoned by his Uncle, on Austrian urgency, to consent along with him); but whom Gortz, by dexterity and intuition of symptoms, caught up by the road, with what a mutual joy! As had been expected, August Christian, on sight of Gortz, with an armed Friedrich looming in the distance, took at once into new courses and activities. From him, <b>no</b> <b>consent</b> now; far other: Treaty with Friedrich; flat refusal ever to consent: application to the Reich, application even to France, and whatever a gallant young fellow could do.|$|E
