Linda married Musty Siddick, had two children Ruby and Irene, and in the 1970s they were living in a Northern Territory Pintupi community called Yayayi. After Musty's death she remarried.|$|E
5|$|Maine's new {{attorney}} general, Richard S. Cohen (<b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the senator) {{took over}} negotiations for the state; soon, each side made new concessions. In March 1980, draft legislation {{was approved by}} the tribes' joint negotiating committee and ratified by an advisory referendum of the tribes' membership. This vote also permitted the inclusion of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in the settlement. The Maine state legislature passed the Maine Implementing Act (MIA), a statute enabling the settlement, on April 3, 1980.|$|E

While the pairs of the monochrome {{male and female}} figures above the spandrels are mirrors of each other, these Ignudi are all different.

These variations become greater with each pair until the postures of the final four bear <b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> each other whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–1818) was {{the final}} and decisive {{conflict}} between the British East India Company (EIC) and the Hindu Maratha Empire in India. The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of the Hindu Maratha territory by British East India Company troops, the largest such British controlled force massed in India. The troops were led by the Governor General Hastings (<b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of Bengal) supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop. Operations began against the Pindaris, a band of Mercenaries and Marathas from central India.|$|E

The group realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management, so recruited Tony Smith (<b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Charisma Records boss Tony Stratton-Smith). The tour was filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release, but {{was rejected by the}} band who felt it was not up to standard. The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973, with three shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Air Mata Iboe {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Njoo Cheong Seng under his penname M. d'Amour; he had previously directed Djantoeng Hati (Heart and Soul; 1941), which also had a tragic ending, for the company. The film was produced by the company's owner, Fred Young. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young (<b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Fred), RdIsmail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego. Other roles were held by established singers of keroncong (traditional music with Portuguese influences), including Soerip, Titing, Soelami, Ning Nong, and Poniman. The film, which used make-up to make Fifi Young age into an old woman over the course of its plot, was the actress' first for Majestic; she had been ill during the production of her husband's debut for the company.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (<b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

5|$|Eleven other {{historical}} {{counties have}} existed in Massachusetts, most becoming defunct when their lands were {{absorbed into the}} colony of New Hampshire or the state of Maine, {{both of which were}} created out of territory originally claimed by Massachusetts colonists. The oldest counties still in Massachusetts are Essex County, Middlesex County, and Suffolk County, created in 1643 with the original Norfolk County which was absorbed by New Hampshire and bears <b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the modern Norfolk County. When these counties were created, they were a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which would remain separate from the Plymouth Colony and that colony's counties until 1691. Hampden County, created in 1812, is the most recently created county still in Massachusetts, although Penobscot County, Maine bore that distinction until Maine broke off from Massachusetts in 1820. The majority of Massachusetts counties are named in honor of English place names, reflecting Massachusetts' colonial heritage.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Dina Eastwood {{announced}} {{that she and her}} husband had been living separately for an undisclosed length of time. On October 23, 2013, Dina filed for divorce after she withdrew her request for legal separation, citing irreconcilable differences. She asked for full custody of their 16-year-old daughter, Morgan, as well as spousal support. The divorce was finalized on December 22, 2014. Eastwood has since been linked publicly with photographer Erica Tomlinson-Fisher (<b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Frances), 41 years his junior, and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera, 33 years his junior. He and Sandera went public with their relationship at the 87th Academy Awards in February 2015.|$|E
5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have <b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the United Kingdom. London {{has also been a}} centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Saint Paul has a {{variation}} of the strong mayor-council form of government. The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body. The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population. Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms. The current mayor is Chris Coleman (DFL), who is <b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> former mayor Norm Coleman. Coleman is Saint Paul's ninth Irish-American mayor since 1900. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had {{maintained}} {{the attacks on}} airfields in south-western England which they had started the previous day. On 12 August, most of the Kentish airfields had been attacked; and on 13 August, the Germans concentrated on the second line airfields south of London. The concentration on Detling and Eastchurch was a failure, as both were Coastal Command stations and bore <b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> Fighter Command. The Germans may have reasoned that if bases such as Manston, Hawkinge and Lympne were neutralised through the attacks on 12 August, then Fighter Command may have had to move onto these airfields. In fact, the bombing of 12 August had failed to knock out these strips, and Adlertag had failed to destroy or render Detling or Eastchurch nonoperational. Owing to poor intelligence, weather conditions, and RAF resistance, attacks on other targets had failed or been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport of}} {{baseball}} {{began to be}} played {{in the years following}} the Civil War; a team known as the St. Louis Brown Stockings was founded in 1875. The Brown Stockings were {{a founding member of the}} National League and became a hometown favorite, defeating the Chicago White Stockings (later the Chicago Cubs) in their opener on May 6, 1875. The original Brown Stockings club closed in 1878, and an unrelated National League team with the same name was founded in 1882. This team repeatedly changed its name, shortening to the Browns in 1883, becoming the Perfectos in 1899, and settling on the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900. In 1902, a team moved to St. Louis from Milwaukee and adopted the name St. Louis Browns, although they had <b>no</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the previous Browns or Brown Stockings. From 1902 until the 1950s, St. Louis was home to two Major League teams.|$|E
