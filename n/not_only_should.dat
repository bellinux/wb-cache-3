25|$|The {{theological}} {{basis for}} forgiveness in Hinduism {{is that a}} person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of anger and unresolved emotions that affect his or her present as well as future. In Hinduism, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E
25|$|Surgery was {{formally}} taught in Italy {{even though it}} was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the formal learning of surgery was Guy de Chauliac. He insisted that a proper surgeon should have a specific knowledge of the human body such as anatomy, food and diet of the patient, and other ailments that may have affected the patients. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> surgeons have knowledge about the body but they should also be well versed in the liberal arts. In this way, surgery was no longer regarded as a lower practice, but instead began to be respected and gain esteem and status.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{dealing with}} sexual {{harassment}} as it occurs, using the designated procedures, prevention {{is often used}} to eliminate sexual harassment before it begins, particularly in schools.The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has stated that training is part of the prevention of sexual harassment in schools and in their 2001 publishing of Sexual Harassment Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students or Third Parties, they have indicated that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> academic institutions provide faculty and teacher training, but also provide students with classroom resources in order to make them aware of what constitutes sexual harassment and what to do if it occurs. It is often recommended that consistent anti-sexual harassment workshops begin in the younger grades so that students remain informed and the policies are strongly enforced.|$|E

25|$|One {{issue that}} sparked {{tensions}} between France and Canada began {{shortly after the}} creation of la Francophonie, an international organization of wholly and partially French-speaking countries modeled somewhat after the Commonwealth of Nations. While Canada agreed in principle to the organization's creation, it was dismayed by France's position that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> Quebec participate as an equal, independent member, but {{that the federal government}} and (by omission) the other provinces with significant French minorities could not. This was seen by many French-Canadians outside of Quebec as a betrayal. This was also seen by some Canadians as France supporting the Quebec sovereignty movement. Some go as far as saying the Francophonie was created to help push the international recognition of Quebec, but in reality the Francophonie was created to promote international cooperation between all French speaking nations, including many newly independent former French colonies in Africa.|$|E
25|$|In {{the arch}} dam, {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, {{crowds at}} events at Arlington National Cemetery were {{too large to}} be {{accommodated}} by the amphitheater. A larger structure was clearly needed. Judge Ivory Kimball, Commander of the Department of the Potomac chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic, believed that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> a new and larger facility be built, but also that the new amphitheater memorialize the dead of all wars in which the nation had fought. Kimball and the GAR began their push for a new amphitheater in 1903, but legislation failed to pass {{for the next five}} years. Legislation authorizing the establishment of a memorial was finally enacted in 1908, but almost no funding was provided for the amphitheater's design and none for its construction. In 1912, legislation was introduced by Senator George Sutherland to authorize construction of a 5,000-seat memorial amphitheater. Prospects for passage initially seemed dim. But during the third session of the 62nd Congress, a number of new federal memorials were approved, including the Arlington Memorial Bridge, the Lincoln Memorial, a memorial to women who served in the Civil War (now the American Red Cross National Headquarters), and a George Washington memorial auditorium. The successful push for new memorials helped supporters win passage of legislation authorizing construction of Memorial Amphitheater. President William Howard Taft, in one of his last acts as president, signed the legislation into law on March 4, 1913.|$|E

500|$|Although some architects {{designed}} the earlier Commissioners' churches in neoclassical style, most were in Gothic Revival style. [...] The earliest of the Gothic Revival churches were based loosely on the Early English style, with single or paired lancet windows between buttresses in {{the sides of}} the church, and stepped triple lancets at the east end. [...] Others were in a [...] "stilted Perpendicular" [...] style,. with [...] "thin west towers, thin buttresses, fat pinnacles, and interiors with three galleries and plaster vaults". [...] These features were only loosely derived from medieval Gothic architecture, and were not true representations of it. [...] A major influence on the subsequent development of the Gothic Revival was AWNPugin (1812–52) and, influenced by him, the Cambridge Camden Society (later named the Ecclesiological Society). [...] Among other things, they argued that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> Gothic be the only right and proper style for churches, but that their features should be accurate representations of that style; they should be [...] "correct" [...] Gothic features, rather than being loosely derived from the style. [...] The term [...] "pre-archaeological" [...] was used to describe churches designed using features only loosely derived from true Gothic.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson took a {{proactive}} role in increasing {{the stature of}} the Canadian viceregal office, travelling widely, hosting lavish state events, and hosting conferences and forums. However, criticism soon ensued over the way her office was spending Crown funds, as, during her tenure, expenditures at Rideau Hall increased 200%; the budget for 2003 was estimated at CAD$41 million. Part of this increase was due to accounting reasons; some costs {{that had previously been}} worked into the budgets of ministries were transferred to the governor general's office. But, the event that the media mostly focused on was Clarkson's 2003, 19-day circumpolar [...] "northern identity" [...] tour, which included state visits to Russia, Finland, and Iceland, and the attendance of 50 other Canadians prominent in the fields of arts, culture, and science. In an atmosphere tainted by several spending scandals in the government, the trip's estimated CAD$1 million cost was attacked as a waste of money. All together, this resulted in some politicians calling for the role of the governor general to be reduced or even for the position to be eliminated, and a poll taken late in 2003 found a majority of respondents thought Clarkson was [...] "too grand" [...] for the office. In an unprecedented move for a vicereine, Clarkson, and not her ministers, personally addressed the controversy, explaining that she had been asked to undertake the state visits by her prime minister. Still, though the Office of the Governor General defended the tour as successful, particularly with regard to the warm reception Clarkson received in Russia and during her meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and it was the Department of Foreign Affairs that commissioned and paid for the trip with funds approved by parliament, when the end cost for the trips came in at CAD$5 million, a scheduled continuation of the tour that would have included visits to Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Greenland was scrapped by the federal government in early 2004. John Fraser later stated Prime Minister Paul Martin left Clarkson to defend herself because he [...] "clearly didn't like her very much" [...] and [...] "even if it was Madam Clarkson's (and John Ralston Saul's) own imaginative idea, it had been officially supported by the government, and no appointed high official should ever be abandoned like that. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>should</b> she have been defended publicly, we were made to look foolish {{in the eyes of the}} countries who had to be informed that the trip to such great allies as Sweden, Norway and Denmark (plus its province of Greenland) was called off." ...|$|E
