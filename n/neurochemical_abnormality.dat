40|$|The high {{incidence}} and serious nature of schizo-phrenia {{has led to}} extensive efforts to discover macro-or microscopic lesions in the brain that could cause the illness. Failure to identify such lesions [1] has lent support {{to a number of}} hypotheses that propose changes in the molecular architecture of the brain as the basis of schizophrenia. Both neuroimaging techniques and brain tissue obtained post-mortem have been used to gain direct evidence to support such hypotheses. It is now pertinent to review the outcomes of key studies using these two techniques and how they are influencing current thinking on the neuro-biology of schizophrenia. This review will not address the basic biochemistry of neurochemical systems which are extensively reviewed elsewhere [2].

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAutistic {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) don’t {{have the}} same etiology. Platelet hyperserotonemia remain the most common <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormality</b> in these patients. The main producer and storage of peripheral serotonin are enteric enterochromaffin cells – serotonin cells. Platelet hyperserotonemia may result from disorders in the synthesis and/or release of enteric serotonin. An increased {{number of people with}} ASD have gastrointestinal disorders. Some of them have a serotonergic background. AimThe aim was to assess the serotonin cells in the duodenal mucosa of patients with ASD. Material and methodsStudy group: 30 children with ASD, including 73 % with duodenitis chronica. Control group (patients without ASD) : 45 patients, 56 % with duodenitis chronica. Immunohistochemical assessment of the number of serotonin cells was performed. ’ResultsChildren with ASD and duodenitis have fewer serotonin cells than autistic children with a normal picture of the duodenum. Children with ASD and chronic duodenitis have fewer serotonin cells than patients from the control group. Patients from the control group, suffering from chronic duodenitis have an increased number of serotonin cells in relation to children without inflammatory lesions in the duodenum. ConclusionsThe serotonergic profiles of the GI tract of autistic patients and their peers without autistic symptoms are different. In the course of chronic duodenitis in patients with ASD the number of serotonin cells falls while in persons without autistic features it increases significantly. Chronic duodenitis contributes to {{an increase in the number}} of serotonin cells in persons without autistic features while decreasing it in patients with ASD...|$|E

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, clinical symptoms that include cognitive and sleep disturbances, and other abnormalities such as increased sensitivity to painful stimuli, increased sensitivity to multiple sensory modalities, and altered pain modulatory mechanisms. Here we relate experimental findings of fibromyalgia symptoms to anatomical and functional brain changes. Neuroimaging studies show augmented sensory processing in pain-related areas, which, together with gray matter decreases and <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in areas related to pain modulation, supports the psychophysical evidence of altered pain perception and inhibition. Gray matter decreases in areas related to emotional decision making and working memory suggest that cognitive disturbances {{could be related to}} brain alterations.

40|$|CONTEXT: A major {{limitation}} {{on the development}} of biomarkers and novel interventions for schizophrenia is that its pathogenesis is unknown. Although elevated striatal dopamine activity is thought to be fundamental to schizophrenia, it is unclear when this <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormality</b> develops in relation to the onset of illness and how this relates to the symptoms and neurocognitive impairment seen in individuals with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether striatal dopamine function is elevated in individuals with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia before the onset of psychosis and to assess how this relates to the symptoms and neurocognitive impairment. DESIGN: Case-control study of in vivo striatal dopaminergic function. SETTING: Academic research. Patients Patients were recruited from a community mental health service. Twenty-four patients having prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia were compared with 7 patients having schizophrenia and with 12 matched healthy control subjects from the same community. Main Outcome Measure Striatal 6 -fluoro-l-dopa F 18 -dopa uptake measured using positron emission tomographic (18) F-dopa imaging. RESULTS: Striatal (18) F-dopa uptake was elevated in patients with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia (effect size, 0. 75) to an intermediate degree compared with that in patients with schizophrenia (effect size, 1. 25). The elevation was localized in the associative striatum in both groups. Moreover, striatal (18) F-dopa uptake in patients with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia was correlated with the severity of prodromal psychopathologic and neuropsychological impairment but not with the severity of anxiety or depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that dopamine overactivity predates the onset of schizophrenia in individuals with prodromal psychotic symptoms, is predominantly localized in the associative striatum, and is correlated with the severity of symptoms and neurocognitive dysfunction...|$|E

We previously identified abnormalities of multiple molecules associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission, including changes in NMDA receptor subunit transcripts and binding sites and NMDA receptor-associated post-synaptic density (PSD) protein transcripts in the thalamus of elderly patients with schizophrenia. In the present study, we performed western blot analysis to determine whether protein levels of NMDA receptor subunits (NR 1, NR 2 A, NR 2 B) and associated PSD proteins (NF-L, PSD 95, SAP 102) are altered in schizophrenia. Thalamic tissue from each subject was grossly dissected into two regions: a dorsomedial region containing limbic-associated dorsomedial, anterior and central medial thalamic nuclei; and a ventral thalamus region that primarily consisted of the ventral lateral nucleus. We observed increased protein expression of the NR 2 B NMDA receptor subunit and its associated intracellular protein, PSD 95, in the dorsomedial thalamus of patients with schizophrenia, but the other molecules were unchanged, and we found no changes in the ventral thalamus. These data provide additional evidence of thalamic <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> particularly in thalamic nuclei which project to limbic regions of the brain.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} {{fibromyalgia}} is unknown. However, several hypotheses {{have been developed}} including [...] "central sensitization". This theory proposes that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased reactivity of pain-sensitive nerve cells in the spinal cord or brain. Neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder often co-occur with fibromyalgia – {{the reason for this}} comorbidity appears to be due to shared genetic abnormalities, which leads to impairments in monoaminergic, glutamatergic, neurotrophic, opioid and proinflammatory cytokine signaling. In these vulnerable individuals, psychological stress or illness can cause abnormalities in inflammatory and stress pathways which regulate mood and pain. Eventually, a sensitization and kindling effect occur in certain neurons leading to the establishment of fibromyalgia and sometimes a mood disorder. The evidence suggests that the pain in fibromyalgia results primarily from pain processing pathways functioning abnormally. In simple terms, it can be described as the volume of the neurons being set too high and this hyper-excitability of pain processing pathways and under-activity of inhibitory pain pathways in the brain results in the affected individual experiencing pain. Some <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormalities</b> that occur in fibromyalgia also regulate mood, sleep, and energy, thus explaining why mood, sleep, and fatigue problems are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia.|$|R

The work by Storvik and colleagues recently published on Alcohol and Alcoholism shows some interesting {{differences on the}} SERT brain density between the type I and type II alcoholic subtypes. Critically, these findings on different serotonergic role in subtypes of alcohol-dependence revive the concept that alcohol addiction is a heterogeneous disorder associated with varying <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Studies testing serotonergic medications in alcohol-dependent patients classified according to subtypes have shown interesting findings.

40|$|Nocturnal {{enuresis}} (NE) is {{a common}} disorder in school-aged children. Previous studies have reported that children with NE exhibit structural, functional and <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the brain, suggesting that children with NE may have cognitive problems. Additionally, children with NE {{have been shown to}} process emotions differently from control children. In fact, most cases of NE resolve with age. However, adults who had experienced NE during childhood may still have potential cognitive or emotion problems, and this possibility has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate brain functional changes in adults with a history of NE. Two groups, consisting of 21 adults with NE and 21 healthy controls, were scanned using fMRI. We did not observe a significant abnormality in activation during the Go/NoGo and Stroop tasks in adults with a history of NE compared with the control group. However, compared to healthy subjects, young adults with a history of NE mainly showed increased activation in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex while looking at negative vs. neutral pictures. Our results demonstrate that adults with a history of childhood NE have no obvious deficit in response inhibition or cognitive control but showed abnormal neural responses to emotional stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Homer 1 mutant mice exhibit {{behavioral}} and <b>neurochemical</b> <b>abnormalities</b> {{that are consistent}} with an animal model of schizophrenia. Because the Homer 1 gene encodes both immediate early gene (IEG) and constitutively expressed (CC) gene products, we used the local infusion of adeno-associated viral vectors carrying different Homer 1 transcriptional variants into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to distinguish between the roles for IEG and CC Homer 1 isoforms in the "schizophrenia-like" phenotype of Homer 1 mutant mice. PFC overexpression of the IEG Homer 1 isoform Homer 1 a reversed the genotypic differences in behavioral adaptation to repeated stress, whereas overexpression of the constitutively expressed Homer 1 isoform Homer 1 c reversed the genotypic differences in sensorimotor and cognitive processing, as well as cocaine behavioral sensitivity. Homer 1 a overexpression did not influence PFC basal glutamate content but blunted the glutamate response to cocaine in wild-type mice. In contrast, Homer 1 c overexpression reversed the genotypic difference in PFC basal glutamate content and enhanced cocaine-induced elevations in glutamate. These data demonstrate active and distinct roles for Homer 1 a and Homer 1 c isoforms in the PFC in the mediation of behavior, in the maintenance of basal extracellular glutamate, and in the regulation of PFC glutamate release relevant to schizophrenia and stimulant abuse comorbidity...|$|R
