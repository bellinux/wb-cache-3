The police, he argued, had been in <b>negligent</b> <b>breach</b> of their [...] "legal duty to exercise reasonable care in considering, investigating, recommending and ultimately granting McArdell's application for a firearm licence." [...] They had incurred vicarious liability, in that their dereliction of duty, unwittingly but effectively, had enabled McArdell's assault.|$|E
5000|$|Explaining his decision, Sir Joseph Canley stated: [...] "As I {{have already}} stated, the primary duty {{was on the}} Club and the {{functions}} of the County Council were supervisory and its liability is for <b>negligent</b> <b>breach</b> of a common law duty arising out {{of the way in which}} they dealt with or ignored their statutory powers. That duty was not a duty to the Club but a duty to the spectators and other persons in the stand. However, the responsibility of the Club is, in my view, very much the greater and I apportion responsibility between the two defendants as to two-thirds on the first defendant and one-third on the third (sic) defendant." ...|$|E
50|$|Delict (from Latin dēlictum, past participle of dēlinquere ‘to be at fault, offend’) {{is a term}} {{in civil}} law jurisdictions for a civil wrong {{consisting}} of an intentional or <b>negligent</b> <b>breach</b> of duty of care that inflicts loss or harm and which triggers legal liability for the wrongdoer; however, its meaning varies from one jurisdiction to another. Other civil wrongs include breach of contract and breach of trust. Liability is imposed {{on the basis of}} moral responsibility, i.e. a duty of care or to act, and fault (culpa) is the main element of liability. The term is used in mixed legal systems such as Scotland, South Africa, Louisiana and the Philippines, but tort is the equivalent legal term used in common law jurisdictions.|$|E
50|$|Distinguish {{alternative}} liability {{from the}} smoke-out function of res ipsa loquitur {{seen in the}} leading case of Ybarra v. Spangard. In Ybarra, the plaintiff brought all defendants who could have possibly been <b>negligent</b> (<b>breached</b> a duty of reasonable care) {{so that they could}} show which party actually was negligent. Thus, in the smoke-out function of res ipsa, the burden is shifted on the defendants to show negligence, whereas in alternative liability all defendants are all shown to have breached a duty of reasonable care and the plaintiff shifts the burden to show causation.|$|R

40|$|According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 59 {{percent of}} all adults {{consider}} education essential to getting ahead in life. At the same time, {{an increasing number of}} adults have begun to blame educators for their failure in life, claiming educational malpractice. Historically, education has been more of an issue {{at the state and local}} levels. Courts do not recognize educational malpractice as a tort because of public policy concerns, saying that claims of “educational malfeasance ” are not capable of assessment within the judicial forum. Over 20 years have passed since the California Appellate Court dismissed a case brought for <b>negligent</b> <b>breach</b> of duty to educate in Peter W. v. San Francisco Unified School Dist. (1976). This paper will survey lawsuits involving teachers and administrators brought since Peter. It will also explore some new areas of liability for professors and administrators: conducting study abroad programs and helping graduates gain employment...|$|E
40|$|Section 61 of the Trustee Act 1925 {{provides}} that: “ 61. Power {{to relieve}} trustee from personal liability If {{it appears to}} the court that a trustee, whether appointed by the court or otherwise, is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred {{before or after the}} commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which he committed such breach, then the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same. ” This provision affords the court the power to excuse a trustee’s breach of trust. It was originally intended to ensure that lay persons would not be deterred from acting as trustees, since the court could exercise its discretion under section 61 to relieve them from liability if they acted honestly and reasonably. But given the increasing prevalence of professional trustees, it was thought that section 61 might become of much reduced importance. One leading study suggested that,“[l]eft alone, section 61 may continue to lie dormant, rising only occasionally to rescue a lay trustee from liability for a technical but <b>negligent</b> <b>breach</b> of duty”. </p...|$|E
40|$|Social life is {{inherently}} risky. Who should bear {{the costs of}} accidental harm? That issue has been traditionally addressed in tort legal doctrine under the concept of breach of the negligence standard of care. Trial courts provide juries with instructions that, put roughly, direct the jury {{to decide whether the}} defendant’s conduct fell below what a reasonably prudent person would have done if in the defendant’s circumstances. Without further judicial direction on that issue, the jury effectively has excessive discretion in rendering a verdict. Such discretion, opens the door for at least two kinds of potential injustice. Juries could treat like cases differently, and juries can easily ignore or fail to give due consideration to a society’s diverse, irreconcilable, and competing conceptions of the good as to what constitutes reasonable prudence. To mitigate such, I have created “democratic standard theory. ” I claim that a theory based on the overarching moral and political commitments of the Kantian tradition can only specify what constitutes <b>negligent</b> <b>breach</b> if it incorporates, as facts, the actual values of the individuals subject to the risk at issue. Since individuals’ comprehensive conceptions of the good conflict, majority rule, constrained by constitutional essentials, should determine what constitutes breach of the negligence standard of care. Thus, in each dispute over negligence in tort, democratic standard theory sets the stakes of negligent risk, especially the costs of accidental harm, in accordance with the values of as many as possible of the individuals locally affected by the particular kind of act at issue. ...|$|E

Among these are breach of fiduciary duty owed to church members, negligence in hiring, supervision and retention of clergy, intentional or negligent infliction of mental distress and vicarious liability for torts committed by individual clergy.

40|$|This report aims to {{encourage}} optometrists {{to reflect on}} the legal implications of clinical contact lens practice, with particular reference to the practice of orthokeratology (ortho-k), which has seen a recent revival of interest. A patient may claim compensation if an optometrist is <b>negligent</b> by <b>breaching</b> his duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in diagnosis, advice or treatment. However, the optometrist will only be liable for reasonably foreseeable harm to the patient, so practitioners need to be fully aware of the foreseeable risks. Failure to adequately inform the patient may lead to a claim for negligence, if disclosure of the risks would have influenced the patient's decision to undergo or forego the procedure. It is important that the professional bodies establish guidelines on acceptable practice, with particular emphasis on the provision of information to patients. Reasonable disclosure, use of appropriate information/consent forms, and proper documentation of cases, should all focus on the needs of, and benefits to, patients. School of Optometr...|$|R

2500|$|The third kind of remedy, for {{unauthorised}} gains, is restitution. In Murad v Al Saraj the Murad sisters {{entered a}} joint venture (creating a fiduciary relation, like for trustees) with Mr Al Saraj to buy a hotel. He deceitfully told them he was investing all his own money, when in fact he set off a debt from the seller and took an undisclosed commission. When sued {{to give up the}} profits he made, he submitted that the sisters would have entered the transaction even if they had known what he had done. Arden LJ rejected this argument, affirming that upon such a wrong, it was not open for the fiduciary to argue what might, hypothetically, have happened. A reduction in liability could only come from a determination of the value of skill and effort contributed. This is less generously quantified for dishonest fiduciaries, but generous allowances are typically given, as in Boardman v Phipps for fiduciaries who all along act honestly. Trustees who are found to commit wrongs may also have a defence under the Trustee Act 1925 sections 61–62. This gives courts discretion to relieve liability for people who acted [...] "honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused". There may also be exclusion clauses in the trust deed, up to the point of removing liability for fraud and open conflicts of interest. Chiefly exclusion clauses will erase liability for breaches of the duty of care, although for professional trustees the ability to do this is constrained by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. If agreements for money management take place through contracts, a professional trustee probably cannot exclude liability for breach of contract under section 3, because given that he would be better placed to take out insurance liability exclusion will probably not be reasonable under section 11. Lastly, the Limitation Act 1980 sections 21–22 prevents claims for innocent or <b>negligent</b> trust <b>breach</b> being pursued six years after the right of action accrues, again with the exception for fraud or property converted by trustees for their own use, where there is no limit.|$|R
40|$|As {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles {{have become}} more affordable, their popularity with {{the general public and}} commercial organisations has seen significant growth in recent years. Whilst remaining a device for both the hobbyist and aircraft-enthusiast to enjoy, they are now also used for carrying out activities such as law enforcement surveillance, agricultural maintenance, acquiring specialist movie and sports event footage along with search and seizure activities. Conversely, despite maintaining many legitimate uses, there are also increasing media reports of unmanned aerial vehicle technology being abused, ranging from physical assaults due to <b>negligent</b> flights to <b>breaches</b> of Civil Aviation Authority Air Navigation Regulations, requiring a forensic analysis of these devices in order to establish the chain of events. This article presents an introductory discussion of unmanned aerial vehicle analysis and provides the results of a digital forensic investigation of a test Parrot Bebop unmanned aerial vehicle. Directions for the acquisition and analysis of the device's internal storage are provided along with an interpretation of on-board flight data, captured media and operating system. Further, as the device can be controlled via Android and iOS devices using the application FreeFlight 3, forensic analysis of these devices is also presented. Results showed the ability to recover flight data from both the unmanned aerial vehicle and controller handsets along with captured media, however problems exist with establishing the definitive owner of the device, particularly if a user had abandoned it at the scene of a crime...|$|R
50|$|Negligence is {{the breach}} of a duty of care. In general, {{the law allows}} me to mind my own business. Thus, if I happen to see someone else's child about to drown in a pool, ordinarily I do not owe a legal duty to anyone {{to try to save}} it. But {{sometimes}} the law requires me to be my brother's keeper. This happens, for example, when the circumstances are such that I owe him a duty of care; and I am <b>negligent</b> if I <b>breach</b> it. I owe him such a duty if a diligens paterfamilias, that notional epitome of reasonable prudence, in the position in which I am in sic, would—(a) foresee the possibility of harm occurring to him; and(b) take steps to guard against its occurrence.Foreseeability of harm to a person, whether he be a specific individual or one of a category, is usually not a difficult question, but when ought I to guard against it? It depends upon the circumstances in each particular case, and it is neither necessary nor desirable to attempt a formulation which would cover all cases. For the purposes of the present case it is sufficient to say, by way of general approach, that if I launch a potentially dangerous undertaking involving the foreseeable possibility of harm to another, the circumstances may be such that I cannot reasonably shrug my shoulders in unconcern but have certain responsibilities in the matter—the duty of care.|$|R
