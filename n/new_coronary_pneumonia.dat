40|$|BACKGROUND: Extreme fatigue is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients, and is {{associated with an increased}} risk for new cardiac events. The objective of the Exhaustion Intervention Trial (EXIT) was to determine whether a behavioral intervention on exhaustion reduces the risk of a <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> event after PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven hundred ten consecutive patients, ages 35 to 68 years, who felt exhausted after PCI were randomized into an intervention group and a usual-care group. The intervention was based on group therapy focusing on stressors leading to exhaustion, and on support for recovery by promoting rest and making rest more efficient. One month after PCI, 50 % of the patients felt exhausted. The intervention reduced the odds of remaining exhausted at 18 months by 56 % in those without a previous history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR = 0. 44; 95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 66), but had no effect on exhaustion in those with a history of CAD (OR = 0. 93; 95 % CI 0. 56 - 1. 55; p =. 78). The intervention did not reduce the risk of a <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> event within 2 years (RR = 1. 14; 95 %CI 0. 82 - 1. 57). Post-hoc analyses suggest that the effect of the intervention was limited by a positive history of CAD, the presence of a chronic, painful condition (especially rheumatism), and by opposite effects on early and late cardiac events. CONCLUSION: A behavioral intervention in PCI patients has a beneficial effect on feelings of exhaustion.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{studies have shown that}} early post-infarction angina was a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction, not a single study has considered this issue in the elderly. The goal of this study, based on a five-year follow-up of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction, was to determine whether early post-infarction angina in the elderly had any influence on mortality and the incidence of additional coronary events. The study population consisted of 51 patients, aged 60 years or more, with acute myocardial infarction. Early post-infarction angina occurred in 31 subjects (Group 1), while it did not in 20 subjects (Group 2). Patients were monitored for five years and the incidences of death and <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> events were recorded. A survival analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prognostic}} role of the Lewis antigenic system, Chlamydia pneumoniae(CP) seropositivity (CP+), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in unstable angina (UA). BackgroundThe role of CP infection in acute coronary syndromes is contradictory. The Lewis antigenic system, a genetically determined blood group system associated with infections and several disorders, including ischemic heart disease, might influence the susceptibility to CP infection, inflammatory response, and risk of cardiac ischemic events. MethodsThe CRP levels, Lewis antigens, and CP+ were measured in 54 patients with Braunwald’s class IIIB UA. All patients were followed up for one year, and the occurrence of <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> events (coronary death, myocardial infarction, and recurrence of instability) were recorded. ResultsTwenty-five coronary events occurred during follow-up. At univariate analysis CRP > 3 mg/l (CRP+) (p = 0. 0056), Lewis antigen b (Leb+) (p = 0. 028), and the combination of Leb+ and CP+ (p = 0. 006) and of CRP+ and Leb+ (p = 0. 003) were associated with <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> events, while CP+ alone was not. At multivariate analysis, CRP+ (p = 0. 008) and combined Leb+CP+ (p = 0. 03) were independent predictors of worse outcome. The event rate was 64 % in CRP+ patients, 67 % in Leb+CP+ patients, and 86 % in CRP+Leb+CP+ patients. Combined Leb+CP+, but not Leb+ and CP+ alone, was related to CRP levels (p = 0. 03). Among CP+ patients, CRP levels were higher in Leb+ than Leb- (p = 0. 028).

40|$|ObjectiveIt is {{important}} for coronary active perfusion systems to avoid myocardial ischemia during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. We have developed a new concept for a perfusion system to pump blood based on changes in helium gas volume. This system uses a conventional intra-aortic balloon pump to activate the perfusion pump. Our study used basic and animal experiments to investigate the most suitable system for coronary perfusion using this new concept. MethodsA conventional intra-aortic balloon pump was used to supply power. A device for perfusion was developed with a balloon placed inside a stiff syringe barrel. The device {{was connected to the}} helium gas line of the intra-aortic balloon pump. Changes in flow with changes in augmentation level were noted when volumes outside and within the balloon were changed. Six pigs with occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were used for system validation, with monitoring to identify changes in hemodynamics and cardiac enzyme levels. ResultsIn the basic experiment, an 80 -mL outside volume and 3. 0 -mL inner volume resulted in the greatest percentage change in flow rate with respect to changes in augmentation. In the animal experiment, the <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> active perfusion system prevented myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion. ConclusionsWe clarified the most suitable method for our <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> active perfusion system. Using this system, safe anastomosis was consistently performed in animal experiments.

Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study that evaluated 740 consecutive patients presenting for diagnostic coronary arteriography between 1977 and 1978. Beginning in 1988, patients with arteriographic CAD (n = 350) were recontacted and asked to complete detailed medical questionnaires. Case and control patients were stratified by development of <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> events, including death from ischemic heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction and revascularization.

Aim: To assess and report the long-term results of LIMA to LAD bypass grafting for isolated LDA lesions. Patients and methods: Retrospective analysis of the medical records and surgical protocols of 40 patients (aged 60 ± 10 years, 28 male) subjected to coronary surgery between 1992 and 2002. Results: Thirty-four patients presented with unstable angina. On angiography, the LAD had a proximal obstruction in 35 patients. Sixteen presented with a myocardial infarction of the LAD territory. Six were managed previously with angioplasty; four had a new critical obstruction, 1 was catalogued as a procedure failure, and one was totally occluded. There was no operative mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke or need for re operation. There were two late deaths, caused by an advanced cardiac failure at 120 months in one patient, and chronic renal failure at 61 months of follow-up in another. Actuarial survival probability was 100 %, 93 % and 75 % at 1, 5 and 10 years.

Recent angiographic trials have generally demonstrated that normalization of plasma lipoprotein profiles reduces the rate of progression of established coronary lesions, but limited data exist on how these treatments influence {{the development of new}} lesions. Methods. Three hundred men and women with coronary artery disease were randomized to multifactor risk reduction or usual care. Highly significant improvements in risk factors were achieved by the risk reduction group compared with minimal changes by the usual care group. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed on entry and after 4 years under identical conditions. A decrement in the minimal diameter of visually normal segments > 0. 2 mm was considered to indicate new lesion formation. Results. A total of 1, 605 segments, representing 257 patients, were considered normal at baseline, with 804 and 801 disease-free segments in the usual care and risk reduction groups, respectively. Ninety-nine segments (6. 1 %) were identified by follow-up quantitative angiography and two angiographic observers as having new lesion formation (usual care 7. 6 %, risk reduction 4. 7 %, p = 0. 05). New lesion formation was observed in 41 (31 %) of 131 patients in the usual care group and in 29 (23 %) of 126 patients in the risk reduction group (p = 0. 16), with a mean number of new lesions/patient of 0. 47 in the usual care group and 0. 30 in the risk reduction group (p = 0. 06).

The odds ratios for low job control were 2. 38 and 1. 56 for self-reported and externally assessed job control, respectively. Work characteristics were simultaneously adjusted and controlled for employment grade level, negative affectivity, and coronary risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: This is apparently the first report showing independent effects of components of two alternative job stress models-the effort-reward imbalance model and the job strain model (job control only) -on coronary heart disease...|$|R
40|$|A 50 -year-old man, {{a former}} smoker, {{presented}} with an ST-segment elevation anterior myocardial infarction that {{was treated with}} thrombolysis in another center. Because {{of the absence of}} reperfusion criteria, he was referred to our hospital for a rescue coronary intervention. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed that the overall left-ventricle systolic function was pre-served but with apical akinesia. Coronary angiography revealed an occlusive lesion (100 %) in the mid-left anterior descend-ing coronary artery distal to a segment with a tapering caliber (Figure 1 A). At that time, the patient was asymptomatic, and, therefore, a conservative management was decided, including dual antiplatelet therapy and full anticoagulation. Biomarkers included elevated creatine kinase (peak: 926 U/L; n< 190), cre-atine kinase-MB peak (peak: 36. 4 ng/mL; n< 5), and troponin I peak (peak: 15. 90 ng/mL; n< 0. 2). A <b>new</b> <b>coronary</b> angiogram performed 7 days later revealed a complete recanalization of th...|$|R
