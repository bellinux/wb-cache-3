3000|$|The {{presence}} of contaminants {{can also be}} measured by its chemical parameters. Hardness of the drinking water is a naturally occurring contaminate, which basically depends on the geographical status. It is caused by significant amounts of calcium or magnesium components; the hardness is classified into carbonate or <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness</b> depending on what molecules are combined with calcium or magnesium. If they are combined with carbonate ions (CO 3 − 2 [...]), the hardness is termed as ‘carbonate hardness’; if combined with other ions, it is <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness.</b> Generally, 300 – 400  mg/L hardness is suitable for drinking purpose. Prolonged exposure to water containing salts (TDS > 500  mg/L) can cause kidney stone, etc.|$|E
30|$|Hardness {{of water}} {{relates to the}} {{reaction}} with soap as Ca and Mg ions precipitate soap. Hardness is expressed as mg/l of CaCO 3. If the hardness as CaCO 3 exceeds {{the difference between the}} alkalinity as CaCO 3 and hardness as CaCO 3, it is termed as <b>Non-Carbonate</b> <b>Hardness.</b> It is also called permanent hardness. From the Table  1, it can be delineated that the NCH values ranged from – 137.9 to 524.0 with an average of 114.8.|$|E
30|$|Quality {{of water}} {{resources}} in the Bandalamottu area of Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh in South India is facing a serious challenge due to Pb mining. Therefore, 40 groundwater samples were collected from this area to assess their hydrogeochemistry and suitability for irrigation purposes. The groundwater samples were analyzed for distribution of chemical elements Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, HCO 3 −, CO 32 −, F−, Cl−, and SO 42 −. It also includes pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness</b> and total alkalinity. The parameters, such as sodium absorption ratio (SAR), adjusted SAR, sodium percentage, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness,</b> Kelly’s ratio, magnesium ratio, permeability index, indices of base exchange (IBE) and Gibbs ratio were also calculated. The major hydrochemical facieses were Ca–HCO 3, Ca–Na–HCO 3 and Ca–Mg–Cl types. The result of saturation index calculated by Visual MINTEQ software combined with Gibbs diagram and IBE findings indicate that, dolomite and calcite dissolution and reverse ion exchange can be a major process controlling the water chemistry in the study area. The results also showed that the salinity (85  %, C 3 class) and alkalinity due to high concentration of HCO 3 − and CO 3 − and low Ca:Mg molar ratio (97.5  %, < 1), are the major problems with water for irrigation usage. As a result, {{the quality of the}} groundwater is not suitable for sustainable crop production and soil health without appropriate remediation.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{it is clear}} that about 42.5 % samples are falling in the area of 5 and this {{indicates}} that carbonate hardness (secondary alkalinity) exceeds 50 %. About 37.5 % samples are falling in the area of 9 and this indicates that none of the cation and anion pairs exceed 50 %. About 20 % samples are falling in the area of 6 which indicates that <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness</b> (secondary salinity) exceeds 50 %. The Piper diagram confirms that all the groundwaters in the study area are characterized as alkaline earth’s (Ca + Mg) exceeds alkalies (Na + K) and weak acids (CO 3  + HCO 3) exceed strong acids (SO 4  + Cl + F). This is due to the dolomitic rocks which are responsible for release of chemical elements into the groundwaters of the Tummalapalle area.|$|E
30|$|The {{salinity}} values {{varied from}} 0.01 to 0.89  ‰ (average: 0.08  ‰) while the Eh values varied from − 65.3 to 150.8  mV (mean: 31.74  mV). The temperature of water samples varied from 26 ° to 33  °C, {{with a mean}} value of 28.42  °C. The total alkalinity (as CaCO 3) was {{in the range of}} 13.4 – 266.7  mg/L (average: 36.94  mg/L), well within the permissible limit of 600  mg/L (BIS 1998). Average total hardness (as CaCO 3) was 63.30  mg/L, with a maximum and minimum value of 20 – 436  mg/L, well below the permissible limit of 600  mg/L (BIS 1998). All samples in Varahi river basin showed the hardness value higher than the alkalinity value illustrating <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness.</b> The calcium hardness (as CaCO 3) values ranged from 10 to 200  mg/L (mean: 35.22  mg/L), within the permissible limit of 200  mg/L (BIS 1998).|$|E
40|$|Optimum {{detergent}} dosage {{during a}} washing process depends on water quality, {{degree of pollution}} and quantity of laundry. Particularly, water quality is an important factor. Other parameters like carbonate- or <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness</b> and calcium / magnesium (Ca / Mg) ratio in addition to total hardness of water {{have an impact on}} the amount of detergent. This work discusses the possibilities realizing a detergent sensor that measures important parameters for the washing process and assess the ideal necessary amount of detergent during the washing process. The approach is to combine impedance spectroscopy with cyclic voltammetry in order to determine both water quality and concentration of detergent in the suds which build up the basis for an optimum detergent dosage. The results of cyclic voltammetry show that it is possible to identify the Ca / Mg ratio and the carbonate hardness separately, which is necessary for the optimization of the washing process. Impedance measurements identify total hardness and detergent concentrations...|$|E

The data are subjected to various hydrogeochem. interpretations. The results show that a large no. of samples have physico-chem. properties well within the permissible limits. According to USSL, the study area groundwater falls under mainly three types i. e., C 2 S 1 C 3 S 1 and C 3 S 2, which are suitable for irrigation of most crops, except one sample in C 3 S 4. From SAR classification, 75 % of the water samples are in carbonate hardness and only 25 % are <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness.</b> Based on Schoeller's water type classification 85 % of the samples are falling under type I and III except only three samples in type II.

3000|$|The {{suitability}} of groundwater for drinking and irrigation was assessed in Tummalapalle area. Forty groundwater samples were analysed for major cations, anions and other parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, {{total dissolved solids}} (TDS), total alkalinity and total hardness (TH). The parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio, adjusted sodium adsorption ratio (adj.SAR), per cent sodium, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness,</b> Kelly’s ratio and permeability index were calculated {{for the evaluation of}} irrigation water quality. Groundwater chemistry was also analysed by statistical analysis, USSL, Wilcox, Doneen, Piper and Chadhas diagrams, to find out their suitability for irrigation. TDS and TH were used as main parameters to interpret the {{suitability of}} groundwater for drinking purpose. The correlation coefficient matrix between the hydrochemical parameters was carried out using Pearson’s correlation to infer the possible water–rock interactions responsible for the variation of groundwater chemistry and this has been supported by Gibbs diagram. The results indicate that the groundwater in Tummalapalle area is alkaline in nature. Ca–Mg–HCO 3 is the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. Water chemistry of the study area strongly reflects the dominance of weathering of rock-forming minerals such as bicarbonates and silicates. All parameters and diagrams suggest that the water samples of the study are good for irrigation, and the plots of TDS and TH suggest that 12.5 % of the samples are good for human consumption.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} ground {{water in the}} Kabini river basin, {{covering}} an area of 7040 sq km 2 in Karnataka, has been studied based on the compn. of one hundred sixty one borewell water samples. An attempt {{has been made to}} classify the ground water by various methods. According to Bureau of Indian Stds., 97 % of the water samples in the study basin are within the desirable to permissible limit. 93 % Of the samples fall in C 2 -S 1 class of USSL diagram. According to Wilcox diagram, 91 % of samples fall within the excellent to permissible classes. In the Hill-Piper diagram, majority of the groundwater samples fall in the Ca, Mg-CO 3, HCO 3, and Na, K-CO 3, HCO 3 hydrochem. facies. This has been attributed to highly weathered and fractured nature of the basement rocks. By plotting on modified Hill-Piper diagram, it is found that majority of the samples have <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness</b> with a salinity ranging from 2. 5 to 23 epm. It is inferred that groundwater of the area has low sodium hazard and low to medium salinity. The range of dissolved components, the values of SAR and residual sodium carbonate indicate that 97 % of the water samples of the basin are suitable for domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes.

A total of 59 groundwater samples were collected from dug and tube wells in November 2008 to evaluate hydrochemistry and suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes. The physico-chemical parameters estimated include pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), redox potential (Eh), total hardness (TH), total alkalinity (TA), temperature, major cations and anions, besides irrigation quality parameters like boron, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), % Na, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), chlorinity index, soluble sodium percentage (SSP), exchangeable sodium ratio (ESR), <b>non-carbonate</b> <b>hardness,</b> potential salinity (PS), permeability index (PI), Kelly index (KI), magnesium hazard (MH), magnesium ratio (MR), index of base exchange. Chloride, sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations classified the groundwater samples into normal chloride, normal sulphate and normal bicarbonate water types, respectively. The Salinity (Class I; 98. 3 %), Chlorinity (Class I; 100 %) and Sodicity (Class 0; 96. 6 %) indices suggest the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. The Wilcox diagram illustrates that 96. 6 % of the samples belongs to excellent to good category, while the US Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram indicates the low salinity/low sodium content in 86. 44 % of samples (C 1 S 1). Positive index of base exchange in majority of the samples (91. 52 %) indicates direct base exchange reaction or chloro-alkaline equilibrium in the study area. The positive value of RSC in majority of samples signifying higher concentrations of HCO 3 over alkaline earths indicates that groundwater are base exchange-softened water as there is an exchange of alkaline earths for Na+ ions.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrated}} {{the importance of}} constructing graphical representations such as Piper trilinear diagram and Chadha’s plot using dissolved constituents (major cations and major anions) to effectively understand hydrochemical evolution, grouping and areal distribution of water facies of groundwater resources in an area. The Piper trilinear diagram {{can be used to}} illustrate the similarities and differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into certain chemical types, while Chadha’s plot can demonstrate the hydrochemical processes like recharging, reverse ion exchange, seawater mixing and base ion exchange chiefly acting in an aquifer. In the present study, piper trilinear diagram classified 93.48  % of the samples under Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–Cl−–SO 4 2 − type indicating the permanent hardness and remaining 6.52  % samples under Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–HCO 3 − type demonstrating temporary hardness. The piper plots further confirmed the existence of mixed type of water with no one cation–anion pair exceeding 50  % in majority of the analyzed samples. Chadha’s plot also demonstrated the dominance of reverse ion exchange water having permanent hardness (viz., Ca–Mg–Cl type) in majority of the samples over recharging water with temporary hardness (i.e., Ca–Mg–HCO 3 type). It is therefore evident that primary salinity and secondary alkalinity were dominant in majority of samples as indicated by permanent (<b>non-carbonate)</b> <b>hardness.</b> In contrast, secondary salinity and primary alkalinity were limited to only few samples as specified by temporary (carbonate) hardness. No typical seawater mixing or base ion exchange was observed in the study area as none of the samples belong to Na–Cl and Na–HCO 3 water types. Both the plots highlighted the contribution from the reverse ion-exchange processes besides the dominance of alkaline earth metals (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) over the alkalis (Na+, K+), and strong acidic anions (Cl−, SO 4 2 −) over the weak acidic anions (CO 3 2 −, HCO 3 −) in the study area. Further, PCA analysis established that water quality parameters under PC 1 and PC 2 (viz., 65.55 and 10.17  % of total variance) having strong loading (> 0.75) was considered to govern the groundwater quality in the study area. While water quality parameters under PC 3 and PC 4 though exhibited strong and positive loading by one parameter each, were considered insignificant due to a lesser percentage of variance (i.e., 6.88 and 6.52  %). Overall the groundwater quality was suitable for drinking and domestic purposes and permissible for irrigation activities.|$|E
