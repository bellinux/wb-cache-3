40|$|An {{open-label study}} was {{conducted}} of <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate,</b> given with reverse transcriptase inhibitors to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) -infected infants and children 3 months to 13 years of age.

An electrolyte composed of sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9. 24; 25 mmol L- 1), {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} (9 mmol L- 1) and methanol (10 %, v/v) was optimized using a mixed-level factorial design, with direct detection at 200 nm.

40|$|Abstract Roche's {{protease}} inhibitor <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (Viracept ®) produced between March 2007 -June 2007 {{was found to}} contain elevated levels of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), a known mutagen (alkylator) – leading to a global recall of the drug. EMS levels in a daily dose (2, 500 mg Viracept/day) were predicted not to exceed a dose of ~ 2. 75 mg/day (~ 0. 055 mg/kg/day based on 50 kg patient). As existing toxicology data on EMS did not permit an adequate patient risk assessment, a comprehensive animal toxicology evaluation of EMS was conducted. General toxicity of EMS was investigated in rats over 28 days. Two studies for DNA damage were performed in mice; chromosomal damage was assessed using a micronucleus assay and gene mutations were detected using the MutaMouse transgenic model. In addition, experiments designed to extrapolate animal exposure to humans were undertaken. A general toxicity study showed that the toxicity of EMS occurred only at doses ≥ 60 mg/kg/day, which is far above that received by patients. Studies for chromosomal damage and mutations in mice demonstrated a clear threshold effect with EMS at 25 mg/kg/day, under chronic dosing conditions. Exposure analysis (C max) demonstrated that ~ 370 -fold higher levels of EMS than that ingested by patients, are needed to saturate known, highly conserved, error-free, mammalian DNA repair mechanisms for alkylation. In summary, animal studies suggested that patients who took <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> with elevated levels of EMS are at no increased risk for carcinogenicity or teratogenicity over their background risk, since mutations are prerequisites for such downstream events. These findings are potentially relevant to > 40 marketed drugs that are mesylate salts. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if complexation with β- cyclodextrin (β-CD) increases water solubility and subsequent bioavailability of <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (NM). Methods: Complexation of NM with β-CD in 1 : 1. 5 molar ratio {{was carried out}} by solvent evaporation, freeze-drying and kneading methods. The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The in vitro solubility of the pure drug {{as well as that of}} the complexes was evaluated using USP type 2 apparatus. One of the drug complexes was also evaluated in vivo using Wistar rats to determine its pharmacokinetic profile. Results: Freeze-dried NM-βCD complex was selected for in vivo studies based on its free flowing property and superior texture. The complexes prepared by the three methods all showed largely similar dissolution rate. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study of the freeze-dried complex in male Wistar rats showed significant increase in Cmax, tmax and AUC (p ≤ 0. 05) compared to those of the plain drug.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was aimed at}} developing the stability indicating spectrophotometric methods for the determination of <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (NEM) in pharmaceutical dosage forms. The stability of NEM was tested in various dissolution media maintained at ambient temperature and 37 oC for 48 h. Stability studies of NEM in various media indicated that the drug was stable in 0. 1 M HCl and pH 7. 8 phosphate buffer. The λmax were found 201. 4 and 212. 0 nm for 0. 1 M HCl and pH 7. 8 phosphate buffers respectively with low coefficient of variation of < 5. 11 %.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} present {{investigation}} {{was to understand the}} interactions involved in complexation of <b>Nelfinavir</b> <b>Mesylate</b> (NM) -a protease inhibitor, used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS with Beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and its subsequent effect on its absorption properties and bioavailability. Milling method was used for complexation. The inclusion complexes were characterized by 2 D NOESY NMR and ITC studies. The feasibility of findings was further confirmed by using Cerius(2) software of Tripos Inc. using Silicon Graphics O- 2. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in rabbits and data was treated by Student's t Test. 2 D NOESY NMR studies showed very intricate behavior showing interactions amongst drug and beta-CD molecule as well as amongst beta-CD-beta-CD molecules. This fact of formation of molecular aggregates was further confirmed by ITC studies. Computer simulation studies further supported the finding of forming shallow complex. The percent relative bioavailability of complex at the dose of 400 mg/kg in rabbits was 185. 37 as compared to the plain NM at 400 mg/kg dose.

40|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (formerly AG 1343) is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease approved {{for the treatment of}} individuals infected with HIV. Nucleotide sequence analysis of protease genes from plasma HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA revealed a unique aspartic acid (D) -to-asparagine (N) substitution at residue 30 (D 30 N) in 25 of 55 patients treated with nelfinavir for a median of 13 weeks. Although the appearance of D 30 N was occasionally associated with concurrent or sequential emergence of other changes (e. g., at residues 35, 36, 46, 71, 77, and 88), genotypic changes associated with phenotypic resistance to other protease inhibitors were not observed (e. g., at residues 48, 50, 82, and 84) or were only rarely observed (e. g., at residue 90). In phenotypic assays, viral isolates with high-level resistance to nelfinavir remained susceptible to indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, and amprenavir (formerly VX- 478 / 141 W 94). Similar results were observed in phenotypic assays utilizing HIV- 1 NL 4 - 3, which contained the D 30 N substitution alone or in combination with substitutions at other residues (e. g., residues 46, 71, and 88). These data indicate that the initial pathway of resistance to nelfinavir is unique and suggest that individuals failing short courses of nelfinavir-containing regimens may respond to regimens containing other protease inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (formerly AG 1343) is {{a potent}} and selective, nonpeptidic {{inhibitor}} of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3 TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d 4 T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3 TC against an acute HIV- 1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47 : 331 - 385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14 : 181 - 206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3 TC, ddI, d 4 T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3 TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (NFV) and nelfinavir hydroxy-tert-butylamide (M 8), the most abundant metabolite of NFV, in infants vertically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and participating in the Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS 7 study. Plasma NFV concentrations were determined during repeated NFV administrations (two to three times a day). Eighteen infants younger that age 2 years participated in this study. The doses administered ranged from 71 to 203 mg/kg of body weight/day. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were obtained by a compartmental approach by using a kinetic model to simultaneously fit NFV and M 8 (active metabolite) concentrations. M 8 was shown to be formation rate limited and was characterized by first-order rate constants of formation and elimination. Body weight was found to be a more appropriate predictor than age of the changes in (i) the rate of metabolism, (ii) the elimination rate constant of NFV, and (iii) NFV clearance. Population parameters were computed to account for the relationship between the rate of metabolism and body weight. The estimated NFV and M 8 elimination half-lives were 4. 3 and 2. 04 h, respectively. The estimated NFV clearance was 2. 13 liters/h/kg. The M 8 concentration-to-NFV concentration ratio was 0. 64 ± 0. 44. In conclusion, the population pharmacokinetic model describing the dispositions of NFV and M 8 should facilitate the design of future studies to elucidate the relative contributions of the parent compound and M 8 to the pharmacological and toxic effects of NFV therapy...|$|E
40|$|A 49 -year-old, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - infected, Haitian-born woman presented with a left facial mass that she had noticed for the previous eight weeks. She was {{known to have been}} HIV-seropositive for the previous 11 years and had been on multiple antiretroviral therapies. Her past medical history was also significant for hypertension, disseminated varicella zoster virus and recurrent oral and buttock Herpes simplex episodes. She was taking the following medications {{at the time of her}} presentation with the facial mass: stavudine, lamivudine, didanosine, <b>nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate,</b> famciclovir, hydrochlorothiazide and cotrimoxazole. She had no complaints of fever, chills, sweats, weight loss or anorexia. She denied any pain, redness or warmth at the site of the facial swelling. Her most recent CD 4 lymphocyte count was 336 cells/µL, with an HIV viral load of log 102. 6 copies/mL. Physical examination revealed a 4 cm fluid-filled mass in the left parotid gland. There was no detectable induration, redness, warmth or tenderness, and no associated adenopathy. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. An aspirate of the mass was performed under sterile conditions and yielded 30 mL of turbid, yellow liquid. A Gram stain revealed no neutrophils, scant mononuclear cells and no visible organisms. An acid-fast stain was negative as well. Routine, mycobacterial and fungal cultures showed no growth. Cytological analysis showed scant reactive lymphocytes and no malignant cells. The patient was not given therapy and was observed for another two months. The fluid reaccumulated in the left parotid gland, and the patient?s only complaint concerned the unsightly appearance of the mass.

40|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> <b>mesylate</b> (Viracept, {{formally}} AG 1343) is {{a potent}} and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV- 1) protease inhibitor (Ki = 2 nM) and is being widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} HIV infection. The current studies evaluated the presence of metabolites circulating in plasma following the oral administration of nelfinavir to healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients, as well as the levels in plasma and antiviral activities of these metabolites. The results showed that the parent drug was the major circulating chemical species, followed in decreasing abundance by its hydroxy-t-butylamide metabolite (M 8) and 3 ′-methoxy- 4 ′-hydroxynelfinavir (M 1). Antiviral assays with HIV- 1 strain RF-infected CEM-SS cells showed that the 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50) of nelfinavir, M 8, and M 1 were 30, 34, and 151 nM, respectively, and that the corresponding EC 50 against another HIV- 1 strain, IIIB, in MT- 2 cells were 60, 86, and 653 nM. Therefore, apparently similar in vitro antiviral activities were demonstrated for nelfinavir and M 8, whereas an approximately 5 - to 11 -fold-lower level of antiviral activity was observed for M 1. The active metabolite, M 8, showed a degree of binding to human plasma proteins similar to that of nelfinavir (ca. 98 %). Concentrations in plasma of nelfinavir and its metabolites in 10 HIV-positive patients receiving nelfinavir therapy (750 mg three times per day) were determined by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. At steady state (day 28), the mean plasma nelfinavir concentrations ranged from 1. 73 to 4. 96 μM and the M 8 concentrations ranged from 0. 55 to 1. 96 μM, whereas the M 1 concentrations were low and ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 19 μM. In conclusion, the findings from the current studies suggest that, in humans, nelfinavir forms an active metabolite circulating at appreciable levels in plasma. The active metabolite M 8 may account for some of the antiviral activity associated with nelfinavir in the treatment of HIV disease...|$|E
30|$|Sulfur-containing {{aromatic}} compounds, notably aryl sulfides {{and their}} derivatives, are prominent in {{fields such as}} biological, pharmaceutical, and materials fields. In particular, their use in synthesizing biologically and pharmaceutically important organosulfur compounds such as HIV protease inhibitors [1] (Viracept, <b>Nelfinavir</b> <b>Mesylate,</b> AG 1343), LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 antagonists [2], and arylthioindoles [3] (potent inhibitors of tubulin assembly) is still not fully understood by synthetic chemists. In general, molecules containing one or more carbon-sulfur bonds {{can be used as}} molecular precursors for the synthesis of new materials [4]. However, compared to C-N and C-O bonds, the transition metal-catalyzed C(aryl)-S bond formation has not been well studied. This bond formation is thought to be partial because of the formation of an S-S coupled product and a concurrent deactivation of the metal catalyst due to the strong coordinative and adsorptive properties of sulfur, which can decrease catalytic activity [5]. General methods for C-S cross-coupling involve the condensation of aryl halides with thiols and, usually, require temperatures greater than 200 °C. These methods also require strongly basic, toxic, high-boiling, polar solvents, namely HMPA, quinolone, or N,N-dimethylacetamide. In order to circumvent these complications, a meticulous effort has been focused on the development of transition metal-catalyzed coupling of thiophenols with aryl halides. Previously, iron [6], nickel [7, 8], palladium [9, 10], cobalt [11], and copper-based [12 – 16] catalytic systems have been reported for this purpose. Even though significant improvements have been made, appropriate techniques are still needed for the synthesis of diaryl thioethers. To date, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles have often been used as metal catalysts because of their physical and chemical stability. In addition, the advantage of nanoparticles including large surface area and heterogeneous nature make them applicable to a broad range of scientific fields and functions such as the immobilization of biomolecules [17], catalysis of organic [18 – 23] and electrochemical reactions [17], use in electrochemical sensors and biosensors [17], enhancement of electron transfer [17], labeling of biomolecules [17], and synthesis of nanofluids [24], antibacterial materials [25], photocatalysts [25, 26], solar cells [27], and so on. Among the various available metal oxide nanoparticles, two copper oxides (Cu 2 O, CuO) have been studied for use in p-type semiconductor materials with narrow band gaps. This is because copper oxides are less expensive, recyclable, and non-toxic and have suitable optical and electronic properties [28 – 32]. Thus, as part of the effort to find new catalytic systems and better understand the role of transition metal nanoparticles in organic transformations, we report herein the use of CuO hollow nanoparticles as catalysts for efficient syntheses of diaryl thioethers. These CuO hollow nanoparticles have advantages in terms of large-scale synthesis and uniform shape compared to previous reported CuO nanoparticles [33, 34]. In recent times, microwave-irradiated organic reactions have become increasingly popular as valuable alternatives to the use of conductive heating for promoting chemical reactions. Besides, improved yields within short reaction time were observed. Microwave activation, as a non-conventional energy source, is becoming a very popular and valuable technique in organic synthesis, as evidenced by the increasing number of annual publications on this topic. In continuation of our previous reports [35], we discovered that microwave irradiation can even accelerate the Ullmann coupling of activated aryl iodides and thiophenols.|$|E
