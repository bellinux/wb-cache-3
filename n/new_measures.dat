5|$|But {{the event}} could not mask the {{economic}} crisis into which Poland was drifting, exacerbated by Soviet demands for more military spending. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> were incomprehensible to many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E

There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100people dead and over 500 injured.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> for discriminatory related party {{transactions}} (DRPTs). There are currently measures for such discriminatory transactions but the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> has a strong theoretical basis and is less susceptible to measurement error. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops and tests a <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> for these discriminatory transactions. Type I and Type II error rates and the power of the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> are compared with an existing measure using computer-simulated and real data. Findings: The capital market sensitivity of the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is also tested and compared with the existing <b>measure.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is found to be superior. Practical implications: The <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> of DRPTs has the potential to contribute to both further research on the impact of related party transactions and policy-making in relation to DRPTs. Originality/value: This paper has developed and tested a <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> for DRPTs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Part I we {{discussed}} limitations of two measures of global (non-fuzzy) uncertainty of Lamata and Moral, and {{a measure of}} total (non-fuzzy) uncertainty due to Klir and Ramer and established {{the need for a}} <b>new</b> <b>measure.</b> In this paper we propose a set of intuitively desirable axioms for a measure of total uncertainty (TU) associated with a basic assignment m(A), and then derive an expression for a (unique) function that satisfies these requirements. Several theorems are proved about the <b>new</b> <b>measure.</b> Our measure is additive, and unlike other TU measures, has a unique maximum. The <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> reduces to Shannon's probabilistic entropy when the basic probability assignment focuses only on singletons. On the other hand, complete ignorance—basic assignment focusing only on the entire set, as a whole—reduces it to Hartley's measure of information. We show that the computational complexity of the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is O(N), whereas previous measures of TU are O(N 2). Finally, we compare the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> to its predecessors by extending the numerical example of Part I so that it includes values of the <b>new</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of Theophilos in 842, <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> to confront the Cretan threat were {{undertaken}} by the new Byzantine regime: in 843 a new maritime theme, that of the Aegean Sea, was established to better deal with the Arabs raids, and another expedition to recover Crete was launched under the personal leadership of the powerful logothetes and regent Theoktistos. Although it succeeded in occupying much of the island, Theoktistos had to abandon the army due to political intrigues in Constantinople, and the troops left behind were slaughtered by the Arabs. In an effort to weaken the Arabs in 853, several Byzantine fleets engaged in coordinated operations in the Eastern Mediterranean, attacking the Egyptian naval base of Damietta and capturing weapons intended for Crete. Despite some Byzantine successes against the Arabs in the following years, the Cretans resumed their raids in the early 860s, attacking the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and Athos. In 866, the Byzantine Caesar Bardas assembled another large-scale expeditionary force to subdue Crete, but his murder by Basil the Macedonian only {{two weeks after the}} fleet set sail from the capital spelled the end of the undertaking.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 {{sovereign}} states. The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led {{to the rise of}} liberal movements, followed by <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich. The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states. National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy. In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E

5|$|The International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an {{industry}} trade organisation representing over 240 airlines (representing 84% of global air traffic)—and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—the United Nations' civil aviation body—began working on implementing <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> to track aircraft in flight in real time. The IATA created {{a task force}} (which included several outside stakeholders) to define a minimal set of requirements that any tracking system must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft. The IATA's task force planned {{to come up with}} several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident. The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but on that day said that the report would be delayed, citing the need for further clarification on some issues. In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15-minute intervals, although it still has not released its report and full details of proposed changes. The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believes cannot be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard has the support of the ICAO. Although the ICAO can set standards, it has no legal authority and such standards must be adopted by member states.|$|E

The empirical work for the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is tested for Chile.

25|$|When {{performance}} appraisal measures are run down, they typically {{need to be}} replaced by <b>new</b> <b>measures.</b> In the sciences, overlapping data is useful, in that it they can be used to confirm or disprove a given hypothesis. In management, however, overlapping measurements are considered redundant, rather than a useful indication of reliability. By the same token, <b>new</b> <b>measures</b> that lie in direct opposition to existing measures of performance are not helpful. For instance, if a retail company uses units of shoes sold in a month as a metric, adding units of shoes remaining unsold after a month as a new metric is not helpful. Since the company can derive the same information and draw the same conclusions from both metrics, it is more efficient to use only one of the two measures. In the interest of generating useful data, new performance measures should be orthogonal to existing metrics.|$|E

Also, the <b>new</b> linearity <b>measure</b> is invariant with respect to translations, rotations and scaling transformations. The <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is theoretically well founded and, because of this, its behaviour can be well understood and predicted to some extent. This is always beneficial because it indicates the suitability of the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> to the desired application.

The results show that the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is subject to fewer data restrictions and therefore results in larger sample sizes. Like the Weiss (2010) <b>measure,</b> the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is positively correlated with analysts’ forecast accuracy (higher levels of cost stickiness are associated with larger absolute forecast errors) and increases the effect of earnings surprises on market reactions (lower levels of cost stickiness are associated with stronger market reactions). In line with economic theory (Bhushan, 1989; Das et al., 1998), the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> exhibits a negative correlation with analyst coverage (higher levels of cost stickiness are associated with higher analyst coverage), indicating that analysts meet the enhanced demand for private information that results from less predictable earnings...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a <b>new</b> {{circularity}} <b>measure</b> which defines {{the degree to which a}} shape differs from a perfect circle. The <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> is easy to compute and being area based, is robust – e. g., with respect to noise or narrow intrusions. Also, it satisfies the following desirable properties: – it ranges over (0, 1] and gives the measured circularity equal to 1 if and only if the measured shape is a circle; – it is invariant with respect to translations, rotations and scaling. Compared with the most standard circularity measure, which considers the relation between the shape area and the shape perimeter, the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> performs better in the case of shapes with boundary defects (which lead to a large increase in perimeter) and in the case of compound shapes. In contrast to the standard circularity <b>measure,</b> the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> depends on the mutual position of the components inside a compound shape. Also, the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> performs consistently in the case of shapes with very small (i. e., close to zero) measured circularity. It turns out that such a property enables the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> to measure the linearity of shapes. In addition, we propose a generalization of the <b>new</b> <b>measure</b> so that shape circu-larity can be computed while controlling the impact of the relative position of points inside the shape. An additional advantage of the generalized measure is that it can be used for detecting small irregularities in nearly circular shapes damaged by noise or during an extraction process in a particular image processing task...|$|R
