Studies have found that gifted students in math, for instance, perform better in spatial visualization than <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> A 2008 review {{published in the journal}} of Neuroscience Biobehavioural Reviews found evidence that visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in many aspects of processing numbers and calculating in math. For example, meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information given its relation to its position within the number. Another study found that numerical estimation might rely on integrating different visual-spatial cues (diameter, size, location, measurement) to infer an answer. A study published in 2014 also found evidence that mathematical calculation relies on the integration of various spatial processes. Another 2015 study published in the journal of Frontiers in Psychology also found that numerical processing and arithmetic performance may rely on visual perceptual ability.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the perceptions of 104 pre-service school counselors regarding students identified as intellectually gifted. Two instruments {{were used in the}} study: the Adjective Checklist (ACL) and the Child Behavioral Checklist, Youth Self Report (YSR). Participants were asked to complete the ACL by endorsing the words they considered most characteristic of a typical gifted student of high intelligence. Items most frequently endorsed indicated a predominantly positive perception (e. g., “ambitious,” “confident”). This finding was supported by a paired-samples t test that indicated a significantly greater score on the ACL favorability scale compared to the score on the ACL unfavorability scale. However, negative perceptions were also observed (e. g., “anxious,” “arrogant”). The YSR was used to exploring the sample 2 ̆ 7 s perception of the psychosocial adjustment of intellectually gifted students as compared to their non-gifted peers. By assuming the position of a student that was identified as either a male, gifted male, female, or gifted female, participants completed the 112 -Likert items on the measure designed to assess adjustment in eight areas: anxiety/depression, withdrawn/depression, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, and aggressive behavior. A 2 x 2 MANOVA indicated significant differences between the groups by gender and by their classification (gifted and non-gifted) but not their interaction. Post hoc ANOVAs and DISCRIMs identified several areas of difference between groups for each main effect. For gender, those in the role of a male indicated more rule-breaking and aggressive behaviors than those in the role of a female. For classification, those in the role of a gifted student rated themselves higher than those in the role of a <b>non-gifted</b> <b>student</b> on anxiety/depression and thought problems. Conversely, those in the role of a gifted student endorsed significantly less difficulty with attention problems, rule-breaking behaviors, and aggressive behaviors compared to those in the <b>non-gifted</b> <b>student</b> role. Results indicated the presence of stereotyped perceptions of gifted students as both maladjusted and better-adjusted in particular areas of psychosocial functioning. Findings suggest the need for experiences that allow pre-services school counselors to explore their perceptions and challenge the content of stereotyped beliefs about students identified as intellectually gifted. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference, if any, between the spatial-analytical ability level of gifted students and that of average students. The sample included 52 gifted students as identified by the Raven’s Advance Progressive Matrices and 110 students with average general intelligence. The sample was divided into 6 groups as 2 ndgrade gifted students (n= 23) and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> (n= 21) who were attending gifted classrooms as inclusion students and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> who were attending regular classrooms (n= 24); and 3 rd grade gifted students (n= 29) and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> (n= 29) who were attending gifted classrooms as inclusion students, and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> who were attending regular classrooms (n= 33). Gifted students and those average students who were attending gifted classrooms were the students of the same inclusion classrooms. Students who scored in the top 5 % on the Raven’s SPM were identified as gifted. Percentileof the A- 2 and 3 - 5 forms of the DISCOVER-spatial analytical assessment were used to determine participants’ spatial analytical ability level. Results: Data analysis showed significant differences between the mean scores of the groups by ability level both for the second grade [F (2 - 67) = 5. 20; p< 0. 05] and the third grade [F(2 - 90) = 9. 31, p< 0. 01]. Findings showed that the mean of spatial analytical ability of the second grade gifted students (M= 3. 04; SD= 0. 88) were significantly higher than the mean of spatial analytical ability of the second grade average students (M= 2. 29; SD= 0. 55) who were attending regular classrooms. Similarly, the mean of spatial analytical ability of the third grade gifted students (M= 2. 86; SD= 1. 16) were significantly higher than the mean of spatial analytical ability of the third grade average students (M= 1. 70; SD= 1. 02) who were attending regular classrooms. However, no significant differences were found between gifted students and average students who were attending gifted classrooms as inclusion students. Also there was no significant difference between the scores of the <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> who were attending the gifted classrooms as inclusion students and those who were attending regular classrooms. Conclusions: Gifted students have higher cognitive skills related to spatial analytical ability(Kyllonen & Kristal; cited in Lohman, 1996, p. 103), such as mental rotation, visualization, figure-ground relation, and perspective (Eliot & Smith, 1983, cited in Stumpf & Eliot, 1999, p. 144 - 146). Findings of this study support prior research as well as the relation between general intelligence and spatial-analytical ability (Cole, Fasnacht-Hill, Robinson, and Cordahi, 2001). However there was not a statistically significant difference between gifted and average students who were inclusion students in the gifted classrooms. The finding can be explained by the possible effect of the enriched education operated in the gifted classrooms to which average students were also included. We can speculate that non-gifted students’ spatialanalytical skills have developed significantly because of the differentiated instruction in the gifted classroom. However, the fact that <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> of the inclusion classrooms did not score significantly higher than <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> of regular classrooms is surprising even though <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> of the inclusion classrooms had differentiated education. This research has a number of limitations. First, the sample size is too small. Second, the sample does not cover many grade levels. Thus, the generalizability of the study is limited. More research is needed to uncover if there is a significant difference between spatial analytical ability of gifted students and average students who are identified by an IQ test. In other words, researchers should investigate whether spatial analytical ability makes a difference in discriminating gifted students from average students...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the latent structure of divergent thinking as a cognitive ability across gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> samples of <b>students</b> utilizing multiple-group analysis of mean and covariance structures (MG-MACS). Whereas Spearman’s law of diminishing returns postulates lower g saturation of cognitive tests with increasing ability level and consequently, a lower correlation of cognitive abilities in more gifted samples, recent evidence from creativity {{research has shown}} that correlations of divergent thinking with intelligence are unaffected by ability level. In order to investigate this conflicting state of affairs with respect to divergent thinking, we utilized increasingly restrictive MG-MACS models that were capable of comparing latent variances, covariances, and means between gifted (IQ > 130) and non-gifted (IQ &# 8804; 130) groups of students. In a sample of 1070 German school students, we found that a MG-MACS model assuming partial strict measurement invariance with respect to the postulated factor model of verbal, figural, and numerical divergent thinking could not be rejected. Further, latent variances and covariances of latent divergent thinking factors did not significantly differ between groups, whereas the gifted group exhibited significantly higher latent means. Finally, implications of our results for future research on the latent structure of divergent thinking are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The long-held {{notion that}} gifted {{students}} prefer to work alone is reported in several general textbooks on gifted children. However, studies addressing this issue are mixed {{and certainly not}} conclusive. Earlier studies disagree on whether those gifted children who claim a preference for working alone do so {{as a function of}} grade and maturational stage, sex, or personality characteristics commensurate with increasingly higher IQs. The current study re-examines this notion through the lens of motivation through social-constructivist theory. Two hundred and forty-seven American school-identified gifted, high achieving, and non-identified (i. e., <b>non-gifted,</b> regular education) <b>students</b> in grades 4 through 12 participated. The measure used in this study was a survey comprising items used in past learning style-related research, items adapted from a personality index and an interest profile, as well as locally-developed open-ended questions regarding preferred learning conditions, learning-related personality characteristics, and perceptions of support in their learning. Participants also had the opportunity to offer ideas about ideal learning situations, and their beliefs on why some children versus others might prefer to work alone. Finally, this study attempted to confirm the hypothesis that those gifted students who feel adequately supported by those in their environment will be less likely to indicate a preference for working alone, compared to those who do not feel supported. Although some indication of a preference of gifted students to work alone was present, this preference was not strong because it varied based on how the question was posed. Moreover, sex and grade-related differences were noted. Perhaps most interestingly, in support of the hypothesis of the study, those participants who reported feeling least supported by others reported the strongest preference to work alone. Implications of these findings on classroom curriculum, future career functioning, and mental health are discussed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the common}} misconceptions {{when it comes to}} {{teaching}} a second language to gifted students is that teachers expect gifted students to be better at learning a second language than <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> Expectations are usually high, and when a student does not live up to these expectations, it causes frustration; not just for the student, but also for the teacher and the parents. This misconception {{stems from the fact that}} most gifted students show an extensive knowledge of their L 1 (first language) at an early age. In theory, a gifted child should therefore be faster at picking up an L 2 (second language) than non-gifted students: Hayes et al (1998, p. 179) states: “there is a strong connection between language ability and learning ability. ” So hypothetically, with their advanced thinking skills, their more extensive verbal skills, and with their aptitude for learning, these gifted students should have little trouble with learning a second language. In practice, however, this does not always seem to be the case; gifted students do not automatically apply their abilities in learning second languages. For example, classroom practice shows that gifted students generally have greater difficulties with learning and memorizing vocabulary than <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> The study described in this thesis has multiple aims. First and foremost it aims to examine if there is a difference in the ways gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> acquire English as a second language.

The main purpose of this study, as mentioned earlier, is to identify the unique needs of mathematics gifted students, measure their specific preferences in various aspects of learning, as well as about their relationships with their teachers and other students. This, in order to establish a broad and deep background to enable a unique reference to the population of gifted students and allow the construction of appropriate educational programs, care and interventions tailored to their needs, while integrating the educational staff at the school.

Two questions guided this investigation. The researcher explored how the prompts of depth and complexity affect gifted and non-gifted student learning across the disciplines. The researcher also examined gifted and non-gifted student perceptions of the prompts of depth and complexity specific to challenge, interest and use.; In this mixed methods study, the primary source of data collection was quantitatively collected {{in the form of a}} pre-post test created as part of the Jacob K.

The purposefully sampled population consisted of gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> in grades 2 - 5 from an urban school district in Southern California who were participants in a research project awarded to the University of Southern California and funded through the U. S. Department of Education’s Jacob K. Javits Grant (PR #S 26 A 040072). A mixed methods approach was employed to analyze data obtained from existing primary research, as well as from recently attained secondary research. The findings from this study provided information regarding the effects of learning with the models of teaching. Specifically, the results offered evidence related to the following: (a) student preferences for learning a defined content area using a model of teaching and the related reasons for their choice, (b) students’ ability to recognize the syntax or sequence of learning {{as it relates to the}} models of teaching, (c) the relationship between previous learning with the models and students’ capacity to transfer their knowledge of learning to self-directed independent study, and (d) the validation of how the models of teaching facilitate the knowledge of learning to learn.; The data indicated that gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> chose to learn specified content areas through a specific model of teaching, and that the perceived interest offered by the models was the primary influence related to their choices. Statistically significant findings were found related to gifted and non-gifted students’ preferences for learning in the social science discipline. Previous learning with the models of teaching equipped both gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> with the ability to recognize the procedural knowledge of learning-to-learn as it related to the selected models of teaching. The comparative analysis of gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> revealed patterns related to their ability to transfer previous learning with the models of teaching to new contexts. The findings revealed that both 4 th and 5 th grade gifted students could more readily transfer their learning from the models of teaching to self-directed independent study when compared to their non-gifted peers and 3 rd grade gifted students. Most students who were able to transfer their knowledge to new contexts selected to conduct the process of independent study using the group investigation model of teaching.; Many of the study’s findings were supported by the theoretical purposes of the models of teaching and were aligned with the theorists’ perspectives on learning and motivation. Implications were offered regarding educational policy and teacher education. Through this study, it is recommended that the models of teaching be integrated into classroom instruction, as well as into pre-service and in-service teacher education programs. Although this type of pedagogy will increase the effectiveness of learning for all students, it is deemed to be necessary for gifted learners in order to assist in developing their potential...|$|E

Students were grouped in three thinking style categories: visual-spatial thinkers, auditory-sequential thinkers or no preference for either thinking style. NIO scores were used to group students into intelligence categories: low-ability, average-ability, high-ability and gifted students. Gifted students were classified based on a diagnosis for giftedness. Intelligence scores and school results were compared to measure the degree of underachievement. Results: Thinking style does not appear to predict giftedness; factors that predict a diagnosis for giftedness are intelligence, school results and age (p <. 001).

From the review of the literature it was concluded that self-efficacy beliefs influence academic achievement. Students with a high sense of self-efficacy for accomplishing a task participate more eagerly in a learning task, work harder, persist longer and achieve at a higher level than those who doubt their capabilities. Students with a high sense of self-efficacy are more self-regulated than those with a low sense of selfefficacy. It was concluded from the review of literature that disadvantaged gifted students perform lower than their potential due to various social and environmental factors. Disadvantaged gifted students are characterized by under-achievement, lack of general motivation to learn, parents with a low level of education, teachers who lack appreciation, poor socio-economic background, academic skills deficit, low selfesteem, rebellious attitude, lower expectations, and avoidance behaviours. Disadvantaged gifted students are very often not selected through the methods used for the identification of gifted students. This is because when those methods are used, the language, cultural and home background of the disadvantaged gifted students are not taken into consideration when results are interpreted. By means of an empirical investigation it could be concluded that there is a difference between disadvantaged gifted students and disadvantaged <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> with relation to certain variables.

In this study, a Self-regulation Skills for Science Learning Scale (SSSLS) has been developed by researcher. Thanks to this scale, the self-regulation skills of the gifted students and non-gifted in learning science have been compared. The sample of the research has been determined in accordance with purposeful sampling method. <b>Non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> are the students who study in two schools determined according to typical sampling method in a province the socio-economic level of which in Turkey is medium-scale. The gifted students are those who enrolled in Science and Art Centre that gives education to the gifted students in the same province. 264 students have been determined at the level of 4 th to 8 th grade in the sample of the research. As the result of research findings, it has been determined that gifted students’ self-regulation skills for science learning are higher than the <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> It has seen that there are significant differences between the self-regulation skills points of both groups in science learning (p 0. 05). The metacognitive skills contain very important skills (e. g. goal setting, monitoring, self-assessment, regulation) on the nurturing of talent. The students’ not having differentiation in the scores of metacognitive skills can be indicator that available gifted education programs doesn’t have the quality to develop these skills...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} would {{be aimed at}} {{comparing}} emotional intelligence and humor in gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>Students.</b> The present study is a causal-comparative study. 60 gifted and 60 normal female students in the second grade of high school Karaj Iran have been selected using cluster sampling method and answered the Modified Schutte EI Scale, Twrsen, and Powell Humor Scale. The collected data have been analyzed using SPSS 21 and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). Obtained results from the study indicate {{that there is a}} significant difference between emotional intelligence, optimism/emotion regulation and humor in gifted and normal female students (p< 0 / 05). Thus, emotional intelligence, optimism/emotion regulation and humor were higher scores in gifted female student. Findings have confirmed difference of emotion intelligence and humor in gifted and normal female students...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of interdisciplinary computer-based simulations compared to traditional teaching methods. The academic intrinsic motivation of gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> was analyzed using a quasi-experimental design, similar to a pretest/posttest design. Students selected {{for this study were}} from a large suburban school district in north Texas. The students were from two in-tact groups of fifth grades at two different elementary schools. There were a total of 183 subjects in the study. The experimental group was taught using two multi-disciplinary computer simulations as part of a twelve week unit of study. These simulations include reading, math, science, and social studies content, and require approximately twenty-five hours to complete. The control group was taught the same content using traditional teaching methods. Pretest and posttest scores on the Children's Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory were used for analysis. This measurement too...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{intelligence}} {{factor was}} used as a separative element and the relationship between the attachment styles and the creative skills was examined. In addition, the effects of some demographic variables concerning gender and family profile on creativity and attachment styles were tested. The subjects were 368 first grade high school students (199 girls and 169 boys), and “Relationship Scales Questionnaire”, “Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking”, “General Ability Test”, and “Personal Information Form ” were used as measurements. Results showed that there was no relationship between attachment styles and verbal creativity scores for both gifted and non-gifted groups. Gender factor had created a meaningful difference {{for the benefit of the}} girls for secure attachment and flexibility points in the gifted group. In terms of mothers ’ education, there were meaningful differences for gifted students in attachment styles, and for <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> in verbal creativity. Having brothers/sisters also lead to differences on originality and fluency scores for gifted group...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} relationships among personality factors, social support, emotional wellbeing, and academic achievement in 65 gifted secondary students, a sample drawn from a longitudinal study of over 950 students. The research demonstrated that, compared to their non-gifted peers, gifted students had significantly higher academic outcomes for all subject areas except Geography and Physical Education. Teachers rated the gifted students as being well adjusted {{and less likely to}} have behavioural or emotional problems than <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> The gifted students, however, reported feeling more sad and less satisfied with their social support than their non-gifted counterparts. There {{were no significant differences in}} terms of self-esteem, trait hope, problem orientation, or attitudes towards education. Within the gifted sample, the research found that the students who were most likely to get poor grades were those who scored high in psychoticism and low in conscientiousness, trait hope, joviality, and in attitudes towards schools. Interestingly, self-esteem was entirely unrelated to gifted performance...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{intelligence}} and self-control on academic performance of academically gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> was investigated. Intelligence {{was measured by the}} Cognitive Ability Test (CAT) which consisted of two subscales: verbal subtest and quantitative subtest. Selfcontrol was assessed by observing the level of students’ commitments to submit their assignments and homework timely. The sample consisted of 74 freshmen- male students. Academically gifted students were selected based on their academic performance as indicated by their GPA scores, the cut-off point was 3. 50 out of 5. 00. Intelligence and Self-control were entered a linear multiple regression model as independent variables whereas students’ GPAs in the first semester was entered as the criterion variable. The results showed that both intelligence and self-control correlated significantly with GPA for the whole sample, r (74) =. 31 and. 58 respectively (p<. 01). Intelligence and selfControl did not correlate significantly with each other. The results also showed that for the whole sample both intelligence and self-control accounted for 42...|$|E
40|$|This {{monograph}} summarizes {{research about}} {{the assessment of}} academically gifted students and addresses the kinds of advocacy a psychologist can offer. The components of a comprehensive assessment are described, noting that many tests developed for the age or grade of gifted students will fail to reflect their advanced abilities and skills. Assessment issues include group versus individual testing, the recency of the standardization, out-of-level testing, test basals and ceilings, {{and the effects of}} timing on performance. It points out that the reliability of ability tests is inversely correlated with the level of IQ, resulting in greater discrepancies among abilities for gifted than <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> Gifted students may also present some special personality concerns, such as a view of their abilities as outside of their control, which leads to fragility in the face of challenge, realistic anxiety about high stakes testing, perfectionism and meticulousness, and reluctance to give up on difficult items. Special situations are considered, such as testing the highly gifted...|$|E

40|$|Self-efficacy is a belief. It can {{encourage}} or hamper students from learning to their full potential. Students who are efficacious are more motivated, more persistent {{to meet their}} goals {{and are more likely}} to take learning risks. The research into the self-efficacy of students classified as verbally or non-verbally gifted is in its infancy. This book details a Doctoral dissertation that investigated the written English self-efficacy of adolescent students. Results identified verbally gifted students had higher written English self-efficacy, were more intrinsically motivated, had higher levels of creativity and wrote superior essays compared to non-verbally gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students.</b> Findings highlighted differences between gender as female student?s recorded higher self-efficacy and written English performance scores and interestingly, students from lower socio-economic backgrounds reported higher self-efficacy compared to students from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Pedagogical implications are considered with teachers encouraged to realise the impact of self-efficacy upon student learning, motivation and persistence regardless of their academic ability...|$|E
40|$|Motivation is a {{major factor}} in {{understanding}} the differences between potential and achievement (Friedman-Nimz & Skyba, (2009), McNabb (2003)). Studies clearly show that motivation helps to explain the differences between gifted achieving and underachieving students. (Baker, Bridger, & Evans, 1998; McCoach & Siegle, 2003). On the other hand, research suggests that on average, gifted students have higher levels of intrinsic motivation than nongifted students (A. W. Gottfried, Gottfried, Cook, & Morris, 2005; Vallerand & Gagne, 1994). Literature on motivation levels of gifted students produces contrasting results, but until now, no study has compared these results with that of students with average abilities. Checking, on one side, the level of achievement, and on the other, the intellectual potential, we wanted to improve the identification of the specifics of gifted youth’s motivation. In this study, we compare the motivational factors amongst gifted and <b>non-gifted</b> <b>students</b> by studying their level of academic performance. This study focuses at secondary school level and assesses task values (Wigfield and Eccles (1983, 2000, 2002) and sources of self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura (1989, 2003).) ...|$|E
