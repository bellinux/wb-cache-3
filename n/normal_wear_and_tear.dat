The umpires will inspect the ball frequently during a match. If the ball is out of shape due to <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> due to batting and ball hitting the pitch, a ball of similar usage rate and condition will be replaced (ie a ball of about 30-overs old will be replaced by a ball about the same 'age').|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Stone Store {{suffered}} the cumulative effects of adjacent traffic movements and {{the ravages of}} <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> Costly remedial work was required and {{in the 21st century}} a bypass was constructed and opened on 23 June 2008, to divert traffic and protect the building for posterity. The old stone store bridge was completely removed {{in the second half of}} 2008. The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and the debate over whether this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved in the minds of many residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.|$|E

The coin will retain its full value even if the red poppy has worn off or been removed; however it is now expected that fully coloured specimens will become collectible in the future.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of ways in which a vehicle buyer might {{determine}} existence of possible odometer fraud. In the US, states require vehicle purchasers to obtain a title or certificate of registration due to federal laws. These titles contain information about a vehicle's odometer history. The information can be accessed through each state's Department of Motor Vehicles. Other options to detect odometer fraud include contacting the vehicle's former owners, conducting a mechanical inspection of the vehicle with particular attention to <b>normal</b> but harmless <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> such as to floor-mats and the rubber on pedals (or to suspiciously new such items), and checking the vehicle's history report (see Used car for a list of vehicle history services in different countries).|$|R

40|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the basic}} means of production, just as of all the instruments of labor, is that, {{taking part in the}} process of production during a lengthy period of time, they preserve their natural form up to the end of their productive life. Gradually they transfer their value to the newly manufactured produce, and consequently after each process of production their <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> increases <b>and</b> their remaining value decreases. The <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of basic means is not always proportional to their age, for it depends on the volume of work performed {{and a number of other}} facts. At the same time <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> {{of the basic}} means determines their efficiency, the time of their final quitting the ranks and the time for replacement. The data on the duration of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> also are the basis for the determination of the norms of assignments for amortization and of the effectiveness of repairs, etc. All this shows the necessity of correctly calculating the <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of the basic means and its great significance for the national economy. ...|$|R
