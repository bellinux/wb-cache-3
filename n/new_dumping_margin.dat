Without a sufficiently significant <b>dumping</b> <b>margin,</b> the investigation cannot conclude with the imposition of sanctions. Given the special interests that often influence the antidumping investigation, the need to identify dumping even if there is no such practice involved often makes the authorities use innovative methods of calculating key elements like the <b>dumping</b> <b>margin.</b> One of the most used such methods is the zeroing procedure. Key words: antidumping, <b>dumping</b> <b>margin,</b> zeroing The Antidumping Agreement allows two ways if calculating the <b>dumping</b> <b>margin</b> (which represents the difference between the export price of a good and the price considered normal for it, considering factors like production costs, transportation and normal profit margin).

40|$|A dumping {{investigation}} involves comparing {{export prices}} with a “normal value” loosely {{defined as the}} price in the exporter’s domestic market observed {{in the course of}} normal trade. However, domestic sales with prices below production costs are excluded from the computation of a normal value; thus increasing the probability products with cyclical prices will get caught with positive <b>dumping</b> <b>margins</b> although there are no intentions to dump.

An antidumping law provides an incentive for both firms to adjust sales so as to shift the <b>dumping</b> <b>margin</b> in their favor, and revenue redistribution strengthens this incentive for the filing firm. It is found that dumping is generally more prevalent and the <b>dumping</b> <b>margin</b> is larger with revenue redistribution, as a consequence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the use of anti-dumping measures {{in order to make}} economic sense of what seems to amount to cheating on an international agreement. There are numerous loopholes in the Anti-dumping Agreement which allow anti-dumping measures {{to be used as a}} form of protection by import-competing industries against fair trade. Some of these loopholes are of a purely legal nature, while others are more practical. During an anti-dumping investigation, a <b>dumping</b> <b>margin</b> is calculated in order to establish whether or not an accused exporter is dumping. This calculation is known as the determination of dumping. In this thesis, the various ways in which the <b>dumping</b> <b>margin</b> can be manipulated or ”captured” are investigated. It is shown that there are numerous ways in which the determination of dumping result can be manipulated in order to ensure a positive dumping result. And economists are concerned about this abuse of anti-dumping as it could have a chilling effect on international trade. However, it is shown in this thesis that anti-dumping investigations are concentrated in certain sectors. In other words, anti-dumping measures (and other non-tariff remedies) are being used as a strategy to protect certain industries. Adam Smith, the ”father” of economics, pointed out that certain sensitive or strategic industries may need to be protected, even if such protection is at the cost of economic welfare. So, it seems that the economic issue is not really about dumping, but about whether or not certain strategic industries should be protected. And it is the protection of these strategic industries, for example the iron and steel industry, that needs further research. EconomicsD. Comm. (Economics...|$|R

40|$|China {{is a major}} {{target for}} {{anti-dumping}} measures by both developed and developing countries. Its rapid industrial transition to higher value-added sectors brings it in direct conflict with the US and the EU. Anti-dumping measures have consistently been employed by the US and the EU to protect their domestic markets from encroaching Chinese exports. In the initial few years of joining the WTO, China rarely initiated any complaint in the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM), while facing several complaints itself. This approach has now evolved. China appears to have acquired the knowledge and capacity to access the WTO DSM for safeguarding its interests. As countries attempt {{to recover from the}} global financial crisis through an export-led strategy, the likelihood of developed countries using antidumping measures and countervailing duties (CVD) to protect their domestic sectors consequently increase. With this background, this paper tracks China 2 ̆ 7 s experience in the WTO with reference to antidumping disputes (both as a complainant and as a respondent). The recurrence of disputes between China and the US/EU is frequently due to alleged currency manipulation that gives China an 2 ̆ 2 unfair 2 ̆ 2 advantage in exports. Tins unfairness is then made the basis of anti-dumping measures and countervailing duties. The paper analyses the developments in recent disputes between involving China. Furthermore, this paper aims to anticipate the effects of the 2016 expiry of the non-market methodology that is currently used to calculate <b>dumping</b> <b>margin</b> against Chinese exports. Once free from being subjected to a surrogate method of calculating <b>dumping</b> <b>margin,</b> China can potentially flood the world market with competitively priced exports that could have long-term consequences for industries in the US and the EU and other developed countries...|$|R

But when the marginal cost differential is â€œsignificantly small,â€ the home firm is able to increase its output and lower the price of the product below its normal value, putting the foreign firm in the situation of an illegal dumping. One interesting implication is that, relative to the case without an AD law, the home firm has a stronger incentive to undertake cost-reducing activities (e. g., R&D investment or the adoption of a more efficient technology) under the law. antidumping laws, antidumping duties, <b>dumping</b> <b>margins...</b>|$|R
