40|$|The {{interactions}} between climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> are of vital importance in shaping human vulnerability to global warming. In this chapter, this is illustrated for an important health risk induced by climate change, namely highland malaria in Africa. Despite the known causal links between climate and malaria transmission dynamics, the anticipated future impacts on disease risk are still surrounded by uncertainty, {{partly due to}} the fact that the relationship between vector-borne disease incidence and climate variables is complicated by many <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors.</b> We discuss some important <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> that are crucial in determining the vulnerability context in the face of global warming. Although we focus on the example of highland malaria in Africa, the need for a systems approach is equally valid for other health impacts (e. g. food security, heat waves, flooding, and health impacts related to water scarcity) ...|$|R

For factors which vary randomly over space (tree to tree or stand to stand), {{the best solution}} is to collect sufficient data (more samples) to compensate for confounding noise. Tree age is corrected for with various statistical methods: either fitting spline curves to the overall tree record or using similar aged trees for comparison over different periods (regional curve standardization). Careful examination and site selection helps to limit some confounding effects, for example picking sites undisturbed by modern man.|$|R
40|$|Many {{high quality}} landscapes {{can be found}} in the North West region of England, {{including}} those of international significance such as the Lake District National Park. These natural assets are recognised by the regional tourism strategy as particularly important, as they are a major determinant for visitors within, and to, the region. However, with the strategy geared towards increasing visitor numbers, there is a substantial challenge to be faced in the future: how to maintain the quality of an environment that is under combined pressure from both visitor numbers and climate change? Focusing on two landscape types considered to be the most vulnerable to a changing climate, the coastal zone and the uplands, this paper presents &# 039;downscaled&# 039; climate change scenarios, and provides an assessment of how a combination of climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> are likely to impact these vulnerable landscapes in the future.

40|$|Understanding spatiotemporal {{tree growth}} {{variability}} and its associations with climate can provide key insights into forest dynamics {{in the context}} of global climate change. Here, we conduct a comprehensive investigation on 64 ring-width chronologies across the entire Northwest (NW) China to understand the regional patterns of tree growth and climate-growth relationships. Using rotated principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis, we found that tree growth was mainly determined by the climate and could be classified into nine groups. Most of the tree-ring chronologies in NW China showed high correlations with moisture conditions in the current and previous growing seasons. After removing age-related growth trends, inter-annual tree growth patterns are supposed to be mainly determined by climate and climate-growth relationships. Since climate-growth relationships for most tree-ring chronologies in this arid region are similar, patterns of tree growth are mainly determined by climate variability. Within each group, the strength of the common signal increases under extreme climate conditions. Thus, climate plays a more important role in determining tree growth in extreme climate conditions relative to the <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors,</b> leading to more coherent growth patterns. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Reindeer {{pastoralism}} is a nomadic circumpolar livelihood involving {{more than}} 20 different indigenous peoples around the entire circumpolar north. The livelihood involves approximately 100, 000 people and 2, 5 million semi domesticated reindeer. This thesis is a {{comparative study of}} the social organization in two reindeer herding regions: the Yamal-Peninsula of Western Siberia, and Western-Finnmark of Northern Norway. This thesis investigates how resilience to climate change {{is embedded in the}} social organization of reindeer pastoralism, and further how <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> in terms of institutional constraints and opportunities affect resilience. The thesis shows that despite climatic differences and differences in the institutional setting, the social organisation of Nentsy pastoralists in Yamal and Sámi pastoralists in Finnmark have strong structural similarities, and further that the social organisation has mechanisms for securing resilience, as the organisation allows herders the freedom to determine the structure and size of the herd according to available natural resources and to determine the best strategy for mobility and migration. Further the thesis argues that the different institutional settings in the two regions are responsible for different effects on the resilience of Nentsy and Sámi reindeer pastoralists...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{continues}} to pose threats to fisheries and fishery-dependent communities globally. Vulnerability {{to climate change}} {{is a function of}} exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity is largely determined by the differences in socio-economic conditions among communities, and conflicts over resources often exacerbate this sensitivity. This study aims to understand factors affecting the sensitivity to climate change. The objectives are twofold: first, to develop indicators affecting sensitivity and to determine how they affect sensitivity, second, to compare sensitivity of two small-scale fishing groups (fishing camps and fishing villages). The study used twelve indicators, which are categorized into two; the community characteristics and assets, and threats and conflicts. Results show that fishing camps are less sensitive to climate change than fishing villages since they have more varied livelihood sources, such as crop farming. This allows for more sources of income. Both groups experience conflict with other lake users and wildlife attacks, which amplify their sensitivity through the reduction of fishing grounds and the damaging of fishing gear. It also shows that both climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> affect sensitivity, and understanding this can help to increase adaptive capacity. The findings allow for formulation of policy recommendations to help strengthen the livelihoods of small-scale fisheries...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} {{the benefits of}} framing {{adaptation to climate change}} as an issue of climate risk management and describes a number of methods and approaches that may be applied {{in the process of developing}} adaptation strategies. A key consideration when developing adaptation strategies is to have a sound understanding of how a given system functions in response to changes in both climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors,</b> and thus the need for a causal model which represents this understanding. There are a range of methods and tools that may be applied to assist with developing this system understanding in a climate risk assessment, and a number of these are described here. Moreover, given that adaptation planning is to a large degree about forward planning, all adaptation strategies will need to appropriately consider the implications of uncertainty on their likely effectiveness. This chapter provides a discussion of the ways in which adaptation strategies can be developed and decisions made when appraising different adaptation strategies. As such, it provides a basis upon which users can assess how they may approach adaptation as an issue of climate risk management and select and apply suitable methods.

40|$|We {{identified}} the spatiotemporal {{patterns of the}} Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the years 1982 - 2008 in the desert areas of Northwest China and quantified the impacts of climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> on NDVI changes. The results indicate that although the mean NDVI has improved in 24. 7 % of the study region; 16. 3 % among the region has been stagnating {{in recent years and}} only 8. 4 % had a significantly increasing trend. Additionally, 45. 3 % of the region has maintained a stable trend over the study period and 30. 0 % has declined. A multiple regression model suggests that a wetter climate (quantified by the Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) is associated with higher NDVI in most areas (18. 1 % of significance) but these historical changes in PDSI only caused an average improvement of approximately 0. 4 % over the study region. Contrasting the regression results under different trend patterns, no significant differences in PDSI impacts were detected among the four trend patterns. Therefore, we conclude that climate is not the primary driver for vegetative coverage in Northwest China. Future studies will be required to identify the impacts of specific non-climatic factors on vegetative coverage based on high-resolution data, which will be beneficial in creating an effective strategy to combat the recent desertification trend in China...|$|R

The analysis shows the importance of regular observations and monitoring of these islands to better understand reef island responses to climate stressors. We show that Grande Glorieuse Island has increased in area by 7. 5 ha between 1989 and 2003, predominantly {{as a result of}} shoreline accretion: accretionoccurred over 47 % of shoreline length, whereas 26 % was stable and 28 % was eroded. Topographic transects and field observations show that the accretion is due to sediment transfer from the reef outer slopes to the reef flat and then to the beach. This accretion occurred in a context of sea level rise: sea level has risen by about 6 cm in the last twenty years and the island height is probably stable or very slowly subsiding. This island expansion during a period of rising sea level demonstrates that sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling the shoreline changes. This paper highlights the key role of <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> in changes in island area, especially sediment availability and transport. We also evidence rotation of the island, underscoring the highly dynamic nature of reef islands...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a global issue with effects that are {{difficult}} to manage at a regional scale. Yet more often than not climate factors are just some of multiple stressors affecting species on a population level. Non-climatic factors—especially those of anthropogenic origins—may play equally important roles with regard to impacts on species and are often more feasible to address. Here we assess the influence of climate change on population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) over the last 30 years, using a Bayesian model. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid- 1990 s was accompanied by a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33 % of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to non-climate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. However, the extent of the contribution of these factors to declining population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data, creating a discussion bias towards climate variables, and effectively distracting from <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Climate {{change is}} already being {{experienced}} in the Arctic with implications for ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. This paper argues that an assessment of community vulnerability to climate change requires knowledge of past experience with climate conditions, responses to climatic variations, future climate change projections, and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> that influence people’s susceptibility and adaptive capacity. The paper documents and describes exposure sensitivities to climate change experienced {{in the community of}} Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories and the adaptive strategies employed. It is based on collaborative research involving semistructured interviews, secondary sources of information, and participant observations. In the context of subsistence hunting, changes in temperature, seasonal patterns (for example timing and nature of the spring melt), sea ice and wind dynamics, and weather variability have affected the health and availability of some species of wildlife important for subsistence and have exacerbated risks associated with hunting and travel. Inuit in Ulukhaktok are coping with these changes by taking extra precautions when travelling, shifting modes of transportation, travel routes and hunting areas to deal with changing trail conditions, switching species harvested, and supplementing their diet with store bought foods. Limited access to capital resources, changing levels of traditional knowledge and land skills, and substance abuse were identified as key constraints to adaptation.

40|$|Background This study {{describes}} heat- and cold-related {{mortality in}} 12 urban populations in low- and middle-income countries, thereby extending {{knowledge of how}} diverse populations, in non-OECD countries, respond to temperature extremes. Methods The cities were: Delhi, Monterrey, Mexico City, Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Salvador, So Paulo, Santiago, Cape Town, Ljubljana, Bucharest and Sofia. For each city, daily mortality was examined in relation to ambient temperature using autoregressive Poisson models (2 - to 5 -year series) adjusted for season, relative humidity, air pollution, day of week and public holidays. Results Most cities showed a U-shaped temperature-mortality relationship, with clear evidence of increasing death rates at colder temperatures in all cities except Ljubljana, Salvador and Delhi and with increasing heat in all cities except Chiang Mai and Cape Town. Estimates of the temperature threshold below which cold-related mortality began to increase ranged from 15 degrees C to 29 degrees C; the threshold for heat-related deaths ranged from 16 degrees C to 31 C. Heat thresholds were generally higher in cities with warmer climates, while cold thresholds were unrelated to climate. Conclusions Urban populations, in diverse geographic settings, experience increases in mortality due to both high and low temperatures. The effects of heat and cold vary depending on climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> such as the population disease profile and age structure. Although such populations will undergo some adaptation to increasing temperatures, many {{are likely to have}} substantial vulnerability to climate change.

40|$|Considerable {{barriers}} {{can emerge}} {{in developing and}} implementing climate change adaptation strategies. Understanding the nature of barriers to adaptation is important so as to find strategic {{ways of dealing with}} them. However, our current understanding is limited and highly fragmented across the academic community. This paper aims to bring some conceptual convergence in these debates by applying a systematic review method to assess the current state of knowledge on barriers to adaptation in the peer-reviewed literature. The review results show that: (1) Barriers to adaptation have hardly been defined in the literature and no clear indicators exist so as to identify and assess them systematically. (2) An impressive number of barriers have been reported, but the list of possible barriers is seemingly endless. (3) The most frequently reported barriers relate to the institutional and social dimensions of adaptation. (4) Barriers are identified as configurations of climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> and conditions that emerge from the actor, the governance system, or the system of concern. (5) Barriers are mainly studied in developed countries with a strong focus on water-related domains. (6) The majority of studies on barriers use small-n inductive case approaches while comparative studies across different contexts are limited. (7) Although interventions to overcome barriers are recommended by most studies, empirical studies on interventions are scarce. We present further conceptual clarification and a more precise definition of barriers to adaptation. We conclude that future research should go beyond asking the questions "if" and "which" barriers to adaptation exist and begin asking "how" and "why" barriers emerge...|$|R
40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{perceived}} {{as one of the}} biggest global health risks of the twenty-first century and a threat to the achievement of sustainable (economic) development; especially in developing countries, climate change is believed to further exacerbate existing vulnerability to disease and food security risks, because their populations are, for example, more reliant on agriculture and more vulnerable to droughts and have a lower adaptive capacity. Furthermore, the health-related impacts of climate change are threatening to undo decades of development policies. The interactions between climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> are of vital importance in shaping human vulnerability to global warming. Climate change cannot be seen as ‘a stand-alone risk factor,’ but rather as an amplifier of existing health and food security risks and an additional strain on institutional infrastructures. In order to avoid a multiplication of health risks in the developing world, {{there is a need to}} better understand the multifaceted and complex linkages involved. This is further illustrated for two important climate change–induced health risks, namely malnutrition and malaria. As the amplification of existing and emerging health risks in the developing world might become the greatest tragedy of climate change, adaptation ranks high on developing countries’ agendas. Of particular importance are the discussions about the ‘Green Climate Fund,’ which aims to administer billions of dollars for mitigation and adaptation. Of course, making funds for adaptation available is an important first step, but we also need to ask ourselves the question how such adaptation policies and projects should take shape. This paper demonstrates that an adequate response to climate change health risks should take a systems approach toward adaptation, acknowledging the importance of the local context of the most vulnerable...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation growth {{and the influence of}} climatic drivers from 1982 to 2011 across China using datasets from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic drivers. Long term trends, significance and abrupt change points of interannual NDVI time series were analyzed. We applied both simple regression and multi-regression models to quantify the effects of climatic drivers on vegetation growth and compare their relative contributions. Results show that on average, the growing season NDVI significantly increased by 0. 0007 year- 1, with 76. 5 % of the research area showed increasing NDVI from 1982 to 2011. Seasonally, NDVI increased at high rates during the spring and autumn while changed slightly during the summer. At a national scale, the growing season NDVI was significantly and positively correlated to temperature and precipitation, with temperature being the dominant factor. At regional scales, the growing season NDVI was dominated by increasing temperature in most forest-covered areas in southern China and dominated by precipitation in most grassland in northern China. Within the past three decades, the increasing trend of national mean NDVI abruptly changed in 1994, slowing down from 0. 0008 year- 1 to 0. 0003 year- 1. To be regional specific, the growing season NDVI in forest covered southern China has accelerated together with temperature since mid 1990 s, while parts of the grassland in northern China have undergone stalled NDVI trends corresponding to slowed temperature increment and dropped precipitation since around 2000. Typical region analysis suggested that apart from long term trends and abrupt change points of climatic drivers, the processes of NDVI variation were also affected by other external factors such as drought and afforestation. Further studies are needed to investigate the nonlinear responses of vegetation growth to climatic drivers and effects of <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> on vegetation growth...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{follows the}} hybrid format {{as defined by}} the Office of Graduate Studies at the University of New Mexico. The three chapters herein were prepared as manuscripts to be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals in the field of Earth sciences. Chapter 1 will be submitted to New Mexico Geology. Chapter 2 will be submitted to Geology. Chapter 3 will be submitted to the Geological Society of America Bulletin. The main theme of these works is an exploration of paleoenvironmental conditions recorded in the Paleocene siliciclastic sediments of the San Juan Basin, northwestern New Mexico. Chapter 1 is an investigation of the lithologic and stratigraphic properties of Cretaceous and Paleogene terrestrial siliciclastic rock units in the San Juan Basin. I used petrography, stratigraphy, and geochemistry to show that marked changes occurred in sedimentation styles, sedimentary sources, and regional landscape evolution in the study area during the Laramide Orogeny and that these changes caused observable trends in San Juan Basin rocks. Chapter 2 explores the enigmatic silcretes of the Nacimiento Formation. My work shows that these silcretes represent a product of silica diagenesis that cannot be explained using currently accepted models of silcrete genesis and that significant accumulation of volcanic ash occurred in the Paleocene San Juan Basin. Chapter 3 is an exploration of the paleosols preserved in the Nacimiento Formation. This work shows that widely used methods of estimating paleoclimate conditions based upon the geochemical composition of paleosols will produce inaccurate estimates in many realistic sedimentary basin environments. The major properties of Nacimiento Formation paleosols appear to be controlled by <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors.</b> I show that the evolution of a fluvial system can explain the observed trends.

40|$|Cropping {{patterns}} in the Builsa district of Ghana are gradually changing and faced with a perceived climate change and its negative consequences on the livelihoods of peasant farmers in the district, it is often assumed that climate change is the sole driver of changes in land- use decisions of peasants. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the perceptions of farmers towards climate change and to measure the extent to which climate variability affect cropping {{patterns in}} the Bulisa District of the upper east region of Ghana over the last two decades (1990 - 2009), how vulnerable peasants are and some response or adaptive measures by peasants in the District to climate change. Using household surveys, oral histories, group interviews and 24 -hour dietary recalls, substantial changes in cropping patterns were observed by peasant farmers in the Builsa district. Peasants have not only adopted new varieties of crops like soya beans and garden eggs but in addition cultivate improved varieties of old crops. These changes in crops grown were explained not only by climate factors such as increased temperatures, reduction in rainfall amount and distribution over the years, shifts in the onset of rains, but also, <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors.</b> From my informants, the most important thing is not about the total amount of rainfall received in a year rather its availability during the critical months of the cropping season. My informants also observed that insufficient labour, inadequate extension services, inability to purchase improved seeds and other agricultural inputs, the decline in market for some varieties of old crops, global influence through the activities of markets, NGOs and state departments and agencies etc, are partly responsible for the types of crops they grow today. It was also observed that off-farm and non-farm livelihood activities were not given the needed attention they deserved by peasants which might increase their level of vulnerability to changes in climate. It is the non-farm activities and the structural factors influencing the farming system that deserve much attention if the risk of climate change is to be reduced.

40|$|The {{socioeconomic}} {{costs of}} floods, droughts, and water scarcity {{in the years}} 2030 and 2095 are examined under three climate scenarios: continuation of the current climate and two climate-change scenarios based on projections from the respective results of the Canadian and Hadley general circulation models. Measures of the adequacy of water supplies to meet both withdrawal and instream uses under current and future conditions are developed for the 18 major water resources regions and 99 assessment subregions in the conterminous United States. Past and likely future changes in the infrastructure available to control and distribute water, the costs of nontraditional sources of supply, water management practices, conservation opportunities, {{the nature of the}} economy, slack in the water supply system, and institutions influencing water use are examined and provide the basis for evaluating the impacts of changes in both climate and <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> on U. S. water resources. The impacts of the climate changes are calculated as the changes in the costs of maintaining the projected no-climate change, non-irrigation off-stream water uses with the climate-altered supplies. The costs and benefits are estimated under three alternative management strategies that differ in the protection provided for stream-flows and irrigation. The results support several general conclusions. First, a greenhouse warming could have major impacts on the future costs of floods, droughts, and balancing water demands and supplies. Second, the contrasting hydrologic implications of the Canadian and Hadley climate models indicate that the magnitude as well as the direction of these impacts are uncertain and likely to vary significantly among water resources regions. Third, there are many oppor-tunities to adapt to changing hydrological conditions, and the net costs are particularly sensitive to the institutions that determine how the resource is managed and allocated among users.

Translating estimates of PAR into mortality indicates that climate change would in 2085 be responsible for 4 - 10 % of the mortality for hunger, malaria and coastal flooding under the four major IPCC scenarios, while the net PAR of water stress could increase from 0 - 72 %. Regarding environmental well-being, both global sink capacity and available habitat for ecosystems and species are projected to be higher in 2100 under the (richest-but-warmest) A 1 FI scenario than poorer-butcooler (B 1 and B 2) scenarios or under the actual (1990) baseline, while <b>non-climate</b> change related <b>factors</b> will dominate coastal wetland loss.

40|$|Several {{decision}} support systems {{were developed in}} recent years to encourage climate adaptation planning in coastal areas, especially at a national to global scale. However, few prototypes are easy to use and accessible for decision-makers to evaluate and manage risks locally. DESYCO is a GIS based {{decision support}} system specifically designed to better understand the risks that climate change poses at the regional/subnational scale (e. g. the effect of sea level rise and coastal erosion on human assets and ecosystems) and set the context of strategic adaptation planning within Integrated Coastal Zone Management. It implements a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology allowing the spatial assessment of multiple climate change impacts in coastal areas and the ranking of key elements at risk (beaches, wetlands, protected areas, urban and agricultural areas). The core of the system is a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model used to operationalize the steps of the RRA (hazard, exposure, susceptibility, risk and damage assessment) by integrating a blend of information from climate scenarios (global/regional climate projections and hydrodynamic/hydrological simulations) and from <b>non-climate</b> vulnerability <b>factors</b> (physical, environmental and socio-economic features of the analysed system). User-friendly interfaces simplify the interaction with the system, providing guidance for risk mapping, results communication and understanding. DESYCO was applied to low-lying coastal plains and islands (the North Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Gabes and the Republic of Mauritius), river basins and groundwater systems (Upper Plain of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche Region).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to clarify what kind of environmental factors that regulate net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (RE) in forest ecosystems across East Asia. Study sites were widely distributed and included diverse ecosystems, such as evergreen and deciduous, coniferous and broadleaf, planted and natural forests, from subarctic to tropical zones. We measured NEP using the eddy covariance technique at 13 forest sites in East Asia. Annual values of GPP and RE are simply regulated by annual mean air temperature across East Asia. There is a clear linear relationship between annual GPP and annual mean air temperature because the air temperature influences both growing period length and the seasonal variation of the maximum photosynthetic capacity, which, together, regulate the annual GPP. On the other hand, there is a strong exponential relationship between annual RE and annual mean air temperature on an East Asia scale, which is quite similar to the relation obtained on a canopy scale. The dependency of annual RE on air temperature on the East Asia scale was similar to that of monthly RE on air temperature on an individual site scale excepting for temperate larch and mixed forests in northern Japan. The reason why the relation is simple is that severe stress, which affects GPP or RE, is small in East Asia. The present study suggests that RE is sensitive to <b>non-climate</b> environmental <b>factors</b> when compared to GPP, thus the annual RE-air temperature relationship is more scattered than the annual GPP-air temperature relationship. The NEP is small at high latitude, relatively large at mid-latitude, and scattered at low latitude. As a whole, the NEP is more influenced by RE than GPP in East Asia. Compared to North America and Europe, the increase in the ratio of GPP to air temperature is slightly higher in East Asia. One of the possible reasons for this is that GPP in East Asia is not exposed to severe environmental stresses, such as summer drought. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} a range of global-mean sea-level rise and socio-economic scenarios on: (1) changes in flooding by storm surges; and (2) potential losses of coastal wetlands through the 21 st century. These scenarios are derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Four different storylines are analysed: the A 1 FI, A 2, B 1 and B 2 'worlds'. The climate scenarios are derived from the HadCM 3 climate model driven by the SRES emission scenarios. The SRES scenarios for global-mean sea-level rise range from 22 cm (B I world) to 34 cm (A 1 FI world) by the 2080 s, relative to 1990. All other climate factors, including storm characteristics, are assumed to remain constant in the long term. Population and GDP scenarios are downscaled from the SRES regional analyses supplemented with other relevant scenarios for each impact analysis. The flood model predicts that about 10 million people/year experienced coastal flooding due to surges in 1990. The incidence of flooding will change without sea-level rise, but these changes are strongly controlled by assumptions on protection. Assuming that defence standards improve with growth in GDP/capita (lagged by 30 years), flood incidence increases in all four cases to the 2020 s due to the growing exposed population. Then to the 2080 s, the incidence of flooding declined significantly to 5 million people/ year in the B 2 world, 2 million people/year in the B 1 world and 1 million people/year in the A 1 FI world due to improving defence standards. In contrast, flood incidence continues to increase in the A 2 world to the 2050 s, and in the 2080 s it is still 18 – 30 million people/year. This reflects the greater exposure and more limited adaptive capacity of the A 2 world, compared to the other SRES storylines. Sea-level rise increases the flood impacts in all cases although significant impacts are not apparent until the 2080 s when the additional people flooded are 7 – 10 million, 29 – 50 million, 2 – 3 million and 16 – 27 million people/year under the A 1 FI, A 2, B 1 and B 2 worlds, respectively. Hence, the A 2 world also experiences the highest increase in the incidence of flooding. This is true under all the realistic scenario combinations that were considered demonstrating that socio-economic factors can greatly influence vulnerability to sea-level rise. The trends of the results also suggest that flood impacts due to sea-level rise could become much more severe through the 22 nd century in all cases, especially in the A 1 FI world. Note that impacts using a climate model with a higher climate sensitivity would produce larger impacts than HadCM 3. Coastal wetlands will be lost due to sea-level rise in all world futures with 5 – 20 % losses by the 2080 s in the A 1 FI world. However, these losses are relatively small compared to the potential for direct and indirect human destruction. Thus, the difference in environmental attitudes between the A 1 /A 2 worlds and the B 1 /B 2 worlds would seem to have more important implications for the future of coastal wetlands, than the magnitude of the sea-level rise scenarios during the 21 st Century. These results should be seen as broad analysis of the sensitivity of the coastal system to the HadCM 3 SRES global-mean sea-level rise scenarios. While these impact estimates are only for one climate model, for both impact factors they stress the importance of socio-economic conditions and other <b>non-climate</b> <b>factors</b> as a fundamental control on the magnitude of impacts both with and without sea-level rise. The A 2 world experiences the largest impacts during the 21 st century, while the B 1 world has the smallest impacts, with the differences more reflecting socio-economic factors than climate change. This suggests that the role of development pathways in influencing the impacts of climate change needs to be given more attention. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} unique among the {{consequences}} of fossil fuel burning in its far reaching impact, both spatially and temporally. Earlier studies estimate the aggregated monetized damage due to climate change at 1. 5 to 2. 0 % of world GDP (for 2 × CO 2); the OECD would lose 1. 0 to 1. 5 % of GDP; the developing countries 2. 0 to 9. 0 %, according to these estimates. These figures are not comprehensive and highly uncertain. Newer studies increasingly emphasize adaptation, variability, extreme events, other (<b>non-climate</b> change) stress <b>factors</b> {{and the need for}} integrated assessment of damages. As a result, differences in impacts between regions and sectors have increased, the market impacts in developed countries tended to fall, and non-market impacts have become increasingly important. Marginal damages are more interesting from a policy point of view. Earlier estimates range from about US$ 5 to US$ 125 per tonne of carbon, with most estimates {{at the lower end of}} this range. These figures are based on polynomial functions in the level of climate change, but the rate of change may be equally important, as are the speed of adaptation, restoration and value adjustment. Furthermore, future vulnerability to climate change will be different from current vulnerability. On the whole, the market impacts fall (relatively) with economic growth while the non-market impacts rise (relatively) with growth...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} likely to have {{important}} consequences for spawning patterns and productivity cycles in the ocean, according to this report. Most international studies centred on change in the ocean take temperature increases into account. But other important variables that require consideration include changes to ocean chemistry (ie. acidification) impeding the ability of organisms to build shells; ocean circulation influencing population dynamics; and change in cloud cover and sea ice affecting light supply to the ocean surface. Although Australia has an extensive coastline and one of the largest fishing zones in the world, its coastal and mid-depth waters are considered to be low in productivity and fisheries are reliant on processes such as upwelling to provide nutrients. Using computer simulations of possible change up to 2030, the authors considered changes in temperature, ocean currents, winds, nutrient supply, rainfall and ocean chemistry. Changes to ocean circulation in the western Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea and an upward trend in water temperatures have led to environmental modification in south east Australia as the East Australian Current pushes further south carrying sub-tropical species into temperate waters. This is a region where climate models indicate rapid warming and a 50 -year observation program has shown a water temperature increase of two degrees Celsius; as a result, sub-tropical introductions to the Tasmanian east coast are already altering the habitat of a whole range of species, and introducing new species such as the sea urchin. The report generated three core findings: • While ocean temperature has a significant influence on observed changes in Australia’s marine flora and fauna, it is the combined effects of multiple climate and oceanographic factors that will shape Australia’s marine life in the future. • The ecological effects of <b>non-climate</b> related stress <b>factors</b> such as fisheries, coastal run-off and pollution which may reduce ecosystem resilience to climate change. • Programs to measure change and modelling of climate change impacts will be crucial components of a strategic national assessment of climate change impacts so that management strategies can be developed. The report identifies six key questions that required addressing by future modelling and ocean and coastal monitoring programs...|$|R
