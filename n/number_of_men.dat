The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> that remained was a significant factor {{in the creation of a}} homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

5|$|The British {{loss was}} given by the Loyalist {{publication}} Gaine's Mercury of September 1, 1777 as 5 killed, 7 wounded and 84 missing. Sir Henry Clinton wrote that the British took 259 prisoners in the engagement, whereas historian Douglas Southall Freeman gives the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> captured as 150. Twenty-one of the American prisoners were officers, {{one of whom was}} wounded; the ranking officer captured was Lieutenant Colonel Edward Antill.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} was not {{secure and}} when the Germans realised something was happening they opened fire with machine-guns and targeted the south bank with artillery fire, sinking some boats or killing their crews. At dawn the evacuation ended with around 500 men still waiting on the north bank. A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> tried to swim across and some {{made it to the}} far bank. Of the men left behind, 200 evaded capture and reached the safety of the south bank over the following days.|$|E
5|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> {{present at}} the battle is disputed. A major factor in this {{is the fact that}} no primary sources give the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> {{present at the}} battle, which leaves modern historians to {{estimate}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men.</b> Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus' army as 30,000, while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim that the size of the Rus' army was 80,000.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81. de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20,000, while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23,000 men.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 118. However, historian John Fennell, an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history, and one well-versed in the primary sources, calls many of these figures into doubt, saying the numbers given in the Russian sources (there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources, at least none that have survived, and other sources from other cultures, if they exist, are rather dubious) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves. The information given in the Novgorod First Chronicle and the Primary Chronicle would imply a total of 11,000 soldiers for the Rus' forces, but Fennel considers even these numbers to be exaggerations. While Russian historians in the Soviet era have traditionally given estimates of around 80,000-100,000, modern Russian historians have taken a revisionist stance with a consensus settling on drastically lower numbers, with the Mongols having a numerical advantage. Russian historian D.G. Khrustalev estimated in 2013 that the Rus' army consisted of 10,000 soldiers (including mercenaries), while the Cumans brought 5,000 cavalry, for a total of 15,000.Khrustalev, p. 416 Carl Sverdrup estimates the army at 8,000, and says 30,000 and 80,000 are enormous exaggerations. The Mongols evidently believed it was a considerable force, given the extreme lengths the Mongols went to dislocate its formations.|$|E

5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan.

5|$|A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> {{were hired}} for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, {{many of the}} workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimately}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> that joined the {{units of the}} 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, {{a large number of}} such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E

5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men,</b> including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E

She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men.

The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two tank {{companies}} and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha, supported with close air support.

5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard.

5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, on {{the front}} lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an outpost network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified the hill and surrounding areas, which served as an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations.
