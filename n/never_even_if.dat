6000|$|... "No, don't ask me how. At a price. It's a bargain. No, no! Don't think that,--a {{bargain with}} Justin, but not degrading. Don't, my dear, let {{the thought of}} it {{distress}} you. I have to give earnests.... Never, dear, never through all the dusty rest of life again will you and I speak together. <b>Never!</b> <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> we come face to face once more--no word...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It only {{remains for}} us, then, {{to decide whether}} we shall carry {{on the war in}} our {{national}} capacity,--one united people against a common enemy,--or whether some champion, famous in former fights, shall be selected to defy the slayer of our brother Antæus to single combat. In the latter case, though not unconscious that there may be taller men among you, I hereby offer myself for that enviable duty. And, believe me, dear countrymen, whether I live or die, the honor of this great country, and the fame bequeathed us by our heroic progenitors, shall suffer no diminution in my hands. Never, while I can wield this sword, of which I now fling away the scabbard,--never, never, <b>never,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the crimson hand that slew the great Antæus shall lay me prostrate, like him, on the soil which I give my life to defend." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{but there}} are {{theoretical}} arguments that such single-photon decays will <b>never</b> occur <b>even</b> <b>if</b> charge is not conserved.|$|R
5000|$|... (Smoking while underage heightens the {{addiction}} and damage to health caused by cigarettes. <b>Never</b> smoke, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> encouraged to by those around you.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So she was, mate," [...] {{agreed the}} sailor, [...] "an' a prettier lady I <b>never</b> knew, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> {{she is a}} mermaid, beggin' your pardon, ma'am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I shall <b>never</b> do, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> I fail {{in getting}} the mill. Do you know, Stephen, that I was {{admitted}} to the ranks of the Sons of Liberty last night?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Penguin Guide to Jazz {{says that}} [...] "the playing is richly evocative and <b>never</b> predictable, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> McBride and Peterson {{occasionally}} lapse into free‑jazz argot during some of Karayorgis's more abstract passages." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{included}} a wall charger and a USB cable to trickle-charge through the USB interface when {{connected to a}} PC (so the wall-socket charger can be left at home). The Non-Volatile File System (NVFS), also known as NVRAM, ensured that data was <b>never</b> lost <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the battery was fully discharged.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{aside from}} that," [...] I continued, [...] "what have I done {{that you should}} even me to dogs by such a supposition? I never yet failed a friend, and it's not likely I'll begin with you. There are things between us that I can <b>never</b> forget, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> you can." ...|$|R
50|$|A similar {{surrender}} table {{governs the}} USSR's surrender, although hostilities in the East will <b>never</b> entirely cease <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the Soviet regime is deemed to have fallen.|$|R
50|$|The hot-headed, fight-enjoying main character. While {{he loves}} a good fight, he detests {{pointless}} cruelty and <b>never</b> kills, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> {{his own life}} is threatened. His preferred weapon is a bokken (wooden sword). In combat, he wears the sentient helmet nicknamed 'Junk' and wields an energy weapon that seals the Ryūkei-dai away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} that you did from the first," [...] said Lenore. [...] "And {{it would make it}} much easier to talk to you than to any outsider, who would <b>never</b> understand, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it were {{possible}} for me to explain, {{how hard it is to}} see which way my duty lies--especially filial." ...|$|R
5000|$|Boyden {{began her}} {{television}} {{career as a}} performer on Young Talent Time (YTT) in 1973, {{at the age of}} seven. In June 1976 Bradley described how [...] "Television has never interfered with Sally's schooling and it <b>never</b> will. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> she decides to make a career out of show business, we want her to have a full education." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ross Anderson, {{professor}} of security engineering at Cambridge University, said: [...] "The message {{has to be}} this: {{if you care about}} your privacy, do not use BT, Virgin or Talk-Talk as your internet provider." [...] He added that, historically, anonymising technology had <b>never</b> worked. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> it did, he stressed, it still posed huge privacy issues.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you preach, Polly. If the {{governor}} took any notice of me, and cared how I got on, I {{would n't mind}} the presents so much; but he don't care a hang, and <b>never</b> <b>even</b> asked <b>if</b> I did well last declamation day, when I 'd gone and learned 'The Battle of Lake Regillus,' because he said he liked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have laid}} me under an {{obligation}} which I could <b>never</b> wipe out, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> I wished it," [...] he said. [...] "It {{was my only}} son you buried out there in Canada." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{perceived}} the view. I {{said to myself}} that {{nothing in the world}} could be more aristocratic. This was the slave-owning woman who had <b>never</b> worked, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> she had been reduced to live by her wits. She was a wonderful old woman. She made me dumb. She held me fascinated by the well-bred attitude, something sublimely aloof in her air of wisdom.|$|R
3000|$|... ‘I think {{behaviors}} among families are more important, {{because if we}} do not execute sustainable behaviors ourselves, the intention of producers will <b>never</b> be realized, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> sellers do produce sustainable products. (Participant 23)’ [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The other {{exception}} {{arises in}} the case where certain forms of pacta successoria are embodied in antenuptial contracts. Some of these dispositions may <b>never</b> be revoked <b>even</b> <b>if</b> both husband and wife desire to do so.|$|R
50|$|Another French {{typographic rule}} states that when {{addressing}} someone, styles like Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle, should <b>never</b> be abbreviated, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> {{followed by a}} title (hence, writing M. le Premier Ministre or Mme l'Ambassadeur would be considered clumsy).|$|R
50|$|The {{recurrence}} or retreatment classification {{is assigned}} if a cancer recurs after an interval {{during which the}} patient has been considered cancer-free (disease-free interval), or if the cancer progresses and the patient has <b>never</b> been disease-free (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> no retreatment is planned).|$|R
5000|$|Sharada {{the aged}} mother {{is seen as}} an {{unwanted}} burden by her son. He overlooks the commitment his mother has put entire life, in bringing him up and she has made so many sacrifices for him that he could <b>never</b> repay <b>even</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to. His lust for money is so grave that he drags his own mother to court. A heartbroken Sharada demands justice, but can a court of law provide it? ...|$|R
5000|$|Nominal typing {{means that}} two {{variables}} are type-compatible if {{and only if}} their declarations name the same type. For example, in C, two [...] types with different names in the same translation unit are <b>never</b> considered compatible, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> they have identical field declarations.|$|R
5000|$|Sylvia Sanchez as Leilani [...] "Lani" [...] San Juan: Olivia's {{sister and}} the one bound to save her {{relationship}} with Dante and Sheryl. She uses alcohol to keep the pain of her past from battling her emotions; she will try her hardest to have the family she has <b>never</b> had <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it takes getting rid of Olivia; she will learn from a support group to help her with her struggles. She's the adoptive mother/biological aunt of Sheryl.|$|R
60|$|If {{there be}} any further {{information}} which you think it necessary to possess, and which I have forgotten to communicate, write {{to me on the}} subject--or, far better, come here yourself, and ask of me with your own lips all that you desire to know. Come, and judge of the life I am now leading, by seeing it as it really is. Though it be only for a few days, pause long enough in your career of activity and usefulness, of fame and honour, to find leisure time for a visit to the cottage where we live. This is as much Clara's invitation as mine. She will <b>never</b> forget (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> I could!) all that I have owed to your friendship--will <b>never</b> weary (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> I should tire!) of showing you that we are capable of deserving it. Come, then, and see her as well as me--see her, once more, my sister of old times! I remember what you said of Clara, when we last met, and last talked of her; and I believe you will be almost as happy to see her again in her old character as I am.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a woman's decalogue," [...] Forrest said, [...] "there is no sin {{save the}} sin of being found out. Why not in ours? No one ever had such a chance {{of getting rid of}} a {{dangerous}} enemy. The whole thing is in our hands. We could never be found out, <b>never</b> <b>even</b> questioned. <b>If,</b> by one chance in a thousand, his body is ever recovered, what more natural? Men have been drowned before on the marshes here many a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good, that is good, indeed," [...] {{the colonel}} said, delighted. [...] "Malcolm, I feel my {{obligations}} to you {{more and more}} every day. Truly I had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> hoped that <b>if</b> my son were ever to be restored to me, I should have such cause {{to be proud of}} him." ...|$|R
30|$|As another example, one can {{consider}} that several countries have constraints on double nationality. Suppose, for instance, that Austria {{does not allow}} dual nationality with the Netherlands 5. In this case, we should exclude from the state space any query containing both attribute name-value pairs (nat,NL) and (nat,AT) (i.e., queries q 7, q 12, q 14 and q 16 in Fig.  1). Accordingly, given the query {(nat,AT)}, we expect this request to be <b>never</b> denied, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> some attribute is missing.|$|R
50|$|Intuitively, this {{behavior}} can be also understood by realizing that the base-emitter voltage in the bipolar transistor is very insensitive to bias changes, so any change in base voltage is transmitted (to good approximation) directly to the emitter. It depends slightly on various disturbances (transistor tolerances, temperature variations, load resistance, collector resistor if it is added, etc.) since the transistor reacts to these disturbances and restores the equilibrium. It <b>never</b> saturates <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the input voltage reaches the positive rail.|$|R
50|$|Tangible {{items are}} {{distinguished}} {{from one another}} by the assignment of a unique identifier {{in the form of}} a unique data string and encoded in a bar code placed on the item. An item unique identifier is only assigned to a single item and is never reused. Once assigned to an item, the IUID is <b>never</b> changed <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the item is modified or re-engineered. IUID is similar to social security numbering used to distinguish citizens of the United States from one another.|$|R
5000|$|The {{argument}} goes thusly. Most {{books on the}} annual ALA list of banned and challenged books were “only” challenged, <b>never</b> banned. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> some were removed from libraries, they are still available for purchase in book stores. Therefore, censorship hasn’t really happened because the government hasn't banned the books. .... Just because libraries and librarians have been so good at defending {{the freedom of the}} public to read as they choose, means that we're being dishonest? No, it just means we're doing our job.|$|R
60|$|<b>Never!</b> I think, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it weren't necessary, I {{should make}} him stay now. You and I are not people {{to run away}} from danger. After all, we're not obliged to yield to our passions--we can control them if we want to. For your own sake you must stay, Violet.|$|R
50|$|During the Muslim conquests of the Middle East and North Africa, some bishops fled to Christian-ruled areas. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> they <b>never</b> returned, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the Christian {{population}} of their dioceses dispersed or adopted Islam, {{they were still}} seen as bishops of those dioceses, who could give rise, even after long interruption (exile and/or vacancy), to a 'restored' line of apostolic succession on each see.|$|R
25|$|Rose again {{announced}} her intentions to appeal her sentence via her solicitor Leo Goatley in October 2000, although in September 2001, she {{announced her}} intentions to cancel her appeals, stating she would <b>never</b> feel free <b>even</b> <b>if</b> released. Nonetheless, Rose maintains her innocence {{in any of}} the murders for which she was convicted.|$|R
30|$|The safety {{criterion}} {{requires the}} incoming vehicle from back to have back gap greater than current speed multiplied by factor. It {{was based on}} the assumption that vehicles coming from the rear would <b>never</b> decelerate <b>even</b> <b>if</b> a vehicle would enter into their lane ahead of them. Hence, the required gap calculated by safety criterion was much higher than those observed in field [21]. This may possibly cause large and unrealistic vehicular queues at lower densities as the vehicles would rarely get enough gaps for overtaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you will; {{but it is}} not needful. Peter, I {{think that}} I know you too well; I think that your heart will <b>never</b> stir <b>even</b> <b>if</b> I be dead and you married to another. And yet men are men, and women have wiles, so I will swear this: That should you slip, perchance, and I live to learn it, I will try not to judge you harshly." [...] And again she laughed, she who was so certain of her empire over this man's heart and body.|$|R
