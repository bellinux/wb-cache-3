5|$|Bruce's trusted {{butler and}} confidant, who {{acts as a}} father figure to Bruce but is unable to accept Bruce's desire to revive his Batman persona, even resigning from his {{position}} to impress the seriousness of his position upon him. Christopher Nolan emphasized the emotional bond between Alfred and Bruce, stressing its importance in the previous films and predicting that the relationship will be strained as it <b>never</b> <b>has</b> before.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is the {{outermost}} {{of the four}} Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits {{at a distance of}} approximately 1880000km (26.3 times the 71492km radius of Jupiter itself). This is significantly larger than the orbital radius1070000kmof the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in the mean-motion resonance—in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked—and probably <b>never</b> <b>has.</b>|$|E
5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

5|$|Uru is {{a revolutionary}} {{adventure}} game {{that takes the}} best qualities of the Myst franchise and makes them even better. The single-player experience will eclipse the beauty, grandeur, and mind-challenging elements of previous titles. Plus, with the option to join a constantly updated online universe, the adventure <b>never</b> <b>has</b> to end. From new machines and puzzles to special events and entirely new Ages, players will find more to do, more to see, and more to explore each time they return—and this time, they can discover everything with old and new friends.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket <b>never</b> <b>has</b> any business whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman <b>never</b> <b>has</b> to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

25|$|In {{this case}} the PID {{controller}} measures the derivative of the measured process variable (PV), rather than the derivative of the error. This quantity is always continuous (i.e., <b>never</b> <b>has</b> a step change {{as a result of}} changed setpoint). This modification is a simple case of setpoint weighting.|$|E

Thou, my beloved little friend, hast done it all. And now let us give Pegasus his liberty." ...|$|R

Evans's lawyer stated that his client <b>never</b> <b>has</b> had a mustache and that photos as well as eyewitness testimony would reveal that Evans has never had a mustache.|$|E
25|$|EA {{does not}} {{discriminate}} against any demographic. All {{that is needed}} to join EA is a desire to become emotionally well. EA is not, and <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been, a program specifically for people of any particular background or treatment history. It is not uncommon for individuals in recovery from addictions or former patients in psychiatric hospitals to seek help in EA after being discharged.|$|E

25|$|A run out cannot {{occur if}} no fielder has touched the ball. As such, if a batsman plays a {{straight}} drive which breaks the non-striker's stumps whilst he is outside his crease, {{he is not}} out. However, if a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches the ball at all before it breaks the stumps at the non-striker's end, then it is a run out, even if the fielder <b>never</b> <b>has</b> any control of the ball.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene <b>never</b> <b>has</b> a fixed effect, so {{how is it possible}} to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Like other Northern Irish banks, Bank of Ireland {{retains its}} note-issuing rights {{from before the}} {{partition}} of Ireland; while Bank of Ireland is headquartered in Dublin, it issues sterling notes within the United Kingdom. In spite of its name, Bank of Ireland is not, and <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been, a central bank; it is a retail bank. Its sterling notes {{should not be confused}} with banknotes of the former Irish pound which were in use in the Republic of Ireland before the adoption of the euro in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The Capital Township {{formed from}} Springfield Township on July 1, 1877, and was {{established}} and {{named by the}} Sangamon County Board on March 6, 1878, {{and the limits of}} the township and City of Springfield were made co-extensive on February 17, 1892 to better serve the people. There are three functions of this township: assessing property, collection first property tax payment, and assisting residents that live in the township. One thing that makes the Capital township unique is that the township <b>never</b> <b>has</b> to raise taxes for road work, since the roads are maintained by the Springfield Department of Public Works.|$|E
25|$|Lick fit is {{the frantic}} licking to which Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs can be prone. This has been {{reported}} in 17% of the breed. When {{in the middle of a}} lick fit, the dog will lick anything they can — carpet, floors, walls — and will eat anything they can find, including grass, leaves, dirt, carpet, and will gulp air and swallow constantly. Their actions make it obvious they are in severe gastrointestinal discomfort. Many owners are able to prevent lick fits by ensuring the dog <b>never</b> <b>has</b> an empty stomach by frequent, smaller meals and large dog biscuits as between meal snacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the gojūon table {{promotes}} a systematic view of kana syllabograms as being always pronounced with the same single consonant followed by a vowel, {{but this is not}} exactly the case (and <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been). Existing schemes for the romanization of Japanese either are based on the systematic nature of the script, e.g. nihon-siki チ ti, or they apply some Western graphotactics, usually the English one, to the common Japanese pronunciation of the kana signs, e.g. Hepburn-shiki チ chi. Both approaches conceal the fact, though, that many consonant-based katakana signs, especially those canonically ending in u, can be used in coda position, too, where the vowel is unvoiced and therefore barely perceptible.|$|E
