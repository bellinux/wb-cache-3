25|$|Arabian {{ostriches}} {{had been}} extinct from Israel years ago. The <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostrich</b> native to North Africa has been reintroduced from captivity {{to the open}} areas and reserves of the Negev desert in Israel where the Arabian ostriches lived before their extinction.|$|E
25|$|Research {{conducted}} by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany in India found molecular evidence that ostriches lived in India 25,000 years ago. DNA tests on fossilized eggshells recovered from eight archaeological sites in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh found 92% genetic similarity between the eggshells and the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostrich.</b> This suggests that ostriches traveled between India and Africa before the two landmasses drifted apart.|$|E
2500|$|The cheetah exhibit, a [...] long, [...] {{wide area}} {{is home to}} two cheetahs. It lies across a water break from the larger exhibit {{containing}} southern white rhinoceroses, greater kudu, sitatungas, a <b>north</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostrich,</b> black-crowned cranes, and goliath herons inhabit the areas {{at the end of}} the boardwalk. This [...] exhibit allows plenty of room for the animals to roam. The zoo has been a successful breeder of southern white rhinos, with over a dozen successful births.|$|E
50|$|In Tunisia, <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> {{were once}} {{common in the}} {{southern}} region of the country. The subspecies had been extirpated since 1887. In 2014, <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> were finally returned to Tunisia after 127 years of being extinct. The birds were first reintroduced to Dghoumès National Park. They were then reintroduced to Sidi Toui National Park, and then to Orbata Faunal Reserve.|$|R
50|$|In 1988-89, the ostriches, {{originally}} {{taken from}} Sudan, {{were introduced to}} National Wildlife Research Center in Saudi Arabia. A reintroduction project using the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> was set up at Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in 1994. Currently, {{it is estimated that}} 90 to 100 individuals are living within the reserve. It was proposed that the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> should also reintroduced to Al-Khunfah Protected Area.|$|R

2500|$|The wild common ostrich {{population}} has declined drastically {{in the last}} 200 years, with most surviving birds in reserves or on farms. However, its range remains very large (...) , leading the IUCN and BirdLife International to treat it as a species of Least Concern. Of its 5 subspecies, the Arabian ostrich (S. c. syriacus) became extinct around 1966, and the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostrich</b> (S. c. camelus) has declined {{to the point where}} it now is included on CITES Appendix I and some treat it as Critically Endangered.|$|E

50|$|The park {{is home to}} 27 {{species of}} large mammals such as Masai lions, African leopards, Sudan cheetahs, over 160 species of birds, 32 species of fish, and small mammals, bats, reptiles, and amphibians. It is in a major flyway used by birds {{migrating}} between Eurasia and Africa. There are many <b>North</b> <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> residing in the national park as well. In 2016, a population of lions, possibly ranging from about 73-146, were discovered in Dinder National Park by {{a team led by}} Oxford University's Hans Bauer. Besides those discovered in the adjacent Alatash National Park in Ethiopia, they are thought to be of Central African origin.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{great variety}} of birdlife and for the birdwatcher, the park is a paradise, Included amongst the several bird species are: South <b>African</b> <b>ostrich,</b> <b>African</b> openbills, barbets, bee-eaters, buzzards, coots, cormorants, doves, hamerkops, jacanas, kingfishers, grey herons, darters, Goliath herons, fish eagles, glossy {{starlings}} and lilac-breasted rollers.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to investigate the morphology and topographic distribution, developmental changes of somatostatin-producing cells in the small intestinal of <b>African</b> <b>ostrich</b> chicks at different ages: 1 day (birth), 45 days, 90 (days) and 334 (control). The results were as follows: Somatostatin (SOM) cells {{were present in the}} mucosal layer of whole small intestinal of the <b>African</b> <b>ostrich</b> on all checked days. SOM cells had round and spherical shapes (closed-type cells) or spindle and pyriform shapes (open-type cells). SOM cells were localized preferentially in the duodenum of 90 days old ostrich. The quantity of SOM-IP cells increased gradually after birth until 90 days and peaked on 90 days in the duodenum, meanwhile it decreased gradually after birth until 90 days and footed on 90 days in the jejunal and ileal regions. These results indicated that SOM might be involved in functional and developmental regulation of small intestinal of <b>African</b> <b>ostrich</b> chicks...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{studying}} nutrition <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> for different ages in zoos, nurseries and small farms evaluated the nutritional value and balance {{of each of the}} components of plant feed, providing the needs for normal growth of poultry, development and productivity, to increase body weight, to increase egg production, quality hatching eggs, meat quality, output and quality of the young. Currently, in most cases, bird feed by copying the natural food, but it is the species, age and seasonal specifics, ensure that in the conditions of the zoo, nursery and farm problematic. Therefore, to solve this problem, we proposed the formulation of plant feed for feeding <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> in a zoo, nurseries and small farms that promote bird health, increase the rate of feeding, increase egg production, increase their survival, as well as the possibility of replacing expensive raw mat erials at cheaper developed using the optimization program "Food Optima Expert". To sustain ostriches exchange energy feed should be not less than 260 kcal / 100 g, protein content not less than 16 %. The complex research to develop formulations of plant feed for <b>African</b> <b>ostriches</b> in a zoo, nurseries and small farms and the quality of their analysis may be of interest in the full feeding <b>African</b> <b>ostriches.</b> The proposed formulation can extend its range of multi-component feed with a sufficiently high biological, energy value, the balanced composition of essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals adapted for ostriches, as well as the possibility of replacing expensive raw materials at lower cost...|$|R
