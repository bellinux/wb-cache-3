5|$|The Capitol Loop {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} highway {{running through}} Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique reassurance markers—the signs that serve as regular reminders of the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector496 for inventory purposes. The highway follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The 365-day haab was {{produced}} by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day winals, completed {{by the addition of}} 5-day period called the wayeb. The wayeb was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns. In a similar way to the tz'olkin, the named winal would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), {{in the case of the}} shorter wayeb period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the tz'olkin had a <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the haab, producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by Mayanists as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.|$|E

5|$|The {{market for}} replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue {{generated}} for leading clubs {{and the frequency}} with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m. Several clubs have been accused of price fixing, and in 2003 Manchester United were fined £1.65m by the Office of Fair Trading. The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying fake shirts which are imported from countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Nonetheless, the chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club. In the first six months after David Beckham's transfer to Real Madrid the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name. A market has also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items. The shirt worn by Pelé in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.|$|E

25|$|William Rowley {{was born}} on February 8, 1824, in Gouverneur, New York in St. Lawrence County, in northern-most New York. He came to Galena, in Jo Daviess County, Illinois, in 1843, and taught school in Brown County, Ohio, and in Jo Daviess County, Illinois. Rowley married Elizabeth Miller in 1847, with their {{marriage}} producing four children. However, a discrepancy exists between accounts of his wife's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> of children, i.e. it is also reported that her maiden name was Caroline Brush, whom he married in February 1862, in North Port, Suffolk County, NY, and mentions only three children, Charles, Alice, and Martha.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins had {{the number}} 21 {{painted on the}} field, at a parking lot {{entrance}} and in the Redskins Ring of Fame, all three of which became temporary memorials.

25|$|The Domain Name System {{specifies}} a set {{of various}} types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (<b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number),</b> an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a resource record set (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.|$|E

TARC claims over 7,000 bus stops, although only about 200 of them have benches and rain shelters—the rest simply have a sign indicating the location is a bus stop. The stops are served by 32 weekday and weekend routes, 12 express routes with weekday service only, totalling 44 routes. The daily routes are named for the primary road they serve. On the daily routes, {{there is no more}} than hour between scheduled buses at any stop, and on weekdays on the busiest routes have even less time between stops. Most of the daily routes have existed under the same <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> for decades, although their routes have almost all been extended to provide access to suburban locations.|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 2012, the Spurs {{unveiled}} a silver alternate uniform. In breaking {{from the traditional}} practice of placing the team or city name in front, the Spurs' new uniform features only the stylized spur logo, with the black number trimmed in white and silver on the upper right. The Spurs primary logo is atop the player <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> on the back (replaced by the NBA logo prior to the 2014–15 season), while the Eurostile 'SA' initials (for San Antonio) are on the left leg of the shorts. Black, silver and white side stripes are also featured on the uniform. The uniforms are worn for select home games. A variation of this uniform, featuring military camouflage patterns {{instead of the usual}} silver, was used for two games in the 2013–14 season; a sleeved version was used the next season. Another variation, this time in black, was unveiled for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
25|$|On {{the return}} of the {{regiment}} from Germany in 1814 following the First Bourbon Restoration, it went to Paris and received the title of dragons du Roi, as the most senior regiment of dragoons (the previous 1st Dragoon Regiment now was a regiment of chevau-légers lanciers). Following Napoleon's return to France, it returned to its previous <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> on 23 April 1815. During the Hundred Days, the regiment was initially part of the 4th Reserve Cavalry Division. In the Army of the North's Belgian campaign, {{it was part of the}} 11th Cavalry Division, in Marshal François Étienne de Kellermann's III Reserve Cavalry Corps. During the retreat following the battle of Waterloo, the 2nd Dragoons attacked and defeated a Prussian force in a skirmish at Sentis. After Napoleon's surrender, it joined the many units camped out in the Loire valley while a new settlement between the coalition and the Bourbons was made. The regiment was dissolved on 4 December 1815, after the Second Bourbon Restoration.|$|E

25|$|A {{bright spot}} {{in the midst of}} the team's disappointing seasons came from a terrible tragedy. In February 2011, former Stingrays goaltender Kirk Daubenspeckwho played for the team from 1999 to 2006 and was part of the Kelly Cup {{championship}} team in 2001was in a near-fatal car accident that resulted in a traumatic brain injury that left him in a coma for six days. Friends, family members and former teammates from the Stingrays, the Hershey Bears, Culver Military Academy and the University of Wisconsin (Daubenspeck's alma maters) banded together to raise money to help defray the extensive medical bills. The team sold T-shirts bearing Daubenspeck's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> (29) at the season's remaining home games. In April 2011, current and former Stingrays donned their skates and took to the ice for the team's first ever alumni game, held to benefit the Daubenspeck family. The event (held at the Carolina Ice Palace) drew a capacity crowd of over 700 and raised over $20,000 in ticket sales and from a post-game jersey auction. Daubenspeck and his family were in attendance, and Daubenspeck dropped the game's ceremonial first puck.|$|E
25|$|On May 13, {{investigators}} searched several {{locations in}} the northeastern U.S. They detained three Pakistani men. Two, cousins who were living at a house in Watertown, Massachusetts, were Brookline, Massachusetts, gas station attendant Aftab Ali Khan (27 {{years old at the}} time, who was set to fly from the U.S. to Pakistan the day he was arrested, and whose visa had expired six months prior) and Boston-area cabdriver Pir Kahn (43 at the time). The two denied knowing Shahzad, but a search of their home found an envelope with Shahzad’s surname and phone number among Aftab Ali Khan's belongings. Shahzad's <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>number</b> were also found in a cell phone believed to belong to Aftab Ali Khan. The third man detained was Mohammad Shafiq Rahman, a 33-year-old computer programmer living in South Portland, Maine. He had known Shahzad in the past, lived in Connecticut a few years prior, and went to Maine in approximately 2008. They were detained on immigration, not criminal, charges. The FBI also conducted searches at a gas station in the nearby town of Brookline, in Camden and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and in Centereach and Shirley, New York, on Long Island. U.S. Attorney General Holder said there was evidence the men had provided money to Shahzad through an informal money transfer network (known as a hawala), but it was not yet clear if they were aware of the bombing plot.|$|E
