25|$|At Fastlane, Neville {{retained}} the WWE Cruiserweight Championship by defeating Gentleman Jack Gallagher. The following night on Raw, Neville again retained his championship against Rich Swann in Swann's rematch from the Royal Rumble. After the match, Neville {{said there was}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> in the cruiserweight division that could compete with him. Austin Aries, who {{had been out of}} action due to injury, disagreed and attacked Neville, insinuating his desire to challenge Neville for the title. On the March 13 episode of Raw, it was revealed that a fatal five-way elimination match between Aries, T.J. Perkins, Tony Nese, Akira Tozawa, and The Brian Kendrick was scheduled for the following night on 205 Live to determine the number one contender for Neville at WrestleMania 33, which was won by Aries, and the match was scheduled for the Kickoff pre-show. The two traded barbs {{over the next couple of}} weeks and on the final 205 Live before WrestleMania, Neville attacked Aries and retreated before Aries could counterattack.|$|E

25|$|Customs for {{reciting the}} Mourner's Kaddish vary {{markedly}} among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom {{is that all}} the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish {{at the end of the}} service.|$|E

500|$|With the Yuan dynasty crumbling, {{competing}} {{rebel groups}} began fighting {{for control of}} the country and thus the right to establish a new dynasty. In 1363, Zhu Yuanzhang eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel Han faction, Chen Youliang, in the Battle of Lake Poyang, arguably the largest naval battle in history. Known for its ambitious use of fire ships, Zhu's force of 200,000 Ming sailors were able to defeat a Han rebel force over triple their size, claimed to be 650,000-strong. The victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction, leaving Zhu Yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful Yangtze River Valley and cementing his power in the south. After the dynastic head of the Red Turbans suspiciously died in 1367 while a guest of Zhu, there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne, and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital Dadu (present-day Beijing) in 1368. The last Yuan emperor fled north to the upper capital Shangdu, and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground; the city was renamed Beiping in the same year. Zhu Yuanzhang took Hongwu, or [...] "Vastly Martial", as his era name.|$|E
500|$|The selectors, after {{a six-hour}} meeting, chose {{the team to}} tour South Africa on 27 August 1968. The {{official}} records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, Peter May, Don Kenyon and Alec Bedser; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and Donald Carr for the MCC; and possibly Maurice Allom, another MCC member. Oborne suggests {{that one of those}} present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely. He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, [...] "Everyone in the room, {{with the possible exception of}} the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled." [...] Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.|$|E
500|$|At the September 2016 Family Research Council Action Values Voter Summit (VVS) in Washington, DC, where Republican {{presidential and}} vice presidential {{candidates}} Donald Trump and Mike Pence also spoke, Bevin [...] "both lamented {{and called for}} revolution and bloodshed to 'redeem' what [...] be lost" [...] if Hillary Clinton were to be victorious in the 2016 presidential election, according to one review of Bevin's speech. He used and echoed the language about [...] "the tree of liberty" [...] being refreshed by the blood of patriots and addressed his own family in the same regard– [...] "I have nine children ... it might be their blood [...] is needed." [...] A second review of the speech said Bevin [...] "urged young Americans especially to 'be bold' and to avoid the temptation to be silent {{in the face of}} left-wing ideologues attempting to remake America." [...] This review continued through [...] "Neville Chamberlains in the world" [...] contrasting with [...] "a Winston Churchill" [...] and [...] "It's a slippery slope.... First, we're killing [...] children , then it's 'Don't ask, don't tell,' now it's this gender-bending kind of 'don't be a bigot,' 'don't be unreasonable,' 'don't be unenlightened.'" [...] Before the final call to service and sacrifice in the speech, in this account, an audience member and then Bevin addressed [...] "hose blood will be shed" [...] in, as another account put it, [...] "violent metaphor." [...] Afterwards, Bevin was asked about the [...] "blood ... shed" [...] part of the speech and, according to a summary, [...] "appeared to say {{he was referring to the}} cost paid by men and women in uniform." [...] A third account of the VVS appearance said he had spoken without notes or teleprompter. Another account reported that he [...] "referenced the rise of the Nazis preceding the Holocaust twice, invoking German pastor Martin Niemöller's oft-cited quote that ends, 'then they came for me– and there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> to speak for me.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|And Then There Were None (1943 play) is Christie's {{adaptation}} of the story for the stage.

2500|$|Historian David Stannard {{writes that}} by the year 1769, the {{destruction}} of the American aboriginal population down to just one-third of one percent of the total American population of 76 million was the most massive genocide in world history, and [...] "there was, at last, almost <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> to kill." [...] According to anthropologist Russell Thornton, for the American Indians [...] "the arrival of the Europeans marked the beginning of a long holocaust, although it came not in ovens, as it did for the Jews. The fires that consumed North America Indians were the fevers brought on by newly encountered diseases, the flashes of settlers' and soldiers' guns, the ravages of [...] "firewater," [...] the flames of villages and fields burned by the scorched-earth policy of vengeful Euro-Americans." [...] David Quammen likened colonial American practices toward Native Americans to those of Australia toward its aboriginal populations, calling both genocide. Some authors, including Holocaust scholar David Cesarani, have argued that United States government policies in furtherance of its so-called Manifest Destiny constituted genocide.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{persecution}} and mob action in Missouri, Illinois, and other states, and {{the assassination of}} their prophet Joseph Smith in 1844, Mormon leader Brigham Young was chosen by {{the leaders of the}} Latter Day Saints (LDS) church to lead the LDS settlers west. He chose to lead his people to the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, especially picked fast-moving group of men and women from their Winter Quarters encampments near Omaha, Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in Iowa including Council Bluffs. About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year as they filtered in from Mississippi, Colorado, California, and several other states. The initial pioneers were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of emigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in Nebraska to Fort Laramie in present-day Wyoming. They initially started out in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. Organized as a complete evacuation from their previous homes, farms, and cities in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, this group consisted of entire families with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>left</b> behind. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not try to cover as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California bound emigrants. Typically taking about 100 days to cover the [...] trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants typically averaged about [...] per day.) In Wyoming, the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to Fort Bridger, where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the rough path known as Hastings Cutoff, used by the ill-fated Donner Party in 1846.|$|E
