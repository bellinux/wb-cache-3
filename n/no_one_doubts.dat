25|$|We {{know little}} {{about the timing of}} language's {{emergence}} in our species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may tell us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke. While <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that they communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.|$|E

50|$|Notwithstanding this, Greenway was {{certainly}} responsible for bringing a mature party system into Manitoba politics.

"No, Susy," [...] {{answered}} the boy, slipping into his place--with a compound expression {{in which the}} spirit of fun, whom <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted,</b> gave the lie {{to the spirit of}} penitence, in whom <b>no</b> <b>one</b> believed--"but I've bin to a sort o' Sunday class a'ready." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly, certainly. Of course <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> your word," [...] replied Blacky, {{with the}} utmost politeness. [...] "But you say {{yourself}} that Farmer Brown's boy didn't see Buster Bear, but only his footprint. Perhaps he didn't know whose it was, {{and if he had}} he wouldn't have been afraid. Now I've got a plan by which we can see for ourselves if he really is afraid of Buster Bear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure. It was {{the common}} talk through Wall Street yesterday, and {{everybody}} believes it"--there {{was no more}} truth in the story, than {{in one of the}} forty reports that have killed General Jackson so often, in the last twenty years.

We pledged eternal allegiance to our hostess, and so without a care of the future, watched the New Year dawn.|$|R
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> Germany's {{economic}} and engineering prowess; {{the question was}} how long bitter memories of the war would cause Europeans to distrust Germany, and whether Germany could demonstrate it had rejected totalitarianism and militarism and embraced democracy and human rights.|$|R
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> that it {{had been}} the latter, when, three days later, Henri II., in the prime of his {{strength}} and height of his spirits, encountered young Des Lorges in the lists, received the splinter of a lance in his eye, and died two days afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} it over deeply," [...] Dias said. [...] "First as to mines; at present almost all the gold that is obtained is acquired by washing the sands of rivers. Here and there gold {{has been found in}} rocks, but not in sufficient quantities to make mining pay. The rivers whose sands are richest in gold are in the mountains that lie behind Lake Titicaca, which lies to the south of Cuzco and on the border of Bolivia. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that in the time of the Incas there existed gold mines, and very rich ones; for {{if it had not been}} so it is impossible to account for the enormous amount of gold obtained by the Spanish conquerors, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that they got but a small portion of the gold in existence when they arrived. It is of no use whatever for us to search the old ruins of the Incas in Cuzco, or their other great towns; all that can be found there has already been carried away.|$|E
60|$|Or, on {{the other}} hand, {{conditions}} remaining the same, let a given organism vary (and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that they do vary) in two directions: into one form (a) better fitted to cope with these conditions than the original stock, and a second (b) less well adapted to them. Then it is no less certain that the conditions in question must exercise a selective influence in favour of (a) and against (b), so that (a) will tend to predominance, and (b) to extirpation.|$|E
60|$|Enough has, perhaps, {{been said}} {{to prove the}} {{existence}} of a general uniformity in the character of the protoplasm, or physical basis, of life, in whatever group of living beings it may be studied. But it will be understood that this general uniformity by no means excludes any amount of special modifications of the fundamental substance. The mineral, carbonate of lime, assumes an immense diversity of characters, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that, under all these Protean changes, it is one and the same thing.|$|E

60|$|The young Warreners {{had been}} mourned as dead, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> {{that they had}} been carried to Cawnpore, and had shared the fate of the {{garrison}} of that place; and the joy of their father therefore was intense, while the whole corps, with whom the boys were general favorites, were delighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far {{the most}} pushing of {{newspaper}} reporters {{had been unable to}} glean further information from the police; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted,</b> however, but that the man in charge, who gave his name as George Higgins, had killed the bookmaker for purposes of robbery.

6000|$|... "Very well. I {{shall be}} {{here all the}} forenoon," [...] {{answered}} Cavanagh, {{in the tone of}} a man accepting a challenge; then, turning to the girl, he said, earnestly: [...] "I want to help you. I shall be here for lunch, and meanwhile I wish you would take Redfield into your confidence. He's a wise old boy, and everybody knows him. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> his motives; besides, he has a family, and is rich and unhurried. Would you like me to talk with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{no doubt}} that Matthew Arnold says much that is true of the narrowness, bigotry, and jealous un-Christian temper of Puritanism; and I suppose <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that they do {{misrepresent}} the true doctrine of Christianity, both by their exclusive devotion to one side only of the teaching of the Bible, and by their misconception of their own favourite portions of Scripture. The doctrine of the Atonement was never in ancient times, I believe, drawn out in the form in which Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and others have lately stated it.|$|E

25|$|When Norquay {{resigned}} as Premier in 1887, his successor David H. Harrison also became {{leader of the}} Conservative parliamentary caucus. Norquay was able to reclaim the latter position early in 1888, following an extremely divided meeting of senior Conservative politicians. By this time, the new Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway had formally introduced party government to the province, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> that Norquay was now the province's Conservative leader.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> on the whole, {{that she}} [...] Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair, [...] And fresh, and [...] "beautiful exceedingly,"[346] [...] Who with the {{brightest}} Georgians[347] might compare: [...] They wondered how Gulbeyaz, too, could be [...] So silly as to buy slaves who might share [...] (If that his Highness wearied of his bride) [...] Her Throne and Power, and everything beside.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} more than a parallel, there is a close and {{intimate}} connexion between psychology and physiology. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that, at any rate, some mental states are dependent for their existence on the performance of the functions of particular bodily organs. There is no seeing without eyes, and no hearing without ears. If the origin of the contents of the mind is truly a philosophical problem, then the philosopher who attempts to deal with that problem, without acquainting himself with the physiology of sensation, has no more intelligent conception of his business than the physiologist, who thinks he can discuss locomotion, without an acquaintance with the principles of mechanics; or respiration, without some tincture of chemistry.|$|E

I tell you <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> anything you have written. That's the genius of it. No one denies it, no one attempts arguments, every one in England and France whose feelings have been ruffled is already wanting to shake hands all over again.

'There must be {{an immense}} amount of {{property}} somewhere. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that he was rich {{when he came to}} England two years ago, and they say everything has prospered that he has put his hand to since. The Mexican Railway shares had fallen this morning, but they were at £15 premium yesterday morning. He must have made an enormous deal out of that.' But Mr Broune's eloquence on this occasion was chiefly displayed in regard to the presumption of Mr Alf. 'I shouldn't think him such a fool if he had announced his resignation of the editorship when he came before the world as a candidate for parliament. But a man must be mad who imagines that he can sit for Westminster and edit a London daily paper at the same time.' ...|$|E
60|$|The bachelors made {{an obvious}} show {{of not having}} heard what he said, and a general laugh went around. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> that Wilkes had spoken the truth in his taunt, and that the bachelors had indeed stolen their own tank.

60|$|The next morning, November 28th, {{the order}} was issued that the gates were to be closed and that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was {{to be allowed to}} pass out under any pretext whatever. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubted</b> that the long-expected sally was to be carried out.

60|$|The Scientist {{finds this}} reasonable, natural, and not harder to believe than {{that the disease}} germ, a {{creature}} of darkness, perishes when exposed to {{the light of the}} great sun--a new revelation of profane science which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts.</b> He reminds us that the actinic ray, shining upon lupus, cures it--a horrible disease which was incurable fifteen years ago, and had been incurable for ten million years before; that this wonder, unbelievable by the physicians at first, is believed by them now; and so he is tranquilly confident that the time is coming when the world will be educated up to a point where it will comprehend and grant that the light of the Spirit of God, shining unobstructed upon the soul, is an actinic ray which can purge both mind and body from disease and set them free and make them whole.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. How {{far down}} the scale of animal life the {{phenomena}} of consciousness are manifested, {{it is impossible to}} say. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> their presence in his fellow-men; and, unless any strict Cartesians are left, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that mammals and birds are to be reckoned creatures that have feelings analogous to our smell, taste, sight, hearing, touch, pleasure, and pain. For my own part, I should be disposed to extend this analogical judgment a good deal further. On the other hand, if the lowest forms of plants are to be denied consciousness, I do not see on what ground it is to be ascribed to the lowest animals. I {{find it hard to believe}} that an infusory animalcule, a foraminifer, or a fresh-water polype is capable of feeling; and, in spite of Shakspere, I have doubts about the great sensitiveness of the [...] "poor beetle that we tread upon." [...] The question is equally perplexing when we turn to the stages of development of the individual. Granted a fowl feels; that the chick just hatched feels; that the chick when it chirps within the egg may possibly feel; what is to be said of it on the fifth day, when the bird is there, but with all its tissues nascent? Still more, on the first day, when it is nothing but a flat cellular disk? I certainly cannot bring myself to believe that this disk feels. Yet if it does not, there must be some time in the three weeks, between the first day and the day of hatching, when, as a concomitant, or a consequence, of the attainment by the brain of the chick of a certain stage of structural evolution, consciousness makes its appearance. I have frequently expressed my incapacity to understand the nature of the relation between consciousness and a certain anatomical tissue, which is thus established by observation. But the fact remains that, so far as observation and experiment go, they teach us that the psychical phenomena are dependent on the physical.|$|E
6000|$|The {{narrative}} may {{be exactly}} true. That is to say, the words, taken {{in their natural}} sense, and interpreted {{according to the rules}} of grammar, may convey to the mind of the hearer, or of the reader, an idea precisely correspondent with one which would have remained in the mind of a witness. For example, the statement that King Charles the First was beheaded at Whitehall on the 30th day of January 1649, is as exactly true as any proposition in mathematics or physics; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>doubts</b> that any person of sound faculties, properly placed, who was present at Whitehall throughout that day, and who used his eyes, would have seen the King's head cut off; and that there would have remained in his mind an idea of that occurrence which he would have put into words of the same value as those which we use to express it. {502} ...|$|E
