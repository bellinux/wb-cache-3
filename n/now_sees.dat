International trains that normally begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she <b>now</b> <b>sees</b> truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E

25|$|These three views—Wilson's non-messianic {{retrospective}} of the Davidic covenant, Brueggemann's sapiential instruction, and Mitchell's eschatologico-messianic programme—all have their followers, although the sapiential agenda {{has been somewhat}} eclipsed by the other two. Shortly before his untimely death in 2005, Wilson modified his position {{to allow for the}} existence of messianic prophecy within the Psalms' redactional agenda.

25|$|The {{next season}} saw Boyd score a disappointing three goals, but {{he signed a}} new one-year deal on reduced terms {{at the end of}} the season. In the 2011–12 season, he scored four goals in the first seven league games of the season which saw Hartlepool unbeaten leading to the club's record start to the season. Despite this, he was dropped by then manager Mick Wadsworth. He would go on to score three more goals for the club, his last being a cool finish in a 2–1 away to Bury. Boyd was {{released}} on 10 May 2012, along with nine other Hartlepool players, after spending 10 seasons with his home town club in two spells, which <b>now</b> <b>sees</b> him in the club's top 15 all time goalscorers and in the top 25 all time appearances.|$|E

25|$|Cooper's {{contribution}} was {{in response to}} claims of mediaeval origin for the scroll. Andrew Sinclair, a leading proponent of Freemasonry's descent from the Knights Templar, hailed it as a great mediaeval treasure, comparable with the Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral. His claim arises from what opponents describe as an optimistic reading of radiocarbon dating, and creative interpretation of the panels. The Tabernacle is claimed to be King Solomon's Temple, with the tents removed in Sinclair's reproduction. Sinclair and his supporters also have trouble with lodge 128 of the Antients. It is variously claimed to be in Yorkshire, or Prince Edwin's Lodge in Bury (a Moderns Lodge constituted in 1803). In 1785, 128 was meeting in the Crown and Feathers, Holborn, London. Robert Lomas, a supporter of the early dating, <b>now</b> <b>sees</b> part of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in one of the altar inscriptions and much of the symbolism. This would place the document to {{the second half of the}} Eighteenth century in a conventional history of the Rite, but Lomas believes it to be mid-fifteenth, again based on radiocarbon dates, which make the side panels younger than the central strip. Realistically, agreement on the scroll, its context and symbolism is a long way off.|$|E

When they make it back to the pawn shop, Merida shows up to shoot arrows at Belle, saying that he can't resist the magic. When Merida breaks open the door she walks into a mirror but after she sees their {{reflection}} Belle yanks the rug from under her and they escaped with a bag containing a potion, then drive to the town line so they could use it, but Belle, worried that Emma will still go after them, demands that she be left out of the car. After she gets out, Belle tells Gold that he still a coward and walks away. Belle then runs into Merida, who then drinks a potion and she turns into a bear and starts chasing Belle, but before she can convince Merida to listen the bear is distracted by Gold, who told Belle to go so he can fight Merida. As the bear sniffs down Gold, he uses an antidote powder to restore Merida back to normal. Despite telling Belle that he didn't know how it worked, Gold told Belle it was her who saved him. The three return to the basement, where Gold agrees to pull Excalibur in exchange for Merida's heart and find out where her brothers are. Gold then pulls Excalibur then places it at Emma's feet, only to have Emma warn Gold that there are heroes around Storybrooke that haven't stopped her, but Gold tells her they're not him.|$|E

500|$|The {{line was}} {{recommended}} for closure by Dr. Richard Beeching in the 1963 Beeching Report, as {{in addition to}} its inconvenient location, it maintained fully manned staff at all stations despite low passenger numbers. Like several other lines threatened with closure, there was strong opposition, and the route survived because the nearby road network made it impractical to run a replacement bus service. The parallel main road from Hastings to Brenzett, the A259, had several level crossings over the line and a hairpin bend at Winchelsea, all of which remain as of the 21st century. At {{the same time as the}} Beeching Report was published, Arthur Irvine complained that a bus took an hour to travel the [...] between Rye and Ashford. The branch to New Romney closed on 6 March 1967, although since 1975 freight traffic has used the line as far as a nuclear flask loading and unloading point just outside Dungeness.

Very occasional passenger services are run for rail enthuasists; as of 2008 the former Lydd station was beginning to fall into disrepair.

500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he <b>now</b> <b>sees</b> Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E
