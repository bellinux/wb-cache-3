40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of DNA single strand breaks (ssb) on the neutral (pH 9. 6) filter elution of DNA from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO K 1) cells {{containing}} DNA double strand breaks (dsb) was investigated. Protein associated ssb were induced by the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I with camptothecin (cpt). Protein associated dsb were introduced by treating cells with the DNA topoisomerase II poison; etoposide (VP- 16). Protein associated ssb and dsb were converted to ssb and dsb by proteinase K present in the lysis solution. In some experiments dsb were generated by the restriction endonuclease Pvu II. It was found that elution of DNA in the presence and absence of ssb was similar under neutral conditions. This {{finding is consistent with}} the view that the fast component of the bi-phasic repair kinetics observed in irradiated mammalian cells with the <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> elution technique is not attributable to the interference of ssb with the measurement of dsb, and thus suggests that the two components of repair observed with the <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> elution elution technique may represent two different types of dsb or modes of repair of dsb...|$|E

30|$|Different {{methods have}} been {{reported}} for the processing of developing latent fingermarks using cyanoacrylate fuming. Simple homemade system consisting of a chamber, such as a glass aquarium, {{can be used to}} develop cyanoacrylate vapors by suitable heat source like hot plate, heater etc. and fumed the articles bearing latent impression at minimal cost. Articles to be processed are suspended in chamber and small amount of liquid cyanoacrylate is heated to around 80 to 100  °C to produce sufficient vapor. A container of water must also be placed in the tank to provide sufficient humidity for the development of prints. Low humidity causes the appearance of weakly developed prints with poor contrast. Development process should be regularly inspected to avoid over-development. Temperature control, proper vapor circulation and automatic removal of the cyanoacrylate vapor are some of the added advantages of commercial fuming chamber over home-made chamber. Some systems also have humidity control (Champod et al. 2004). Stokes and Brennan (1995) developed a reliable, robust and easy to use free standing cabinet for the automatic development of latent fingermarks using cyanoacrylate fuming. Some authors used cyanoacrylate treated <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> paper to develop latent fingermarks on cadavers, living skin, currency, kraft paper, leather, wood and silk fabric. The <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> paper was brushed or sprayed with cyanoacrylate ester or cyanoacrylate ether solution allowed to dry for several minutes. The treated paper was then put on the surface bearing latent fingermarks. This paper should be left on the surface for 5 to 60  min depending upon the nature of surface (Jian and Dao-an 1991). Almog and Gabay (1986) used glass desiccators and polythene bag as a fuming cabinet to develop latent fingermarks on different kinds of porous surfaces using cyanoacrylate fuming method.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The beam form has {{a direct}} effect on the quality and {{efficiency}} of flexible forming using a combined plasma arc.

30|$|To {{study how}} {{materials}} {{on the inner}} walls with different optical properties influenced the light environment in the mesocosm tanks, we used thin glossy white PVC sheets (named White in the following) and thick aluminum foil (named Alu in the following) to cover the inside wall, {{in addition to the}} uncovered original black polyethene wall (named Black in the following). The mesocosm tanks were filled with tap water, the absolute irradiance was measured at 0.3, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4.4  m in depth, the water-column irradiance was calculated by trapezoid depth integration, and the results shown are relative to those for Alu. The light spectra were measured with Ocean OpticsTM radiometers USB 2000 + and USB 4000 (Ocean Optics, Winter Park, Florida, USA), with the fiber-optical cable mounted on a frame that held the tip of the fibre upward in a vertical position.

For a given particle, both the LET and the particle energy determined the efficiency to induce DNA lesions. RBE values for the total amount of induced strand breaks were always smaller than 1. For DNA double strand breaks, RBE values only slightly larger than 1 were determined for particle radiation with an LET around 300 keV/#mu#m. Intracellular DSB/SSB ratios were found to be equivalent to data reported for in vitro systems using radioprotective conditions. Strand break rejoining as indicator of cellular repair processes was detected even after high-LET irradiation (LET #<=# 10000 keV/#mu#m). However, both the half times of rejoining and the fraction of residual DNA breaks increased with the atomic number of the particle.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> elution method for detecting DNA double strand breaks in mouse L 1210 cells after X-ray. The assay will detect {{the number of}} double strand breaks induced by as little as 1000 rad of X-ray. The rate of DNA elution through the filters under neutral conditions increases with X-ray dose. Certain conditions for deproteinization, pH, and filter type are shown to increase the assay's sensitivity. Hydrogen peroxide and Bleomycin also induce apparent DNA double strand breaks, although the ratios of double to single strand breaks vary from those produced by X-ray. The introduction of double strand cuts by HpA I restriction endonuclease in DNA lysed on filters results in a rapid rate of elution under neutral conditions, implying that the method can detect double strand breaks if they exist in the DNA.

40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that the {{differences}} in radiosensitivity between cell lines can be related to differences in dsb induction (Radford 1986 a). In the light of this we have set out to assess the extent to which differences in radiation survival between human tumour cell lines can be attributed to differences in dsb induction. For nine human tumour lines survival was assayed by clonogenic assay and compared with dsb induction by irradiation at ice-bath temperature as measured by <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> elution. The lines varied widely in their sensitivity, ranging from a sensitive neuroblastoma (surviving fraction at 2 Gy, SF 2 = 0 · 13) to a resistant bladder carcinoma (SF 2 = 0 · 62). Dsb induction was found to vary between the cell lines, such that resistant cells generally suffered less damage than sensitive ones. However, the relationship between damage induction and celluar sensitivity was not a simple one, and other factors which may influence sensitivity need to be invoked. These {{data suggest that}}, in human tumour cell lines, differences in radiosensitivity may at least in part be due to different levels of damage induction, but that some lines may vary in their tolerance of damage due to differences in biological characteristics such as repair capacity...|$|E

In contrast to the protective effect exhibited by WR 1065 in reducing 60 Co-induced DNA damage, WR 1065 was ineffective in reducing or protecting against induction of DNA strand breaks by JANUS neutrons. The kinetics of DNA double-strand rejoining were measured following neutron irradiation. In the absence of WR 1065, considerable DNA degradation by cellular enzymes was observed. This process was inhibited when WR 1065 was present.

40|$|There was a {{progressive}} formation of strand breaks in mature DNA of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells that {{were treated with}} methotrexate. Cells were labeled with [14 C]thymidine before incubation with methotrexate, and DNA strand breaks were measured by alkaline and by <b>neutral</b> <b>filter</b> elution methods. DNA single-strand breaks accumulated in a linear fashion {{as a function of}} time during the first 10 hr of incubation with 2 microM methotrexate. Thereafter, the accumulation of DNA strand breaks deviated from linearity because of progressive cell death. The extent of DNA strand breakage in cells that had been incubated with methotrexate for 24 hr was as high as in cells that had been irradiated with 300 rads. DNA strand breaks persisted in cells that were incubated, after exposure to methotrexate, in medium containing thymidine, hypoxanthine, and nonessential amino acids, indicating that these strand breaks were poorly repaired. Cell death commenced after 10 hr of incubation with methotrexate and continued during the following 3 - 4 days. These findings suggest that cell death was due to a lethal accumulation of DNA strand breaks. The formation of DNA strand breaks is probably due to inefficient DNA repair, resulting from the inhibition of syntheses of thymidylate and of purine nucleotides. The accumulation of DNA strand breaks was minimal in growth-arrested cells, which are resistant to methotrexate toxicity...|$|E
