25|$|Around 1000AD, cast bronze horseshoes with <b>nail</b> <b>holes</b> became {{common in}} Europe. Common was a design with a {{scalloped}} outer rim and six <b>nail</b> <b>holes.</b> The 13th and 14th centuries brought the widespread manufacturing of iron horseshoes. By {{the time of}} the Crusades (1096–1270), horseshoes were widespread and frequently mentioned in various written sources. In that period, due to the value of iron, horseshoes were even accepted in lieu of coin to pay taxes.|$|R

The horse can be given an antiseptic foot bandage for 3-4 days and then be shod if the lameness is gone. The prognosis is usually good provided that minimal damage occurs to vatial structures of the foot. Tetanus prophylaxis is used for unvaccinated horses.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary means}} of failure in a slate roof is when {{individual}} slates lose their peg attachment and begin to slide out of place. This can open up small gaps above each slate. A secondary mode of failure is when the slates themselves begin to break up. The lower parts of a slate may break loose, giving a gap below a slate. Commonly the small and stressed area above the <b>nail</b> <b>hole</b> may fail, allowing the slate to slip as before. In the worst cases, a slate may simply break in half and be lost altogether. A common repair to slate roofs is to apply 'torching', a mortar fillet underneath the slates, attaching them to the battens.13 This may applied as either a repair, to hold slipping slates, or pre-emptively on construction.|$|E

The seeds on the crust of the bread, {{as well as}} the crust itself, along with the plaited handles of the bread basket, are rendered with pointillé dots. Soft parts of the bread are rendered with thin swirls of paint, with dabs of ochre used to show the rough edges of broken crust. One piece of bread to the viewer's right and close to the Dutch oven, has a broad band of yellow, different from the crust, which Cant believes is a suggestion that the piece is going stale. The small roll at the far right has thick impastoed dots that resemble a knobbly crust or a crust with seeds on it. The bread and basket, despite being closer to the viewer, are painted in a more diffuse way than the illusionistic realism of the wall, with its stains, shadowing, nail and <b>nail</b> <b>hole,</b> or the seams and fastenings of the woman's dress, the gleaming, polished brass container hanging from the wall. The panes of glass in the window are varied in a very realistic way, with a crack in one (fourth row from the bottom, far right) reflected on the wood of the window frame. Just below that pane, another has a scratch, indicated with a thin white line. Another pane (second row from the bottom, second from right) is pushed inward within its frame.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel image-guided robotbased system to assist orthopedic surgeons in performing distal locking of long bone intramedullary nails. The system {{consists of a}} bone-mounted miniature robot fitted with a drill guide that provides rigid mechanical guidance for hand-held drilling of the distal screws ’ pilot holes. The robot is automatically positioned so that the drill guide and nail distal locking axes coincide, using a single fluoroscopic X-ray image. Since the robot is rigidly attached to the intramedullary nail or bone, no leg immobilization or real-time tracking is required. We describe the system and protocol and present a method for accurate and robust drill guide and <b>nail</b> <b>hole</b> localization and registration. The in vitro system accuracy experiments for fronto-parallel viewing show a mean angular error of 1. 3 @�� � a H R A between the computed drill guide axes and the actual locking holes axes, and a mean 3. 0 mm error @�� � a I I mmA in the entry and exit drill point, which is adequate for successfully locking the nail.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the biomechanical {{properties}} of an Interlocking Nail (ILN) and a Plate-Rod-Combination (PRC) in a canine comminuted fracture model. The hypotheses were that construct torsional and compressive compliances will be greater with ILN than with PRC and that construct bending compliance will be similar for both fixation devices. Twelve canine tibial pairs of similar size were used. Three groups were formed (n= 4 /group). The group size was determined in a pilot study. In each pair, one tibia was instrumented with a 160 mm x 6 mm ILN, using four 2. 7 mm screws. The contralateral tibia was stabilized with a 4 mm Steinmann pin, combined with an 11 -hole, 3. 5 mm limited contact - dynamic compression plate. To mimic a comminuted fracture, a 10 mm mid-diaphyseal defect was created. Four paired specimens were cyclically loaded in torsion (± 5 Nm), compression (167. 58 N), or bending (3. 5 Nm). Construct compliances were determined at the 10 th cycle, then compared within and between constructs using two-factor ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (torsion, compression). Bending tests were compared using a paired student&# 65533;s t-test. Finally, the samples were tested to failure. The load to failure was compared using a paired student&# 65533;s t-test. The significance level was set at p< 0. 05 for all tests. The mode of failure was reported qualitatively. Compliance curves for the ILN constructs were consistently bilinear in both torsion and compression. In torsion, the initial compliance between the constructs was significantly greater than the secondary compliance (p< 0. 001). Importantly, the maximum mean torsional angle with ILN was close to 35 °. Initial compliances were also greater in the ILN in comparison to the PRC constructs in compression (p< 0. 005). Conversely, in either torsion or compression, there were no significant differences in secondary compliances between ILN and PRC constructs. Finally, bending compliance curves did not show the bilinear appearance found in torsion or compression. Moreover, ILN and PRC construct compliances were not significantly different in bending. During failure testing, the ILN was more prone to deformation than the PRC. The results of this study demonstrate that in a comminuted fracture model the combination of a bone plate and an IM pin provides a significantly more rigid fixation method than an ILN in torsion. This finding may result from a mismatch between the screw and <b>nail</b> <b>hole</b> diameter as well as deformation of the screw threads and the <b>nail</b> <b>hole</b> under torsional loads. Clinically, by improving tibial fracture repair stability, plate-rod-combinations may reduce post-operative morbidity and promote faster return to limb function, compared to an interlocking nail...|$|E
30|$|This {{patient is}} elderly and {{presented}} with accompanying comorbidities: diabetes and osteoporosis. Despite the accompanying medical conditions, {{the patient had}} been fully mobile prior to the injury and was sufficiently well for surgery to be considered. Consideration was given to screw and plate fixation but excluded as standard anatomical locking plates for distal femur are applied onto the lateral condyle. Whilst there are plates designed for medial application, these are {{in the context of}} fixation of distal femur osteotomy and not for fracture fixation. A decision was taken to use an intramedullary nail with secure fixation of the medial condyle provided by pairs of condyle screw and nuts which are implant accessories designed for use in osteoporotic bone. We considered that suitable compression between the fragments could be applied and congruity maintained using this system. On the other hand, we identified that this patient also had an accompanying bony defect between the fragments, and we judged that achieving suitable levels of angular and rotational stability only using the “condyle screw and condyle nut” system would be insufficient. Therefore, we planned the surgery as follows: apply suitable compression to the fracture using the “condyle screw and condyle nut” system, achieve the angular and rotational stability by adding an intramedullary nail, and improve stability through bone grafting at the defect site. We chose the T 2 supracondylar nail for this procedure, as it has a multiple, multi-directional distal locking system. The nail was inserted passing the isthmus to obtain the stability of the nail/screw construct. We controlled the depth of nail insertion and inserted a maximum of four screws including two units of the “condyle screw and condyle nut” to apply and maintain suitable compression between the fragments. The most distal screw was locked to the <b>nail</b> <b>hole</b> by the end cap, and this contributed the improvement in angular and rotational stability.|$|E

50|$|The next stage, the {{conservation}} of the timbers, which began later in 2008, involved immersing the timbers in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for an extended period.

Pore fillers used for large flat surfaces such as floors or table tops generally contain silica instead of or in addition to wood dust. Pores can also be filled using multiple coats of the final finish rather than a pore filler.|$|R
