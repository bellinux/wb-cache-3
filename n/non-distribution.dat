50|$|According to Hansmann, the “non-distribution {{constraint}} - {{prohibits the}} distribution of residual earnings to individuals who exercise control over the firm”. It prohibits {{those who have a}} vested interest in the organization from receiving the organization’s profit for personal gain. This constraint is a common characteristic of nonprofits, which creates less of an incentive for the organization to take advantage of the consumer’s lack of knowledge. The nonprofit has no reason to cheat the consumer out of quality or service delivery because the organization's individuals cannot benefit directly. Therefore, the consumer is more likely to trust a nonprofit organization providing services than to trust a for-profit organization because of the nonprofit’s <b>non-distribution</b> constraint. According to Easley and O'Hara, state law stipulates that the organizations day-to-day costs should be reasonable.|$|E
5000|$|A nonprofit {{organization}} (also {{known as a}} non-business entity) is an organization that has been formed {{by a group of}} people in order [...] "to pursue a common not-for-profit goal", that is, to pursue a stated goal without the intention of distributing excess revenue to members or leaders. A {{nonprofit organization}} is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption or charitable status.|$|E

The District Court concluded that Dish’s users retransmits Fox’s programing within the contractual authorization provided by Fox. Nothing in the parties’ agreement expressly limits retransmission to {{the context of}} a DBS-based multicast. Dish does not distribute Fox’s programing; it is the user who transmits the programing to herself or other members of her household, which does not fulfill the meaning of distribution in the statue. However, the district court held that Dish Anywhere and Hopper Transfers breach the No Copying provision of the parties’ agreement because Dish’s subscribers can place-shift outside their homes. Fox did not give Dish its consent to offer this service to subscribers for use outside home. Fair Use is an affirmative defense to copyright infringement, but parties are free to bargain away their rights to make fair use of copyrighted material under contractual agreements. The district court denied the summary judgment in this point because considered that there was a triable issue of fact as to the damages flowing from the breach.Fox also contended that PTAT infringes the <b>Non-Distribution</b> Provision. The district court held that Dish did not distribute anything, because PTAT automatically recorded already permissible content to a subscriber and does not disseminate those recordings beyond user’s home. Fox contended that the QA copies breached the No-Copying Provision. The district court agreed with Fox considering that there is a breach of contract remedy to solve the dispute. The reasonable amount of royalties that Dish should pay for the period that used QA copies is a triable issue of fact.|$|E

NGOs - defined by the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint - compete for donations from donors by exerting fundraising effort.

However, if the market size is endogenous and NGOs both compete and co-operate in attracting new donors, the free-entry equilibrium number of NGOs is generally smaller than the optimal number.

In Iran, the Government’s absolute monopoly in the economy {{is one of the}} most important factors that prevent the provision of necessary requirements for the implementation of social entrepreneurship. Legally, most of the rules on social efforts are obsolete or not up-to-date. Politically, social issues are majorly viewed from the political and security points of view.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{case study}} of the U. S. confectionery industry. In the first essay, I use an institutional approach to determine the changing structure of the American confectionery industry. I provide the historical context of how the industry has evolved to the current state dominated by two big firms, and how Hershey and Mars achieve current dominant positions. I argue that Hershey adopted the industrial-foundation organizational form based on the donor-agency theory which assures donors that their donations are not redistributed as profits to residual claimants. I further argue that the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint in the Hershey Trust Company prevents dividends (donations) from being redistributed to residual claimants, and that the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint makes more sense for Hershey because its founder, Milton Hershey, expressed his preference to leave a long lasting legacy. I likewise review the empirical evidence on the performance of family-owned firms vis-à-vis that of non-family owned firms. I argue that Mars has chosen a family-controlled organizational form based on the competitive advantage theory which postulates that firm value is maximized when families retain control, benefitting both family and nonfamily shareholders. The Mars family’s greater commitment to the company, its long-term investment horizon, and the amenity potential associated with a traditional family name are consistent with the theory and made Mars more successful than most other family firms. The second essay analyzes the effect of TV advertising and in-store displays on the sales of chocolates. I examine which method is more effective in gaining customers and in increasing total sales. Also, I look at the evidence to see whether the lack of advertising by a firm will hurt the industry as a whole.

40|$|Background: Teaching {{hospitals}} {{have to balance}} patient and learner needs in their daily routines. To respond to these challenges, non-profit hospitals may perform differently than public and for-profit hospitals because of their <b>non-distribution</b> constraint. Purposes: This study analyzes patient satisfaction data of non-profit teaching hospitals in comparison to teaching hospitals with for-profit and public ownership status. Patient satisfaction {{is assumed to be}} an indicator of how patient needs are met regardless of the teaching goals. Approach: The average patient satisfaction ratings for German hospitals (n[*]=[*] 1461) that were published on the ‘klinikbewertungen. de’ German hospital rating platform were collected for a cross-section analysis. Findings: The data show that non-profit teaching hospitals are better rated than for-profit and public teaching hospitals. Non-profit hospitals seem to be more competent in handling the balance between societies’ needs for clinical training and patient needs for a favorable service experience.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{association}} of differences in economic incentives between for-profit (FP) and nonprofit (NP) hospice care providers with management performance using financial and nonfinancial metrics. This research is based on the expectations of Agency theory and applies proxies of the quality of patient care while controlling for differences in cost-efficiency. Our findings indicate that FP hospice providers (1) selectively admit patients with longer life-prognoses and billable days and hence lower average costs per day (2) employ a lower average cost/skill mix of workers and (3) have higher CEO compensation and profit. The NP providers admit more patients with the less profitable life-prognoses attributes have lower CEO compensation and reinvest their net earnings under the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint. While the profit incentive may be needed to attract providers into this rapidly growing and underserved market the NP providers return a lower cost per patient served from the taxpayer's perspective...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that non-profit organizations (NPOs) are {{prevalent in the}} health care industry because of consumers 2 ̆ 7 quality uncertainty dates back at least to Arrow (1963). The model developed here attempts to formalize this notion. It is shown that if government is vigorous enough in enforcing the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint (the legal prohibition against distributing profits earned by an NPO), non-profits can decrease the underprovision of quality both directly by providing services and indirectly by improving the equilibrium quality level in the for-profit sector. ^ This model is tested against a full information alternative using nursing home data. Previous empirical work has focused {{on the question of whether}} or not quality is higher in the non-profit sector. The models in this paper demonstrate that this is a poorly posed question which can yield misleading policy implications. The results primarily favor the asymmetric information model and indicate that the coexistence of for- and non-profit firms may increase consumer welfare. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether nonprofit executive pay patterns {{are consistent with}} the espoused social mission of these organizations. We find that nonprofit CEOs are paid a significant fixed component, and many CEOs also receive additional pay associated with managing larger sized organizations. Our analysis indicates that nonprofit executive compensation is not significantly related to CEO performance, as measured either by improved fund-raising results or better administrative efficiency. This weak pay-for-performance link may be due in part to nonprofits concern about violating the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint in the sector, which prohibits the distribution of excess earnings. While nonprofits may not be breaching the letter of the law, some organizations appear to challenging its spirit: We present evidence that CEO compensation is significantly higher in organizations where free cash flows is present, as measured by commercial revenues, liquid assets and investment portfolios.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an LFG-based analysis of coordination {{in terms of}} (non-headed) sets off-structures {{and the distribution of}} grammatical functional information across sets. This approach provides a descriptively adequate account of key properties of coordination, including the distribution of grammatical functions across all conjuncts, the ability to coordinate unlike categories under certain syntactic conditions, and the <b>non-distribution</b> of lexical properties such as tense and number. Coordination is subject to the condition that items can be conjoined if and only if they satisfy the condition of functional equivalence. This condition {{does not have to be}} stipulated; it follows as an axiom from the general principles of functional application to sets. Since coordination is not a headed construction, there is no percolation path for features from individual categories within a coordinate structure to the node dominating the coordination. Therefore lexical properties will not be shared across the coordination as a whole. The lack of distributivity allows individual conjuncts to differ in terms of lexical properties. In particular, it is expected, rather than exceptional, that coordinated NPs may differ in number, person, case and gender. The proposed account also predicts a high level of idiosyncrasy and variability with respect to 'agreement' between the subject NP and the verb and/or predicate complement...|$|E
40|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} play {{a critical}} role in U. S. housing policy, a role typically justified by the claim that their housing investments produce significant neighbor-hood spillover benefits. However, little work has actually been done to measure these impacts on neighborhoods. This paper compares the neighborhood spillover effects of city-supported rehabilitation of rental housing undertaken by nonprofit and for-profit developers, using data from New York City. To measure these benefits, we use increases in neighboring property values, estimated from a difference-in-difference specification of a hedonic regression model. We study the impacts of about 43, 000 units of city-supported housing completed during the 1980 s and 1990 s, and our sample of property transactions includes nearly 300, 000 individual sales. We find that both nonprofit and for-profit projects generate significant, positive spillover effects. This finding in itself is significant, given the widespread skepticism about the impact of subsidized housing on neighborhoods. We also find some differences across sectors. First, the impact of nonprofit housing remains stable over time, whereas the effect of for-profit housing declines slightly with time. Second, while large for-profit and nonprofit developments deliver similar benefits, in the case of small projects, for-profit developments generate greater impacts than their nonprofit counterparts. These differences are consistent with theoretical predictions. In particular, in the presence of information asymmetries with respect to housing quality, the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint should lead nonprofits to invest more than for-profits in developing and maintaining features that benefit the broader community. Meanwhile, the fact that scale makes a difference to nonprofit impacts may reflect the capacity constraints often faced by smaller nonprofits. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|E
40|$|Concerns with {{improper}} {{collection and}} usage of personal information by businesses or governments {{have been seen}} as {{critical to the success of}} the emerging electronic commerce. In this regard, computer professionals have the oversight responsibility for information privacy because they have the most extensive knowledge of their organization’s systems and programs, as well as an intimate understanding of the data. Thus, the competence of these professionals in ensuring sound practice of information privacy is of great importance to both researchers and practitioners. This research addresses the question of whether male computer professionals differ from their female counterparts in their self-regulatory efficacy to protect personal information privacy. A total of 103 male and 65 female subjects surveyed in Taiwan responded to a 10 -item questionnaire that includes three measures: protection (protecting privacy information), <b>non-distribution</b> (not distributing privacy information to others), and non-acquisition (not acquiring privacy information). The findings show (1) significant gender differences exist in the subjects’ overall self-regulatory efficacy for information privacy, and, in particular, (2) that female subjects in this study exhibited a higher level of self-regulatory efficacy than males for the protection and non-acquisition of personal privacy information. The identification of the factorial structure of the self-regulatory efficacy concerning information privacy may contribute to future research directed to examining the links between privacy efficacy and psychological variables, such as ethical attitude, ethical intention, and self-esteem. Studies can also be extended to investigate how different cultural practices of morality and computer use in men and women may shape the different development patterns of privacy self-efficacy. Understanding the different cultural practices may then shed light on the social sources of privacy competence and the appropriate remedies that can be provided to improve the situation.

40|$|The aim of {{non-profit}} organizations (NPO) is {{to provide}} services and goods for its clientele, with profit being a minor objective. By having this definition as the basic purpose of doing business, {{it is obvious that}} the goal of an organisation is to serve several bottom lines and not only the financial one. This approach is underpinned by the <b>non-distribution</b> constraint which means that NPO are allowed to make profits to a certain extent, but not to distribute them. The advantage is that there are no single shareholders who might have an interest in the prosperity of the organisation: there is no pie to divide. The gained profits remain within the organisation and will be reinvested in purposeful projects. Good governance is mandatory to support the aim of NPOs. Looking for a measure of good governance the principals of corporate governance (CG) will come in mind. The purpose of CG is direction and control, and in the field of NPO, CG is enlarged to consider the relationship to all important stakeholders who have an impact on the organisation. The recognition of more relevant parties than the shareholder is the link to corporate social responsibility (CSR). It supports a broader view of the bottom line: It is no longer enough to know how profits are used but rather how they are made. Besides, CSR addresses the responsibility of organisations for their impact on society. When transferring the concept of CSR to the non-profit area it will become obvious that CSR with its distinctive features will match the aims of NPOs. As a consequence, NPOs who apply CG apply also CSR to a certain extent. The research is designed as a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis. First, the investigation focuses on the theoretical basis of both concepts. Second, the similarities and differences are outlined and as a result the interconnection of both concepts will show up. The contribution of this research is manifold: The interconnection of both concepts when applied to NPOs has not got any attention in science yet. CSR and governance as integrated concept provides a lot of advantages for NPOs compared to for-profit organisations which are in a steady justification to show the impact they might have on the society. NPOs, however, integrate economic and social aspects as starting point. For NPOs CG is not a mere concept of compliance but rather an enhanced concept integrating a lot of aspects of CSR. There is no “either-nor” between the concepts for NPOs...|$|E
40|$|Microheaters {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} for their sensor-based applications, such as gas sensor, flow rate sensor and other microsystems. Here, we investigate the pyroelectric effect, activate by microheaters fabricated on - Z surface of LiNbO 3 crystal. Pyroelectric effect is the capability of certain crystal to produce temporary voltage during heating or cooling transient. Fabrication of microheaters on LiNbO 3 crystals gives an advantage of confined temperature gradient, together with low power consumption for application-based sensors. In this paper, we study the electron emission from the - Z surface of a pyroelectric material (LiNbO 3), relevant to the microheaters fabricated on the +Z surface of crystal. Different geometries of microheaters, such as Fan, Meander, Double Spiral and S-Shape were fabricated on + Z surface of a single domain LiNbO 3 crystal [1]. Thermal behavior of these microheaters was analyzed using COMSOL™ Multiphysics and compared with the experimental data obtained by FLIR SC 7000 Series thermo camera. Static and time-dependent thermal analyses were performed using a voltage generator by applying DC and step voltage signals to the microheater. It was observed that the electric field resulting from the temperature induced by the microheater changes the spontaneous polarization of the LiNbO 3 crystal affecting the electron emission. This pyroelectric electron emission (PEE) from - Z surface of the LiNbO 3 crystal was investigated using two-probe point measurement. It was observed that the PEE from LiNbO 3 {{is due to the}} perturbation, by the temperature variation, of equilibrium between spontaneous polarizations Ps in the crystal and external screening charges (qsc) on its surfaces. At equilibrium, all Ps are fully screened by qsc and no external electric field exists. Any excess or lack of screening charges (qsc) relatively to Ps, leads to the appearance of an electrostatic state from the uncompensated charges (ρ) given by ρ = Δ (Ps-qsc) [2]. Furthermore, we verified the pyroelectric emission effect in a transient condition for all the microheaters. A voltage signal at 10 mHz was applied to the microheater using signal generator. A tip (diameter∼ 0. 254 mm) was positioned at distance ≤ 1 mm from the - Z surface of LiNbO 3 crystal. The current peaks were acquired using oscilloscope that occurs due to the <b>non-distribution</b> of Ps on the - Z surface of LiNbO 3. It was observed that microheaters with complex structure have significantly higher number of current peaks compared to a simplest structure, because complex microheater leads to a nonuniform temperature gradient on the - Z surface of the LiNbO 3 crystal [3]. It was also noted that the temporal distances between adjacent electrical peaks exponentially increases during the application of the thermal transient, showing a dependency of the rate of heating and cooling on the PEE in a transient condition of the crystal. Finally, we demonstrate two pyroelectric effect based applications: Pyro-jetting of liquid droplet (oil, OIR 906, water and PDMS) [4, 5] and pyro-emission lithography using microheater [6]...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the pari passu {{principle}} of insolvency law (which provides that the creditors {{of a company}} in liquidation are to be paid rateably), and to ask how it relates to other principles available {{for the treatment of}} claims in corporate liquidation. The discussion reveals that the principle has rather limited effect in governing distributions of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate. Not only do various types of secured claim fall beyond its ambit, even unsecured claims are often exempt from its application. Nevertheless, the principle thrives both in judicial rhetoric and in academic arguments. For example, many a challenge to the different priorities accorded to different types of claim in a company 2 ̆ 7 s insolvency begins with an incantation of the pari passu principle. Commentators see an inherent tension between the 2 ̆ 7 two fundamental principles of credit and insolvency law 2 ̆ 7, that of the freedom of contract which allows one to bargain for priority, and the mandatory pari passu principle. The pari passu principle is said to be 2 ̆ 7 the foremost principle in the law of insolvency around the world 2 ̆ 7. It is thought to be 2 ̆ 7 all-pervasive 2 ̆ 7, and its effect is to 2 ̆ 7 strike down all agreements which have as their object or result the unfair preference of a particular creditor by removal from the estate on winding up of an asset that would otherwise have been available for the general body of creditors. 2 ̆ 7 The principle is said to be supported both by the need for an orderly liquidation of insolvents 2 ̆ 7 estates, and by requirements of fairness. So {{it is not surprising that}} its invocation as the starting point for, say, the debate on the priority of secured or preferential claims, weights the argument in a particular way. Since the pari passu principle has been recognised so widely and for so long as vital, and since it serves such desirable aims as orderliness in liquidation and fairness to all creditors, any deviation from it must be a cause for concern. On this view, the priority (say) of secured or preferential claims is an abnormality, a pathology to be diagnosed and controlled, perhaps even 2 ̆ 7 cured 2 ̆ 7. Since 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 is the norm, the onus must be on those supporting differing priorities to justify their claim. To the extent that their efforts are unpersuasive, the case for priority must be considered not established, and the 2 ̆ 7 default principle 2 ̆ 7 of 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 must prevail. This paper seeks to overturn this order of things. It is suggested the pari passu principle does not constitute an accurate description of how the assets of insolvent companies are in fact distributed, has no role to play in ensuring an orderly winding up of such companies, does not explain or justify distinctive features of the formal insolvency regime, and has little to do with fairness in liquidation. The actual role of the principle, it is argued, is merely to provide a low-cost method for dealing with those types of claim which both Parliament and commercial parties themselves have decided should receive little or nothing in most insolvencies. The principle, long regarded as the core distributional principle in corporate liquidation, is more properly understood as a principle of <b>non-distribution.</b> To the extent that these arguments succeed, the initial onus of justifying their position shifts from those arguing in favour of the priority of secured credit, to those who support a more 2 ̆ 7 equal 2 ̆ 7 distribution of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate...|$|E
