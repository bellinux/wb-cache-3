As a result, investing there would become less risky and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E

25|$|Yield curves {{are usually}} upward sloping asymptotically: {{the longer the}} maturity, the higher the yield, with {{diminishing}} marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). There are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, {{it may be that}} the market is anticipating a rise in the risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors who are willing to lock their money in <b>now</b> <b>need</b> to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, {{readers of}} 18th-century {{literature}} <b>now</b> <b>need</b> {{to understand the}} history of the period more than most readers of other literature do. The authors were writing for an informed audience and only secondarily for posterity. Even the authors, who criticised writing that lived for only a day (like Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, in The Dedication to Prince Posterity of A Tale of a Tub and Dunciad, among other pieces) were criticising specific authors, who are unknown to those without historical knowledge of the period. Poetry of all forms was in constant dialogue, and each author was responding and commenting upon the others. Novels were written against other novels (like the battles between Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, who, along with Eliza Haywood, wrote a novel satirising Richardson's Pamela, and between Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett). Plays were written to make fun of plays or to counter the success of plays (like the reaction against and for Cato and, later, Fielding's The Author's Farce). Therefore, history and literature are linked in a way rarely seen at other times. On one hand, the metropolitan and political writing can seem like coterie or salon work, but on the other hand, it was the literature of people deeply committed to sorting out a new type of government, new technologies and newly-vexatious challenges to philosophical and religious certainty.|$|E

When Bart tries to suggest alternate viewing, Ms. Botz quickly puts him in his place because she has dealt with troublesome children like him before. After Ms. Botz leaves the room Bart tunes into a station airing America's Most Armed and Dangerous (a parody of America's Most Wanted), which profiles a wanted burglar nicknamed [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] A mug shot of the suspect shows Bart and Lisa that Ms. Botz is [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] Ms. Botz enters {{the living room and}} realizes that her cover has been blown.

Globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.
