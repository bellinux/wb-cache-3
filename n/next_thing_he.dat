500|$|The Skelton family {{received}} {{support from}} CBS management {{and from the}} public following the announcement of Richard's illness. Skelton himself was beset by a serious illness and by a household accident which kept him off the air. He suffered a life-threatening asthma attack on December 30, 1957, and was taken to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where his doctors said that [...] "if there were ten steps to death, Red Skelton had taken nine of them {{by the time he}} had arrived". Initially hospitalized for an indeterminate length of time, Skelton later said he was working on some notes for television and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> remembered, he was in a hospital bed; he did not know how serious his illness was until he read about it himself in the newspapers. His illness and recovery kept him off the air for a full month; Skelton returned to his television show on January 28, 1958.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E
2500|$|A man {{finds an}} old bottle, {{picks it up}} and opens it. The Genie comes out of the bottle and says: [...] "Thanks so much for letting me out! I feel I should do {{something}} for you, too. Would you like to become a Hero of the Soviet Union?" [...] (Hero of the Soviet Union was the highest Soviet award). The guy says: [...] "Yes, sure!" [...] <b>Next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> knows, he finds himself on a battlefield [...] with five grenades, alone against five German panzers.|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>he</b> {{did was to}} have a large, {{deep well}} dug, so that we might have sweet water from it for {{drinking}} purposes, rather than be forced to use that from the river, for it was to his mind that through this muddy water did the sickness come to us.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, he vaulted {{with a light}} leap on {{his hands}} up {{the edge of the}} precipice. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> we knew, <b>he</b> was standing, safe and sound, with the rope round his waist, a living soul, on the further brink beyond the chasm.|$|R
60|$|He did the <b>next</b> best <b>thing,</b> however: <b>he</b> took a {{place in}} a sailing dahabeeah; and as we steamed up slowly, {{stopping}} often on the way, to give me time to write my articles, he managed to arrive almost always at every town or ruin exactly when we did.|$|R
2500|$|The malevolent {{persecution}} panel: In {{this panel}} many crows are attacking a pinned-down lizard, representing {{the other extreme}} of Kurelek's view of the doctors. He writes, [...] "The doctors who dress in hospital whites are represented in their true color - black, just like birds of prey." [...] He represented them as not actually caring if the subject is cured or not, though later he claimed this was a false idea, and attributed it to his father's phobia of hospitals. The father had developed the phobia from an incident with William during his college years. A doctor had recommended for him a tonsil operation. His parents refused {{to pay for it}} so William used money he had earned as a lumberjack. But something went wrong and Kurelek hemorrhaged, coughing blood everywhere, and lost consciousness. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> knew he saw his parents standing before him [...] "seething with anger" [...] at what had happened. According to his autobiography, this was the first evidence for Kurelek that his parents actually cared.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> {{knew was}} 'Here, Master Lorimer, {{you know this}} gear better than I; {{unfasten}} this buff coat. There, he can breathe. Drink this, my lad.' ...|$|E
60|$|But moments only, for the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> said {{put her in}} a {{particularly}} odious light. He informed me that she had sworn to hunt Mr. Anon down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> did the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> to it. <b>He</b> {{hauled out}} that prospectus, and started reading it in form. I watched him do it. He kept {{it under the}} desk and made a foul row, {{laughing}} over it. Appleby couldn't help spotting him. Of course, he told him to bring {{him what he was}} reading. Up went Merrett with the prospectus." ...|$|R
60|$|He did. So we started. Mine not {{to reason}} why, mine {{but to do}} and die, as the poem says. If an {{elephant}} had come into Geisenheimer's {{and asked me to}} dance I'd have had to do it. And I'm not saying that Mr Ferris wasn't the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> to it. <b>He</b> was one of those earnest, persevering dancers--the kind that have taken twelve correspondence lessons.|$|R
50|$|Nizam {{was first}} {{called up to}} the Singapore senior squad in 2009 but did not feature against Thailand.He made his first {{international}} debut in a friendly match against Poland on 23 January 2010, replacing Fazrul Nawaz in the 46th minute. Although earmarked as Singapore's <b>next</b> big <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> has yet to find {{the back of the}} net for the Lions after 16 appearances. In his next two games for the Lions, against Afghanistan and Bahrain, Nizam found himself with opportunities to score in both games but somehow managed to miss them, leaving him still waiting to open his account after 18 caps.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is too much!" [...] said Mrs. Archibald. [...] "The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> will be tapping at her window. I {{will go out}} {{and speak}} my mind to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a fine}} night, the sky {{thick with}} stars, and Mr. Farebrother {{proposed}} that they should make a circuit to the old church by the London road. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> said was-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> do do is {{to think}} about {{altering}} the church, until he found 'twould be a matter o' cost and what not, and then not to think no more about it." ...|$|E
40|$|Difficulties of Smith's {{new work}} ["Flora Graeca"]. If {{beginning}} his botanical pursuits again {{he would make}} a work comprising the new or rare plants he has introduced; the <b>next</b> best <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> could do was to keep his collection as open to possible to draughtsmen such as [Ferdinand Lucas] Bauer [(1760 - 1826), botanical artist] and [James] Sowerby, and [Henry Charles] Andrews [(fl 1790 s- 1830 s), botanical artist] and [Sydenham Teast] Edwards [(1768 - 1819), botanical artist], though the former two have not had cause to use it. Initially averse to his name being given to any genus. He has not been so abundant in new plants since cutting of his communications with the Cape...|$|R
50|$|William was {{a devout}} Christian. He {{believed}} {{that if he was}} a good Christian, he would go to heaven. He thought that this was important because he had never been treated well on earth, and it would be one place he could be happy and rest. Finally after much practice and determination, William learned how to read. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>he</b> wanted to do was learn how to write. Late at night, when his master was asleep, he would practice his writing by candlelight. He soon took to teaching a short lesson on Sundays to some of the other slaves on the plantation. But soon the white people found out and banned them from meeting again to talk about learning.Anderson was a slave.|$|R
500|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, née Lea (1860–1940). The couple's {{youngest}} son, Clifford Lea Bax, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the <b>next</b> best <b>thing.</b> <b>He</b> was a musical child: [...] "I cannot remember the long-lost day when I was unable to play the piano – inaccurately".|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is a man}} {{who wants}} to pay more taxes than he is charged." [...] Richard Watson Gilder did very well for a poet. He advertised his magazine. He spoke of hiring Mr. Carnegie--the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> will be trying to hire me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid you}} couldn't {{do much of}} {{anything}} with him," [...] he heard Mr. Lord say. [...] "He's had enough {{of this kind of}} life already, so he says, an' I expect the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> does will be to try and run away." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did was {{to change}} his own name, for he thought this would make matters better for him if he should be {{captured}} after entering upon his new criminal career. So he called himself Captain Thomas, by which name he was afterwards known.|$|E
5000|$|After a while, Yennefer summons Geralt upstairs; Dandelion is happily, safely asleep, {{and there}} is only the {{question}} of price to be discussed. Geralt first wants to take Dandelion to safety, and offers a price to guarantee his return. Yennefer wants her price right away though, and reveals that she has in fact trapped Geralt in the room. The witcher is completely paralyzed. After a rather fruitless argument, Geralt passes out and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> Geralt knows, <b>he</b> is sharing the cell with [...] "honest thieves", an innocent old man and Chireadan.|$|R
5000|$|Ben's Cat's last win came on May 20, 2016, in the Jim McKay Turf Sprint, a race {{in which}} he was well behind and in heavy traffic with a quarter-mile remaining. [...] "At no time in the race did he look {{like he was going to}} win," [...] said Leatherbury. [...] "He hits the top of the stretch and I'm just hoping for third money. And the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know, <b>he</b> splits horses and sticks his nose out right at the wire. I get chills when I hear the replay of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fix {{the frame}} {{together}} now, Coppet," [...] said Lumley to our carpenter, who {{came forward with}} a load of small timbers, [...] "and let it face as it now lies. The ground is fortunately so flat that we won't require much levelling of foundations. Now, the <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> Max," [...] <b>he</b> added, turning to me and consulting the plan, [...] "is this--have we made the best possible arrangement of our space? You see I am not much of an architect, but luckily we have not {{to contend with the}} civilised difficulties of lobbies and staircases." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> {{did was to}} buy a cork-screw in a shop, and go apart into {{a secret}} place in the fields. And there he tried to draw the cork, but {{as often as he}} put the screw in, out it came again, and the cork as whole as ever.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had felt}} very wakeful, {{but he must}} have dozed off after all, because the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> knew he was {{sitting up in bed}} and trying to {{recollect}} what it was that Tom’s voice had said. Oh! He remembered it now. It had said: “Mr. Byrne! Look out, sir!” A warning this. But against what? ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> exposes, is {{the project}} communicated at Oxford, by a worthy Gentleman since deceased. But since he avowed himself, {{that it was}} but a rough draught, our Author might have paid more respect to his memory, than to {{endeavour}} to render it ridiculous. But let us see how he mends the matter in his own which follows.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "dragon" [...] {{with the}} head of a [...] "salamander" [...] {{features}} in the legend of the Lambton Worm, a serpent caught in the River Wear and dropped in a well, which after 3-4 years terrorized the countryside of Durham while the nobleman who caught it was at the Crusades. Upon return, he received spiked armour and instructions to kill the serpent, but thereafter to kill the <b>next</b> living <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> saw. His father arranged that after the lindwyrm was killed, a hound dog would be released and the son would kill that; but instead of releasing the dog the father ran to his son, and so incurred a malediction by the son's refusal of patricide. Bram Stoker used this legend in his short story Lair of the White Worm.|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on the shoot, {{production}} manager Gary Kent said: [...] "Robert was a prop man to begin with. I {{had no idea}} he was a director. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> I knew <b>he</b> was doing it, and he called me in as a {{production manager}}. It was fun. He took it seriously, so you never got the feeling he was just in it for the bucks. I thought it just took him forever to get a shot. He was always fussing over it. It was murder. His movies were long and arduous, but nonetheless I had some affection for Robert." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, Tillotson {{purchased}} The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, {{and subsequently}} moved there. After a successful bid {{to create a}} polling location at Dixville Notch, {{he was the first}} voter in every American presidential primary and presidential election for 40 years, until his death at age 102. His casting his vote immediately after midnight was often covered in the press. Tillotson was a Republican, but regarding his choice of candidates, he stated, [...] "'I think the first thing you look for is honesty. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> is, has <b>he</b> got a brain? And is he emotionally reasonably stable?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now a good honest laugh is like {{whooping}} cough--it is catching. The {{first thing}} Danny Meadow Mouse knew his tears would not come. It's a fact, Danny Meadow Mouse had run short of tears. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> knew he wasn't crying at all--he was laughing. Yes, Sir, he actually was laughing. He tried to cry, {{but it was}} of no use at all; {{he just had to}} laugh.|$|E
60|$|Vance had no show whatever, as Del well knew, {{who played}} with him, feinting, attacking, retreating, dazzling, and disappearing {{every now and again}} out of his field of vision in a most {{exasperating}} way. As Vance speedily discovered, he possessed very little correlation between mind and body, and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> discovered was that he was lying in the snow and slowly coming back to his senses.|$|E
6000|$|He {{continued}} to look at me; then he gave a laugh which was not the contradiction, but quite the attestation, of the effect produced on him by my grip. If I had wanted to hold him I held him. It only came to me even that I held him too much. I felt this in fact with the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> said. [...] "If you're too excited, then, to be coherent now, {{will you tell me}} to-morrow?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sat down}} on the grass, and told them the story of his life, or as much of it as he could remember, from the day when he was first cradled in a warrior's brazen shield. While he lay there, two immense serpents came gliding over the floor, and opened their hideous jaws to devour him; and he, a baby of a few months old, had griped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little fists, and strangled them to death. When he was but a stripling, he had killed a huge lion, almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders. The <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>he</b> had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster, called a hydra, which had no less than nine heads, and {{exceedingly}} sharp teeth in every one of them.|$|R
60|$|Tom was Polly's rock {{ahead for}} a long time, because he was always {{breaking}} out in a new place, and one never knew where to find him. He tormented yet amused her; was kind one day, and a bear the next; at times she fancied he {{was never going to}} be bad again, and the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> she knew <b>he</b> was deep in mischief, and hooted at the idea of repentance and reformation. Polly gave him up as a hard case; but was so in the habit of helping any one who seemed in trouble, that she was good to him simply because she could n't help it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! what didn't they do?" [...] {{retorted}} {{the station}} master. [...] "Come in here, an' knocked over a box an' a basket, rushed {{up to the}} winder, an' the <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> I knew, <b>he</b> had planked down a lot o' money, an' when I stuck my head out the winder here, that feller pretended to grab up a ticket wot I didn't give him at all, an' took up his money and dusted out the door. At the same time while this was goin' on, 'nother feller had a light turned on this here winder wot nearly blinded me, and the feller with that funny lookin' camera was a-turnin' the crank to beat the cars!" ...|$|R
