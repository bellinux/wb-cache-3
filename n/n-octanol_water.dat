It was hypothesized that the lipophilic complex would be better absorbed by leaves than ZnSO 4 because leaf cuticles are primarily hydrophobic. Cuticle/water partition coefficients, which were measured using enzymatically isolated Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis) cuticles, showed that a chelating polymer called polyethylenimine and rhamnolipid increased Zn sorption to adaxial cuticle surfaces by 2 -fold and 5 -fold, respectively. The chelate EDTA reduced cuticle sorption of Zn to 17 % of the ZnSO 4 control. The rate of Zn diffusion across isolated adaxial cuticles was measured by dialysis. In addition, Zn sorption by cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) foliage was measured by spraying chelated Zn solutions on the foliage before washing the leaves with a rainfall simulator at set intervals. The {{results showed that the}} rate of Zn diffusion across C. sinensis cuticles was not related to the cuticle/water partition coefficients of the chelate solution. Nor did the formation of lipophilic Zn-rhamnolipid complexes increase Zn diffusion across the primarily hydrophobic cuticle. Six hours after application to G. hirsutum leaves, rhamnolipid, EDTA and polyethylenimine had reduced the rate of Zn sorption by 71, 74 and 81 % of the ZnSO 4 control, respectively, which suggested that these chelates may increase the risk of Zn-fertilizer runoff during rainfall events. The reduction in Zn sorption with chelate application was probably due to the size selectivity of aqueous pores that are present within leaf cuticles and the efficiency with which aqueous pores transport ionic Zn 2 +.

In practice, for each test compound log Kow values were generated at a range of volume ratios of <b>n-octanol</b> and <b>water</b> (i.e. 0.5 : 1, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1) for each of two (normally 48  h and a longer period, either 148  h or 168  h) or more stir periods. In this experiment, the majority of the test compounds (# 1 – 6, 10 – 12) were added to the water phase, while the cationics and reference compound (# 7 – 9, 13, 14) were added to the n-octanol phase. It is considered that either application mode should give the correct log Kow value, the main justifications for adding cationics in n-octanol, are that (a) they were soluble in this solvent and (b) this application mode would reduce any losses resulting from their strong adsorption to glass surfaces.

The experimental methods include: the ‘slow-stirring’ method (OECD 123) [2], the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (OECD 117) [3], and a solubility ratio method (referred to in OECD 107) [1] which uses {{the ratio of the}} chemical solubility in <b>n-octanol</b> and in <b>water.</b> All these methods are listed in EU Technical Guidance Document (TGD) guidance [4] and have been used for regulatory notification purposes by different lead registrants in REACH Phases 1 and 2 (i.e. chemicals manufactured or imported in Europe[*]>[*] 1000 and[*]>[*] 100 tonnes per annum, respectively). However, there are concerns that these methods have not been fully validated for surfactants and may not be applicable due to the specific phase behaviour of surfactants. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} aqueous ‘solubility’ is not properly defined for surfactants and also is difficult to measure. Surfactants dissolve not only as single molecules (mono-molecular solution), but at higher concentrations also form different types of soluble aggregates, e.g. spherical micelles, vesicles (depending on their chemical structure, concentration, temperature). The maximum mono-molecular solubility of a surfactant is defined as the critical micelle concentration (CMC). However, the CMC is not a good descriptor of water solubility, as micelles themselves are also a perfectly water-soluble state of surfactants [5]. A working approach for surfactants might be the comparison of measured solubilities in <b>n-octanol</b> and <b>water.</b> However, it is then prudent to take the CMC in water as the solubility limit, in order to avoid the artefact of unrealistically low log Kow values [4].|$|R

Xanthones are natural constituents of plants in the families Bonnetiaceae and Clusiaceae, and comprise oxygenated heterocycles with a variety of biological activities along with an anticancer effect. To explore the anticancer compounds from xanthone derivatives, a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed by the multiple linear regression method. The structure–activity relationship represented by the QSAR model yielded a high activity–descriptors relationship accuracy (84 %) referred by regression coefficient (r 2 = 0. 84) and a high activity prediction accuracy (82 %). Five molecular descriptors – dielectric energy, group count (hydroxyl), LogP (the logarithm of the partition coefficient between <b>n-octanol</b> and <b>water),</b> shape index basic (order 3), and the solvent-accessible surface area – were significantly correlated with anticancer activity. Using this QSAR model, a set of virtually designed xanthone derivatives was screened out.

Electron-rich nitrogen donors tend to bind more strongly than electron-deficient ones, and the weakest binding is found for neutral O and S donors such as oxazole and thiophene. In all cases, ligand binding is stronger in <b>n-octanol</b> than in <b>water,</b> and the differences in binding energies for the two solvents are greater for ionic ligands than for neutrals. Finally, dimerization of ferriprotoporphyrin IX by means of iron(iii) -carboxylate bond formation has been modelled. The results are discussed in terms of haemozoin crystal growth and its disruption by known anti-malarial drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to study the influence of size, nature, and topology of substituents on the thermodynamic characteristics of sublimation, fusion, solubility, solvation, and partitioning processes of some drug and druglike molecules. Thermodynamic functions of sublimation process 2 -acetaminophen and 3 -acetaminophen were obtained {{on the basis of}} temperature dependencies of vapor pressure by the transpiration method. Thermodynamic characteristics of solubility processes in <b>water,</b> <b>n-octanol,</b> and n-hexane were calculated from the temperature dependencies of solubility using the solubility saturation method. For evaluation of fusion parameters, differential scanning calorimetry was used. A new approach to distinguishing specific and nonspecific energetic terms in the crystal lattice was developed. Specific and nonspecific solvation terms were distinguished using the transfer from the “inert” n-hexane to the other solvents. For the acetaminophen compounds and for some related drug molecules, the correlation between melting points and a parameter describing the ratio between specific and nonspecific interaction in the crystal lattices was obtained. A diagram enabling analysis of the mechanism of the partitioning process was applied. It was found that for isomers of benzoic acids and for acetaminophens, the position of substituents affects the mechanism of the partitioning process but not the extent of partitioning (Δ G_tr^ 0 values). In contrast to this, an increased size of substituents (parabens) leads to essential changes in Δ G_tr^ 0 values, but the mechanism of the partitioning process stays the same...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between amino acid side chains govern protein secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure formation. For molecular modeling approaches {{to be able}} to realistically describe these phenomena, the underlying force fields have to represent these interactions as accurately as possible. Here, we compare the side chain−side chain interactions for a number of commonly used force fields, namely the all-atom OPLS, the united-atom GROMOS, and the coarse-grain MARTINI force field. We do so by calculating the dimerization free energies between selected pairs of side chains and structural characterization of their binding modes. To mimic both polar and nonpolar environments, the simulations are performed in <b>water,</b> <b>n-octanol,</b> and decane. In general, reasonable correlations are found between all three force fields, with deviations on the order of 1 kT in aqueous solvent. In apolar solvent, however, significantly larger differences are found, especially for charged amino acid pairs between the OPLS and GROMOS force fields, and for polar interactions in the MARTINI force field in comparison to the higher resolution models. Interestingly, even in cases where the dimerization free energies are similar, the binding mode may differ substantially between the force fields. This was found to be especially the case for aromatic residues. In addition to the inter-force-field comparison, we compared the various force fields to a knowledge-based potential. The two independent approaches show good correlation in aqueous solvent with an exception of aromatic residues for which the interaction strength is lower in the knowledge-based potentials. ...|$|R
30|$|Another {{aspect to}} {{consider}} in a biphasic system is the organic solvent toxicity toward microorganisms. This toxicity depends on its inherent toxicity and the intrinsic tolerance of the bacterial species and strains (Ramos et al. 2002). The toxicity of a solvent correlates with the logarithm of its partition coefficient in <b>n-octanol</b> and <b>water</b> (log P), meaning that, organic solvents with a log P of between 1.5 and 4.0 are toxic for microorganisms. Six organic solvents were selected for lycopene extraction {{as a function of}} the log P, ranging from 3.76 to 6.31. In all aqueous-organic systems tested in this study three phases were formed after 2  h of culture: an aqueous phase containing cells, an interphase and an organic phase (Fig.  4 A). Lycopene was removed from the cells to the interphase and the organic phase, thus enhancing production. Maximum lycopene production was obtained from octane-aqueous systems (5 : 1, v v− 1) (74.71  ±  3.74  mg L− 1 or 49.70  ±  2.48  mg g cell− 1), a 2 -fold improvement over that attained in aqueous culture. This production was also much higher than that obtained from tomato, 0.42  mg g− 1, which suggest it is a promising strategy for its industrial production (Sharma and Le Maguer 1996). This lycopene production rate is, to our knowledge, the highest reported in the literature to date. Moreover, the proteo-lipidic nature of the interphase demonstrated by TEM (Fig.  5 A), showed a high lycopene storage capacity of 76.5  % (57.15  ±  2.86  mg L− 1) with respect to the total production of lycopene in aqueous-octane systems (Fig.  4 B). This interface was formed from partial outer membrane disintegration, while cells with structural integrity were found in the aqueous-octane systems after 24  h (Fig.  5 D, E). Additionally, flow cytometry analysis of E. coli BL 21 LF cells showed a significant percentage (24.74  %) of viable and cultivatable cells for continuous lycopene production (Fig.  6; Table  3). From these results, a series batch reactor for semi-continuous lycopene extraction was designed (Fig.  7 a). The biomass reached was similar for the all cycles, although lycopene production decreased with each of cycle. The results further support the idea that cell depolarisation indicates a decline in cell functionality due to energy depletion, but does not involve cell death. Besides, lycopene accumulation in the cell membrane seems to affect lycopene biosynthesis, since the amount of lycopene extracted from cells to the interphase and the organic phase decreased in each cycle. Nevertheless, the lycopene production obtained from the fifth cycle (120  h) was 36.96  ±  1.82  mg L− 1, similar to that obtained in the aqueous medium (Fig.  7 b).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe atomic {{electrostatic}} potentials {{calculated by}} the CHELPG method {{have been shown}} to be sensitive indicators of the gas phase and solution properties of the statins. Solvation free energies in <b>water,</b> <b>n-octanol</b> and n-octane have been determined using the SMD solvent model. The percentage hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) of the statins in solution have been determined using (a) the differences in solvation free energies between n-octanol and n-octane as a measure of hydrophilicity, and the solvation energy in octane as a measure of hydrophobicity (b) the sum of the atomic electrostatic charges on the hydrogen bonding and polar bonding nuclei of the common pharmacophore combined with a solvent measure of hydrophobicity, and (c) using the buried surface areas after statin binding to HMGCR to calculate the hydrophobicity of the bound statins. The data suggests that clinical definitions of statins as either "hydrophilic" or "lipophilic" based on experimental partition coefficients are misleading. An estimate of the binding energy between rosuvastatin and HMGCR has been made using: (a) a coulombic electrostatic interaction model, (b) the calculated desolvation and resolvation of the statin in water, and (c) the first shell transfer solvation energy as a proxy for the restructuring of the water molecules immediately adjacent to the active binding site of HMGCR prior to binding. De-solvation and re-solvation of the statins before and after binding to HMGCR are major determinants of the energetics of the binding process. An analysis of the amphiphilic nature of lovastatin anion, acid and lactone and fluvastatin anion and their abilities to cross the blood brain barrier has indicated that this process may be dominated by desolvation and resolvation effects, rather than the statin molecular size or statin-lipid interactions within the bilayer. The ionization energy and electron affinity of the statins are sensitive physical indicators of the ease that the various statins can undergo endogenous oxidative metabolism. The absolute chemical hardness is also an indicator of the stability of the statins, and may be a useful indicator for drug design...|$|R
