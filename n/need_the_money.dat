5|$|Meanwhile, at TGS, {{it is time}} {{to renew}} Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) contract, and Jack decides to {{approach}} the matter carefully as Tracy does not <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he makes on the show. While negotiating Tracy's new contract, Jack mentions this fact, which comes as a shock to Tracy, who had never realized that he could survive financially without the income. After realizing that Tracy has quit the show, Jack {{must find a way to}} bring him back, after Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), complains to Jack about how unbearable his father is to have around the house. Meanwhile, in order to get attention for herself, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decides to cut her hair for charity as a publicity stunt. Jenna makes an appearance on NBC's Today Show, where her haircut will be broadcast. Meredith Vieira asks Jenna's opinion on the news that Tracy has left TGS. At learning this, Jenna bails out on her haircut.|$|E
500|$|Before {{he could}} move, however, {{he had to}} dispose of his {{thousands}} of [...] glass-plate negatives. [...] He also had to get himself out of debt once again. [...] In an attempt to accomplish both of these at once, he offered his collection of negatives to the Nebraska State Historical Society. [...] To Addison Sheldon, head of the Society's Legislative Reference Bureau, he wrote, [...] "Now {{is the time to}} buy me cheap, when I <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> so badly." [...] In November 1911, he and Sheldon signed a contract for the sale of the negatives for $1000. [...] Butcher was to receive $100 down; the rest would be paid after the Nebraska legislature passed a bill appropriating funds for the purchase.|$|E
2500|$|Chrysler Financial {{initially}} {{refused to}} take $750 million in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) government bailout aid because executives didn't want to abide by executive-pay limits, and because the firm doesn't necessarily <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> [...] In January 2009, Chrysler Financial was the recipient of $1.5 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The company said that it used the money to fund 85,000 loans to purchase Chrysler automobiles. Chrysler Financial repaid all of the TARP loan in July 2009 by raising funds from an asset-backed securitization through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility program.|$|E

2500|$|With Palmer bailing on the tour, {{some critics}} {{referred}} to it as [...] "unprofessional behaviour". In Number One magazine, he hit back at the claims he joined the band for money: [...] "Firstly, I didn't <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and secondly the cash wasn't exactly a long time coming. It wasn't exactly an experience that set me up for retirement." [...] He also was accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He snapped: [...] "Listen, I gave the Power Station that sound. They took it from me, not the other way around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{gave the}} show a {{negative}} review saying, [...] "Like so many former primetime titans, it's perplexing to see Barr reduced to this [...] " [...] and [...] "Why Barr wanted {{to participate in}} this sort of [...] "celebreality" [...] unscripted sitcom—especially if she hates Hollywood as much as she says—is a little less obvious, especially since she professes not to <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and, given her syndication bounty, shouldn't". David Hinckley of the Daily News gave it two out of five stars. He said, [...] "Roseanne fans will be reassured, though not surprised, to hear that she sounds and acts exactly the same on the plantation as she did on her sitcom set".|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{submitted}} to the United Nations Security Council in October 2002 charge that both the Angolan rebel leader, Mr. Jonas Savimbi, and the Liberian government still violate the trade and weapons bans {{with the help of}} a global network of arms dealers, diamond merchants and natural resources companies. Other logistical issues continue to hinder the success of the KPCS. Terrorist organizations can transport diamonds over borders without detection and convert them back into banknotes whenever they <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Leaders have to use discretion when increasing sanctions, because though they help to discourage conflict diamonds, they can also stunt the growth and development necessary for the countries' fragile economies. [...] "It's clear that international traders are always ready to bypass the sanctions and buy diamonds coming from UNITA," [...] UN official Juan Larrain said in 2000.|$|E

("I got plenty o' nuttin"). Sportin' Life waltzes around selling [...] "happy dust", but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. ("I hates yo' struttin' style"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. ("Buzzard keep on flyin' over".) ...|$|E
2500|$|When Justice Stephen Breyer {{asked if}} [...] "Congress passes a law {{and it says}} it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by {{building}} a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where {{we will have the}} regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to have}} a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?" [...] Clement answered [...] "I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom, United States, France, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Spain and Mexico on 15 July 2009. It was originally set to be released on 21 November 2008, but was pushed back by eight months to 17 July, despite being completed. Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn noted that the move was meant [...] "to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009," [...] with other films being delayed due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The box-office success of summer WB films Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and The Dark Knight also motivated the decision. An unnamed rival studio executive told Entertainment Weekly that the move was to [...] "stop next year's profits from looking seriously underwhelming after the phenomenal success of The Dark Knight," [...] as [...] "they don't <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> this year anymore." [...] Dan Fellman, WB head of distribution, said that the studio had considered the date change {{for three to four}} weeks prior to the announcement, but gave it serious consideration a week before they came to their final decision. Three months before its release in July, the date was again changed by 2 days from 17 to 15 July, so it could open on a Wednesday like most tentpole summer movies.|$|E
