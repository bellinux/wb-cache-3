5|$|Suter and Heisman turned away. 'Can {{you beat}} that?' Suter asked the Auburn coach. Heisman didn't say anything, I guess {{he thought a}} great deal. He told me {{afterwards}} that he had <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> so sorry for {{a man on a}} football field as he had for Suter at that moment.|$|E
5|$|Tim Burton {{signed with}} Walt Disney Pictures to direct two films in Disney Digital 3D, which {{included}} Alice in Wonderland and his remake of Frankenweenie. Burton developed the story because he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> an emotional tie {{to the original}} book.|$|E
60|$|Shelton was silent; he was {{thinking}} deeply. He had <b>never</b> before <b>felt</b> so distrustful of the youthful foreigner.|$|R

5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E
5|$|Stivetts {{was again}} {{reserved}} by Boston, and later re-signed for $2000. Due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man starting pitching rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie Vic Willis, his role {{with the team}} {{was expected to be}} as an extra outfielder. Stivetts claimed that he had <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> better in his life and his outlook on the up-coming season was positive.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E
60|$|Something in {{the tone}} struck strangely through her heart. It {{was the voice of}} what Diana <b>never</b> had <b>felt</b> yet--deep suffering--and she gave a little shiver.|$|R

5|$|One {{year after}} the death of the Joker during the events of , Batman is {{struggling}} {{to come to terms with}} the absence of his nemesis and the uncomfortable feeling that the pair shared a bond deeper than either could admit. Without the Joker's chaotic presence, Gotham's citizens have <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> safer, and crime in the city has dramatically declined. However, this gives Batman's enemies, including Penguin, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn, a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|After their Hampstead {{home was}} hit by bomb {{shrapnel}} in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London {{to live in a}} farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. This was to become Moore's home and workshop {{for the rest of his}} life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years. In 1943 he received a commission from the Church of St. Matthew, Northampton, to carve a Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: According to ATF {{director}} John Magaw, {{the event}} had no overtly racist overtones until 1985, although he conceded eight days later that blacks would <b>never</b> have <b>felt</b> welcome at any point.|$|R

5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women. The {{most famous and}} enduring of these relationships involved Lu√≠sa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald {{also made}} a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> entirely {{comfortable}} in the smoky atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Mangeot {{also asked}} Boulanger to {{contribute}} articles of music criticism to his paper Le Monde Musical, and she occasionally provided articles for this, and other newspapers, {{for the rest}} of her life, though she <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> at ease setting her opinions down for posterity in this way.|$|E

25|$|Davies {{made several}} {{attempts}} at solo albums throughout the '70s, but he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> enough enthusiasm or interest {{to see the}} projects through. He would often act as the producer and engineer at the Kinks' main studio, Konk, in his spare time, producing albums {{for the likes of}} Claire Hamill and Andy Desmond.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{has since}} complained {{that time and}} money constraints, along with his {{obligation}} to Thelma & Louise, kept him from retooling the film in a completely satisfactory manner. While he is happier with the 1992 release of the film than with the original theatrical version, he has <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> entirely comfortable with it as his definitive director's cut.|$|E
60|$|She <b>never</b> again <b>felt</b> quite {{young enough}} and defiant enough and free {{enough to run}} and halloo in the public streets; {{and it was as}} a Nice Married Woman that she {{attended}} the next weekly bridge of the Jolly Seventeen.|$|R
60|$|Felix had <b>never</b> before <b>felt</b> so {{hopeful about}} Fulbert; {{but still he}} was too much overset to talk to Cherry, and hurried her off to bed, soon {{following}} her example, for he had not the heart to see Lance that night.|$|R
60|$|George, likewise, looked {{awkward and}} confused, as stout and healthy boys are {{accustomed}} {{to do in the}} society of the sick or afflicted. <b>Never</b> having <b>felt</b> pain or sorrow, they are abashed, from not knowing how to sympathize with the sufferings of others.|$|R
