5|$|Louis XVIII {{signed the}} Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which {{extended}} {{east of the}} Rhine. She had to pay <b>no</b> <b>war</b> indemnity, and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew instantly from French soil. These generous terms would be reversed in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon's return to France in 1815).|$|E
5|$|UB-11s {{commanding}} officer at commissioning only remained {{in charge of}} the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more {{commanding officer}}s assigned {{through the end of the}} war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. UB-11 was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made <b>no</b> <b>war</b> patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, UB-11 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.|$|E

25|$|In May 1881 Tryon {{was sent}} as senior officer {{with a group}} of ships to patrol the coast of Tunisia.

This was a breach of international law and might have escalated into a serious incident, but Tryon handled the matter with tact. He suggested to the senior French officer, Captain Rieunnier, that perhaps a mistake had been made. The French apologised and explained that the commander of Leopold had misunderstood his instructions.|$|E

25|$|In May 1940, the US {{requested}} base {{rights in}} Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, {{as part of}} the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with <b>no</b> <b>war</b> material received by the UK in exchange.

25|$|No {{sooner than}} the Tai-Shan world finally became quiet, the king turned his {{attention}} to Portuguese Goa and the advancing Mughal Empire in the west. In response to competing requests by the Ceylonese kingdoms of Kotte and Kandy for military aid, he finally sent an elite army in 1576 to Kotte, which he considered a protectorate, ostensibly to protect Theravada Buddhism on the island from the Portuguese threat. Goa considered it was technically at war with Pegu although <b>no</b> <b>war</b> ever broke out. Closer to home, he responded to the Mughals' 1576 annexation of Bengal by claiming the entire swath of lands in present-day northeast India, as far west as the Ganges and by sending an invasion force to Arakan in 1580.|$|E

During World War II, the town infrastructure was kept almost saved. Except in the final fights for the town, there were <b>no</b> <b>war</b> actions on the territory of the town.

25|$|Popov {{trained for}} the navy, and {{commanded}} ships {{before and during}} the Crimean War. He rose to the rank of rear-admiral and was assigned to supervise warship design and construction. He was in command of a squadron in the Pacific during the Polish Crisis that followed the January Uprising in 1863, and was sent to North America on a goodwill mission, and in order to raid colonial possessions should war break out between Russia and other European powers. Though there was <b>no</b> <b>war,</b> Popov spent a year in San Francisco, where the Russian presence had a distinct impact on life. Popov turned to warship design after his return to Russia, and proposed a series of warships to an unconventional circular design. Only two were built, one of which, Vitse-admiral Popov, was named in honour of him. Their radical designs proved troublesome, and were not repeated.|$|E
