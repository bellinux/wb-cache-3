[...] Arguing that the EU's energy research should be focused elsewhere, she said: [...] "The Green/EFA group demands that these funds be spent instead on energy research that is relevant to the future. A major focus should now be put on renewable sources of energy." [...] French Green party lawmaker Noël Mamère claims that more concrete efforts to fight present-day global warming will be neglected {{as a result of}} ITER: [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we're going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30–50 years when we're not even sure it will be effective." ...|$|E
60|$|And is {{not this}} a gospel, and good news? Is it <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> {{that we need}} never be afraid or ashamed {{to give way to}} our {{tenderness}} and pity? for God does not think it beneath him to be tender and pitiful. Is it <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> that we need never be afraid or ashamed to forgive, to take back those who have neglected us, wronged us? for God does not think it beneath him to do likewise. That we need never show hardness, pride, sternness to our children when they do wrong, but should win them by love and tenderness, caring for them all the more, the less they care for themselves? for God does even so to us, who have sinned against him far more than our children ever can sin against us.|$|E

How long have you made head against your inherited failings?" ...|$|E
60|$|So thought Solomon, {{in spite}} of all his wisdom, because he had <b>not</b> heard the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> of Easter day. And so think many now, who are called wise men and philosophers; because they, alas! for them, will <b>not</b> believe the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> of Easter day.|$|R

[...] "Now I think of it, Mrs Bland, Mr Leather is to call here by appointment this very morning, so you must be particularly careful not {{to say a word}} to him about this telegram, or Captain Stride, or anything I have told you about the lost ship--you understand, Mrs Bland?" ...|$|E

I used to think sometimes, at night, that I should never see her again. That she would come back in time was all I have had to wish for." [...] He was lying on his back, and as he spoke he pressed his withered hands together above the bedclothes. They could not begin immediately to tell him of Mr. Crawley, {{but as soon as}} his mind had turned itself away from the thoughts of his absent daughter, Mrs. Grantly again reverted to her news.|$|E
6000|$|And is it <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> again, that God does {{care for}} sinners, {{and for all}} kinds and sorts of sinners? Some go wrong from mere stupidity and ignorance, because they know no better; because they really are not {{altogether}} accountable for their own doings. They are like the silly sheep, who gets out over the fence of his own fancy: and yet no reasonable man will be angry with the poor thing. It knows no better. How many a poor young thing goes wandering away, like that silly sheep, and having once lost its way, cannot get back again, but wanders on further and further, till it lies down all desperate, tired out, mired in the bogs, and torn about with thorns! ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>not</b> exactly <b>good</b> <b>news</b> {{from any}} point of view, and Brooke was pondering over it {{somewhat}} moodily {{when he heard}} a voice he recognized, and looking up saw a woman with pale blue eyes smiling at him.|$|R
5000|$|The good news: Help to Work reduced benefit receipt and {{increased}} employment among participants. The <b>not</b> so <b>good</b> <b>news</b> (but {{no surprise to}} those of us who know the literature): not by very much, and overall outcomes were still pretty bad.|$|R

6000|$|Rejoice {{that there}} is a fire of God the Father whose name is Love, burning for ever unquenchably, to destroy out of every man's heart and out of the hearts of all nations, and of the {{physical}} and moral world, all which offends and makes a lie; and that into that fire the Son will surely cast all shams, lies, hypocrisies, tyrannies, false doctrines. Is it <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> that that fire is unquenchable, that that worm will not die? The fire may be kindled for us--the worm may seize our hearts. God grant that in that day we may have courage to let the fire and the worm do their work--to say to Christ, [...] "These too are Thine, and out of Thine infinite love they have come. Thou requirest truth in the inward parts, and I will thank Thee for any means, however bitter, which Thou usest to make me true. I want to be an honest man and a right man! And, O joy! Thou wantest me to be so also. O joy! that though I long cowardly to quench Thy fire, I cannot do it. Purge me therefore, O Lord, though it be with fire. Burn up the chaff of vanity and self-indulgence, of hasty prejudices, second-hand dogmas,--husks which do not feed my soul, with which I cannot be content, of which I feel ashamed daily--and if there be any grains of wheat in me, any word or thought or power of action which may be of use as seed for my nation after me, gather it, O Lord, into Thy garner." [...] Amen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah but," [...] {{someone may}} say, [...] "that, {{if it ever}} happens at all, will not happen till we are dead, and what part or lot shall WE have in it? we who die {{in the midst of}} all this sin, and injustice, and distress?" [...] There again the Bible gives us hope: [...] "I believe," [...] says the Creed, [...] "in the resurrection of the flesh." [...] The Bible teaches us to believe, that we, each of us, as human beings, men and women, shall have a share in that glorious day; not merely as ghosts, and disembodied spirits--of which the Bible, thanks be to God, says little or nothing, but as real live human beings, with new bodies of our own, on a new earth, under a new heaven. [...] "Therefore," [...] says David, [...] "my flesh shall rest in hope;" [...] not merely my soul, my ghost, but my flesh. For the Lord, who not only died, but rose again with His body, shall raise our bodies, {{according}} to the mighty working by which He subdues all things to Himself; and then the whole manhood of each of us, body, soul, and spirit, shall have one perfect consummation and bliss, in His eternal and everlasting glory.--That is our hope. If that is not a gospel, and good news from heaven to poor distressed creatures in hovels, and on sick beds, to people racked with life-long pain and disease, to people in crowded cities, who never from week's end to week's end look on the green fields and bright sky--if that is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> and a dayspring of boundless hope from on high for them, what news can be? ...|$|E

5000|$|Mormon {{scholar and}} {{columnist}} Jana Riess {{was critical of}} the organization's tactics, stating: [...] "I am very concerned about privacy in our culture more generally.

[...] She called MormonLeaks [...] "disturbing" [...] and said: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> for any of us."

But the boom soon be swamped. The war between France and Spain conditioned an order of the Captaincy General of the island that forced into exile in Franco-Haitian and French residents.

50|$|In a {{professional}} Review, philosopher Maximiliano Korstanje argues that violence has declined, {{but not for}} the reasons stipulated in Pinker´s book. Violence and rivalry not only are innate to humans but also pave the ways for the construction of culture. Its decline corresponds with an indicator of submission and control. In order for monopolizing the means of production, financial elite needs from peace, mobility, tourism, democracy and commodity-exchanges. What violence decreased is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news</b> simply because capitalism proved to be a machine to create material asymmetries. Paradoxically, while this world became less violent, it turned out more unjust for many peripheral classes.|$|E

In the short term, it finds that the biggest risks from the Chinese slowdown may be political, stemming from a weakening of the Renminbi, either from actions taken by China’s central bank and/or from large capital outflows...|$|R

50|$|The 1957 Defence White Paper, {{which focused}} on missiles, and not manned {{aircraft}} - which were declared 'obsolete', also was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> because it precluded any future government financial support for development of non-already extant manned combat aircraft, and so prevented any official financial support for the engine or aircraft from the Ministry of Defence.

5000|$|After {{breaking}} into series television in 1975 with Happy Days, followed by guest spots {{in several other}} TV shows, and three more movies including Grease, Conaway was cast as vain and struggling, but goodhearted and handsome, aspiring actor Bobby Wheeler in the workplace comedy Taxi, which premiered in fall 1978. [...] He had appeared in an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show for the same producers, and, he said in 1987, had been considered {{for the role of}} John Burns, which eventually went to Randall Carver: But then one day I got the whole script and became real interested in the actor character, then called Bobby Taylor. And producers said they had been thinking along the same lines, so I read again. Later I got a call from casting director Joel Thurm, who says, 'Well, it's <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> but it's not bad news either.' He says I'm the only choice for a white actor, but that they'd had a meeting and thought that maybe Bobby should be black and that now they're looking at black actors. ...

40|$|I {{investigate}} how peer firms affect a firm’s management earnings forecast decision around its earnings announcement date. I {{find that the}} probability of a firm issuing a <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecast is positively related to the proportion of peer firms issuing <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts, but a firm’s bad news forecast is not affected by the bad news forecasts of peer firms. Furthermore, I find that the positive influence of peers’ <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts on the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecast of the following firm is weaker with the presence of the firm’s higher transient institutional ownership, and stronger when analyst followings of the firm are larger. In addition, I find that firms do <b>not</b> fabricate <b>good</b> <b>news</b> to follow <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts of peer firms, only choosing to reveal <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> These findings suggest that managers herd on early <b>good</b> <b>news</b> forecasts to avoid their stock prices being discounted by investors, but not on early bad news forecasts because managers hope that subsequent favorable events may bury early bad news. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
