40|$|We {{documented}} depredation by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Florida <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus cavalla) troll fishery. Between March and June 2003, {{we conducted}} 26 interviews of charter and commercial fishermen in Islamorada, Florida, and 23 along Florida’s east coast from Fort Pierce south to Lake Worth Inlet. All fishermen indicated they had observed bottlenose dolphins depredating bait or catch—king mackerel being the species most often taken by dolphins. During on-board observations of depredation between March and June 2003, {{we found that}} dolphins took 6 % of <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught by charter fishermen and 20 % of fish caught by commercial fishermen. We concluded that depredation by bottlenose dolphin occurs commonly in this fishery and {{has the potential to}} incur a significant economic cost to <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> fishermen. To address this concern, we conducted preliminary tests of a gear modification designed to reduce depredation in the <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> fishery between December 2003 and January 2004.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1006 <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus cavalla) {{representing}} 20 discrete samples collected between 1996 and 1998 {{along the east}} (Atlantic) and west (Gulf) coasts of Florida and the Florida Keys were assayed for allelic variation at seven nuclear-encoded microsatellites. No significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations were found for six of the microsatellites, and genotypes at all microsatellites were independent. Allele distributions at each microsatellite were independent of sex and age of individuals. Homogeneity tests of spatial distributions of alleles at the microsatellites revealed two weakly divergent “genetic” subpopulations or stocks of <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> in Florida waters—one along the Atlantic coast and one along the Gulf coast. Homogeneity tests of allele distributions when samples were pooled along seasonal (temporal) boundaries, consistent with the temporal boundaries used currently for stock assessment and allocation of the <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource, were nonsignificant. The degree of genetic divergence between the two “genetic” stocks was small: on average, only 0. 19 % of the total genetic variance across all samples assayed occurred between the two regions. Cluster analysis, assignment tests, and spatial autocorrelation analysis did not generate patterns that were consistent with either geographic or spatial-temporal boundaries. King mackerel sampled from the Florida Keys could not be assigned unequivocally to either “genetic” stock. The genetic data were not consistent with current spatial-temporal boundaries employed in stock assessment and allocation of the <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource. The genetic differences between <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Atlantic versus those in the Gulf most likely stem from reduced gene flow (migration) between the Atlantic and Gulf in relation to gene flow (migration) along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of peninsular Florida.

40|$|Although {{bite force}} is a {{commonly}} used metric of feeding performance, other {{factors such as}} bite pressure and strike speed {{are also likely to}} affect prey capture. Therefore, this study investigated static bite force, dynamic speeds, and predator and prey forces resulting from ram strikes, as well as bite pressure of the <b>king</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomberomorus cavalla, in order to examine their relative contributions to overall feeding performance. Theoretical posterior bite force ranged from 14. 0 - 318. 7 N. Ram speed, recorded with a rod and reel incorporated with a line counter and video camera, ranged from 3. 3 - 15. 8 BL/s. Impact forces on the prey ranged from 0. 1 - 1. 9 N. Bite pressure, estimated using theoretical bite forces at three gape angles and tooth cross-sectional areas, ranged from 1. 7 - 56. 9 MPa. Mass-specific bite force for <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> is relatively low in comparison with other bony fishes and sharks, with relatively little impact force applied to the prey during the strike. This suggests that <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> rely on high velocity chases and high bite pressure generated via sharp, laterally compressed teeth to maximize feeding performance...|$|R
40|$|Conflicts between {{marine mammals}} and {{fisheries}} {{can be attributed}} to spatial overlap and resource competition between cetaceans and fisheries and/or behavioral learning among marine mammals. In the present study, I documented depredation by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Florida’s <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> troll fishery. Depredation refers to the behavior in which predator species remove or damage fish on fishing lines or in nets. I conducted twenty-six surveys of charter and commercial fishermen in Islamorada, Florida and twenty-three along Florida’s east coast from Fort Pierce south to Lake Worth Inlet, and I observed dolphin behaviors from working vessels in these two study sites. All survey respondents indicated they had observed bottlenose dolphins depredating bait or catch. Fishermen reported that <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> was the species most often taken by bottlenose dolphins. From behavioral observations, I found that dolphins took 6 % of <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught by charter fishermen and 20 % of fish caught by commercial fishermen. I attributed these differences to seasonal variation in fish distribution or gear differences between vessel types.

This result suggests that these key species may be more efficiently managed as a group, rather than with the use of existing single species regulations.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{methods of}} stomach content analysis and stable 15 N and 13 C isotope biochemistry analysis {{were used to}} investigate the trophic dynamics and feeding ecology of coastal pelagic fishes in the waters off southeastern Florida, USA. The coastal pelagic fish complex includes blackfin tuna Thunnus atlanticus, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> Scomberomorus cavalla, little tunny Euthynnus alletteratus, skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, and wahoo Acanthocybium solandri. These coastal teleosts, particularly the tunas and wahoo, are primarily targeted by recreational anglers. However, {{there is a shortage}} of available trophic and diet composition data concerning these fishes of the coastal pelagic ecosystem. Stomach and muscle tissue samples were collected from the species of various lengths over a three-year period from March 2010 and March 2013. Across all six species, teleost fishes dominated the prey with an average 64. 5 % by occurrence, 63. 7 % by number, and 89. 9 % by weight. There were two dominant prey families: Clupeidae and Carangidae. Dolphinfish showed the lowest diet overlap among the six species, due to the highly diverse diet. The highest diet overlap occurred between <b>king</b> <b>mackerel</b> and little tunny. The mean δ 15 N ranged from 8. 21 ‰ (wahoo) to 13. 18 ‰ (<b>king</b> <b>mackerel),</b> and the mean δ 13 C ranged from - 18. 41 ‰ (<b>king</b> <b>mackerel)</b> to - 16. 70 ‰ (dolphinfish). Blackfin tuna exhibited the largest δ 15 N range (7. 22 to 13. 21 ‰), as well as the largest δ 13 C range (- 19. 13 to - 12. 99 ‰). The δ 15 N and δ 13 C signatures in the muscle tissue showed evidence of shifts to higher trophic levels with an increase in fish size and the formation of distinct trophic groups among the coastal pelagic predators. The δ 13 C also suggested an inshore-offshore spatial relationship among the coastal pelagic fish. The trophic dynamics and feeding ecology data generated by this study will provide valuable baseline data for the coastal pelagic complex and future ecosystem studies...|$|R
