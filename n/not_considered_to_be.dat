5|$|Abrahams Creek is a {{perennial}} stream with relatively poor water quality. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline {{and has a}} daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil.|$|E
5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of}} the ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces {{in addition to the}} mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.|$|E

5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role {{due to their}} high cost and limited evidence of efficacy. Medications for acne work by targeting {{the early stages of}} comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E

Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.|$|E

Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|When young, it may {{be mistaken}} for the edible St George's {{mushroom}} (Calocybe gambosa) or the miller (Clitopilus prunulus).

E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.|$|E

5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|As US31 curves {{around to}} the {{northeast}} and east in Charlevoix County, it follows {{a section of the}} Lake Michigan shoreline that is <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of any bay. The highway continues through Northern Michigan agricultural areas to the southeast of Charlevoix. Once it enters the city, the trunkline intersects the northern end of M-66 and follows a series of city streets to a drawbridge over the channel that connects Lake Charlevoix to Lake Michigan. South of the structure it is Bridge Street, and north of the bridge it is Michigan Avenue. The highway turns eastward to exit town on Petoskey Avenue and follow the Lake Michigan shoreline. Near the community of Bay Shore, US31 crosses into Emmet County. The trunkline continues past the Bay Harbor development on Charlevoix Avenue into the city of Petoskey.|$|E
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
