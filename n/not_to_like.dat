500|$|The goddess' name [...] "Dhumavati" [...] {{means the}} [...] "smoky one". She is said <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> offerings burnt {{in a fire}} that is not smoky.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for a Writers Guild Award in 1991. Holly E. Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on not just this episode, but the whole of the first season, saying, [...] "What's <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> about an episode like 'The Stakeout,' in which (among other things) we are witness to the invention of George's alter ego, Art Vandelay (and his import/export business)?" [...] Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly also liked the episode but had some doubts, saying it was, [...] "A painfully realistic take on the lovers-to-friends transition that should have been more comically fruitful." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again, this is {{defective}} observation. It {{is human}} <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be praised; one can even notice {{it in the}} French. But it is <b>not</b> human <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, even when it {{comes in the form}} of a [...] "tribute." [...] I think a little psychologizing ought to have come in there. Something like this: A dog does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a redskin does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a negro does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a Chinaman does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed; let us deduce from these significant facts this formula: the American's grade being higher than these, and the chain-of argument stretching unbroken all the way up to him, there is room for suspicion that the person who said the American <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, and regards it as a tribute, is not a capable observer.|$|R

500|$|Icke and {{his family}} moved in 1982 to Ryde on the Isle of Wight. His {{relationship}} with Grandstand was shortlived–he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> him–but he continued working for BBC Sport until 1990, often on bowls and snooker programmes, and at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He was by then a household name, but a career in television began to lose its appeal; he wrote that he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious. In August 1990, his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the Community Charge (also known as the [...] "poll tax"), a local tax introduced that year by Margaret Thatcher's government. He ultimately paid it, but his announcement {{that he was willing}} to go to prison rather than pay prompted the BBC, by charter an impartial public-service broadcaster, to distance itself from him.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Zinta {{appeared}} in two films. Her first release was the folk comedy Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen, co-starring Govinda, a production {{that had been}} delayed since 2002. The film garnered negative reviews and poor box office returns. Zinta's role was small, and was not well received. She next starred opposite Saif Ali Khan in Siddharth Anand's comedy-drama Salaam Namaste. Produced by Yash Raj Films, {{it was the first}} Indian feature to be filmed entirely in Australia and {{went on to become the}} year's highest-grossing Bollywood production outside of India, earning [...] internationally. The film tells the story of a contemporary cohabiting Indian couple and their subsequent struggle with an unexpected pregnancy. Zinta played the female protagonist Ambar Malhotra, a single modern young woman who leaves India to make her own life in Melbourne. Salaam Namaste received mostly positive reviews, and Zinta's performance earned her nominations for Best Actress at a number of award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh referred to her as [...] "terrific" [...] and argued that she gave [...] "her most accomplished performance to date". The New York Times noted, [...] "She is cheerleader-homecoming queen-fraternity sweetheart pretty, so even when her characters are being unkind it's hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> her." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Allistair Pinsof at Destructoid {{reviewed}} the game, {{calling it a}} mix between Paperboy and Muscle March {{in terms of the}} complexity and pace, and compared the gameplay to Crash Bandicoot. He found it to be [...] "such a gloriously twisted, charming spectacle" [...] that it would be difficult <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> it; he said that the main reason to play the game is [...] "the sheer lunacy" [...] of it, saying that the game is [...] "obsessed" [...] with America, and portrays Americans as [...] "unhygienic hillbillies" [...] in a manner that makes it unclear if it is a self-aware parody or not. He concluded that the game is funny, but not great, and that the ridiculous premise and its large amount of small details make the game [...] "charmingly brain-dead". In 2013, Justin Amirkhani at Complex included the game in a list of company-branded video games that [...] "didn't suck", saying that while the game's graphics had not aged well, it was mechanically very similar to Temple Run, which Amirkhani called his favorite iOS game. He concluded that Pepsiman is not a bad game for people with quick reflexes, {{as long as they can}} stand the high amount of advertising within the game; he claimed that Pepsiman was the advergame with the largest amount of [...] "logos-per-second".|$|E

500|$|James Rocchi of MSN Movies {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Heartfelt and hilarious, smart and silly, action-packed but never violent, Despicable Me 2 is that rare sequel that outshines its beginnings." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For an adult, the {{predictability}} could turn you blasé. For kids, revisiting these jokes is a howl. Pinkie promise." [...] Mary F. Pols of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As a sequel it stands level with the first film, and may have the edge on it." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, who do Minion voices expertly, never let up on the laughs. A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky, but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun." [...] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "What's missing—and this was the crucial component of part one—is a little sour to undercut the sweet. Like its protagonist, a bad guy gone boringly good, Despicable Me 2 has no edge. It's fatally nice and insufficiently naughty." [...] Laremy Legel of Film.com gave the film a 6.3 out of 10, saying [...] "Despicable Me 2 is fun, especially near the culmination. Structural issues aside, it's impossible <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> these characters, all of them, rendered with love, always entertaining even when the story around them doesn't make much sense." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Heart" [...] {{received}} {{a wide range}} of opinion from reviewers, though the balance was clearly on the positive side. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like?</b> Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E
500|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a mainstream audience in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes. Gosling portrayed Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: [...] "It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative." [...] Gosling sought to imbue his character with [...] "quiet strength" [...] and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was uncooperative. The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads and noted that, [...] "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds against them." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's [...] "beguiling unaffectedness" [...] and noted that [...] "it's hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> these two or begrudge them a great love together". The film grossed over $115 million worldwide. Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award. Entertainment Weekly has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists.|$|E

Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their Fiat 600 and drop him off at 1719 Julián Alvarez Street, location of Fundación Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir's frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> working alone.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013, {{tensions}} {{were reportedly}} growing between Cameron and Larry.

The Camerons were said <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> Larry, amid suggestions that the pet was a public relations prop. Cameron posted to Twitter saying that he and Larry got on [...] "purr-fectly well". Nevertheless, bookmakers Ladbrokes made Cameron the odds-on (1/2) favourite to leave Downing Street first, with Larry as the 6/4 outsider. The Daily Telegraph suggested that Cameron never really liked cats but that spin doctors believed Larry could make the PM appear more friendly. When leaving office in 2016, Cameron spoke of his [...] "sadness" [...] that he could not take Larry with him. When Theresa May became Prime Minister in 2016, there were concerns that Larry was stressed and could be missing the Cameron family.|$|E

Patricia Highsmith does a fine job of {{ensuring}} he wheedles his way into our sympathies." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert made a similar appraisal of the character in his review of Purple Noon, Rene Clement's 1960 film adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley: [...] "Ripley is a criminal of intelligence and cunning who gets away with murder. He's charming and literate, and a monster. It's insidious, the way Highsmith seduces us into identifying with him and sharing his selfishness; Ripley believes that getting his own way is worth whatever price anyone else might have to pay. We all have {{a little of that}} in us." [...] Novelist Sarah Waters esteemed The Talented Mr. Ripley as the [...] "one book I wish I'd written." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) {{surrounded}} the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that [...] "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They {{walked up and down}} the aisles and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental to the image of blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. [...] "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art." ...|$|E

[...] He appears <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> or understand either Meg or Charles Wallace, and Meg in turn thinks of Mr. Jenkins as a failure and an obstacle, who believes in [...] "the law of the jungle". However, in A Wind in the Door, Jenkins notices Charles Wallace's physical weakness before Meg does, and Meg is reminded that he once secretly bought Calvin a [...] badly needed pair of shoes. Knowing these things helps Meg to [...] "Name" [...] Mr. Jenkins; i.e., to love and understand him, and help him to do the same. Meg eventually realizes that both she and Mr. Jenkins himself have consistently underestimated him. Once named, Mr. Jenkins joins Meg and Calvin O'Keefe on their quest to save Charles Wallace.
