60|$|By noon he had {{rounded the}} wide {{curve of the}} brake and was facing south. The bluff had petered out from a high, mountainous wall to a low {{abutment}} of rock, but it still held to its steep, rough nature and afforded <b>no</b> <b>crack</b> or slope where quick ascent could have been possible. He pushed on, growing warier {{as he approached the}} danger-zone, finding that as he neared the river on this side it was imperative to go deeper into the willows. In the afternoon he reached a point where he could see men pacing to and fro on the bluff. This assured him that whatever place was guarded was one by which he might escape. He headed toward these men and approached to within a hundred paces of the bluff where they were. There were several men and several boys, all armed and, after the manner of Texans, taking their task leisurely. Farther down Duane made out black dots on the horizon of the bluff-line, and these he concluded were more guards stationed at another outlet. Probably all the available men in the district were on duty. Texans took a grim pleasure in such work. Duane remembered that upon several occasions he had served such duty himself.|$|E

When Champion (who was interviewed nearly every day) heard of this late little crumb of success falling to his unconscious rival, the last link snapped that held back his devilish hatred. Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own love and honour which has been the talk of the shire. You will ask me why I allowed such atrocious attentions. I answer that I could not have declined them except by explaining to my husband, and there are some things the soul cannot do, as the body cannot fly. Nobody could have explained to my husband. Nobody could do it now. If you said to him in so many words, 'Champion is stealing your wife,' he would think the joke a little vulgar: that it could be anything but a joke--that notion could find <b>no</b> <b>crack</b> in his great skull to get in by. Well, John was to come and see us act this evening, but just as we were starting he said he wouldn't; he had got an interesting book and a cigar. I told this to Sir Claude, and it was his death-blow. The monomaniac suddenly saw despair. He stabbed himself, crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him; he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy, and John is sitting in the dining-room reading a book." ...|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{cracking}} densities {{tended to}} be in the same range as those reported for bridge decks of similar ages in the study by Darwin et al. (2004). It was of interest that several decks exhibited minimal (or <b>no)</b> <b>cracking,</b> despite being in service for over 10  years. Lightweight bridge deck 2 L and normalweight bridge deck 2 N, on the same bridge, exhibited virtually <b>no</b> <b>cracking</b> after 16  years of service in a coastal environment. The low traffic on this pair of bridges alludes to the potential role of traffic-induced stress on cracking, as well as the ability of these particular concrete mixtures to perform well in a coastal environment. The most extensive pattern cracking was observed in bridge decks in the Piedmont region. It is of note that these decks included the oldest pair (7 N/ 7 L) and the pair experiencing the highest traffic volume (6 N/ 6 L).|$|R
60|$|I {{was present}} during the {{commencement}} of the excavations (August 20, 1877) and Mr. Farrer had two deep trenches dug {{at opposite ends of}} the atrium, so that I might examine the nature of the soil near the remains. The field sloped from east to west at an angle of about 7 degrees; and one of the two trenches, shown in the accompanying section (Fig. 8) was at the upper or eastern end. The diagram is on a scale of 1/20 of an inch to an inch; but the trench, which was between 4 and 5 feet broad, and in parts above 5 feet deep, has necessarily been reduced out of all proportion. The fine mould over the floor of the atrium varied in thickness from 11 to 16 inches; and {{on the side of the}} trench in the section was a little over 13 inches. After the mould had been removed, the floor appeared as a whole moderately level; but it sloped in parts at an angle of 1 degree, and in one place near the outside at as much as 8 degrees 30 minutes. The wall surrounding the pavement was built of rough stones, and was 23 inches in thickness where the trench was dug. Its broken summit was here 13 inches, but in another part 15 inches, beneath the surface of the field, being covered by this thickness of mould. In one spot, however, it rose to within 6 inches of the surface. On two sides of the room, where the junction of the concrete floor with the bounding walls could be carefully examined, there was <b>no</b> <b>crack</b> or separation. This trench afterwards proved to have been dug within an adjoining room (11 ft. by 11 ft. 6 in. in size), the existence of which was not even suspected whilst I was present.|$|E
6000|$|... "For, observe, {{the lines}} which cause these far-away effects of shadow, are not, as often in less noble rocks, caused by real cracks {{through the body}} of the mountain; for, were this so, it would follow, from what has just been stated, that these aiguilles were cracked through and through in every direction, and {{therefore}} actually weaker, instead of stronger, than other rocks. But the appearance of fracture is entirely external, and the sympathy or parallelism of the lines indicates, not an actual splitting through the rock, but a mere disposition in the rock to split harmoniously when it is compelled to do so. Thus, in the shell-like fractures on the flank of the Aiguille Blaitière, the rock is not actually divided, as it appears to be, into successive hollow plates. Go up close to the inner angle between one bed of rock and the next, and the whole mass will be found as firmly united as a piece of glass. There is absolutely <b>no</b> <b>crack</b> between the beds,--no, not so much as would allow the blade of a penknife to enter for a quarter of an inch;[124] but such a subtle disposition to symmetry of fracture {{in the heart of the}} solid rock, that the next thunderbolt which strikes on that edge of it will rend away a shell-shaped fragment or series of fragments; and will either break it so as to continue the line of one of the existing sides, or in some other line parallel to that. And yet this resolvedness to break into shell-shaped fragments running north and south is only characteristic of the rock at this spot, and at certain other spots where similar circumstances have brought out this peculiar humor. Forty yards farther on it will be equally determined to break in another direction, and nothing will persuade it to the contrary. Forty yards farther it will change its mind again, and face its beds round to another quarter of the compass; and yet all these alternating caprices are each parts of one mighty continuous caprice, which is only masked for a time, as threads of one color are in a patterned stuff by threads of another; and thus from a distance, precisely the same cleavage is seen repeated again and again in different places, forming a systematic structure; while other groups of cleavages will become visible in their turn, either as we change our place of observation, or as the sunlight changes the direction of its fall." ...|$|E
60|$|Ours was a {{reasonably}} comfortable ship, with the customary sea-going fare --plenty of good food furnished by the Deity and cooked by the devil. The discipline observable on board was perhaps {{as good as}} it is anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The ship was not very well arranged for tropical service; but that is nothing, for this is the rule for ships which ply in the tropics. She had an over-supply of cockroaches, but this is also the rule with ships doing business in the summer seas--at least such as have been long in service. Our young captain was a very handsome man, tall and perfectly formed, the very figure to show up a smart uniform's finest effects. He was a man of the best intentions and was polite and courteous even to courtliness. There was a soft grace and finish about his manners which made whatever place he happened to be in seem for the moment a drawing room. He avoided the smoking room. He had no vices. He did not smoke or chew tobacco or take snuff; he did not swear, or use slang or rude, or coarse, or indelicate language, or make puns, or tell anecdotes, or laugh intemperately, or raise his voice above the moderate pitch enjoined by the canons of good form. When he gave an order, his manner modified it into a request. After dinner he and his officers joined the ladies and gentlemen in the ladies' saloon, and shared in the singing and piano playing, and helped turn the music. He had a sweet and sympathetic tenor voice, and used it with taste and effect. After the music he played whist there, always with the same partner and opponents, until the ladies' bedtime. The electric lights burned there as late as the ladies and their friends might desire; but they were not allowed to burn in the smoking-room after eleven. There were many laws on the ship's statute book of course; but so far as I could see, this and one other were the only ones that were rigidly enforced. The captain explained that he enforced this one because his own cabin adjoined the smoking-room, and the smell of tobacco smoke made him sick. I did not see how our smoke could reach him, for the smoking-room and his cabin were on the upper deck, targets for all the winds that blew; and besides there was <b>no</b> <b>crack</b> of communication between them, no opening of any sort in the solid intervening bulkhead. Still, to a delicate stomach even imaginary smoke can convey damage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Grain {{refinement}} is attempted using severe {{plastic deformation}} (SPD) through the severe torsion straining process (STSP) {{which we have}} developed recently. The STSP is a continuous process for grain refinement without requirement of any die. In this study, an AZ 61 Mg alloy was subjected to STSP at a temperature of 573 K with a rotation speed of 10 rpm and a moving speed of 200 mm/min. With this process, an initial grain size of ~ 20 µm was reduced to ~ 2 ~ 3 µm. Room temperature compression tests revealed that there were <b>no</b> <b>cracks</b> after 15 % of compression for the STSP sample whereas fracture occurred for a conventionally extruded sample. For compression tests at 473 K, <b>no</b> <b>cracks</b> occurred in the STSP samples after 80 % compression but compression was feasible without cracking only up to 20 % for an extruded sample. It is shown that the STSP can be useful for grain refinement and ductility improvement of the AZ 61 Mg alloy...|$|R
60|$|Lyon found Sir David Ashmore {{a capital}} subject {{and a very}} {{comfortable}} sitter into the bargain. Moreover {{he was a very}} agreeable old man, tremendously puckered but not in the least dim; and he wore exactly the furred dressing-gown that Lyon would have chosen. He was proud of his age but ashamed of his infirmities, which however he greatly exaggerated and which did not prevent him from sitting there as submissive as if portraiture in oils had been a branch of surgery. He demolished the legend of his having feared the operation would be fatal, giving an explanation which pleased our friend much better. He held that a gentleman should be painted but once in his life--that it was eager and fatuous to be hung up all over the place. That was good for women, who made a pretty wall-pattern; but the male face didn't lend itself to decorative repetition. The proper time for the likeness was at the last, when the whole man was there--you got the totality of his experience. Lyon could not reply that that period was not a real compendium--you had to allow so for leakage; for there had been <b>no</b> <b>crack</b> in Sir David's crystallisation. He spoke of his portrait as a plain map of the country, to be consulted by his children in a case of uncertainty. A proper map could be drawn up only when the country had been travelled. He gave Lyon his mornings, till luncheon, and they talked of many things, not neglecting, as a stimulus to gossip, the people in the house. Now that he did not 'go out,' as he said, he saw much less of the visitors at Stayes: people came and went whom he knew nothing about, and he liked to hear Lyon describe them. The artist sketched with a fine point and did not caricature, and it usually befell that when Sir David did not know the sons and daughters he had known the fathers and mothers. He was one of those terrible old gentlemen who are a repository of antecedents. But {{in the case of the}} Capadose family, at whom they arrived by an easy stage, his knowledge embraced two, or even three, generations. General Capadose was an old crony, and he remembered his father before him. The general was rather a smart soldier, but in private life of too speculative a turn--always sneaking into the City to put his money into some rotten thing. He married a girl who brought him something and they had half a dozen children. He scarcely knew what had become of the rest of them, except that one was in the Church and had found preferment--wasn't he Dean of Rockingham? Clement, the fellow who was at Stayes, had some military talent; he had served in the East, he had married a pretty girl. He had been at Eton with his son, and he used to come to Stayes in his holidays. Lately, coming back to England, he had turned up with his wife again; that was before he--the old man--had been put to grass. He was a taking dog, but he had a monstrous foible.|$|E
