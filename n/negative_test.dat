5|$|After the lackluster {{critical}} and commercial {{response to the}} first film, series creator Gene Roddenberry was {{forced out of the}} sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed its final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and this theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy had not intended to have a role in the sequel, but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. <b>Negative</b> <b>test</b> audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production team used various cost-cutting techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniature models from past projects and reusing sets, effects footage, and costumes from the first film. Among the film's technical achievements is being the first feature film to contain a sequence created entirely with computer-generated graphics.|$|E
5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a <b>negative</b> <b>test</b> screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E

At the Bislett Games on 28 June, he broke Lasse Virén's Finnish record in 5000 metres and {{finished}} second after Fernando Mamede with the result 13:16.02. In July, he competed only three times; first two times in the Finnish Championships on July 6–8 in Kajaani, where he took the gold medals after solo runs in both 5000 metres (13:24.99) and 10,000 metres (28:06.85), and the third time when improving his 3000 metres record to 7:44.42 in Varkaus on 12 July. According to a Vainio interview in 2004, he took his next injection after the Rotterdam Marathon around 10 July, and was sure that this time period would be long enough to allow metabolism to take its effect and ensure a <b>negative</b> <b>test</b> at the Olympics.|$|E
25|$|A severe ADAMTS13 {{deficiency}} below 5% or <10% of {{the normal}} (depending on the definitions) is highly specific for the diagnosis of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity assays {{are based on the}} direct or indirect measurement of VWF-cleavage products. Its activity should be measured in blood samples taken before therapy has started, to prevent false high ADAMTS13 activity. If a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is present an ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay is needed to distinguish between the acquired, autoantibody-mediated and the congenital form of TTP (USS). The presence of antibodies can be tested by ELISA or functional inhibitor assays. The level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor may be fluctuating over the course of disease and depends on free circulatory antibodies, therefore an onetime <b>negative</b> <b>test</b> result does not always exclude the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors and thereby an autoimmune origin of TTP. A severe ADAMTS13 deficiency {{in the absence of an}} inhibitor, confirmed on a second time point in a healthy episode of a possible USS patient, usually sets the trigger to perform a molecular analysis of the ADAMTS13 gene to confirm a mutation. In unclear cases a plasma infusion trial can be done, showing an USS in the absence of anti-ADAMTS13-antibodies a full recovery of infused plasma-ADAMTS13 activity as well as a plasma half-life of infused ADAMTS13 activity of 2–4 days. A deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity in first-degree relatives is also a very strong indicator for an Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome.|$|E

[...] The constant creation of new drugs, both legal and illicit, forces toxicologists to keep themselves apprised of new research and methods to test for these novel substances. [...] The stream of new formulations means that a <b>negative</b> <b>test</b> result does not necessarily rule out drugs. [...] To avoid detection, illicit drug manufacturers frequently change the chemicals' structure slightly. [...] These compounds are often not detected by routine toxicology tests and can be masked by the presence of a known compound in the same sample. As new compounds are discovered, known spectra are determined and entered into the databases that can be downloaded and used as reference standards. Laboratories also tend to keep in-house databases for the substances they find locally.|$|E

Reading the colors at those time intervals is important because the colors will continue to darken and a later reading will be an incorrect result.

False positives can also occur with contamination of clinical specimens with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Alcaligenes faecalis, which also produce (1→3)β-D-glucan. [...] This test can aid in the detection of Aspergillus, Candida, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. [...] This test cannot be used to detect Mucor or Rhizopus, the fungi responsible for mucormycosis, as they do not produce (1,3)-beta-D-glucan.|$|E

Someone who was raped may be concerned that a prior infection may suggest sexual promiscuity. There may, however, be situations in which testing has the legal purpose, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was part of the crime.

40|$|Background: Dobutamine-atropine stress {{echocardiography}} (DASE) is a {{safe and}} accurate method to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD), and can identify individuals {{at high risk for}} cardiac events such as myocardial infarction and cardiac-related death. the literature is limited regarding the prognostic value of DASE in women. Objective: the objective was to determine the prognostic value of DASE in 300 women with known or suspected CAD. Results: the 300 women underwent DASE and were followed up for 65 months (mean: 27 months). Ninety-five women had positive tests and 205 had <b>negative</b> <b>tests.</b> We demonstrated that women with <b>negative</b> <b>tests</b> had a 94 % hard-event-free survival rate at follow-up (myocardial infarction and death), and in those with positive tests the event-free survival rate was 27 % (P = 0. 0003). the difference between women with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>tests</b> was also significant when minor events and total events were considered. Women with positive tests had 16. 7 times more chance of having events than women with <b>negative</b> <b>tests.</b> Furthermore, women with positive tests but without cardiac events at follow-up (mean of peak WMSI - rest WMSI = 0. 24 0. 16) had less ischemic myocardium than women with positive tests and cardiac events at follow-up (mean of peak WMSI - rest WMSI = 0. 34 +/- 0. 26) (P < 0. 04). Conclusion: Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography has good prognostic value for cardiac events in women. Women with <b>negative</b> <b>tests</b> have low probability for follow-up infarction or death. Women with positive tests and higher severity of induced ischemia have the highest incidence of cardiac events.

40|$|Ruling out disease often {{requires}} expensive or potentially harmful confirmation testing. For such testing, a less invasive triage test is often used. Intuitively, few <b>negative</b> confirmatory <b>tests</b> suggest {{success of this}} approach. However, if <b>negative</b> confirmation <b>tests</b> become too rare, too many disease cases could have been missed. It is therefore important {{to know how many}} <b>negative</b> <b>tests</b> are needed to safely exclude a diagnosis. We quantified this relationship using Bayes' theorem, and applied this to the example of pulmonary embolism (PE), for which triage is done with a Clinical Decision Rule (CDR) and D-dimer testing, and CT-angiography (CTA) is the confirmation test. For a maximum proportion of missed PEs of 1 % in triage-negative patients, we calculate a 67 % 'mandatory minimum' proportion of negative CTA scans. To achieve this, the proportion of patients with PE undergoing triage testing should be appropriately low, in this case no higher than 24 %. Pre-test probability, triage test characteristics, the proportion of <b>negative</b> confirmation <b>tests,</b> and the number of missed diagnoses are mathematically entangled.
