The age limit was raised to enable less favoured candidates to catch up on career advancement, the element in the entrance examination for “general culture” (which had proven advantageous to upper-class applicants) was reduced, students from other grandes ecoles were prevented from making claims that they were already civil servants when they applied to the <b>National</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Administration,</b> and a rule of parity between students and lower civil servants among candidates for admission to the ENA was established. In addition, a law of January 1983 introduced a third route of access to the <b>National</b> <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Administration,</b> reserved for those who had held important posts in mutual aid societies, voluntary associations, and trade unions for a period of at least eight years, and extended this opportunity to certain local elected officials.|$|E
