40|$|<b>Nutritional</b> <b>anaemia,</b> due chiefly to iron deficiency, {{is widely}} {{prevalent}} {{in many parts}} of the world. There is increasing evidence that even mild anaemia affects health and reduces productivity and that a high prevalence of anaemia has profound socioeconomic consequences. The pathogenesis of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> is now reasonably well understood. Measures avilable for combating it include: therapeutic supplementation for accessible population groups with a high prevalence of anaemia, such as pregnant women and schoolchildren; iron fortification of one or more widely consumed foodstuffs; management of those conditions, such as hookworm infestation, that increase requirements for haemopoietic nutrients; and education of the public, and of all categories of health personnel, regarding the importance of anaemia and the ways of controlling it. Experience has shown that there is no simple solution to the problem and in each area where iron deficiency anaemia is prevalent it will probably be necessary to develop and combine many or all of these measures. In each community it will be necessary to introduce these measures so that their effectiveness can first be studied in a pilot trial. When this has been successfully completed it should be followed by a field trial under realistic conditions, and only when this has proved successful should a regional or national programme be introduced. However, the problem is complex and it is only by sustained effort of all concerned that it will prove possible to develop adequate public health control of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Aim: {{to study}} the {{nutritional}} status of elderly Chinese vegetarians. Subjects and method: dietary intake (using the 24 -h recall method), anthropometric indices and some nutritional laboratory parameters were studied in 131 elderly Chinese vegetarian women {{with a mean age}} of 81 years. Data from age- and sex-matched omnivore subjects from previous elderly surveys were used for comparison. Results: total energy, fat and protein calorie, thiamine, riboflavin and niacin intakes were lower in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians, while carbohydrate calorie, calcium, potassium, retinol equivalent and ascorbic acid intakes were higher. The 25 th, 50 th and 75 th percentile for total body fat were lower and those for corrected arm muscle area were higher in vegetarians. Both urinary Na/Cr and K/Cr ratios were higher but the Na/K ratio was similar to that in non-vegetarians, as were mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Serum total cholesterol was lower, while serum triglyceride concentration was similar. The mean haemoglobin level was lower in vegetarians, the prevalence of anaemia being 30 %, with deficiencies in BI 2 and/or iron accounting for 64 % of the anaemia, compared with only 30 % in non-vegetarians. Serum B 12 concentration below the reference range occurred in 54 % of the vegetarian subjects. Vegetarians also had a lower prevalence of a history of ischaemic heart disease; however, the prevalence of smoking was also lower. Conclusion: while the Chinese vegetarian diet may result in a favourable risk-factor profile for ischaemic heart disease, it is deficient in many B vitamins and gives rise to a high frequency of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemias...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: The {{prevalence}} of anaemia {{has been well}} studied particularly on etiology of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> in children of age group 5 - 10. 9 yr in India. The present study was carried out {{to find out the}} prevalence and etiology of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> among 5 to 10. 9 yr old corporation school children from urban slums. Methods: Urban Delhi slums were divided into four areas and one corporation school from each area was randomly selected. A total of 406 children from 4 each school were randomly selected over a period of one yr and {{prevalence of}} anaemia was estimated. Another subset of 95 anaemic children `admitted to the hospital during the same period were evaluated for the etiology of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Results: Prevalence of anaemia as judged by WHO recommended cut-off values of haemoglobin among these children was 41. 8 per cent. Pure or mixed iron deficiency anaemia was the commonest type of anaemia noted in 68. 42 per cent (65 of 95) children followed by pure or mixed B 12 deficiency noticed in 28. 42 per cent (27 of 95) anaemic children. Of the pure variety, iron deficiency was the commonest cause occurring in 41. 05 per cent (39 of 95) children. Interpretation & conclusion: Childhood anaemia continues to be a significant public health problem in school children aged 5 to 10. 9 yr and iron deficiency either alone or in combination is the commonest nutritional cause of anaemia. Pure or mixed vitamin B 12 deficiency is an important but yet not commonly recognized cause of anaemia among these children...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{the bone marrow}} examination findings and determine the indication for bone marrow examination. Design: A retrospective audit. Setting: Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. Subjects: All bone marrow aspirates done at Aga Khan University for the period comprising February 2003 to February 2006 were retrieved and analysed. Results: A total of 356 patient’s case histories including bone marrow examination results were analysed. Ages of the patients ranged from 18 months to 91 years. Males were 180 (50. 6 %) and females were 176 (49. 4 %). <b>Nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> as a group {{was the most common}} haematological disorder found on bone marrow examination in our patients with megaloblastic anaemia predominating.

Methodology:A retrospective review of all bone marrow aspiration cytology reports of patients referred to Haematology and Blood Transfusion {{department of the}} Jos University Teaching Hospital between January 1 st 2005 and December 31 st 2008 on account of anaemia was carried out. Results: The commonest cause of anaemia was acute leukaem is (n= 45 : 24. 3 %); followed by combined megaloblastic and iron deficiency <b>anaemia</b> (<b>nutritional</b> deficiency <b>anaemia)</b> (n= 34 : 18. 4 %); and bone marrow failure (Aplastic anaemia) (n= 20 : 10. 8 %). Bone marrow aspiration cytology alone failed to identify causes of anaemia in a few patients (n= 6 : 3. 2 %). Conclusion: The study provides a valuable insight into the causes of anaemia in our environment. In contrast to the general opinion that iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia, acute leukaemia {{was found to be}} the commonest cause of anaemia in this environment followed by deficiency of nutritional factors and bone marrow failure. Lack of laboratory facilities has hindered further investigation of causes of anaemia in this environment. More emphasis should be placed on {{identifying and}} managing the specific cause of anaemia rather than the current broad based approach to management.

40|$|Capítulo de libro [...] Universidad de Costa Rica, Instituto de Investigaciones en Salud. 1985 The {{amount of}} new {{knowledge}} accumulated {{in the past}} 15 years about the aetiology, epidemiology, and public significance of diarrhoeal disease is quite remarkable, particularly because such knowledge has challenged orthodox concepts strongly rooted in misconceptions. Until recently, most diarrhoeas {{in the general population}} were regarded as 'food indigestion' and accordingly were given a variety of lay names. Remarkably, even today some medical professionals may refer to certain diarrhoeas as caused by unwholesome food with characteristics incompatible with health. Even though shigellosis, salmonellosis, cholera, giardiasis, amoebiasis, and other specific clinical entities had been characterized satisfactorily, as recently as 10 years ago it was difficult to prove that most outbreaks of diarrhoea in communities were of an infectious origin. In fact, some spoke of 'nutritional diarrhoea' in analogy with <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemias.</b> It is now accepted, however, that most diarrhoeas in the community and in outpatient and emergency hospital services are related to viral, microbial, and parasitic agents, a concept supported by the following considerations: (a) diarrhoeas are prevalent in ecosystems with inadequate environmental sanitation, education, income, and personal hygiene; (b) secondary cases develop in contacts of index cases within intervals compatible with incubation periods, pointing to spread by direct or indirect contact; (c) incidence and severity of diarrhoea decrease with age, and older persons are relatively free of diarrhoea, suggesting the d! [...] relopment of immunity; (d) comprehensive laboratory investigations demonstrate a potential infectious pathogen in about 70 per cent of acute diarrhoea cases (Mats 1983 a). Thus, improvement of personal hygiene and environmental sanitation results in a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal diseases. It is easy to understand the epidemic proportions of diarrhoea in New York City {{at the turn of the}} century, comparable to that of many less developed countries today, when environmental conditions, education, personal hygiene, and income were low, especially among immigrants.

He then speaks of his return to Oxford in 1943, and after passing the final medical examinations of Oxford University, {{the start of his}} career in academic medicine in Leslie Witts' department. In the interview he recalls Leslie Witts, who was the Nuffield Professor of Clinical Medicine, Alexander Gibson and Sir Arthur Hurst. He talks of service in the RAMC and, following the death of his father, a short period in charge of his father's general practice in London. In 1949 he returned to Oxford as a research assistant in the Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, and in 1954 he became director of clinical studies, a position he held for eleven years. There follows a discussion of some of the problems he encountered during this period of growth and development for the Oxford Clinical School, including opposition from Robert Macintosh, the Nuffield Professor of Anaesthetics, who believed that the Nuffield benefaction should be used solely for postgraduate affairs. The discussion then moves to Sir John's research interest in gastroenterology, in particular <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemias</b> and bone diseases caused by malabsorption from the gut, and he mentions that he {{was the first person to}} perform a biopsy by mouth of the mucosal lining of the small intestine. He goes on to speak of his interest in teaching medical students, and then of his involvment in planning the new John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and setting up the new Clinical School in Cambridge. In the final part of the interview Sir John talks about his association with the Royal College of Physicians. He was elected a Fellow of the College in 1959, and in 1960 he was the Goulstonian Lecturer and in 1977 the Lumleian Lecturer. He held various offices of the College, and as the Hans Sloane Fellow from 1985 to 1991 was responsible for arranging hospital training for overseas doctors. The interview concludes with a discussion of the contribution the medical profession in the UK can make to training doctors from other countries, ensuring the training given reflects the needs of a particular country...|$|R
40|$|Sole fed {{commercial}} pellets {{suffers from}} a <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia.</b> The hypotheses tested are: (1) the <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> in sole fed commercial pellets is caused by an iron deficiency; (2) the assumed iron deficiency is due to inadequate absorption of iron; (3) an increase in absorption due to a higher bioavailability of heme or iron chelates will alleviate anaemia in sole and (4) haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin (Hb) are expected to follow the iron absorption patterns. In addition, we estimated the absorption of copper, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum and zinc in order to evaluate possible interaction between available iron sources and the absorption of other divalent minerals. Sole were fed four diets, each with a different iron source: iron sulphate, iron methionate, iron proteinate or heme. Feeding was restricted and equal for all diets. At {{the start of the}} experiment, sole reared on commercial pellets had average values of Hct, Hb and the hepatosomatic index of 12. 5 %, 19. 6 g. l- 1 and 1. 13 %, respectively. The values {{at the end of the}} experiment did not differ from the values at the start and were not affected by the source of iron. The apparent absorption coefficients (AAC) of iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt, chromium and molybdenum, except for copper, were unaffected by the iron sources. Yet, the iron absorption was high for all sources tested. The AAC of copper was 15 – 22 % higher in sole fed the diet with heme. The use of the different iron sources, including heme, did not affect Hct and Hb in anaemic sole. The high absorption of iron and copper in sole fed heme did not affect Hct and Hb, which suggests that the <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> in sole is not an iron nor a copper deficiency anaemia...|$|E

40|$|<b>Nutritional</b> iron-deficiency <b>anaemia</b> (IDA) is {{the most}} common {{disorder}} in the world, affecting more than two billion people. The World Health Organization’s global database on anaemia has estimated a prevalence of 14 % based on a regression-based analysis. Recent data show that the prevalence of IDA in pregnant women in industrialized countries is 17. 4 % while the incidence of IDA in developing countries increases significantly up to 56 %. Although oral iron supplementation is widely used for the treatment of IDA, not all patients respond adequately to oral iron therapy. This is due to several factors including the side effects of oral iron which lead to poor compliance and lack of efficacy. The side effects, predominantly gastrointestinal discomfort, occur in a large cohort of patients taking oral iron preparations. Previously, the use of intravenous iron had been associated with undesirable and sometimes serious side effects and therefore was underutilised. However, in recent years, new type II and III iron complexes have been developed, which offer better compliance and toleration as well as high efficacy with a good safety profile.

40|$|Scientifically, {{this study}} aimed to {{validate}} the potential of ragworm to alleviate anaemia in common sole and to identify the dietary requirements of common sole to alleviate this anaemia. At {{the same time it}} was aimed to explain part of the difference in growth between sole fed a commercial pellet and sole fed ragworm. Practically, this study aimed to develop a diet that achieves similar growth rates in sole as when fed ragworm. Sole fed commercial pellets developed <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Feeding ragworm or mussel alleviates this <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia.</b> It is suggested that the ability of mussel or ragworm (meal) to alleviate anaemia and improve growth in sole can be explained by  heme iron and high B 12 levels. Yet, iron absorption in sole is high and independent of iron source. Still, heme increases the absorption of copper. The high absorption of iron and copper in sole fed heme does not affect the haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin (Hb) levels, which indicates the anaemia in sole is not an iron or a copper deficiency anaemia. The Hct and Hb levels in sole are affected by dietary B 12. Yet, the applied levels are unable to alleviate the anaemia in sole induced by feeding commercial pellets. More options to alleviate the <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> in common sole are discussed. Nutrients as vitamin C, B 1, B 2, B 5 and a possible role of dietary EPO are discussed. It is suggested that the slow growth of pellet-fed sole might be due to the low Hct and Hb levels, which hampers the uptake of oxygen, and thus also the overall metabolic capacity, including the scope for growth. Discussed is a 7 °C difference in the “optimal” temperature between sole fed ragworm and the 2 nd generation pellet and that the “worm effect” is dependent on temperature. However, the growth rate of sole fed the 3 rd generation pellet at 18. 4 °C was comparable to the growth rate of sole fed ragworm, which could not have been the consequence of increasing Hct and Hb levels as these were comparable to levels found in sole fed commercial pellets. Yet, B 12 levels in blood plasma of sole are up to 200 times those of other (fish) species. Hence, we inferred on the possibility of a specific metabolic function of B 12 in respiration in sole. In addition, the economic and practical impact of the improved growth rate in sole culture is discussed. Finally, several suggestions for future research are given...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The study {{explores the}} {{association}} between the household environment and the prevalence of anaemia among {{children under the age}} of five years in India. Data and methodology: The study is based on 52, 868 {{children under the age of}} five years, included in India’s National Family Health Survey- 3. The outcome variable was the prevalence of anaemia. To understand the role of environment in determining child anaemia, step wise logistic regression models consisting of environmental, child, socio-economic and media exposure variables were applied. Results: The occurrence of childhood anaemia was higher in the North Eastern and Eastern regions compared to all other regions of India. Unclean fuel use, poor toilet facilities, staying in non-concrete house, exposure to smoking were important variables determining the prevalence of anaemia. Smoking when it was controlled with only socio economic factors showed lesser impact on anaemia but when it got adjusted with socio-economic, child and media variables together it showed an important impact as it increased the risk of anaemia. Conclusion: Children under five years of age generally stay inside their house and are more exposed to the household environment. Thus, among these children there are multiple risk factors causing anaemia along with the nutritional deficiencies. Better resources are needed to educate the public and to increase awareness for improved hygiene, sanitation and housing facilities, health and nutrition etc. Along with a wider programme to manage <b>nutritional</b> deficiency <b>anaemia</b> in children less than five years, there should be a holistic approach towards anaemia control inculcating household environmental conditions and socio economic determinants...|$|R
40|$|Background. There is {{a paucity}} of data {{pertaining}} to the epidemiology and public health impact of Enterobius vermicularis and Strongyloides stercoralis infections.

MethodsA total of 1, 033 children were included in a cross-sectional study implemented in the Bagamoyo district in 2011 / 2012. Faecal samples were examined for intestinal helminth infections using a broad set of quality controlled methods. Finger-prick blood samples were subjected to filariasis and Plasmodium parasitaemia testing and full blood cell count examination. Weight, length/height, and/or mid-upper arm circumference were measured and the nutritional status determined in accordance with age. Results E. vermicularis infections were found in 4. 2 % of infants, 16. 7 %, of PSAC, and 26. 3 % of SAC. S. stercoralis infections were detected in 5. 8 %, 7. 5 %, and 7. 1 % of infants, PSAC, and SAC, respectively. Multivariable regression analyses revealed higher odds of enterobiasis in children of all age-groups with a reported anthelminthic treatment history over the past six months (odds ratio (OR) : 2. 15; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 22 - 3. 79) and in SAC with a higher temperature (OR: 2. 21; CI: 1. 13 - 4. 33). Strongyloidiasis was associated with eosinophilia (OR: 2. 04; CI: 1. 20 - 3. 48) and with Trichuris trichiura infections (OR: 4. 13; CI: 1. 04 - 16. 52) in children of all age-groups, and with asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitaemia (OR: 13. 03; CI: 1. 34 - 127. 23) in infants.

Methodology: The study was a descriptive hospital based, cross-sectional study, involving 156 patients aged 60 years and above that were admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital between December 2015 and February 2016. A structured questionnaire was used to get information on the socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, symptoms and signs of anaemia, presence of co morbid conditions, general information on their nutritional habits as well as drinking and smoking habits. Blood samples were drawn for a complete blood count, peripheral smear, serum cobalamin, serum ferritin and serum folate assays. The student t-test for independent sample means and chi-squared test were used to study association of numerical and categorical variables (respectively) with anaemia Multinomial regression analysis was done to study the association between various factors and the different categories of anaemia (mild, moderate and severe). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between different variables and anaemia. Results: A total of 156 elderly hospitalised patients were enrolled. Prevalence of anaemia was 79. 5 %, with moderate anaemia having the highest frequency of 48. 4 %, followed by severe anaemia at 28. 2 % and mild anaemia at 23. 4 %. Fatigue was the most common symptom suggestive of anaemia occurring with a frequency of 58. 1 %. No symptoms suggestive of anaemia were reported in 27 % of the anaemic participants and among those participants who were reported to have severe anaemia, 14 % had no symptoms suggestive of anaemia. Pallor was present in 72 % of anaemic participants. Anaemia was found to be associated with a high blood pressure and skipping meals [OR= 4. 98 (1. 86 – 13. 37), p = 0. 001 and OR= 3. 55 (1, 16 – 110. 82), p = 0. 026]. <b>Nutritional</b> deficiency <b>anaemia</b> accounted for 35 % of the anaemia in our elderly population, with the leading cause being iron deficiency anaemia (25 %). Combined deficiency anaemia was found in 4. 8 % of the anaemic participants. Conclusion: The prevalence of anaemia in the elderly is high with a significant proportion presenting with no symptoms suggestive of anaemia. Clinicians should therefore consider screening all elderly people diagnosed to have hypertension or those who are admitted to hospital for anaemia. With a significant proportion of anaemia in the elderly being attributed to <b>nutritional</b> deficiency <b>anaemia,</b> programs that promote health education to the elderly population and their caregivers on adequate meal habits and dietary requirements need to be provided to protect them from nutritional deficiencies that may cause anaemia. Larger epidemiological studies need to be done on anaemia in the elderly to ascertain causes of anaemia and verify the results from this study...|$|R
40|$|Frequent {{haemodialysis}} (HD) regimens {{have been}} proposed with the aim to improve survival and other important patient outcomes. They indeed avoid the long interdialytic interval and {{have been associated with}} some proven benefits, i. e. an improvement in blood pressure and phosphataemia control, a reduction in left ventricular mass and lower ultrafiltration rates. However, the actual impact of frequent HD regimens on survival is, at best, inconclusive and, at worse, harmful, and remains uncertain regarding <b>nutritional</b> status and <b>anaemia</b> control. Moreover, the higher rates of vascular access complications and more rapid development of anuria with frequent HD regimens are worrying. Frequent HD also considerably increases the burden for patients and their caregivers, logistics and costs, especially with in-centre frequent schedules. In our opinion, before increasing HD frequency, a number of underused strategies summarized in our review and able to improve patient tolerance and/or HD dose should be tested first, taking into account patient's characteristics and life expectancy. Frequent HD schedules should be reserved for selected cases, only after all other available options have failed...|$|R
40|$|Severe anaemia is {{a common}} {{presentation}} in non-pregnant adults admitted to hospital in southern Africa. Standard syndromic treatment {{based on data from}} the pre-HIV era is for iron deficiency, worms and malaria. We prospectively investigated 105 adults admitted consecutively to medical wards with haemoglobin < 7 g/dl. Those with acute blood loss were excluded. Patients were investigated for possible parasitic, bacterial, mycobacterial and <b>nutritional</b> causes of <b>anaemia,</b> including bone marrow aspiration, to identify potentially treatable causes. Seventy-nine per cent of patients were HIV-positive. One-third of patients had tuberculosis, which was diagnosed only by bone marrow culture in 8 % of HIV-positive patients. In 21 % of individuals bacteria were cultured, with non-typhi salmonella predominating and Streptococcus pneumoniae rare. Iron deficiency, hookworm infection and malaria were not common in HIV-positive anaemic adults, although heavy hookworm infections were found in 6 (27 %) of the 22 HIV-negative anaemic adults. In conclusion, conventional treatment for severe anaemia in adults is not appropriate in an area of high HIV prevalence. Occult mycobacterial disease and bacteraemia are common, but iron deficiency is not common in HIV-positive patients. In addition to iron supplements, management of severe anaemia should include investigation for tuberculosis, and consideration of antibiotics active against enterobacteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the Government's National <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Anaemia</b> Control Programme (NNACP) Program, now a part of RCH, has been limited due to poor supply and {{distribution}} system of iron supplements. In this paper, an attempt {{has been made to}} assess the current supply, procurement and distribution system of IFA tablets from the Lucknow district up to the Sub Centre level, The study revealed that the supply pattern of IFA tablets, which are provided through KIT A. has been grossly erratic at all the levels, Contrary to the RCH guidelines, the grass root level workers are no where involved in demand estimation procedure, which is done by GOI on the basis of fixed population of a sub-centre of 5000. The transportation of these kits to the sub-centre also poses a problem with ANMs'.

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} level of {{haemoglobin}} A 2 in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) including zidovudine with untreated HIV patients. Material and Methods. The study was a case control study. A total of 185 patients {{were included in the}} study; the case group included 125 HIV patients who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) including zidovudine and 60 were in the control group who were not receiving ART. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done and hemoglobin A 2 level was observed; value more than 3. 5 % was considered significant. The Hb A 2 percentages of HIV patients were compared with those of control using an unpaired t-test. Results. The mean of Hb A 2 in case group was 3. 462 % (SD 0. 675) and in control group it was 2. 815 % (SD 0. 246). The higher Hb A 2 value was seen in significant number of treated patients than control group (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion. The clinicians, pathologists, haematologists, and genetic counsellors should be aware of effects of <b>nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> and ART on Hb A 2 to reduce the chances of misdiagnosis of β-thalassaemia especially in developing countries and for centres for antenatal screening...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Pancytopenia {{refers to}} the {{combination}} of anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Causes {{may be due to}} bone marrow failure, bone marrow infiltration, ineffective haematopoiesis or peripheral pooling/ destruction. A bone marrow aspirate is usually required to establish the diagnosis. Aetiologies of pancytopenia vary from one geographical region to other. Aim: Study of pancytopenia in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in north Karnataka. Methods: This study was conducted at SNMC and HSK, Bagalkot. This study was prospective, observational undertaken for 6 -month period between July 2016 -January 2017. History, physical examination, and primary blood investigations were done in all patients. Selected patients were evaluated with bone marrow examination. Materials: A total of 69 human subjects were enrolled. A thorough history, clinical examination and blood investigations were carried out. Results: Dimorphic anaemia is common than megaloblastic anaemia. Among those subjected for bone marrow megaloblastic anaemia was commoner than dual deficiency bone marrow. Other causes of pancytopenia were malaria, dengue, enteric fever, and less common causes included sepsis, MDS, TB, HIV, SLE. Conclusion: <b>Nutritional</b> <b>anaemia</b> is commonest cause for pancytopenia. This may be due to megaloblastic anaemia or deficiency of iron/vitamin B 12 /folate combine...|$|E
40|$|Worm {{infestation}} is a {{major problem}} in children from developing countries due to bad hygienic conditions. It produces <b>nutritional</b> deficiencies and <b>anaemia</b> in children when present in large numbers. The present study deals with the investigation of the frequency of intestinal helminth parasites in children of Kashmir valley in the age group of 4 - 15 years. 312 children were examined for different intestinal helminths in three schools located in rural areas of Kashmir valley. Negative cases were re-examined and if found free of intestinal helminthes were labelled as negative. Of the 312 children examined 222 (71. 15 %) tested positive for various intestinal helminths. The various helminth parasites found include Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Enterobius vermicularis and Taenia saginata. By for the highest frequency of 69. 23 % (216 / 312) was noted for Ascaris lumricoides followed by Trichuris trichiura 30. 76 % (96 / 312), Enterobius vermicularis 7. 69 % (24 / 312) and Taenia saginata 7. 69 % (24 / 312). Single infection was found in 33. 65 % (105 / 312) where as mixed infection was seen in 37. 5 % (117 / 312) children. This study emphasizes the need for improved environmental hygiene i. e. clean water supplies, enhanced sanitation and chemotherapy of all school age children in all the rural areas.

40|$|Among {{the mineral}} {{elements}} required by humans, iron (Fe) {{is the most}} common cause of <b>nutritional</b> deficiencies, particularly <b>anaemia.</b> Legume plants are extremely important in the world's diet and they are major sources of mineral nutrients. However, when these plant foods are grown in calcareous soil, their production is severely affected by Fe deficiency chlorosis (IDC), andwhen less Fe is available for absorption, less amount of this element will be available for accumulation in the edible plant parts. As Fe plays critical roles in photosynthesis and respiration, when lacking this element, plants develop chlorosis and their growth is drastically reduced. IDCmorphological symptoms weremonitored in soybean (Glycinemax), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and themodel crop barrel medic (Medicago truncatula). When compared to the other two legumes, G. max presented lower Fe-reduction rates and severe chlorosis, associated with lower SPAD values. Transcriptome analysiswas performed in roots of the three specieswhen grown in Fe deficiency and Fe sufficiency, and 114, 723 annotated geneswere obtained for all samples. Four IDC-related genes were up-regulated in common by the three species and can be considered key players involved in the IDC response, namely, metal ligands, transferases, zinc ion binding and metal ion binding genes. With regards to the genes most highly expressed under iron deficiency individually by each species, we found that the most highly expressed genes were a defensin in P. vulgaris, a phosphatase in M. truncatula and a zinc ion binding gene in G. max...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} of anaemia as {{a risk factor}} for child and maternal mortality is described. Maternal case fatality rates, mainly from hospital studies vary from 50 %. These large differences in risk were related primarily to differences in available obstetric care for women living in areas with inadequate antenatal and delivery care facilities. The relative risk of mortality associated with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 40 - 80 g/L) was 1. 35 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0. 92 - 2. 00) and for severe anaemia (Hb < 47 g/L) was 3. 51 (95 % CI 2. 05 - 6. 00). Nutritional-related anaemia mortality is likely to be greater than malarial anaemia-related mortality. With good antenatal and obstetric care most anaemia-related deaths are preventable, and policies to reduce anaemia prevalence should not be divorced from efforts to provide adequate antenatal and delivery facilities for women in developing countries. In children, although mortality was increased with anaemia (< 50 g/L), the evidence for increased risk with less severe anaemia was inconclusive. A survival analysis of Malawian infants indicated that if Hb decreased by 10 g/L after 6 months of age, the risk of dying before 12 months of age increased 1. 72 times. Evidence from a number of studies suggests that mortality due to severe malarial anaemia in children is greater than that due to iron-deficiency anaemia. Primary prevention of <b>nutritional</b> and malarial <b>anaemia</b> in young children could lead to reductions in child mortalit...|$|R
