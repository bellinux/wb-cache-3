40|$|The {{loss and}} {{restoration}} of large apex predators can have substantial effects on community structure and dynamics. For example, predator-caused changes in prey movement and habitat use may instigate a behaviorally-mediated trophic cascade (BMTC). In a popularly cited example, wolf (Canis lupus) reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park (YNP) has been hypothesized as a driving {{factor in the}} recovery of riparian vegetation via behavioral modification of elk (Cervus elaphus); however the evidence for a BTMC is inconclusive {{due in part to}} a lack of knowledge regarding the extent that elk actually avoid areas of high wolf predation risk. We used an empirically based (i. e., turning-angle, step-length) conditional <b>logistic</b> regression <b>movement</b> analysis of GPS collared female elk (n = 27) during winter (2000 - 2004) on the Northern Range of YNP to evaluate elk response to a commonly used kernel density estimates and fine-scale integrated measures of wolf predation risk (e. g., elk distribution, wolf distribution, wolf-killed elk locations, environmental factors). We found a non-linear response to predation risk at the population level with elk increasing their use of riskier sites followed by either no relationship or slight avoidance after a predation risk threshold. Furthermore, individuals varied widely in their response to predation risk demonstrating that individual-specific attributes may be highly important in explaining BMTC. Lastly, elk response to predation risk varied across the 24 hour solar cycle as expected when prey are responding to crepuscular wolf hunting activities. This research may explain contradictory findings reported in the literature related to a wolf-induced BMTC in YNP, and thus has implications for the conservation and management of predator and prey; particularly as large predator restoration is increasingly viewed as a tool for ecological recovery...|$|R

METHODS: Data on neck pain, sensory symptoms in the arm, psychosocial and physical risk factors for neck disorders, {{and the range of}} active neck movements were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire, interview, and physical examination for a community-based sample of 2145 adults aged 25 - 64 years. The prevalence of neck pain and sensory symptoms was examined according to the extent of neck <b>movements.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression was used to assess the relation of risk factors to neck disorders, defined by various combinations of pain and restricted movement, and the associations were compared. RESULTS: The ranges of different categories of neck movement were correlated within persons, and their sum ("total neck movement") was unimodally distributed across persons. The prevalence of neck pain and sensory symptoms was elevated when total neck movement was below the 30 th centile, and particularly below the 10 th centile. Associations between neck pain and low vitality and poor support at work were stronger when there was also restricted neck movement, but the extent of neck movement did not materially modify the relation of neck pain to physical risk factors.

40|$|Intraoperative {{assessment}} of surgical margins {{is critical to}} ensuring residual tumor does not remain in a patient. Previously, we developed a fluorescence structured illumination microscope (SIM) system with a single-shot field of view (FOV) of 2. 1 × 1. 6 mm (3. 4 mm 2) and sub-cellular resolution (4. 4 μm). The goal {{of this study was}} to test the utility of this technology for the detection of residual disease in a genetically engineered mouse model of sarcoma. Primary soft tissue sarcomas were generated in the hindlimb and after the tumor was surgically removed, the relevant margin was stained with acridine orange (AO), a vital stain that brightly stains cell nuclei and fibrous tissues. The tissues were imaged with the SIM system with the primary goal of visualizing fluorescent features from tumor nuclei. Given the heterogeneity of the background tissue (presence of adipose tissue and muscle), an algorithm known as maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) was optimized and applied to the images to specifically segment <b>nuclear</b> features. A <b>logistic</b> regression model was used to classify a tissue site as positive or negative by calculating area fraction and shape of the segmented features that were present and the resulting receiver operator curve (ROC) was generated by varying the probability threshold. Based on the ROC curves, the model was able to classify tumor and normal tissue with 77 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity (Youden's index). For an unbiased measure of the model performance, it was applied to a separate validation dataset that resulted in 73 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. When this approach was applied to representative whole margins, for a tumor probability threshold of 50 %, only 1. 2 % of all regions from the negative margin exceeded this threshold, while over 14. 8 % of all regions from the positive margin exceeded this threshold...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy Johannesburg, 2012. A variety of mass movement landforms occur in the southern Drakensberg, South Africa, and whilst {{a number of studies}} on individual landforms have been conducted, regional scale assessments of the Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Transfrontier Park have been relatively limited. Mass movement has been defined as the downward and outward movement of slope-forming material under the influence of a transporting agent such as water, air, ice or snow (Goudie, 2004). This includes landforms such as landslides, debris flows, terracettes, solifluction lobes and rockfall. Although two landslide risk assessments have been conducted in the region, one was site specific and focussed on shallow, translational slides (Bijker, 2001), whilst the other was at a much larger regional scale and focused on large palaeo-mass movements (Singh, 2008). Numerous international mass movement classifications have been developed over the years, and one of the primary aims of this research is to develop a classification for mass movement landforms within a southern African context. A number of mass movement landforms were identified, measured and mapped in the field to acquire {{a better understanding of how}} the landforms originate. This classification was then further adapted to facilitate the identification of mass movement landforms from orthophotos. Aerial photo interpretation techniques were used to map three terrace-type mass movement landforms and four shear-type mass movement landforms in the Garden Castle State Forest of the Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Transfrontier Park. A further level of detail was added to the classification by ascribing environmental conditions to the different landform types. A Geographic Information System was used to collate and generate spatial information which could be added to the landforms in the mass movement inventory. These were then analysed using univariate and multivariate statistical modelling. Histograms, as well as an area-weighted frequency distribution, were used to describe the landforms and then hierarchical partitioning was used to identify the environmental variables associated with each type of landform. One main environmental variable was identified for each type of mass <b>movement.</b> <b>Logistic</b> regression was then used to create probability maps for each type of landform.

40|$|Network {{theory can}} be used to model and {{optimise}} <b>logistic</b> systems. The <b>movement</b> of goods is a major issue in our society and there is a large potential for increased efficiency in the transportation systems. Terminals and their equivalents are important in logistic systems. This is especially obvious when it comes to sea transport. The role of a port terminal is to collect goods on the landside before it can be loaded onto the ships and vice versa. A terminal is needed because of the large difference in the size between the vehicles feeding the ships and the ships themselves. If terminal operations can be improved the efficiency of the whole transportation system will be improved. The focus of this thesis is on {{the development and implementation of}} a tool for modelling port terminal operation. Results from the tool are the impact of infrastructural changes in the terminal and the impact of changing the routing of a cargo and resources through the terminal. Concepts and ideas behind the tool can also be used to model other terminals and transportation systems. The tool is based on networks. In a network the nodes play a very important role, because the flows are routed and rerouted there. All the flow changes in a system are made in the nodes. A modelling tool has to be based on strong theories and concepts. One such theory is combinatorial graph theory. This theory contains methods and algorithms for among other things handling flows on networks. Nodes with complex functionalities are, however, not handled very well by graph theory. There is a need for an extension of graph theory to include complex node functionalities to model logistic systems better. Part of this work is focused on the extension because it is needed for the development of the tool. The three problem areas addressed in the thesis are: The development and implementation of a tool for modelling port terminals based on an extended version of combinatorial graph theory. The extension of combinatorial graph theory to include complex node functionalities. The modelling of data and information associated with transportation. </UL...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the rate of referral to cardiac catheterization in men and women early after nuclear testing {{as a function of}} the magnitude of myocardial ischemia by radionuclide perfusion imaging. Background. Although many previous studies have suggested that gender-related differences are present in the clinical management of coronary artery disease, the presence of such a difference with respect to referral to catheterization after noninvasive testing is disputed. Methods. We examined 3, 211 consecutive patients (1, 074 women, 2, 137 men) who underwent exercise dual-isotope single-photon emission computed tomography and had follow-up evaluation performed at least 1 year after nuclear testing (mean [±sd]follow-up 19 ± 5 months) for “hard” events (cardiac death and myocardial infarction) and referral to cardiac catheterization or revascularization within 60 days of <b>nuclear</b> testing. Multiple <b>logistic</b> regression analysis was performed to determine the best predictors of referral to catheterization as well as to examine whether gender itself added further information to this model. Results. Although men were referred to catheterization more frequently than women (10. 6 % vs. 7. 1 %, p < 0. 001) early after exercise nuclear testing, there were no differences in the rate of referral to catheterization or revascularization after stratification by the amount of abnormally perfused myocardium detected by nuclear scan. Both men and women with normal scan results were infrequently referred to subsequent catheterization. In the setting of severe ischemia, women were referred to catheterization more frequently than men. This higher rate appears to be clinically appropriate because women with severely abnormal scan results had a significantly higher event rate than men (17. 5 % vs. 6. 3 %, p < 0. 0001). This greater risk in women than in men appeared to be underappreciated because the increased rate of hard events in women with severely abnormal scan results was out of proportion to the smaller increase in their rate of referral to cardiac catheterization. Although gender added information to the multivariate model most predictive of referral to catheterization models when nuclear variables were not included, when nuclear variables were considered, the addition of gender added no further significant information. This finding suggests that adjusting for differences in perfusion scan abnormalities by the use of nuclear testing eliminated the apparent gender-related referral bias. Conclusions. After controlling for differences in perfusion scan abnormalities, no gender-related referral bias to catheterization was present. In the setting of severe ischemia, women had a greater rate referral to catheterization than men. As a function of risk, both men and women were appropriately referred to catheterization at a low rate when the scan result was normal. However, because women with severe perfusion abnormalities had a greater rate of cardiac death and myocardial infarction than men, women in this high risk subgroup were underreferred to catheterization relative to men. This finding points to the need to better identify women at high cardiac risk...|$|R
