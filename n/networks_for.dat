5|$|The {{episode was}} first aired in the United States {{on the cable}} {{television}} channel Comedy Central on February 25, 1998. It received a Nielsen rating in the 8.0 range. In Canada, the episode premiered on The Comedy Channel on August 20, 1998, {{it was the last}} of a three-week South Park marathon aired by the network. A little over 300,000 viewers watched the episode, which was a record for the channel, which had only been part of Canada's cable <b>networks</b> <b>for</b> ten months. The complete three-week marathon was watched by an average 186,307 viewers per minute per day.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered on October 23, 2010, as {{the start}} of the Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Halloween {{programming}} block. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.6 million viewers, which made it the second highest performing television movie on all ad-supported cable television <b>networks</b> <b>for</b> the night. Critical response to Growing the Big One was largely positive; some critics praised the story and Doherty's performance, while others were more critical of the chemistry between the two lead actors. It was released on DVD three days following the film's premiere.|$|E

5|$|The game's open world {{setting was}} {{modelled}} on Los Angeles {{and other areas}} of Southern California. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled to increase its draw distance render capabilities. Key team members conducted field trips around Southern California to gather research and footage, and Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used to help design the city's road <b>networks.</b> <b>For</b> {{the first time in}} the series, players control three protagonists throughout the single-player mode. The team found the multiple protagonist design an intrinsic change to the gameplay and narrative devices. They refined the shooting and driving mechanics and tightened the narrative's pacing and scope.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation <b>networks</b> <b>for</b> loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different <b>networks</b> <b>for</b> the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E
