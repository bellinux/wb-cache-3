40|$|Although neuropsychological {{localization}} {{constitutes the}} principal {{approach to the}} study of language disorders, there is reason to think it may not be entirely correct.

40|$|Many {{kinds of}} {{research}} in the neurological field have been done over a hundred years, but there are still unknown mechanisms or phenomena about the functions of nerve cells. Nerve cells are known as electrically excitable cells, so nerve signals can be recorded by electrical devices.

The PDMS substrate has a cylindrical groove on the center of the top surface for placement of a nerve cell root, and the Gold electrode array is fabricated across the groove. To deposit Gold electrodes on the curved surface of PDMS, we applied UV-induced graft polymerization and Electroless plating techniques. The sheet resistance of the deposited Gold electrodes were evaluated to show they have enough conductivity to use for nerve cell experiments...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The authors {{examined}} HIV-positive {{subjects to}} determine the relationship of patient complaints ofcognitive and motor dysfunction to psychiatric status and performance on established cognitive and motor function tests. Method: HIV-positive volunteers (N = 77) were evaluated at entry into a longitudinal <b>neurological</b> <b>study.</b> Forty were asymptomatic, 29 had AIDS-related complex, and eight had AIDS. The subjects were not selected for {{the presence or absence}} of cognitive or motor complaints. Complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction were assessed with items from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Macro Neuro-logic Exam. Current depression and anxiety were assessed with the Profile of Mood States. Psychiatric status was assessed with the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, a structured interview that provides DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses. Actual cognitive and motor perfor-mance was measured with standard neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to the effects ofHIV. Results: Cognitive complaints were found in 38 (49 %) ofthe subjects. These complaints were associated with psychiatric symptoms but not with cognitive performance. Motor complaints, found in 12 (16 %) of the subjects, were associated with poorer motor performance but not with psychiatric symptoms. The overall frequency ofpsychiatric diag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} general class of {{quantile}} residual life models, where a specific quantile {{of the residual}} life time, conditional on an individual has survived up to time t, {{is a function of}} certain covariates with their coefficients varying over time. The varying coefficients are assumed to be smooth unspecified functions of t. We propose to estimate the coefficient functions using spline approximation. Incorporating the spline representation directly into a set of unbiased estimating equations, we obtain a one-step estimation procedure, and we show that this leads to a uniformly consistent estimator. To obtain further computational simplification, we propose a two-step estimation approach in which we estimate the coefficients on a series of time points first, and follow this with spline smoothing. We compare the two methods in terms of their asymptotic efficiency and computational complexity. We further develop inference tools to test the significance of the covariate effect on residual life. The finite sample performance of the estimation and testing procedures are further illustrated through numerical experiments. We also apply the methods to a data set from a <b>neurological</b> <b>study.</b> Key words and phrases: Censored data, nonparametric regression, quantile regression, residual life, spline. 1...|$|E

Material and methods: Data have been analyzed in 932 patients with DS. Among them there were 607 women (65 %) and 325 men (35 %). The age of patients with DS varied from 17 to 68 years, in average 44, 5 ± 4, 5 years. All the patients have experienced comprehensive clinical and <b>neurological</b> <b>study,</b> MRI study of brain and spinal cord.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to introduce Sumiko Mikimoto’s piano method, The Correct Piano Technique (2004), which represents a modern approach to piano technique based on physiological and <b>neurological</b> <b>study.</b> The author places Mikimoto’s method within a historical context, and shows how it offers a unique approach to piano playing with its anatomical–based awareness of localized muscle structures. Mikimoto not only describes different hand types, along with their accompanying strengths and weaknesses, but also presents a comprehensive picture {{of the development of}} piano technique through numerous exercises that are arranged incrementally. In addition to her various exercises, Mikimoto patented a finger–board in 1980 that helps the pianist stretch tendons and trains the small muscles of the hand and fingers. The strength of this method lies in its ability to address a broad range of technical challenges faced at many different levels from the beginner up through the advanced level pianist, as well as to help prevent tension–related injury. Broadly speaking, the historical context of piano technique shows a gradually increasing awareness of the body. Since {{the turn of the twentieth}} century and continuin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMotivated by the {{likelihood}} functions of several incomplete categorical data, this article introduces {{a new family}} of distributions, grouped Dirichlet distributions (GDD), which includes the classical Dirichlet distribution (DD) as a special case. First, we develop distribution theory for the GDD in its own right. Second, we use this expanded family as a new tool for statistical analysis of incomplete categorical data. Starting with a GDD with two partitions, we derive its stochastic representation that provides a simple procedure for simulation. Other properties such as mixed moments, mode, marginal and conditional distributions are also derived. The general GDD with more than two partitions is considered in a parallel manner. Three data sets from a case-control study, a leprosy survey, and a <b>neurological</b> <b>study</b> are used to illustrate how the GDD {{can be used as}} a new tool for analyzing incomplete categorical data. Our approach based on GDD has at least two advantages over the commonly used approach based on the DD in both frequentist and conjugate Bayesian inference: (a) in some cases, both the maximum likelihood and Bayes estimates have closed-form expressions in the new approach, but not so when they are based on the commonly-used approach; and (b) even if a closed-form solution is not available, the EM and data augmentation algorithms in the new approach converge much faster than in the commonly-used approach...|$|E
