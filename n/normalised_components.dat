Under quite general hypotheses, the free energy {{is shown to}} be almost upper-semicontinuous: some <b>normalised</b> <b>component</b> of a limit measure will have free energy at least that of the limit of the free energies. From this, we deduce results concerning existence and continuity of equilibrium states (statistical stability).

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} modelling, analysis, design {{and control of}} 4 th -order LCLC {{resonant}} power converters. Both voltage-output and current-output variants, are considered. Key research outcomes are the derivation of new frequency- and time-domain models of the converters, based on <b>normalised</b> <b>component</b> ratios, and including the effects that parasitic elements have on circuit behaviour, and {{a detailed account of}} multi-resonant characteristics; extensions to the use of cyclicmode modelling methods for application to LCLC converters, to provide rapid steady-state analysis, thereby facilitating the use of the derived methodologies as part of an interactive design tool; the formulation of analytical methods to predict the electrical stresses on tank components-an important consideration when designing resonant converters, as they are often higher than for hard-switched converter counterparts; the characterisation of both continuous and discontinuous modes of operation and the boundary conditions that separate them; and a substantial treatment of the modelling, analysis and design of LCLC converters that can provide multiple regulated outputs by the integrated control of both excitation frequency and pulse-width-modulation. The proposed methodologies are employed, for validation purposes, in the realisation of two proof-of concept demonstrator converters. The first, to satisfy the requirements for delivering 65 V (rms) to an electrode-less, SW, fluorescent lamp, to improve energy efficiency and lifetime, and operating at a nominal frequency of 2. 65 MHz, is used to demonstrate capacitively-coupled operation through the lamp tube, thereby mitigating the normally detrimental effects of excitation via the electrodes. The second prototype considers the realization of an LCLC resonant power supply that can provide multiple regulated outputs without the need for post-regulation circuitry. The two outputs of the supply are independently, closed-loop regulated, to provide asymmetrical output voltage distributions, using a combination of frequency- and duty-control. Although, an analysis of the supply shows that the behaviour is extremely complex, due, in particular, to the highly non-linear interaction between the mUltiple outputs and parasitic inductances, and rectifier, an analysis to provide optimum performance characteristics, is proposed. Moreover, a PICIFPGA-based digital controller is developed that allows control of the transient performance of both outputs under start-up and steady-state conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{test the}} CP^N- 1 sigma {{models for the}} Painlevé property. While the {{construction}} of finite action solutions ensures their meromorphicity, the general case requires testing. The test is performed for the equations in the homogeneous variables, with their first <b>component</b> <b>normalised</b> to one. No constraints are imposed on the dimensionality of the model or {{the values of the}} initial exponents. This makes the test nontrivial, as the number of equations and dependent variables are indefinite. A CP^N- 1 system proves to have a (4 N- 5) -parameter family of solutions whose movable singularities are only poles, while the order of the investigated system is 4 N- 4. The remaining degree of freedom, connected with an extra negative resonance, may correspond to a branching movable essential singularity. An example of such a solution is provided.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} face {{recognition}} using profile images {{based on the}} representation of the original and morphological derived profile shapes is presented in this paper. The goal of our approach is to use information from profile outline that bounds the face and the hair. A grey-level profile image is thresholded to produce a binary image, representing the face region. After normalising the area and orientation of this shape using basic morphological operations, dilation and erosion, we simulate hair growth and haircut and produce two new profile silhouettes. From this three profile shapes feature vectors are obtained using distances between outline curve points and shape centroid. After <b>normalising</b> the vector <b>components,</b> the Euclidean distance measure is used for measuring the similarity of the feature vectors derived from different profiles. Experiments were performed on profile images of thirty persons. Experimental results including recognition rates are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the alternating current field measurement (ACFM) technique for high-speed inspection of railway wheels/track is important to ensure the integrity of railway assets. The stress and conditions at the wheel/rail contact patch, severity of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage and changes in microstructure and hardness with tread depth for railway wheels are investigated. This study employs experimental measurement of RCF defects in railway wheels to understand ACFM sensor signal - RCF defect relationships. The influence of sensor frequency and speed, sensor angle relative to crack angle, lift-off distance, crack propagation angle and inter-crack spacing distance are investigated. Low rather than high frequency sensors are better suited at sizing cracks in railway wheels and track. The optimum signal is obtained when the sensor is oriented parallel to the crack angle. The signal is reduced at higher speeds. The maximum change in the <b>normalised</b> Bx signal <b>component</b> of the sensor’s magnetic field is greater for closely spaced cracks (< 5 mm) and thus overestimates the defect. Inter-crack spacing distances of 15 - 20 mm yield estimates for crack pocket depths that are oversized by 20 - 36...|$|R

We confirm previous studies, but now for a larger sample, that a large fraction of galaxies show significant lopsidedness in their stellar disks, measured as the Fourier amplitude of the m= 1 <b>component,</b> <b>normalised</b> to the average or m= 0 component, in the surface density. Late-type galaxies {{are found to be}} more lopsided, while the presence of m= 2 spiral arms and bars is correlated. The m= 1 amplitude is found to be uncorrelated with the tidal forces acting on a galaxy via nearby companions. Numerical simulations are carried out to study the generation of m= 1 via different processes: galaxy tidal encounters, galaxy mergers, and external gas accretion and subsequent star formation. The simulations show that galaxy interactions and mergers can trigger strong lopsidedness, but do not explain several independent statistical properties of observed galaxies. To explain all the observational results, it is required that a large fraction of lopsidedness results from cosmological accretion of gas on galactic disks, which can create strongly lopsided disks when this accretion is asymmetrical enough...|$|R

The kinematical analysis gives a value for the elongation of {{the potential to be}} $sim 10 % $. The mean amplitude of spatial lopsidedness is found to be $sim 0. 14 $ in the inner disc, similar to the field galaxies, and is smaller by a factor of $sim 2 $ compared to the Eridanus group galaxies. It is also shown that the the average value of A$_ 1 $ does not increase with the Hubble type, contrary to what is seen in field galaxies. We argue that the physical origin of lopsidedness in the Ursa Major group of galaxies is tidal interactions, albeit weaker and less frequent than in Eridanus. Thus systematic studies of lopsidedness in groups of galaxies can provide dynamical clues regarding the interactions and evolution of galaxies in a group environment.

40|$|Abstract]: A gas {{chromatograph}} {{is the most}} common method to continuously determine the hydrocarbon dew point of export natural gas. It is used to ascertain the composition of the natural gas mixture which is applied to a thermodynamic equation of state. Due to the inherent design of the process type {{gas chromatograph}} there are limitations to the computation of the gas mixture in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. It was found that process type C 9 + gas chromatographs determine a higher hydrocarbon dew point than actual, because it summates all the chromatogram hydrocarbon peaks within the respective carbon group into the normalised alkane of that carbon group. The reason for this, is that the process type gas chromatograph does not have a method to identify these species between the <b>normalised</b> alkane <b>components</b> in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. Therefore the aim of this project was to research the 'equations of state' used to calculate natural gas hydrocarbon dew point from constituent analysis by Gas Chromatography and to develop a methodology to improve Gas Chromatography hydrocarbon dew point determination. One important characteristic of the gas chromatograph, is that the measurement of carbon fractions greater than pentane, n - C 5, is based on the relationship of component elution time and hydrocarbon boiling point. The International Standard Organistation standard 23874 (ISO 23874, 2007) uses this relationship to calculate the boiling points of unidentified hydrocarbon components by linear interpolation between the normalised alkanes. The limitation of the ISO 23874 standard is that it is only applicable for laboratory analysis type gas chromatographs. In order to exploit the boiling point and hydrocarbon component elution time relationship to identify unknown components using a process gas chromatograph, the author developed his own method and a modified method of the ISO 23874 standard. Trials on export natural gas, using the equation of state software program, GasVLE, a manual chilled mirror instrument and a Daniel 500 C 9 + gas chromatograph proved that the Grygorcewicz method is a valid characterisation method for further research and use in improving the hydrocarbon dew point determination of export natural gas when applied to a process gas chromatograph on a custody transfer station or pipeline...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBiological {{traits are}} {{increasingly}} used for describing ecological functioning of stream benthic assem- blages. Such approaches associate information on species distribution to their biological characteristics (e. g. life history, physiology, dispersal ability) providing a biological trait profile of communities. They may complement structural bioassessment measures using taxonomic composition by providing indirect information on stream ecological functioning, {{with the additional}} advantage of being less constrained by biogeographic differences. A multivariate predictive model, that provides a site-specific list of expected taxa at least disturbed conditions was recently developed for the bioassessment of Portuguese streams. Here, we tested if the inclusion of trait information in the model would also enable the detection of most common anthropogenic disturbances (i. e., organic contamination, hydrological disturbance) and provide diagnostic hints for causal relationships. We used existing information on 11 invertebrate biological traits and their 54 categories to convert the observed and expected taxonomic composition at several test sites into expected and observed trait compositions. The first three axes of a <b>normalised</b> PCA (Principal <b>Components</b> Analysis) performed on disturbance variables accounted for 42. 7 % of explained variability. The proportion of variance in distur- bance explained by {{the three types of}} trait-based metrics (overall observed/expected trait composition, trait-category profile difference and traits profile dissimilarity) ranged between 9 % and 32 %. Our pre- dictions made on the response of observed to expected trait categories for organic contamination were generally confirmed and demonstrated that disturbances resulted in a change in those traits conferring species resilience capacity and sensitivity to oxygen depletion, as well as a shift in the proportion of ani- mals with filter-feeding behaviour. Variations in observed to expected trait-category differences showed that even a small increase in organic contamination led to a significant change in the biological trait profile, as expected. By contrast, only two out of 11 trait category predictions were confirmed for hydro- logical disturbance. Finally, we found that 4 / 11 and 9 / 11 observed to expected trait differences showed a significant deviation with organic contamination and hydrological disturbance, respectively, whereas all 11 observed to expected trait differences responded to overall disturbance. These changes in trait profiles reflect changes in the performance of invertebrate communities to cope with disturbance, which potentially can alter ecosystem functioning (e. g., energy flow or chemical cycling). In conclusion, the integration of biological trait information in an AUSRIVAS type predictive model allowed the detection of a general disturbance gradient and particularly organic contamination, which indicates their value in addition to taxonomic-based assessment...|$|R
