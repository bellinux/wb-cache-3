5|$|According to Teeuw, {{after the}} {{publication}} of Atheis Mihardja immediately became famous. Maier notes that the fame and warm reception to which Atheis was released was influenced not only by the novel's strengths, but also by Mihardja's personality and stature. These qualities were in-line with the nascent government's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> literature, as the most developed of the new national culture, for nation-building; in 1969, Atheis received a literary award from the government of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{built-in}} gyroscope {{allows for}} some image stabilization {{for the camera}} while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including {{being able to take}} its first picture in 1.1seconds and the next half a second later.|$|E

5|$|The {{view has}} been taken that judges may assign meaning to vague {{constitutional}} provisions or statutes {{on the basis of}} their own ideological preferences, hence disregarding Parliament's intention. This criticism arguably does not suggest the need to abandon interpretation by reference to the legislature's intention, but serves to highlight the importance of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the power of interpretation in an appropriate manner.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call. Their buccal cavity is {{enlarged}} and dome-shaped, {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the correct punches.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement {{was expected to}} require lasers {{of a few hundred}} kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a perfume mister arrangement. LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that such an arrangement cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> fuel assemblies that cost pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester makes targets for about $1 million each. It is suggested that NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.|$|E
5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, TouchWave was {{a privately}} held, venture-backed startup company in Palo Alto, California, with future {{entrepreneur}} Oliver Muoto as its marketing director. Co-founded by CEO Bo Larsson, Jeff Snider, David F. Wittenkamp, and Jesper Stroe, TouchWave released its first product, WebSwitch, in 1997. WebSwitch, a Web-based phone switch, provided telephony over IP and targeted small to medium-sized businesses and branch networks of larger organizations. The WebSwitch {{was designed to}} deliver significantly lower costs for communications, ease of management and administration and offered services on a single IP-based network platform. The timing of TouchWave's late 1997 release of its phone switch product matched Level 3's development of its first softswitch, a method to connect calls from one phone line to another without a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> traditional hardware.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiêm back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to give full support. They regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiêm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if the plot failed.|$|E

5|$|Most modern {{smartphones}} {{are capable}} of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using RTSP streaming for the video. Not all of YouTube's videos {{are available on the}} mobile version of the site. Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of Apple products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, H.264, a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including Apple TV, iPod Touch and the iPhone. In July 2010, the mobile version of the site was relaunched based on HTML5, avoiding the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Adobe Flash Player and optimized for use with touch screen controls. The mobile version is also available as an app for the Android platform. In September 2012, YouTube launched its first app for the iPhone, following the decision to drop YouTube as one of the preloaded apps in the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 operating system. According to GlobalWebIndex, YouTube was used by 35% of smartphone users between April and June 2013, making it the third-most used app.|$|E

5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
