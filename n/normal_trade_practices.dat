40|$|Agricultural {{trade between}} Poland and Belgium {{has a long}} history but was never very {{important}} and is rather erratic, though some products are traditionally traded, such as oilseeds, strawberries, alcoholic beverages or horse meat. The collapse of communism gives new opportunities for both partners, through <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> but also thanks to the Interim Agreement signed by Poland and the European Community and thanks to the PHARE programme. However, several obstacles do exist : the Polish unstable economic, legal and political situation, the financial difficulties of the Polish enterprises, the lack of reliability of some partners, the low packaging and marketing quality of the Polish products, problems at the border, [...] . Nevertheless, Polish products have a good intrinsic quality and Poland does not produce some fruits and vegetables, which constitute good reasons to believe in an increase of agricultural trade between Poland and Belgium. This trade can also be enhanced by the creation of a public institution dealing with standardization, quality control and domestic and foreign promotion. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to investigate how the UK’s biggest companies in certain sectors and industries are using countertrade techniques, {{as a method of}} internationalisation. The research uses a case study approach, to enable an in-depth understanding of the current attitudes towards and uses of countertrade. Six companies are studied in detail, representing the defence & aerospace, natural resources, engineering and industrial sectors. The research found such companies rarely use that countertrade, neither as a feature of their <b>normal</b> <b>trading</b> <b>practice</b> nor as a means of internationalisation. The primary reasons for the avoidance of countertrade are the new paradigm of business ethics, the increased visibility of market prices in the internet age and the complexity of arranging deals. Exceptions are firms which supply Governments, especially the defence & aerospace sector. The size and political importance of deals is driving the use of offset, where the value of the primary contract is balanced, either directly or indirectly, by other forms of inward investment managed by the supplier. The pressure on firms to meet offset obligations is driving them to seek more imaginativ...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{used the}} non-competitive input–output table that captures {{processing}} trade to estimate the domestic value added generated by China’s gross exports. We have tried to analyze the effects of three types of trade in China’s exports: processing <b>trade,</b> <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> in goods, and <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> in services. To determine what causes change in the DVA of China’s exports, we used SDA and discussed six main factors: the value added coefficients, the import coefficient, the intermediate inputs, the volume of exports or export scale, the export structure, and the ratio of three types of export (processing <b>trade,</b> <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of goods, and <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of services).|$|R

50|$|One caveat to this {{approach}} is the accountability to Fair <b>Trade</b> <b>practices.</b> Companies pay money to certifying organizations to receive certification, and this money {{is not going to}} the cocoa farmers. On the other hand, a company that says that it is following fair <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> but lacks a fair trade certification may not actually be following fair <b>trade</b> <b>practices.</b> This could lead to a moral hazard of saying the company is implementing Fair <b>Trade</b> <b>practices,</b> charging premium prices, but in actuality, not paying higher wages to farmers.|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} exports in <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of goods were the major {{contributor}} to these DVA increases. Specifically, it contributed 59.5 and 67.0 % in periods of 2002 – 2007 and 2007 – 2010, respectively. As the proportion of processing exports decreased, the contribution of processing exports to DVA of gross exports decreased by 9 %, from 28.8 to 19.1 %. Similarly, {{the proportion of the}} <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of services increased and the contribution of <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> in services to DVA also increased during these two time periods.|$|R

40|$|The 1965 {{legislation}} to curb restrictive <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> {{has been widely}} regarded as weak. By contrast, the <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1974 (Cth) has been considered as providing the platform for a more comprehensive competition policy. This paper argues that the 1965 – 67 and 1971 Acts were more effective than has been commonly recognised in raising awareness {{about the extent of}} restrictive <b>trade</b> <b>practices,</b> discrediting price agreements and laying the foundations for the 1974 Act. The role of Ron Bannerman, the sole Commissioner of <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices,</b> was critical to their success. This paper uses parliamentary debates, Bannerman's published works and an interview with him undertaken in early 2005. ...|$|R

30|$|Theoretically, {{we could}} use the DPN tables {{directly}} to compute the value added in China’s exports. To analyze the impact of processing <b>trade,</b> <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of goods, and <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of services on China’s exported DVA thoroughly, however, we chose to use exports-of-goods data released by China’s General Administration of Customs and services data published by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. We combined these with the export structure of the DPN table to determine the export structure vector of processing <b>trade</b> (E_P), <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> of goods (E_N), and services (E_s), respectively. There are two main reasons. First, in the DPN table, processing trade is composed of trade in goods only and therefore exports are listed separately. But for <b>normal</b> <b>trade,</b> export includes trade in goods and services. In other words, trade in goods and trade in services are combined in the same export column in the DPN table. Secondly, the DPN table does not update data in a timely manner. There are, however, official data adjustments. For these two reasons, China’s export data (including goods processing <b>trade,</b> <b>normal</b> <b>trade</b> in goods, and in services) were sourced from China’s Statistical Yearbook.|$|R
