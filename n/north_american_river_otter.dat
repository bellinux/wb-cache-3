5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal {{was identified as}} a species of otter and has a variety of common names, including <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> northern river otter, common otter and, simply, river otter. Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic river otter, and Prince of Wales otter.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, muskrat, <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} {{growing in the}} {{riparian}} zones along the Rogue River include willows, red alder, white alder, black cottonwood, and Oregon ash.

5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. River otters also currently inhabit coastal regions throughout the United States and Canada. North American river otters also inhabit the forested {{regions of the}} Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the north slope of the Brooks Range.|$|E
5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is {{more social}} than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic social {{group is the}} family, {{consisting}} of an adult female and her progeny. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which {{can be made up}} of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts. River otters are very susceptible {{to the effects of}} environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers. A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population.|$|E
50|$|Land {{and aquatic}} {{inhabitants}} include bobcats, rabbits, foxes, <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters,</b> <b>American</b> alligators, eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon couperi), gopher tortoises and gopher frogs.|$|R

5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
5|$|Like other otters, the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> {{lives in}} a holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern spotted owl {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. Roosevelt elk, American black bear, coyote, cougar, black-tailed deer, <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter,</b> American mink, and North American beaver are among the mammals found in the watershed.|$|E

5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> is {{considered}} a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations {{in many areas of}} the United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E

5|$|<b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> are polygynous. Females {{usually do}} not {{reproduce}} until two years of age, although yearlings produce offspring on occasion. Males are sexually mature at two years of age. The number of corpora lutea increases directly with age.|$|R
50|$|In Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, scat samples showed {{raccoons}} {{to make up}} 28% of the cougar's diet, harbor {{seals and}} blacktail deer 24% each, <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otters</b> 10%, California sea lion 7%, and American mink 4%; the remaining 3% were unidentified.|$|R

The NFSLR also contains rare tropical peripheral fish species, including gobies, sleepers, and pipefish.|$|R
25|$|As well smaller mammals such as Keen's myotis (Myotis keenii), {{northern}} {{flying squirrel}} (Glaucomys sabrinus), fisher (Martes pennanti), ermine (Mustela erminea), <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis), least chipmunk (Tamius minimus) and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) are sighted along with snowshoe hares, and white-tailed {{deer in the}} Boreal Transition ecoregion. Carnivores which prey on these creatures such as lynx and wolves are also located in the area.|$|E
25|$|Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans {{were drawn}} to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver (Castor canadensis), river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and sea otter (Enhydra lutris). This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. The Russians maintained a sealing station in the nearby Farallon Islands from 1812 to 1840, taking 1,200 to 1,500 fur seals annually, though American ships had already exploited the islands. By 1818 the seals diminished rapidly until only about 500 could be taken annually and within the next few years, the fur seal was extirpated from the islands until they began to recolonize the islands in 1996. Although 20th-century naturalists were skeptical that beaver were historically extant in coastal streams or the Bay itself, earlier records show that the California golden beaver (Castor canadensis ssp. subauratus) {{was one of the most}} valued of the animals taken, and apparently was found in great abundance. Thomas McKay reported that in one year the Hudson's Bay Company took 4,000 beaver skins on the shores of San Francisco Bay. Recently, beaver have recolonized the brackish Napa Sonoma Marsh in north San Pablo Bay and its Sonoma Creek and Napa River tributaries. Also recently re-colonizing the Bay and its tributaries, the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>otter</b> (Lontra canadensis) was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, and recently in Corte Madera Creek, and in the south Bay on Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina.|$|E
