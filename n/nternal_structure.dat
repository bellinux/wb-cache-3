40|$|Aerosol {{filtration}} in fibrous filters {{is one of}} {{the principal}} methods of accurate removal of particulate matter from a stream of gas. The classical theory of depth filtration of aerosol particles in fibrous structures {{is based on the assumption}} of existing single fibre efficiency, which may be used to recalculate the overall efficiency of entire filter. Using “classical theory” of filtration one may introduce some errors, leading finally to a discrepancy between theory and experiment. There are several reasons for inappropriate estimation of the single fibre efficiency: i) neglecting of shortrange interactions, ii) separation of inertial and Brownian effects, ii) perfect adhesion of particles to the fibre, iv) assumption of perfect mixing of aerosol particles in the gas stream, v) assumption of negligible effect of the presence of neighbouring fibres and vi) assumption of perpendicular orientation of homogenous fibres in the filtration structure. Generally speaking, “classical theory” of filtration was used for characterization of the steady - state filtration process (filtration in a clean filter, at the beginning of the process) without deeper investigation of the influence of the <b>nternal</b> <b>structure</b> of the filter on its performance. The aim of this review is to outline and discuss the progress of deep-bed filtration modelling from the use of simple empirical correlations to advanced techniques of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Digital Fluid Dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Sand shoals which extend seaward of Georgia estuary entrances are {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} sedimentary processes. Among these the interaction of waves and tidal currents appears to be most important to the sediment budget. As waves approach the shoreline they are refracted and wrap around the shoal margins. Wave crests interfer over the shoal surfaces and result in surges of water toward the shoreline. Waves also commonly "break " at points of interference and create wave bores which travel shoreward and interact with tidal currents. During the ebbing tide, this interaction is of particular importance to the sediment budget of the shoals. Sedi-ment being transported seaward by tidal flow is diverted landward in gyral-paths by wave bores. The resultant "sediment gyres " are "dynamic sediment traps " which cause accumulations of sand in swash platforms. Swash platforms associated with shoals can be recognized by the sand-body geometry and characteristic <b>nternal</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
