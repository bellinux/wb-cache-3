5|$|<b>Neurotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of {{mephedrone}} on serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although {{some studies}} in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve endings in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E
5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol {{suppresses}} {{brain function}} during intoxication; but upon withdrawal rebound effects {{occur in the}} glutamate/NMDA system and with excess glutamate activity glucocorticoid release; due to the repeated intoxication, followed by acute withdrawal, a <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> that damages {{the central nervous system}} develops, leading to persisting impairments in verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities as well as impairment of spatial orientation. Due to developmental processes occurring during adolescence including myelinization and restructuring of the synapses, adolescents are thought to be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|This {{results in}} a loss of {{function}} of the cycle, and {{results in a}}n accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid results in changes of the biochemistry and structure of the astrocytes themselves, resulting in an apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes results in a pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production.|$|E

As the genus possesses relatively strong chelicerae, the bite could leave a scar on hard tissue (such as fingers).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} developmental <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), PBDE 99, PBDE 153, and {{the fully}} brominated PBDE 209, after exposure during the newborn period in rodents. Our environment contains {{vast numbers of}} contaminants, including the flame retardants, PBDEs. The PBDEs are widely found in the environment and are increasing in human milk. Individuals can be exposed to PBDEs during their whole lifetime, and especially during the lactation period. The neonatal period, coinciding with the lactation period, is characterized in many mammalian species by rapid growth {{and development of the}} immature brain. It has been shown that numerous toxicants can induce permanent disorders in brain function when administered to the neonatal mouse during the brain growth spurt (BGS). In mice and rats this period is postnatal, spanning over the first 3 - 4 weeks of life, while in humans, BGS begins during the third trimester of pregnancy and continues throughout {{the first two years of}} life. The present studies identified a defined critical period during BGS in mice when the brain is vulnerable to insults of low doses of PBDEs and that it is the presence of PBDEs or their metabolites in the brain during this critical period that is crucial to evoking <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> The effects observed are permanent altered spontaneous behavior, reduced habituation, deficits in learning and memory, and disturbances in the cholinergic system. These effects worsen with age. The ability of PBDEs to induce <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> does not appear to be gender-, strain- or species-specific, because the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> are induced in rats and male and female mice of different strains. The developmental <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of PBDEs are similar to those observed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and possible interactive effects of PBDEs and other environmental contaminants are therefore of concern...|$|R
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are long-lived toxic organic compounds and are of major concern for human and ecosystem health. Although {{the use of}} most POPs is banned in most countries, some organochlorine pesticides are still being used in several parts of the world. Although environmental levels of some POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have declined, newly emerging POPs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have been increasing considerably. Exposure to POPs {{has been associated with}} a wide spectrum of effects including reproductive, developmental, immunologic, carcinogenic, and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> It is of particular concern that <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of some POPs have been observed in humans at low environmental concentrations. This review focuses on PCBs as a representative chemical class of POPs and discusses the possible mode(s) of action for the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> with emphasis on comparing dose-response and structure-activity relationships (SAR) with other structurally related chemicals. There is sufficient epidemiological and experimental evidence showing that PCB exposure is associated with motor and cognitive deficits in humans and animal models. Although several potential mode(s) of actions were postulated for PCB-induced <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects,</b> changes in neurotransmitter systems, altered intracellular signalling processes, and thyroid hormone imbalance are predominant ones. These three potential mechanisms are discussed in detail in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SAR was conducted on other structurally similar chemicals to see if they have a common mode(s) of action. Relative potency factors for several of these POPs were calculated based on their effects on intracellular signalling processes. This is a comprehensive review comparing molecular effects at the cellular level to the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> seen in the whole animal for environmentally relevant POPs...|$|R

50|$|Recent {{research}} investigating MDMA {{has revealed}} the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> {{of the drug}} on brain serotonin neurons. Long term and potentially permanent changes to serotonergic axons have been noted in animal and primate studies where they were administered doses of MDMA similar to those taken by some human users. MDMA has subsequently been used to investigate the role that serotonin may play in visual orientation processing. Serotonin neurons are thought to reside in the occipital lobe, which {{is an area of}} the brain responsible for visual processing of line orientation, edges, motion and stereoscopic depth perception. Because MDMA is known to affect serotonin and that serotonin is thought to be involved in vision, individuals who take MDMA may exhibit differences in their visual orientation processing.|$|E

40|$|The neuroprotective {{effects of}} {{flavonoids}} will ultimately {{depend on their}} interaction with both neuronal and glial cells. in this study, we show that the potential <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of quercetin are modified by glial cell interactions. Specifically, quercetin is rapidly conjugated to glutathione within glial cells to yield 2 '-glutathionyl-quercetin, which is exported from cells but has significantly reduced neurotoxicity. In addion, quercetin underwent intracellular O-methylation to yield 3 '-O-methyl-quercetin and 4 '-O-methyl-quercetin, although these were not exported from glia {{at the same rate}} as the glutathionyl adduct. The neurotoxic potential of both quercetin and 2 '-glutathionyl-quercetin paralleled their ability to modulate the pro-survival Akt/PKB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways. These data were supported by co-culture investigation, where the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of quercetin were significantly reduced when they were cultured alongside glial cells. We propose that glial cells act to protect neurons against the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of quercetin and that 2 '-glutathionyl-quercetin represents a novel quercetin metabolite.
