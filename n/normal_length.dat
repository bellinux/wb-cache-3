Like regular telomeres, mega-telomeres are made of a repetitive sequence of DNA and associated proteins, and are located on the ends of chromosomes. However, mega-telomeres are substantially longer than regular telomeres, ranging in size from 50 kilobases to several megabases (for comparison, the <b>normal</b> <b>length</b> of vertebrate telomeres is usually between 10 and 20 kilobases).|$|E
25|$|The weapons {{used are}} also in debate. As {{mentioned}} above, some claim Gonnosuke was using a long staff (bo) reinforced with metal rings. Other versions claim he used an exceptionally long wooden sword which was above {{the average length of}} a Japanese sword over four shaku 1 long, (roughly 121cm or 48 inches), instead of the <b>normal</b> <b>length</b> bokuto of around 2.45 Shaku (roughly 74cm or 29 inches). Musashi's weapon of choice is also debated. One version say he was armed with only a half-finished bokuto, which Musashi was actually still carving as the duel began, and used it to overwhelm Gonnosuke without ever using the X-shaped block, instead hitting him lightly on the forehead as to demonstrate his superior stance in battle and emphasizing proper distance to an opponent, or Maai.|$|E
25|$|The {{wedding was}} widely {{broadcast}} on television, internet, and radio, {{in more than}} 180 countries. ITV, BBC, and CNN covered the ceremony and associated events live through the combined pool of footage from the BBC, Sky, and ITN to help cover the overall cost. In North America, which is five to nine hours behind British Summer Time, the wedding occurred during the time usually taken up by network breakfast television programmes, which expanded their <b>normal</b> <b>length</b> to allow for full coverage. NBC's Today began coverage at 4am Eastern Time, and along with MSNBC, partnered with ITV. ABC partnered with BBC, CBS has its own live London affiliates, and Fox and Fox News Channel partnered with their sister network Sky News. The CBC and CTV had live coverage. Cable networks and radio also had live coverage. In Mexico, the wedding aired on Televisa and TV Azteca; all television stations in Mexico carrying the ceremony stayed on the air during the late night hours instead of normally signing off. The ABC also took the BBC feed in Australia, in addition with pay TV channel UKTV. Coverage was also provided on the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. The ABC had planned to produce alternative commentary with The Chaser, but {{in response to these}} plans, the BBC barred the use of its footage for such a purpose, on orders from Clarence House. The royal wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel. In Croatia the wedding was broadcast on Doma TV, while in Serbia the wedding was broadcast on Radio Television of Serbia and B92 Info. Live broadcast in China was done by CCTV News and Phoenix Info News. In Portugal, the wedding was covered by RTP and TVI. The wedding was also widely followed through various cable and local channels in India and Pakistan. In the Philippines, the wedding was broadcast on ABS-CBN, GMA and TV5, with all three networks sending their own reporters at London. In Ireland the wedding was broadcast on RTÉ One and TV3. Marty Whelan and Mary Kennedy provided commentary for RTÉ Television, while TV3 took a live feed of ITV's coverage.|$|E

500|$|The pudendal nerve can be {{compressed}} or stretched, {{resulting in}} temporary or permanent neuropathy. Irreversible nerve injury may occur when nerves are stretched by 12% {{or more of their}} <b>normal</b> <b>length.</b> If the pelvic floor is over-stretched, acutely (e.g. prolonged or difficult childbirth) or chronically (e.g. chronic straining during defecation caused by constipation), the pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch-induced neuropathy. Pudendal nerve entrapment, also known as Alcock canal syndrome, is very rare and is associated with professional cycling. Systemic diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis can damage the pudendal nerve via demyelination or other mechanisms. [...] A pelvic tumor (most notably a large sacrococcygeal teratoma), or surgery to remove the tumor, can also cause permanent damage.|$|E

50|$|Radial {{angulation}} of {{the hand}} enables patients with stiff elbows to reach their mouth for feeding; therefore treatment is contraindicated in cases of extension contracture of the elbow. A risk of centralization is that the procedure may cause injury to the ulnar physis, leading to early epiphyseal arrest of the ulna, and thereby resulting in an even shorter forearm. Sestero et al. reported that ulnar growth after centralization reaches from 48% to 58% of <b>normal</b> ulnar <b>length,</b> while ulnar growth in untreated patients reaches 64% of <b>normal</b> ulnar <b>length.</b> Several reviews note that centralization can only partially correct radial deviation of the wrist and that studies with longterm follow-up show relapse of radial deviation.|$|R

500|$|Viewtiful Joe {{features}} unique gameplay {{elements in}} the form of Joe's [...] "Viewtiful Effects (VFX) Power", which is designed to emulate camera tricks seen in films. VFX Power is used in both battling enemies and solving various puzzles. These three powers are limited by the [...] "VFX Gauge" [...] located {{at the top of the}} screen. Normally, the meter is full, giving the player access to Joe's super powers via his Viewtiful Joe transformation. The meter slowly empties when an ability is in use. Once it depletes, Viewtiful Joe changes to normal Joe, lowering his attack and defense and leaving him temporarily devoid of VFX Power. The VFX Gauge automatically refills over time and can also be manually filled by picking up bottles of [...] "VFX Juice". The first VFX Power is [...] "Slow", which slows time, causing the player's attacks to be more powerful, increasing Joe's reflexes, and allowing him to dodge attacks more easily. The second VFX Power, [...] "Mach Speed", allows Joe to move at a faster speed, creating multiple after-images of him when he unleashes a flurry of attacks on all enemies on the screen. It can additionally cause his attacks to envelop Joe in a temporary heat shield, rendering him immune to flame attacks and setting enemies on fire when struck. The last VFX Power, [...] "Zoom In", causes a camera close-up of Joe, powering up his normal attacks, granting him a set of new attacks, and paralyzing all lesser foes in proximity to him. However, any damage dealt to Joe whilst zoomed in is increased too. Any two VFX Powers can be combined. The VFX Gauge can be extended by collecting a certain number of V-Films present in each stage.

2500|$|Alas this globe only {{lasted a}} little while, {{as it was}} {{replaced}} {{a few months later}} with a variation on the theme. Following the 1962 Pilkington Report that suggested that the third television station be awarded to the BBC, the BBC launched BBC2 on 20 April 1964. In preparation to this, all 'BBC TV' branding had to disappear from the presentation of the soon to be called BBC1. The Globe was made smaller, surrounded by a thich black circle and encompassed in a large white box on a grey background. There was also a slanted BBC logo in the bottom right corner. The lack of on screen branding is unusual, but as this ident began its life on BBC TV and ended on BBC1, the lack is justified. However the lack is also because BBC2 was unseen by many viewers: the new 625 line system meant new equipment had to be purchased and poor coverage meant few could view it. A clock also accompanied this look, with the same design as the globe, but with clock replacing the globe. It had a black background and <b>normal</b> <b>length</b> second hands.|$|E

2500|$|The {{compound}} cis- {{was first}} described by Michele Peyrone in 1845, and {{known for a}} long time as Peyrone's salt. The structure was deduced by Alfred Werner in 1893. In 1965, Barnett Rosenberg, Van Camp et al. of Michigan State University discovered that electrolysis of platinum electrodes generated a soluble platinum complex which inhibited binary fission in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. Although bacterial cell growth continued, cell division was arrested, the bacteria growing as filaments up to 300 times their <b>normal</b> <b>length.</b> [...] The octahedral Pt(IV) complex cis-, but not the trans isomer, was found to be effective at forcing [...] filamentous growth [...] of E. coli cells. The square planar Pt(II) complex, cis- turned out to be even more effective at forcing filamentous growth. This finding led to the observation that cis- was indeed highly effective at regressing the mass of sarcomas in rats. Confirmation of this discovery, and [...] extension of testing to other tumour cell lines launched the medicinal applications of cisplatin. [...] Cisplatin was approved for use in testicular and ovarian cancers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 19 December 1978., and in the UK (and in several other European countries) in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Very {{early in}} the Pacific War, a scheme was {{proposed}} to fit Lightnings with floats {{to allow them to}} make long-range ferry flights. The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E 41-1986 was modified with a tailplane raised some , booms lengthened by two feet and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to <b>normal</b> <b>length</b> but the tail raised [...] All three tail modifications were designed by George H. [...] "Bert" [...] Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough sealift capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.|$|E
