5|$|The 1987 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a below-average season, having fewer named storms {{than in a}} <b>normal</b> <b>year,</b> that resulted in little impact throughout the Atlantic basin; the United States recorded no hurricane-related fatalities, making the 1987 season the fourth to do so since 1976. The season officially began on June 1, 1987 and ended on November 30; however, a pre-season storm, Tropical Depression One, led to the season's starting on May25. Storm activity ended several weeks early; the final storm of the season, Tropical Depression Fourteen, dissipated on November4. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season.|$|E
25|$|When {{the total}} water {{availability}} is below 740 TMC (i.e. distress year), the allocated share of each state is reduced proportionately. Kerala (in Kabini basin) and Karnataka would use their reduced allocations and release rest of water below Billigundulu gauging station {{for use in}} Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

In its verdict, the tribunal allocated 419 TMC of water annually to Tamil Nadu and 270 TMC to Karnataka; 30 TMC of Cauvery river water to Kerala and 7 TMC to Puducherry. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu being the major shareholders, Karnataka was ordered to release 192 TMC of water to Tamil Nadu in a <b>normal</b> <b>year</b> from June to May.|$|E
500|$|On June 15, 2006, Bush signed , {{designating}} {{the waters}} of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a national monument under the 1906 Antiquities Act. Using the Antiquities Act bypassed the <b>normal</b> <b>year</b> of consultations and halted the public input process and came just before the draft environmental impact statement for the proposed Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Marine Sanctuary was to be published. This was the second use by Bush of the Antiquities Act, following the declaration of the African Burial Ground National Monument on Manhattan in February 2006. The legislated process for stakeholder involvement in the planning and management of a marine protected area had already taken five years of effort, but the abrupt establishment of the NWHI as a National Monument, rather than a Sanctuary, provided immediate and more resilient protection. The protection is revocable only by legislation.|$|E

500|$|Well {{before the}} start of the rainfall, much of Arizona had been {{affected}} by a wet winter and subsequent monsoon season leaving the grounds saturated and susceptible to flooding. [...] Moreover, the months of August and September had been very wet months for most of the Southwestern United States. In fact, it had rained almost every other day at many weather stations in Arizona. The remnants of a Pacific hurricane brought rain to much of California and part of Arizona. Then, on September 22, the North American Monsoon became active over the region. This was atypical for late September; by this time, in a <b>normal</b> <b>year</b> the climate is dry. However, in late September1983, surface weather maps exhibited a few unusual features. A thermal low lay over the mouth of the Gulf of California while the tail end of a weak cold front was located atop of the Great Basin. On September28, moisture from the storm began spreading across Mexico and the southwest United States, due to a stalled low pressure area off the coast of California drawing the thunderstorms northeastward. Tropical Storm Octave played a vital role in the disaster by supplying warm, moisture to the region, which collided with cooler air from the subtropics. By October 2, the heaviest rainfall had ended.|$|E

This revealed ecological resilience motivated some farmers to adopt hybrids despite their commercial unattractiveness in <b>normal</b> <b>years.</b> That response {{to climate change}} had a tipping effect. The increase in sales of hybrid seed in 1937 and 1938 financed research at private seed companies that led to new varieties with significantly improved yields in <b>normal</b> <b>years.</b> This development provided the economic incentive for late adopters to follow suit. Because post- 1936 hybrid varieties conferred advantages beyond improved drought resistance, the negative ecological impact of the devastating 1936 drought had the surprising, but beneficial, consequence of moving more farmers to superior corn seed selection. ...|$|R

To begin with, [...] ensures that we take care of the fact that weekdays slide for each year. A <b>normal</b> <b>year</b> has 365 days, but , so 52 full weeks make up one day too little.

And to subtract by 1 is exactly what is required for a <b>normal</b> <b>year</b> – since the weekday slips one day forward we should compensate one day less to arrive at the correct weekday (i.e. Sunday). For a leap year, b becomes 0 and 2b thus is 0 instead of 8—which under mod 7, is another subtraction by 1—i.e., a total subtraction by 2, as the weekdays after the leap day that year slides forward by two days.|$|E

2500|$|On 20 February 2013, {{based on}} the {{directions}} of the Supreme Court, the Indian Government notified the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) on sharing {{the waters of the}} Kaveri system among the basin States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala and Union territory of Puducherry.

Tamil Nadu has to use 10 TMC for minimum environmental flows downstream of Lower Coleroon Anicut and supply 7 TMC to Puducherry out of the 192 TMC water released by Karnataka in a normal water year. Kerala can use 21 TMC from Kabini river basin, 6 TMC from Bhavani river basin and 3 TMC from Pambar river basin in a <b>normal</b> <b>year.</b> Water going waste to sea at Lower Coleroon Anicut in excess of 4 TMC (other than 10 TMC minimum environmental flows) in any water year forms part of utilisable water share of Tamil Nadu. The ambiguity in the verdict is that utilisable water (clauses IV and V) in the basin is allocated among the states but it has not defined how to measure the same.
