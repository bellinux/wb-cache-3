25|$|For this reason, {{many from}} this {{municipality}} {{and others from}} the Sierra Gorda, have migrated out to cities in Mexico and to the United States in order to work. The municipality estimates that about 35% of its population has migrated abroad, equaling about 8 thousand people. Others suggest the numbers are even higher, with an estimate of four people in the United States for each family here. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> how many {{from the state of}} Querétaro have gone to the U.S. to work or the amount which is sent back in remittances each year. However, it is estimated that the Sierra Gorda region receives between 50,000 and 100,000 USD per day or 18.2 million dollars each year. This is larger than the municipal budget of Pinal de Amoles. These remittances have come to overshadow earnings made locally from small shops, livestock and agriculture. In Pinal de Amoles and other areas of the Sierra Gorda, the dollar {{has become part of the}} economy, especially around Christmas when many come back to visit families for the holiday season. This has led to many businesses accepting the dollar as a medium of exchange in many businesses including restaurants and bars. Many families now use it as a regional currency. However, remittance money sent back can vary depending on economic and political factors. As of January 2011, the amount sent back to the Sierra Gorda fell about forty percent. Officials blame the security situation on the US-Mexican border, with many younger people in the US not visiting during the Christmas season.|$|E
2500|$|Two of Clio's sisters, Melpomene (the oldest sister) and Calliope, are jealous that Clio ({{although}} the youngest) is {{the leader}} of the Muses and that Zeus had promised [...] "Xanadu" [...] to Clio, although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what that entails ("Evil Woman"). So they plot to discredit Clio and cause her banishment by tricking her into breaking one of Zeus's rules: a Muse must not fall in love with a mortal, so they will curse [...] "Kira" [...] and Sonny to fall in love.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 28 June 1940, a terror bombing {{rationale}} had been advanced for the A4 (V-2 rocket) being developed {{at a meeting}} between Army Ordnance Chief Emil Leeb and Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht, Walther von Brauchitsch. Following the relative failure of the Baedeker Raids on Britain in 1942, development of both flying bomb and rocket accelerated, with Britain designated as the target. On September 29, 1943, Albert Speer publicly promised retribution against the mass bombing of German cities by a [...] "secret weapon". Then the official 24 June 1944 Reich Propaganda Ministry announcement of the [...] "Vergeltungswaffe 1" [...] guided missile implied there would be another such weapon. After the first operational A-4 launch in September 1944, the rocket was renamed the V-2. (although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> who gave it this name). However, the V-2 operations manual distributed to firing batteries continued to use the A-4 name for the rocket.|$|E

Three days afterwards his body was found floating in St. Margaret's Loch, under St. Anthony's Chapel.

60|$|The bars {{along the}} coast shift with every storm, and in many places there is {{occasionally}} none at all. We ourselves observed {{the effect of a}} single storm with a high tide in the night, in July, 1855. It moved the sand on the beach opposite the light-house to the depth of six feet, and three rods in width as far as we could see north and south, and carried it bodily off <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> where, laying bare in one place a large rock five feet high which was invisible before, and narrowing the beach to that extent. There is usually, as I have said, no bathing on the back-side of the Cape, on account of the undertow, but when we were there last, the sea had, three months before, cast up a bar near this lighthouse, two miles long and ten rods wide, over which the tide did not flow, leaving a narrow cove, then {{a quarter of a mile}} long, between it and the shore, which afforded excellent bathing. This cove had from time to time been closed up as the bar travelled northward, in one instance imprisoning four or five hundred whiting and cod, which died there, and the water as often turned fresh, and finally gave place to sand. This bar, the inhabitants assured us, might be wholly removed, and the water six feet deep there in two or three days.|$|E

They came and went as they pleased. The war, for all practical purposes, was over. Nothing effective opposed them.|$|R

The {{excitement}} extended across the river to the little city of Burlington, and there was danger of the whole history of the colony's getting into the newspapers.
