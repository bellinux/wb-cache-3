This is a seeming violation of Newton's law of cooling but in reality it is due to <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects</b> that influence the freezing process.

25|$|The above effects often {{combine to}} cause <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects</b> within capacitors. For example, {{dielectric}} absorption {{refers to the}} inability of a capacitor that has been charged {{for a long time}} to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called soakage or battery action. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15–25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.|$|E
25|$|Epistasis is the {{phenomenon}} where {{the effect of}} one gene (locus) {{is dependent on the}} presence of one or more 'modifier genes', i.e. the genetic background. Originally the term meant that the phenotypic effect of one gene is masked by a different gene (locus). Thus, epistatic mutations have different effects in combination than individually. It was originally a concept from genetics but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. It arises due to interactions, either between genes, or within them, leading to <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects.</b> Epistasis has a large influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and evolvability of phenotypic traits.|$|E

40|$|Random {{environmental}} influences, such as snow cover, {{are widely}} regarded as an integral feature of caribou population dynamics. We conducted computer simulations to explore the ramifications of such stochastic variability for caribou demography. We devised 4 models with increasing levels of complexity: Model 1, density-independence under different levels of stochasticity and r; Model 2, <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect</b> of snow cover on r; Model 3, <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect</b> of snow cover on r and stochasticity {{as a function of}} population size; and Model 4, <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect</b> of snow cover on r, stochasticity as a funciton of population size, and density-dependence according to the logistic equation. The results of Model 1 indicated that nearly all caribou populations subject only to environmental vagaries experienced either extincition or irruption. Model 2 revealed that <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect</b> of snow cover depressed the realised r as a function of population size. Finally, Model 4 suggested long-term population as previously reported in literature, but with reduced chance of overshooting K under moderate to high environmental variability...|$|R

25|$|The {{above-mentioned}} linearity of Planck's mechanical assumptions, {{not allowing}} for energetic interactions between frequency components, was superseded in 1925 by Heisenberg's original quantum mechanics. In his paper submitted on 29 July 1925, Heisenberg's theory accounted for Bohr's above-mentioned formula of 1913. It admitted non-linear oscillators as models of atomic quantum states, allowing energetic interaction between their own multiple internal discrete Fourier frequency components, on the occasions of emission or absorption of quanta of radiation. The frequency of a quantum of radiation {{was that of}} a definite coupling between internal atomic meta-stable oscillatory quantum states. At that time, Heisenberg knew nothing of matrix algebra, but Max Born read the manuscript of Heisenberg's paper and recognized the matrix character of Heisenberg's theory. Then Born and Jordan published an explicitly matrix theory of quantum mechanics, based on, but in form distinctly different from, Heisenberg's original quantum mechanics; it is the Born and Jordan matrix theory that is today called matrix mechanics. Heisenberg's explanation of the Planck oscillators, as <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects</b> apparent as Fourier modes of transient processes of emission or absorption of radiation, showed why Planck's oscillators, viewed as enduring physical objects such as might be envisaged by classical physics, did not give an adequate explanation of the phenomena.|$|E

2500|$|In {{classical}} optics, {{light is}} {{thought of as}} electromagnetic waves radiating from a source. Often, coherent laser light is thought of as light that is emitted by many such sources that are in phase. Actually, the picture of one photon being in-phase with another is not valid in quantum theory. [...] Laser radiation is produced in a resonant cavity where the resonant frequency of the cavity {{is the same as}} the frequency associated with the atomic electron transitions providing energy flow into the field. [...] As energy in the resonant mode builds up, the probability for stimulated emission, in that mode only, increases. [...] That is a positive feedback loop in which the amplitude in the resonant mode increases exponentially until some <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects</b> limit it. [...] As a counter-example, a light bulb radiates light into a continuum of modes, and there is nothing that selects any one mode over the other. The emission process is highly random in space and time (see thermal light). In a laser, however, light is emitted into a resonant mode, and that mode is highly coherent. Thus, laser light is idealized as a coherent state. (Classically we describe such a state by an electric field oscillating as a stable wave. [...] See Fig.1) ...|$|E
