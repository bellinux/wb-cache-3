This paper evolves around the idea that in a century dominated by mass-media and globalization, translators should be able to promptly respond to the publishers’ requirements and make sure that they have chosen the best option for their future target readers. In Andy Briggs’s novels, the never-ending clash between good and evil acquires almost graphic representations embedded in a rather detailed vocabulary related to war and modern technology. Translating such novels becomes a challenge for those who have to bear in mind that <b>nowadays</b> <b>teenagers</b> all over the world have the possibility to communicate on the internet and are thus accustomed to the kind of language the characters in these novels use...|$|E

The breakthrough of the new communication technologies in our daily lives has lead to new social practices and to less accurate messages {{in terms of the}} displayed linguistic and discoursal features. Spelling and punctuation mistakes, vocabulary and language mistakes, discoursal mistakes have been noticed in the messages transmitted by the <b>nowadays</b> <b>teenagers</b> who are ardent users of various social networks. This is the very reason for which the PR students need to develop written communication skills. In order to fulfill this purpose, we have conceived a written communication guide made up of three chapters.

The profession of the educator is interesting, but also very demanding. <b>Nowadays,</b> <b>teenagers</b> have access {{to all sorts of}} information. They openly discuss random topics and even know their rights very well. This would not be a problem if a family properly performed its function, the function of an educator and a mentor. The teacher's responsibility is to explain the material in an interesting and engaging way, to actively engage students in the educational process, and to properly motivate them. In a secondary school, the material covered in professional training intertwines with the material taught in a classroom and must respond to the latest trends. The teacher's personality is also very important. The interaction between the teacher and his or her student plays a significant role. Novelty and modernity are perceived from one's point of view and are shaped by one's professional and personal development. This represents an innovation in the pedagogic process. The practical section will be developed from a basis of a research project via an anonymous questionnaire and an observation of a teacher at work...|$|E

However, a tweet is limited to 140 characters, which are too short to provide enough information to accurately figure out its tweeter’s stress. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes to leverage details of social interactions between tweeters and their following friends (i. e., time-sensitive comment/response actions under a tweet) to aid stress detection. Experimental results through a real user study show that time sensitivity of comment/response acts {{plays a significant role}} in stress detection, and involving such interaction acts can improve the detection performance by 23. 5 % in F-measure over that without such interactions...|$|R

Lack of opportunities to experience nature may influence their perception of nature. Do they miss the flower-rich grasslands and the meadow birds of the past? Do they miss the variety of plants and water animals in the ditches? If we want to convince young people that it is important to conserve biodiversity we have to find out what kinds of preconceptions, ideas and beliefs they have about environmental issues. Are they worried about deterioration of the environment and loss of nature? A survey was conducted among approximately 400 Dutch schoolchildren (age: 8 – 16 years) in order to test their feelings about deterioration of the environment and the extinction of species. The majority of pupils answered that they regret the extinction of species more or less, especially popular ones. For a minority it does not matter at all. The proportion of pupils who expressed indifference to the pollution of air, water and soil was 7 %, 10 % and 13 %, respectively. Dying of the forest was taken very seriously by approximately 60 % of the pupils; this percentage increased after a slide of a dead forest was shown. A similar result was obtained in respect to the assumed extinction of a common plant species: it was taken more seriously after some information was given. More than half of the pupils predicted a bad future for the Netherlands. However, this pessimistic view can be changed into a more optimistic one by stimulating activities to improve the environment. The fact that most pupils judged their own future positive may indicate that they feel to have some control on the quality of their own life...|$|R

Each group has to participate one by one actively. Firstly, one group begins to ask for another group with one important question: “Who do you need you from our group?” Then second group will discuss who will be chosen for the position that one person needs to take responsibility to cross the opposite side’s chain. Because another team has very strong chain with team members’ hands are connected. If {{he or she can}} cut this chain, that person should take one person from their group to his own group. If he cannot cut the complex connected links by hands, that person should stand and add to opposite side. As a result, the numbers of team-members will be increased by the time. And the game continues to ask from the second group. Then it goes like that situation till the team has at most two people.

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo analisar e problematizar como os adolescentes favorecidos socialmente sÃo subjetivados e constroem discursivamente significados sobre ser adolescente na contemporaneidade. Tomando como referÃncia a articulaÃÃo entre discurso e modos de subjetivaÃÃo em Foucault, buscou-se, por meio de pesquisaâintervenÃÃo, problematizar a constituiÃÃo dos sujeitos adolescentes a partir de como se posicionam no {{interior}} dos discursos (aceitaÃÃoâresistÃnciaânegociaÃÃo) que enredam a(s) adolescÃncia(s) no contexto atual. Levaram-se em consideraÃÃo as transformaÃÃes contemporÃneas, tais como a expansÃo da tecnificaÃÃo e do consumo em massa e a pouca circulaÃÃo na cidade, aspectos que restringem o contato do adolescente socialmente favorecido com os adolescentes de classes populares, bem como os vÃrios discursos sobre adolescÃncia a partir de um lugar de saber e poder. Ou seja, as prÃticas discursivas e nÃo discursivas, segundo Foucault, que estÃo na base da constituiÃÃo dos sujeitos. O locus da pesquisa foi uma escola particular de Fortaleza e a ferramenta teÃrico-metodolÃgica foi o grupo de discussÃo, composto por quinze adolescentes entre 13 e 15 anos, que produziu um vÃdeo intitulado Conhecendo as AdolescÃncias. A anÃlise dos discursos produzidos e veiculados no grupo teve como base os estudos de Foucault. Nessa anÃlise, foi possÃvel perceber que as versÃes que os adolescentes constroem, sobre si e sobre o outro adolescente, sÃo atravessadas por discursos dos campos psicolÃgico, biolÃgico, sociolÃgico, midiÃtico, jurÃdico e, sobretudo, por sua experiÃncia, no que ela tambÃm Ã enredada por tais discursos. Embora nÃo identifiquem quais desses campos estÃo na base de suas prÃprias construÃÃes discursivas, mostram influÃncia daqueles que constroem diferentes significados sobre adolescÃncia, tomando como critÃrio sua condiÃÃo socioeconÃmica. A abertura para as mudanÃas e negociaÃÃes em seus posicionamentos, engendrada no grupo de discussÃo, promoveu deslocamentos discursivos, ampliando as possibilidades de constituiÃÃo subjetiva para estes adolescentes mais favorecidos socialmente. This study {{aimed to}} analyze and problematize how socially favored teenagers are subjectified and construct discursively meanings about being a <b>teenager</b> <b>nowadays.</b> Referring {{to the relationship between}} discourse and forms of subjectivity in Foucault, it was searched, through intervention research, to problematize the constitution of the adolescents from how they place themselves within the discourses (acceptanceâresistanceânegotiation) that entangled the adolescence(s) in the current context. The contemporary transformations were taken into consideration, such as the technification expansion, the mass consumption and the little circulation in the city. These aspects restric the contact of the socially favored teenagers with others from lower classes, as well as the various discourses about adolescence from a place of knowledge and power. In other words, the discursive and non-discursive practices, according to Foucault, which underlie the constitution of the individuals. The locus of the research was a private school in Fortaleza and the theoretical-methodological tool was a discussion group, composed of fifteen adolescents between 13 and 15 years old, who produced a video called Conhecendo as Adolescencias. The analysis of the discourses produced and transmitted in the group was based on the studies of Foucault. In this analysis, it was possible to realize that the versions which adolescents construct about themselves and about the other adolescent are crossed by the psychological, biological, sociological, media and juridical speeches and above all by his experience as it is also entangled by such speeches. Even though, they do not identify which of these fields are the bases of their own discursive constructions, they show influence of those who construct different meanings about adolescence, taking their socioeconomic condition as criterion. The openness for the changes and negotiations in their positions, engendered in the discussion group, promoted discursive displacements, expanding the possibilities of subjective constitution for these adolescents more socially favored...|$|R
