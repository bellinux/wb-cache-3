Northpoint filed its application in a filing window for <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> systems, and claimed that its terrestrial system was entitled to the same rights given to other applications filed in that window, which employed the same frequency range. Pressed by satellite firms uneager {{at the prospect of}} sharing their spectrum with other providers, Congress passed language requiring the FCC to select an independent engineering firm to perform tests that would protect the fact to ensure that MVDDS would not interfere with satellite transmissions. The MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit engineering company that studies engineering issues for the government, was hired by the FCC to make the determination. Since MDS America did not file a proposal to use the spectrum within the time period the FCC specified, their technology was not tested by MITRE.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a software simulator applicable to narrowband land mobile satellite channels, in urban environments.

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{the use of}} {{congestion}} pricing for achieving relative service differentiation in satellite IP networks. The idea is to use {{congestion pricing}} as an effective approach to control traffic rate for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flows, with Explicit Congestion Notification as a congestion feedback mechanism, by taking into account network users ’ willingness-to-pay. With multitude of competing TCP flows, congestion pricing ensures that the higher the user’s willingness-to-pay, the higher the traffic throughput. We implement the congestion pricing approach on the ns- 2 simulator and evaluate its performance on both geostationary and <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> IP networks. Simulation results show that congestion pricing can be adopted as an effective approach for service differentiation in satellite IP networks and achieves fair relative service differentiation. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{provision}} of multimedia services via a <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> system requires advanced traffic engineering procedures. It includes adaptive routing, adaptive forwarding and appropriate signalling. In this study, we evaluate {{the impact of}} different signalling procedures {{on the performance of}} a network. The signalling procedures were used in conjunction with traffic class dependent routing, smoothed link-cost functions and adaptive forwarding alleviates the oscillations in the traffic distribution. The performance of the proposed signalling procedures is evaluated in two different traffic load scenarios. The simulation results are presented in terms of the average packet delay in the network and the average normalized data throughput. The simulation results indicate that the proposed triggered signalling significantly decreases the signalling load, while the network’s performance is not deteriorated in terms of packet delay and data throughput...|$|E
50|$|The Cospas-Sarsat {{system was}} made {{possible}} by Doppler processing. Local unit terminals (LUTs) detecting <b>non-geostationary</b> <b>satellites</b> interpret the Doppler frequency shift heard by LEOSAR and MEOSAR satellites as they pass over a beacon transmitting at a fixed frequency. The interpretation determines both bearing and range. The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the heard frequency, which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the earth. This triangulates the position of the beacon. A faster change in the doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite's orbit. If the beacon is moving toward or away from the satellite track due to the Earth's rotation, it is on one side or other of the satellite's path. Doppler shift is zero at the closest point of approach between the beacon and the orbit.|$|R
