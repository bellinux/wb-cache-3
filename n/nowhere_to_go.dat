The Western Han Dynasty writer Sima Qian in his book Historical Records records the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high granary. As there was <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> Shun grabbed two bamboo hats and leapt off the granary and glided downward to safety.|$|E

5|$|A cold open shows Trey Atwood (Bradley Stryker) and {{his brother}} Ryan {{stealing}} a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay in juvenile hall for the underage Ryan.

When Ryan's mother, Dawn (Daphne Ashbrook), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in Chino, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J. (Ron Del Barrio), expels him from the house. Standing at a payphone with <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> Ryan calls Sandy for help. As Sandy drives Ryan to his house in Newport Beach, the opening credits and the theme tune play—unlike the other episodes, there is no title sequence.|$|E
