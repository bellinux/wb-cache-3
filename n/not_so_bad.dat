500|$|Not all of {{the reviews}} were positive; for example, Roger Sale in The Hudson Review largely criticized the novel, saying, [...] "At times {{it seems that the}} {{commentary}} is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> and the novel awful, but at others Fowles makes the novel almost work and the comments are embarrassingly vulgar." [...] Ultimately, the reviewer concluded that the novel was [...] "stumbling and gauche and much much too long, but curiously attractive too." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved {{reluctant}} to create starring roles for Wong; her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing {{her as a}} leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, notes, [...] "She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't {{know what to do}} with her." [...] She spent the next few years in supporting roles providing [...] "exotic atmosphere", for instance playing a concubine in Tod Browning's Drifting (1923). Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles. Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: [...] "Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and take good parts and be independent when you're climbing." ...|$|E

500|$|While in {{training}} for the Sanitar, Walpole devoted his leisure hours to gaining a reasonable fluency in the Russian language, and to his first full-length work of non-fiction, a literary biography of Joseph Conrad. In the summer of 1915 {{he worked on the}} Austrian-Russian front, assisting at operations in field hospitals and retrieving the dead and wounded from the battlefield. Occasionally he found time to write brief letters home; he told Bennett, [...] "A battle is an amazing mixture of hell and a family picnic – not as frightening as the dentist, but absorbing, sometimes thrilling like football, sometimes dull like church, and sometimes simply physically sickening like bad fish. Burying dead afterwards is worst of all." [...] When disheartened he comforted himself with the thought, [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> as it was at Marlow".|$|E
500|$|Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly said that, unlike Black's {{previous}} song, [...] "My Moment" [...] was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> it's good, and Michelle Woo of OC Weekly described [...] "My Moment" [...] as [...] "a {{lot less}} terrible" [...] than [...] "Friday", making it [...] "less awesome". Many compared the production {{to that of}} [...] "Friday". Mike Hale of The New York Times criticized Black's vocals for being [...] "as heavily processed" [...] as they were previously, but said that the tuning had [...] "been done much more artfully", meaning Black sounded [...] "more like a human being." [...] A reviewer for The Huffington Post said, [...] "if you were hoping for [...] "Friday" [...] part two, this certainly isn't it. Gone is the weird nasal, overly auto-tuned voice that made 'Friday' sound like she was saying 'fried egg.'" [...] Black herself was called [...] "sweet but very self empowered" [...] by Stransky, and Adrian Chen of Gawker called the track [...] "a 'look-at-me-now' love letter" [...] to all [...] haters". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the song in a similar light; for him, Black [...] "does offer a bit of vitriol to those who wrote her off as a one-hit Internet wonder." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were {{in a certain sense}} [...] "on holiday" [...] in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} early stages of her presidential {{campaign}} for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled [...] "Love Her", [...] "Hate Her", while Mother Jones titled its profile of her [...] "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates, while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled [...] "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate". By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh, that [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle." [...] The [...] "bitch" [...] epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics, flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well. Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] and related incidents {{in the run-up to the}} January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events [...] "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." ...|$|E

[...] Napster's founder Sean Parker, portrayed by Timberlake in The Social Network, stated [...] "I don’t think I look {{anything}} like Timberlake, but it's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> being played by a sex symbol." ...|$|E

2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a [...] "Jolly Boys Outing" [...] (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: [...] "See, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> once you're up!"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is also reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems, such as when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, and he replies: [...] "Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion", and when Matthias, the old man who works with the PFJ, dismisses crucifixion as [...] "a doddle" [...] and says being stabbed would be worse. The director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: [...] "Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly." [...] Religious figures later responded by saying that Jones did not seem to understand the meaning of the crucifix symbol or its significance to Christians as a reminder of the suffering and death Christ endured for their sake. The Pythons also argued that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Later in the World War, Papen {{returned}} to the army on active service, first on the Western Front. In 1916 Papen took command of the 2nd Reserve Battalion of the 93rd Regiment of the 4th Guards Infantry Division fighting in Flanders. The Guards units of the Prussian Army had the responsibility of protecting Wilhelm II in peacetime, so a posting to a Guards unit was very prestigious. On 22 August 1916 Papen's battalion took heavy losses while successfully resisting a British attack on the river Somme that earned him praise for his courage under fire from his commanders. Between November 1916–February 1917, Papen's battalion was engaged in almost continuous heavy fighting, where Papen displayed coolness under fire and a certain [...] "reckless courage" [...] as {{he seemed to have}} no fear of death, but other officers criticized him for his tendency to charge into things without thinking matters through. On 11 April 1917, Papen fought at Vimy Ridge, where his battalion was defeated with heavy losses by the Canadian Corps. The Germans had held Vimy Ridge against repeated French attacks in 1915 and British attacks in 1916, and the ridge become a symbol of German power, so its loss in only one day's fighting to the Canadian corps was considered humiliating. In a report after Vimy, Papen's commanding officers praised him for his courage and elan as he resisted the Canadian assault up the heights of Vimy, ordering counter-attack after counter-attack, but criticised him for poor planning and execution of his counterattacks. Papen argued that the defeat was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> as the Canadian Corps were unsuccessful for the previous four weeks in attempting to take Vimy, so its loss in only one day was really not that bad. After Vimy, Papen stated he was tired of commanding infantrymen in defensive battles on the Western Front, and asked for a transfer to the Middle East, where he could fight in offensive battles as a cavalryman, the style of war in which he had been trained, and which suited his personality better. Significantly, Papen's commanding officers were not sorry to lose him, and approved his request to go to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
