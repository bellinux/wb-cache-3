5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the <b>neoconservative</b> {{movement}} in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Reagan coalition" [...] in the Republican Party, {{according}} to independent historian Dr. George H. Nash, originally consisted of five factions: the libertarians, the traditionalists, the anti-communists, <b>neoconservatives,</b> {{and the religious}} right. After Reagan left office the Reagan coalition shattered, with the deepest divisions seen between the libertarians and traditionalists on one side, and the <b>neoconservatives</b> and the religious right on the other. This was most evident as the <b>neoconservatives</b> and the religious right became the dominant force in the Republican Party.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neoconservatives</b> {{differ from}} Paleoconservatives {{in that they}} promote an interventionist foreign policy to promote {{democracy}} and are more moderate on fiscal issues. They were the strongest supporters of the Iraq War. Many 'neocons' were in earlier days identified as liberals or were affiliated with the Democrats. <b>Neoconservatives</b> have been credited with importing into the Republican party a more active international policy. <b>Neoconservatives</b> are willing to act unilaterally when they believe it serves a moral position to do so, such as the spread of democracy.|$|R
5|$|In America, <b>neoconservative</b> {{aspirations}} {{to use the}} United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , comments in The Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a <b>neoconservative</b> view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E
5|$|Tracking Tito's {{family is}} a man known as Brown, a brusque and obstinate lead covert {{operative}} for a shadowy organization of unclear connection to the U.S. government. Of <b>neoconservative</b> orientation, Brown {{appears to have a}} background in law enforcement, but little training in tradecraft. Brown and his team attempt to track the activities of the old man and Tito with the help of Brown's captive Milgrim, whom he has translate the volapuk-encoded Russian used by Tito's family to communicate. Milgrim is addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, and is kept docile and compliant by Brown, who controls his supply of Rize. Brown believes that Tito and the old man are in possession of information that would, if revealed, undermine public confidence in the U.S.'s participation in the Iraq War. In his attempts to capture them and their data, however, Brown is instead fed disinformation through the old man's intricate schemes.|$|E

5000|$|Paleo {{historian}} Thomas Woods elaborated on the divergence in the Conservative movement, and {{the ascent}} of the <b>Neoconservatives,</b> and their distinguishing features from more traditional Conservatives: The Conservative’s traditional {{sympathy for the}} American South and its people and heritage, evident {{in the works of}} such great American Conservatives as Richard M.

They believe in an aggressive U.S. presence practically everywhere, and in the spread of democracy around the world, by force if necessary. ... <b>Neoconservatives</b> tend to want more efficient government agencies; Paleoconservatives want fewer government agencies. <b>Neoconservatives</b> generally admire President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his heavily interventionist New Deal policies. <b>Neoconservatives</b> have not exactly been known for their budget consciousness, and you won't hear them talking about making any serious inroads into the federal apparatus.|$|R
