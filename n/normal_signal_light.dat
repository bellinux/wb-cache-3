40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space. A signal laser is coupled into the cavity and provides two output light channels: the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> through the cavity and the reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> from the cavity. We show that with the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency manifested by the free-space control light, the amplitude and the phase of the intra-cavity <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> can be manipulated by the free-space control laser. We analyze the cavity transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> and the cavity reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> and show that the two output channels of the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> are complementary and the cavity-atom system is a versatile system for studies of alloptical switching and cross-phase modulation at low control intensities...|$|R

Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions. It also provides <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing for certain time periods according to traffic demand.

In <b>light</b> of this, the global quadrature squeezing of the signal mode is independent of the mean photon ener-gy.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{recognizing}} <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> in traeic scenes {{in real time}} has been developed.

This multifilter approach is model-based, and it comprises much of the available knowledge about <b>signaling</b> <b>lights.</b> In addition to color, this includes characteristics like the locations of the lights relative to the vehicle, their size, symmetry, and blinking frequencies. The individual filters, and the way how they cooperate, have been designed {{in such a way that}} the system recognizes active <b>signaling</b> <b>lights</b> reliably, while false alarms are largely avoided. We have implemented the approach on a real-time vision system and tested it both in simulations under approximately real conditions and in real highway scenes by using a robot-car...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a novel receiver {{in visible light}} communication system based on RGB LEDs. It contains three major parts the collimating lens, the spectro-device and the photodetector. The mixed RGB <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> are captured, separated and received by the collimating lens the spectro-device and the photodetector respectively. Through the adjustment of the collimating lens, the receiver can receive enough light even if {{the distance between the}} <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> source and the receiver is changed. The receiver has the advantages of strong mobility and strong ability of receiving <b>signal</b> <b>light.</b> Based on the designed receiver the high-speed visible light communication system using RGB wavelength division multiplexing technology can have better performance...|$|R

5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> (at night). <b>Signal</b> <b>lights,</b> which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|R

In experiments at the University of Karlsruhe we studied the dependency between reaction time and overlap of <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b> We can see, that the total overlap from a yellow turn signal and a red brake signal will increase the reaction time. The increase depends of the ratio between the luminance of the turn indicator signal and the luminance of the brake signal.
