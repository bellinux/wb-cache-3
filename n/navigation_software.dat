25|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a <b>navigation</b> <b>software</b> included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the engine revs to 4,000 rpm.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. A {{navigation}} performance sensitivity study {{with respect to}} the quality variation of sensors and sensor combinations is presented in this thesis. <b>Navigation</b> simulation <b>software</b> capable of using real-time and simulated sensor data is developed in this project. The simulation software is used to simulate different sensor combinations and therefore evaluate the best configuration for each AUV mission. A sensor module is also developed to capture real-time sensor data. The sensor module includes a low-cost 6 -degreeof- freedom inertial measurement module (rate gyroscopes and accelerometers), a three-axes magnetometer and other sensor interfaces. The real-time sensor data are used to test and calibrate the <b>navigation</b> simulation <b>software.</b> Different sensor combinations are evaluated by using the <b>navigation</b> simulation <b>software</b> with simulated sensor data as input. The quality of each sensor is varied by changing its noise characteristics. The performance study, together with the developed simulation tools, simplifies the process of selecting a sensor combination to fulfill a specific navigation accuracy requirement...|$|R
2500|$|Waze (...) , (formerly FreeMap Israel) is a GPS <b>navigation</b> <b>software</b> {{that works}} on {{smartphones}} and tablets with GPS support and provides turn-by-turn navigation information and user-submitted travel times and route details, while downloading location-dependent information over a mobile telephone network. Waze describes its app as a community-driven GPS navigation app, which {{is free to}} download and use. The app was first developed and popularized by Waze Mobile, an Israeli company founded by Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar and Uri Levine, funded by two Israeli venture capital firms, Magma and Vertex, and an early-stage American venture capital firm Bluerun Ventures. Waze Mobile was acquired in 2013 by Google.|$|E
