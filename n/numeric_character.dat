25|$|Note: HTML <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> {{references}} {{can be in}} decimal format (&#DDDD;) or hexadecimal format (&#xHHHH;). For example, &#1813; and &#x0715; (1813 in decimal) both represent U+0715 SYRIAC LETTER DALATH.|$|E
25|$|The Unicode Hebrew block {{extends from}} U+0590 to U+05FF and from U+FB1D to U+FB4F. It {{includes}} letters, ligatures, combining diacritical marks (Niqqud and cantillation marks) and punctuation. The <b>Numeric</b> <b>Character</b> References is included for HTML. These {{can be used}} in many markup languages, and they are often used in Wiki to create the Hebrew glyphs compatible with the majority of web browsers.|$|E
25|$|In XML and XHTML, {{characters}} can {{be expressed}} as hexadecimal <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> references using the notation &#xcode;, where the x denotes that code is a hex code point (of 1- to 6-digits) assigned to the character in the Unicode standard. Thus &#x2019; represents the right single quotation mark (’), Unicode code point number 2019 in hex, 8217 (thus &#8217; in decimal).|$|E
50|$|The {{general format}} of the Monitoring Station Designators was the {{alphabetic}} characters MS followed by one or two <b>numeric</b> <b>characters.</b> Typically the alphabetic <b>characters</b> and <b>numeric</b> <b>character(s)</b> were separated by a dash character.|$|R

25|$|XML (and hence XHTML) defines an &apos; {{character}} {{entity reference}} for the ASCII typewriter apostrophe. No equivalent entity {{is defined in}} the HTML 4 standard, despite all the other predefined character entities from XML being defined in HTML. If it cannot be entered literally in HTML, a <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> reference could be used instead, such as &#x27; or &#39;. &apos; is officially supported in HTML since HTML 5.|$|E
500|$|On July 10, 2008, the {{swastika}} CJK unicode character (...) {{appeared at}} the top of Google's Hot Trends list—a tally of the most popular search terms in the United States—for several hours. It was later reported that the HTML <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> reference for the symbol had been posted on /b/, with a request to perform a Google search for the string. A multitude of /b/ visitors followed the order and pushed the symbol {{to the top of the}} chart, though Google later removed the result.|$|E
2500|$|... &#0; is not permitted, however, {{because the}} null {{character}} {{is one of}} the control characters excluded from XML, even when using a <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> reference. An alternative encoding mechanism such as Base64 is needed to represent such characters.|$|E

2500|$|The BBAN format column {{shows the}} format of the BBAN part of an IBAN in terms of upper case alpha {{characters}} (A–Z) denoted by [...] "a", <b>numeric</b> <b>characters</b> (0–9) denoted by [...] "n" [...] and mixed case alphanumeric characters (a–z, A–Z, 0–9) denoted by [...] "c". For example, the Bulgarian BBAN (4a,6n,8c) consists of 4 alpha characters, followed by 6 <b>numeric</b> <b>characters,</b> then by 8 mixed-case alpha-numeric characters ...|$|R
2500|$|Strings: A {{sequence}} of characters surrounded by quotes {{is equivalent to}} a list of (<b>numeric)</b> <b>character</b> codes, generally in the local character encoding, or Unicode if the system supports Unicode. For example, [...] "to be, or not to be".|$|E
2500|$|Almost any Unicode code point {{can be used}} in the {{character}} data and attribute values of an XML 1.0 or 1.1 document, even if {{the character}} corresponding to the code point is not defined in the current version of Unicode. In character data and attribute values, XML 1.1 allows the use of more control characters than XML 1.0, but, for [...] "robustness", most of the control characters introduced in XML 1.1 must be expressed as <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> references (and #x7F through #x9F, which had been allowed in XML 1.0, are in XML 1.1 even required to be expressed as <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> references). Among the supported control characters in XML 1.1 are two line break codes that must be treated as whitespace. Whitespace characters are the only control codes that can be written directly.|$|E
2500|$|All {{permitted}} Unicode characters may {{be represented}} with a <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> reference. Consider the Chinese character [...] "中", whose numeric code in Unicode is hexadecimal 4E2D, or decimal 20,013. A user whose keyboard offers no method for entering this character could still insert {{it in an}} XML document encoded either as &#20013; or &#x4e2d;. Similarly, the string [...] "I <3 Jörg" [...] could be encoded for inclusion in an XML document as I &lt;3 J&#xF6;rg.|$|E
50|$|Traditional Chinese <b>numeric</b> <b>characters</b> {{are also}} used in Japan and Korea and were used in Vietnam before the 20th century. In {{vertical}} text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese <b>numeric</b> <b>characters</b> {{are also used}} {{in much the same}} formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{sources of}} {{technology}} for XML were the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), which defined {{a profile of}} SGML {{for use as a}} [...] "transfer syntax"; and HTML, in which elements were synchronous with their resource, document character sets were separate from resource encoding, the xml:lang attribute was invented, and (like HTTP) metadata accompanied the resource rather than being needed at the declaration of a link. The ERCS(Extended Reference Concrete Syntax) project of the SPREAD (Standardization Project Regarding East Asian Documents) project of the ISO-related China/Japan/Korea Document Processing expert group was the basis of XML 1.0's naming rules; SPREAD also introduced hexadecimal <b>numeric</b> <b>character</b> references and the concept of references to make available all Unicode characters. To support ERCS, XML and HTML better, the SGML standard IS 8879 was revised in 1996 and 1998 with WebSGML Adaptations. The XML header followed that of ISO HyTime.|$|E
