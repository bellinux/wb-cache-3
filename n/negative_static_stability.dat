5000|$|The YF-16, {{eventually}} {{developed into}} the F-16 Fighting Falcon, was the world’s first aircraft intentionally {{designed to be}} slightly aerodynamically unstable. This technique, called [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] (RSS), was incorporated to further enhance the aircraft’s performance. Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability, which induces an aircraft to return to its original attitude following a disturbance. However, positive static stability, the tendency to remain in its current attitude, opposes the pilot’s efforts to maneuver. On the other hand, an aircraft with <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> will, {{in the absence of}} control input, readily deviate from level and controlled flight.|$|E
50|$|The added {{modifications}} {{increased the}} aircraft gross weight approximately 2000 lb and shifted {{the center of}} gravity 3% MAC aft of the baseline EA-6B. In previous models, when operating at sustained high angles of attack, fuel migration would cause additional shifts in CG with the result that the aircraft had slightly <b>negative</b> longitudinal <b>static</b> <b>stability.</b> Results of flight tests of the new configuration showed greatly improved flying qualities and the rearward shift of the CG had minimal impact.|$|R
40|$|Fuel savings can be {{achieved}} by moving the center of gravity of an aircraft aft which reduces the <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> margin and consequently the trim drag. However, flying qualities of an aircraft with relaxed <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> can be significantly degraded. The flying qualities can be restored by using a pitch active control system (PACS). This report documents the work accomplished during a follow-on program (see NASA CR- 165951 for initial program report) to perform extended flight tests of a near-term PACS. The program included flying qualities analyses, piloted flight simulation tests, aircraft preparation and flight tests to demonstrate that the near-term PACS provided good flying qualities within the linear <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> envelope to a <b>negative</b> 3 % <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> margin...|$|R
5000|$|At low {{angles of}} attack, the lift is {{generated}} {{primarily by the}} wings, fins and the nose region of the body. The total lift acts at a distance [...] ahead of the centre of gravity (it has a negative value in the figure), this, in missile parlance, is the centre of pressure [...] If the lift acts ahead of the centre of gravity, the yawing moment will be negative, and will tend to increase the angle of attack, increasing both the lift and the moment further. It follows that the centre of pressure must lie aft of the centre of gravity for <b>static</b> <b>stability.</b> [...] is the static margin and must be <b>negative</b> for longitudinal <b>static</b> <b>stability.</b> Alternatively, positive angle of attack must generate positive yawing moment on a statically stable missile, i.e. [...] must be positive.

50|$|An {{aircraft}} with <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> {{can therefore}} be made more maneuverable. At supersonic airspeed, a negatively stable aircraft can exhibit positive static stability due to aerodynamic center migration. To counter this tendency to depart from controlled flight—and avoid the need for constant minute trimming inputs by the pilot—the 4th gen aircraft has a quadruplex (four-channel) fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC), which is the key component of the FLCS, accepts the pilot’s input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces {{in such a way}} as to produce the desired result without inducing a loss of control. The FLCC also takes thousands of measurements per second of the aircraft’s attitude, and automatically makes corrections to counter deviations from the flight path that were not input by the pilot. Coordinated turn is also achieved in the same way, processing thousands of instructions per second to synchronize yawing and rolling to minimize sideslip drag in turns.|$|E
40|$|As part of {{the support}} program for the Atmospheric General Circulation Experiment, {{laboratory}} studies of baroclinic and other convective instabilities were performed for {{a thin layer of}} fluid between thermally conducting horizontal discs. There were three types of modes identified. The first has a spiral-arm appearance, and exists for large enough horizontal thermal forcing, weak enough static stability, and large enough rotation. The source of this wave is shown to be the Eady mode of instability. The second mode is due to convective instability in the thermal boundary layers which exist due to the thermally conducting horizontal boundaries. Finally, for strong enough <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability,</b> thermal convection of the Benard type appears. The most significant result is that the symmetric (Solberg) mode was not found, even though the infinite-plane theory predicts this mode under certain experimental conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of relaxed <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> was studied under {{a program to}} determine ways of improving the energy efficiency in current and future transport aircraft. Pitch active control systems (PACs) were developed for application {{in the near term}} to current aircraft and in the next generation to advanced aircrft of the future. Analyses identified potential drag benefits of: (1) 2 % for current transport aircraft with neutral stability; and (2) as much as 17 % for next generation aircraft with high aspect ratio supercritical wings which must operate 10 to 15 % statistically unstable to achieve optimum performance. Flight test evaluations of the near-term PACs were conducted to a 3 % mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> margin on a Lockheed L- 1011 aircraft.

These two pitch active control systems consisted of a simple 'near-term' PACS and a more complex 'advanced' PACS. Eight different flight conditions, representing the entire flight envelope, were evaluated with emphasis on the cruise flight conditions. These studies were made utilizing the Langley Visual/Motion Simulator (VMS) which has six degrees of freedom. The simulation tests indicated that (1) the flying qualities of the baseline aircraft (PACS off) for the cruise and other high-speed flight conditions were unacceptable at center-of-gravity positions aft of the neutral <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> point; (2) within the linear <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> flight envelope, the near-term PACS provided acceptable flying qualities for static stabilty margins to - 3 percent; and (3) with the advanced PACS operative, the flying qualities were demonstrated to be good (satisfactory to very acceptable) for static stabilty margins to - 20 percent...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} PACS {{control law}} {{was developed for}} a commercial wide-body transport (Lockheed L- 1011) by using modern control theory. Validity of the control law was demonstrated by piloted flight simulation tests on the NASA Langley visual motion simulator. The PACS design objective {{was to develop a}} PACS that would provide good flying qualities to negative 10 percent static stability margins that were equivalent to those of the baseline aircraft at a 15 percent static stability margin which is normal for the L- 1011. Also, the PACS was to compensate for high-Mach/high-g instabilities that degrade flying qualities during upset recoveries and maneuvers. The piloted flight simulation tests showed that the PACS met the design objectives. The simulation demonstrated good flying qualities to negative 20 percent static stability margins for hold, cruise and high-speed flight conditions. Analysis and wind tunnel tests performed on other Lockheed programs indicate that the PACS could be used on an advanced transport configuration to provide a 4 percent fuel savings which results from reduced trim drag by flying at <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> margins...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of an advanced pitch active control system (PACS) and a reduced area horizontal tail for a wide-body jet transport (L- 1011) with a flying horizontal stabilizer is discussed. The advanced PACS control law design objectives were to provide satisfactory handling qualities for aft c. g. flight conditions to <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> margins of 10 percent and to provide good maneuver control column force gradients for nonlinear stability flight conditions. Validity of the control laws were demonstrated by piloted flight simulation tests on the NASA Langley Visual Motion Simulator. Satisfactory handling qualities were actually demonstrated to a negative 20 percent static stability margin. The PACS control laws were mechanized to provide the system architecture that would be suitable for an L- 1011 flight test program to a negative stability margin of 3 percent which represents the aft c. g. limits of the aircraft. Reduced area horizontal tail designs of 30 and 38 percent {{with respect to the}} L- 1011 standard tail were designed, fabricated and wind tunnel tested. Drag reductions and weight savings of the 30 percent smaller tail would provide an L/D benefit of about 2 % and the 38 % small tail L/D benefit would be about 3 percent. However, forward c. g. limitations would have to be imposed on the aircraft because the maximum horizontal tail lift goal was not achieved and sufficient aircraft nose-up control authority was not available. This limitation would not be required for a properly designed new aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{large-scale}} dynamics {{as represented by}} the residual mean meridional circulation in the transformed Eulerian sense, in particular its stratospheric part, on lower stratospheric static stability and tropopause structure is studied using a comprehensive chemistry–climate model (CCM), reanalysis data, and simple idealized modeling. Dynamical forcing of static stability as associated with the vertical structure of the residual circulation results in a dominant dipole forcing structure with <b>negative</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> forcing just below the tropopause and positive static stability forcing just above the tropopause. This dipole forcing structure effectively sharpens the tropopause, especially during winter. Furthermore, the strong positive lowermost stratospheric static stability forcing causes a layer of strongly enhanced static stability just above the extratropical tropopause—a tropopause inversion layer (TIL) —especially in the winter midlatitudes. The strong positive static stability forcing is shown to be mainly due to the strong vertical gradient of the vertical residual velocity found just above the tropopause in the winter midlatitudes. Stratospheric radiative equilibrium (SRE) solutions are obtained using offline radiative transfer calcula-tions for a given tropospheric climate as simulated by the CCM. The resulting tropopause height in SRE is reduced by several kilometers in the tropics but is increased by 1 – 2 km in the extratropics, strongly reducing the equator-to-pole contrast in tropopause height. Moreover, the TIL in winter midlatitudes disappears in the SRE solution {{in contrast to the}} polar summer TIL, which stays intact. When the SRE solution is modified to include the effect of stratospheric dynamics as represented by the stratospheric residual circulation, the TIL in winter midlatitudes is recovered, suggesting that the static stability forcing associated with the stratospheric residual circulation represents the main cause for the TIL in the winter midlatitudes whereas radiation seems dominant in causing the polar summer TIL. 1...|$|E

40|$|Water vapor {{directly}} {{affects the}} dynamics of atmospheric eddy circulations through the release of latent heat. But {{it is difficult to}} include latent heat release in dynamical theories because of the associated nonlinearity (precipitation generally occurs where there is upward motion). A new effective <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> is derived that fundamentally captures the effect of latent heat release on moist eddy circulations. It differs from the usual dry <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> by an additive term that depends on temperature and a parameter measuring the up–down asymmetry of vertical velocity statistics. Latent heat release reduces the effective <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> experienced by eddies but cannot reduce it to zero so long as there are nonprecipitating regions of the eddies. Evaluation based on reanalysis data indicates that the effective <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> in the lower troposphere ranges from; 80 % of the dry <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> at high latitudes to; 25 % in the tropics. The effective <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> provides a solution to the longstanding problem of how to adapt dry dynamical theories to the moist circulations in the atmosphere.

In general, the climate state does not depend very much on whether or not this interaction is included, because the poleward eddy heat transport dominates the eddy forcing of mean temperature and wind fields. However, the climatic sensitivity is significantly affected. Compared to two-level model results with fixed <b>static</b> <b>stability,</b> the poleward eddy heat flux is less sensitive to the meridional temperature gradient and the gradient is more sensitive to the forcing. For example, the logarithmic derivative of the eddy flux with respect to the gradient has a slope that is reduced from approximately 15 on a beta-plane with fixed <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> and approximately 6 on a sphere with fixed <b>static</b> <b>stability,</b> to approximately 3 to 4 in the present model.

The determination of the <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> is compared within two models: an idealized moist model with simplified representations of radiative transfer and other physical processes, and a comprehensive GCM with full physics. The GCMs are run over a zonally symmetric, fixed sea surface temperature (SST) aquaplanet surface, with a multitude of SST distributions to study the response of the extratropical <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> over a wide parameter range. In both models, the dry <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> averaged over the midlatitudes increases both with increases in the meridional temperature gradients, and with increases in the mean SST.
