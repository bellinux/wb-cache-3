5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E
25|$|Drivers at intersections with all-way {{stop control}} or traffic signals need the least sight distance. At all-way stops, drivers {{need to be}} able to see {{vehicles}} stopped at other approaches. At signals, drivers approaching the intersections <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> signal heads. In jurisdictions that allow right turn on red, drivers in the right lane stop control need the same sight distance as two-way stop control. Although not needed during normal operations, additional sight distance should be provided for signal malfunctions and power outages.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} Parliamentary hearing, Labour Party, NZ First, Green Party and MƒÅori Party {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} order of the questions and said that the public should first be asked whether they want a change, and continue with a second referendum only if they do, or both questions compacted into one referendum, which could potentially save millions of dollars. David Seymour (ACT's representative in the Cross-Party Group) said that the planned order made sense, as the public would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> alternative designs before deciding on a change. Professor John Burrows, chair of the Flag Consideration Panel, agreed that familiarity with proposals is a prerequisite for a properly informed decision about them.|$|E

When opening a panel to access the shaft system, they discover Manheim's dead body. Shawn [...] "psychically" [...] reveals this to the police, using it as a way to distract them while he watches the security footage for the vault. After viewing the footage, they hold a bachelor party where Shawn questions all of the attendees. Shawn talks with Lacey Maxwell (Christine Chatelain), the sister of the groom, who asks him to get her bouquet from a locked cooler, but he can't. Before the wedding, the bouquets are passed out, and Lacey panics when hers isn't there. Lacey reveals she is a magician when she helps to calm down the flower girl. Shawn realizes who stole the ring and killed Manheim, but his realization occurs in the middle of the ceremony. Shawn interrupts the wedding with a [...] "psychic episode", and exposes Lacey to everyone.|$|E

[...] Dembski has appeared on several television shows, including a 2005 interview with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show with Edward Larson and Ellie Crystal where he said he accepted religion before science.|$|E
2500|$|Hudlin knew {{immediately}} {{that he wanted}} Halle Berry {{for the role of}} Angela after she came in and did the reading, and was nervous that Murphy wouldn't like her. Berry had appeared in a couple of films prior to being cast in Boomerang. However, after Berry performed her screen test, Murphy told Hudlin [...] "well, that's it. There's no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> other two actresses because she's the part." [...] Executives at Paramount Pictures were nervous about Robin Givens being cast in such {{a major role in the}} film, as she was disliked by many in the general public at the time because of her past relationship with Mike Tyson. Hudlin however, [...] "thought that actually made her perfect for the role, that she was this formidable person, and a match for Eddie Murphy, who also had an increpid reputation as a ladies' man. So, I wanted the audience to feel like this would be a fair fight." ...|$|E

6000|$|An {{undefined}} shape hovered {{before him}} in the garden, halfway between the gate and the house; it remained outside of the broad shaft of lamplight projected from the window. It wavered for a moment after it had become aware of his observation and then whisked round {{the corner of the}} lodge. This characteristic movement so effectually dispelled the mystery--it could only be Mrs. Rooth who resorted to such conspicuous secrecies--that, to feel the game up and his interview over, he had no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> figure reappear on second thoughts and dodge about in the dusk with a sportive, vexatious vagueness. Evidently Miriam's warning of a few minutes before had been founded: a cab had deposited her anxious mother at the garden door. Mrs. Rooth had entered with precautions; she had approached the house and retreated; she had effaced herself--had peered and waited and listened. Maternal solicitude and muddled calculations had drawn her from a feast as yet too imperfectly commemorative. The heroine of the occasion of course had been intolerably missed, so that the old woman had both obliged the company and quieted her own nerves by jumping insistently into a hansom and rattling up to Saint John's Wood to reclaim the absentee. But if she had wished to be in time she had also desired not to be impertinent, and would have been still more embarrassed to say what she aspired to promote than to phrase what she had proposed to hinder. She wanted to abstain tastefully, to interfere felicitously, and, more generally and justifiably--the small hours having come--to see what her young charges were [...] "up to." [...] She would probably have gathered that they were quarrelling, and she appeared now to be motioning to Peter to know if it were over. He took no notice of her signals, if signals they were; he only felt that before he made way for the poor, odious lady there was one small spark he might strike from Miriam's flint.|$|E
