Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever {{collected}} in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium <b>Neutrino</b> Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan <b>Neutrino</b> Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes of liquid gallium. Another experiment was the GALLEX <b>neutrino</b> detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar <b>neutrino</b> flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until better solar <b>neutrino</b> detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).|$|E

The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar <b>neutrino</b> problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass <b>neutrino</b> exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita (University of Tokyo) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics for illustration of <b>neutrino</b> change identities and identification of mass. This is the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Queen's University researcher.

25|$|<b>Neutrino</b> {{oscillation}} {{arises from}} a mixture between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three <b>neutrino</b> states that {{interact with the}} charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three <b>neutrino</b> states of definite mass. Neutrinos are created in weak processes in their flavor eigenstates. As a <b>neutrino</b> propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three mass states advance at slightly different rates due to the slight differences in the <b>neutrino</b> masses. This results in a changing mixture of mass states as the <b>neutrino</b> travels, but a different mixture of mass states corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. So a <b>neutrino</b> born as, say, an electron <b>neutrino</b> will be some mixture of electron, mu, and tau <b>neutrino</b> after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the <b>neutrino</b> will be again mostly electron <b>neutrino.</b> The electron flavor content of the <b>neutrino</b> will then continue to oscillate {{as long as the}} quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between <b>neutrino</b> flavors are small in comparison with long coherence length for <b>neutrino</b> oscillations this microscopic quantum effect becomes observable over macroscopic distances.|$|E
