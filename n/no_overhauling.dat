40|$|Purpose: of this paper: Mainly, future {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} processes should be oriented to refurbishing and overhaul, such as mining machines, hydraulics, military industry, heavy industry products, etc [...] This paper shows method which can improve indirectly profitability also in environment protection area. Design/methodology/approach: Methodology that solves refurbishing and overhaul problem of application, {{is based on}} CAD/CAM integration, and predicts possibility to even prepare design for refurbishing. With help of reverse engineering techniques, also exist approach to refurbish elements that has <b>no</b> <b>overhaul</b> documentation prepared before. Findings: Preparation of overhaul documentation for families of constructions, should be computer aided with use of prepared dedicated software. Time need to prepare refurbishing technology, can be considerably reduced. Research limitations/implications: Refurbishing and overhaul in existence cycle of product should have same rights as technology or design processes. Future development of new refurbishing technologies should be prepared in software combined with CAD/CAM modules used in advanced CAE programs. Practical implications: Mining industry after possible initiate refurbishing methods, can extend exploit time of exerted machines. Simultaneously producers of mining machines and equipment, after bringing in design for refurbishing strategy in to production, can enhance economical profits from maintenance and service time prolongation. Originality/value: For last twenty years no development in area of patents were noticed. That came with increase of consumption strategy progressed by produces. Presented method solves issues of materials raise in prices and relatively short time of maintenance and service time period. New workstations in industry can be created with application of the method...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyse}} why some {{contemporary}} corporate organisations {{are reluctant to}} articulate the effect of their market positioning behaviour on the unwilling communities that oppose their activities. It describes the communicative interactions between several large corporate organisations and the grassroots activist groups opposing their activities, in Victoria, Australia. Design/methodology/approach – Extensive secondary data were collected, including extensive newspaper and radio transcripts from the campaign periods, web site downloads, letters and other campaign documents. The research design applied to the data, a qualitative, interpretative analysis, drawing on key theoretical frameworks. Findings – The research findings suggest that powerful protest strategies, combined with the right political and social conditions, and {{a shift in the}} locus of politics and expertise, bring to light public concerns about the ethics of corporate practices, such as public relations, used egocentrically by organisations, to harmonise their activities in late modern Western society. It finds that <b>no</b> serious <b>overhaul</b> of business ethics can occur until the unity of public relations is critically scrutinised and reformed. It helps define an alternative holistic communicative approach which could be applied more widely to business practice that helps avoid the limitations and relativism of public relations. Originality/value – The research flags new ways of thinking expressed in the notion of public communication that could lead to creative and unusual coherences vital to deal with the apparent ecological challenges for society in late modernity. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|No. 4 {{had been}} unnamed on the Corris under Great Western {{ownership}} (it {{has been suggested}} that it carried the name Tattoo prior to 1930 but photographs suggest otherwise). Upon arrival on the Talyllyn Railway it was named Edward Thomas after the former manager of the railway, though another suggested name had been James Swinton Spooner, after the engineer who had built the line. Although it was not realised at the time, Edward Thomas, in his role as Secretary of the Aberllefenni Slate and Slab Quarries Co after 1935, had {{played an important role in}} helping keep the Corris Railway open and so ensuring the survival of the locomotive. Along with No. 3, it kept its Corris number, giving both locos the unusual distinction of carrying the same number though the ownership of four different railway companies (the Corris, Great Western, British Railways and Talyllyn Railway). Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn Railway. Upon arriving, No.4 was in need of a major overhaul but was unserviceable as the Talyllyn Railway were struggling for money. Fortunately, John Alcock, the chairman of the Hunslet Engine Company, was a member of the Preservation Society and had <b>No.</b> 4 <b>overhauled</b> free of charge at his works. Like Sir Haydn when it arrived at the Talyllyn Railway it had no buffers, so was subsequently fitted with them.|$|R
40|$|IN DECEMBER 2004, the new Barroso Commission {{brought the}} saga of the French and German {{infringements}} of the Stability and Growth Pact to a close by lifting the "excessive deficit" procedure launched in 2003. That same month, the Commission launched infringement proceedings against Greece that has been providing inaccurate public deficit statistics since {{the creation of the}} Pact in 1997. The new head of the Commission also declared that there would be <b>no</b> major <b>overhaul</b> of the Pact. In the November 2003 crisis, when the Council suspended the implementation of the Pact at a time France and Germany overshot its deficit ceiling, most observers called the Pact dead and many rejoiced since the Stability and Growth Pact had come under heavy criticism for some time. A year after, we asked four leading scholars that have studied monetary integration: have news of the death of the Stability and Growth pact been grossly exaggerated? Should it be resuscitated? Why or why not? Amy Verdun and Nicolas Jabko argue that the Pact will survive for lack of an alternative able to gather the support of a large bipartisan cross-national coalition. Henrik Enderlein then argues that the pact should not be fixed but broken. Finally, Andrew Martin explains why the real problem does not so much lie with the Pact per se, but instead with the philosophy behind the EMU policy mix (restrictive fiscal and monetary policies). It creates vicious circles: By keeping economic growth too low the European central bank retarded the expansion of public revenue, making it more difficult to meet the Pact requirements...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of preservation, the line {{struggled}} to operate using the original rolling stock. When the line was taken over in 1950 Dolgoch was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos. 3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named Sir Haydn and Edward Thomas respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No. 3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 80 years in 1951, but it frequently derailed, and on inspection {{it turned out that the}} Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13 mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long wheelbase of Talyllyn. Both Talyllyn and Dolgoch had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering Talyllyns trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotives fixed wheelbase. No. 4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock, the chairman of the Hunslet Engine Company, was a member of the Preservation Society and had <b>No.</b> 4 <b>overhauled</b> free of charge at his works. No. 4 then began service on the railway in 1952 and worked the majority of the trains that season.|$|R

Se trata de una modificación que se ha limitado a un mero incremento de tipos, siendo la medida más significativa la deducción del 75 % en los 150 primeros euros. Es una reforma centrada en el micromecenazgo. Sin embargo, su característica esencial es que nos encontramos ante una noreforma, en tanto no se han afrontado los problemas basilares del mecenazgo. El Gobierno constituyó un Grupo de Trabajo Interministerial a los efectos de elaborar un informe para analizar diversas propuestas sobre el mecenazgo. El informe, que no ha sido publicado, valoró de forma negativa una reforma. Además, las cuestiones que examinó fueron limitadas, dejando fuera algunos de los problemas esenciales del régimen actual del mecenazgo. El presente trabajo analiza la reforma del mecenazgo y las conclusiones del Informe del Grupo de Trabajo Interministerial. This paper {{analyses}} {{the reform}} of the law concerning charitable contributions enacted in 2015. The amendment was limited to an increase on tax deduction rates alone; and the most significant measure was a tax deduction of 75 % on the first € 150 of the donation. The reform focused on crowdfunding. However, <b>no</b> real <b>overhaul</b> of charitable contributions was undertaken: the new law does not address the main problems requiring solution. In an earlier report, a government working group analyzed a range of measures in relation to the tax implications of gifts. The final conclusion of the (unpublished) report was that the current system was fit for purpose. Furthermore, the issues explored by the working group were limited, and did not include some of the key problems in the current system regulating charitable contributions.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of Puerto Rican Regulation <b>No.</b> 6768, which <b>overhauled</b> the existing fishery management framework, generated considerable hostility towards local managers. Among the controversial management measures adopted in 2004 were {{the assignment of}} fishing licenses based on fishing income, the establishment of closed seasons, and new minimum size restrictions for commercially valuable species. Though tensions have subsided, considerable opposition to these regulations remains. This paper provides a characterization of the current population of active small-scale fishermen, discusses their perceptions about the biological and socio-economic condition of the fishery, and describes their attitudes towards the new management framework. This study revealed {{that the number of}} active fishermen decreased from 1, 731 in 1988 to 868 in 2008. Although a declining resource base {{was one of the main}} drivers behind these waning participation statistics, rising fuel costs and burdensome regulations exacerbated the rate of attrition. The majority of the fishermen were middleaged men (50 years) with moderate levels of formal education and high levels of fishing dependence which limited their employment opportunities outside the fishery. Most of the vessels were small (20 ft) and outfitted with a single outboard engine (80 hp). Hook and line and SCUBA were dominant gears because of their versatility and cost effectiveness. Fishermen suggested that their opposition to the regulations would continue unless they were afforded greater regulatory flexibility and provided with a larger role in the decision-making process. Fishermen were adamant about the need to reconsider the income reporting requirements to secure a fishing license because of the potential for losing public assistance benefits. They also objected to increasing the minimum size of many deepwater snapper (Lutjanidae) and grouper (Serranidae) species because it forced them to discard dead fish, a practice they consider wasteful since these species do not survive the ascent to the surface once hooked...|$|R
