5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, the match did not happen because Hogan changed his mind, as he was supposedly <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E
5|$|Fleming was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the book, {{owing to}} the {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of the plots. However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based {{on one of the}} characters in the book.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1944, Cariappa was {{promoted}} to Brigadier, but was not given the command of a brigade as expected. Instead, he {{became a member of}} the Reorganisation Committee chaired by Lieutenant General Sir Henry Willcox. Though Cariappa was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the appointment initially, and protested to the Military Secretary, the experience proved to helpful when he took over as the C-in-C four years later. The committee closely worked with the General HQ and Viceroy's Secretariat. This gave the British hierarchy a chance to assess Cariappa.|$|E
5|$|Seven offered Johns the 10.30pm Thursday timeslot, which Johns had {{the option}} of declining owing to a clause in his contract. Co-host Webcke was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the late time, and Johns' {{producers}} perceived that there may be difficulty in booking guests at that time. Consequently, Johns declined the offer and sat out 2011 on full pay. It has also been suggested that success of The Matty Johns Show depended on the success of related AFL show The Bounce, which failed in 2010. The future of The Matty Johns Show is currently unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with writer Philip Stark.

The duo were <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the episode, particularly the ending, and were surprised by the positive response it received from fans. Parker said he also wanted the episode to convey, in part, that Halloween is a positive holiday for children.|$|E

5|$|In August and September, {{the first}} {{screenshots}} of Duke Nukem Forever were released in PC Gamer. However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting {{on the back of}} a moving truck and firefights with aliens.

5|$|Many of the {{creative}} staff at Pixar were <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> how the sequel was turning out. Lasseter, upon returning from the European promotion of A Bug's Life, watched the development reels and {{agreed that it was}} not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. When it became apparent that the war would not be a short one, Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines, three of which had been built at Whiteheadâ€™s in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.|$|E

5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E
5|$|Rita Sullivan {{contacts}} Lewis {{and they}} attend the theatre together. Lewis charms Rita and she books {{him for the}} Chamber of Commerce Easter Dinner Dance. Lewis is surprised when Audrey turns up at the dance with Claudia. Audrey becomes jealous of Rita, and the women insult each other until Lewis intervenes. Lewis leaves his diary containing his clients' details in Audrey's salon. When he returns to collect it, he finds Audrey has read it. Audrey tells Lewis that they cannot continue to be together, but Lewis kisses Audrey and tells her he has feelings for her. They begin dating, despite Rita telling Audrey it will end in tears. After noticing Audrey is <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> his occupation, Lewis quits and tells Audrey that he is beginning to feel too old for the job.

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston, features BeyoncÃ© wearing a modern-day tank top, performing the song against a blank background which changes {{back and forth}} between white and black. Interspersed are some scenes from a photo shoot within her film Dreamgirls. This version appears on the Dreamgirls DVD release. In the director's cut of this version, BeyoncÃ© is seen posing for a photo shoot not featured in the film in which she wears very outlandish clothing. As the shoot progresses it becomes more and more evident that BeyoncÃ© is <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the direction of the shoot and when she is handed a bird to pose with she becomes fed up, walks away and strips down to the black tank top and tights underneath. She then climbs the staircase of the building to the rooftop and finishes singing the song.|$|E
5|$|There was one driver change {{heading into}} the race. Having been {{in one of the}} Jordan cars since the first race of the season in Australia, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was sacked by his team and was {{replaced}} by Jordan's third driver Zonta. Frentzen announced he would take legal action against Jordan and team principal Eddie Jordan said that Frentzen's management was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> Jordan's current performance but denied rumours that a heated row occurred. The Schumacher brothers were sympathic towards Frentzen who felt unhappy about the manner in which he was sacked. Irvine came to Jordan's defence and said that he believed the decision was influenced by problems Jordan had with 1996 World Champion Damon Hill who had similar poor performances like Frentzen. In an interview with The Sunday Independent in 2005, Jordan later claimed that Frentzen was sacked because engine supplier Honda wanted Japanese driver Takuma Sato to race for Jordan in 2002 and to retain Honda's engine supply. During the week of the race, the organisers of the German Grand Prix signed an extension to continue hosting the event at the Hockenheimring until 2008 with an option for a further five years.|$|E
5|$|They {{were joined}} on the grid's front row by the sister No. 19 car after Tandy set a lap {{time at the}} session's {{conclusion}} that saw him be 0.257 seconds slower than his teammates. Jani and Lieb qualified in third position, three-tenths of a second slower than the two sister Porsche cars. Lotterer twice went onto the track and improved his first lap time by 0.116 seconds to 1:55.114, while FÃ¤ssler {{was unable to find}} a rhythm, and could not improve on his co-driver's fastest time, restricting them to qualifying fourth. Duval and di Grassi took fifth place with the latter stating that the team was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the No. 8 car's setup, and that overnight work had to be undertaken. Davidson and Buemi held fifth place until di Grassi and Duval's lap times demoted them to sixth. Conway and Sarrazin secured seventh with the latter saying that he was held up by slower cars on his two timed laps. Albuquerque and Rast filled the grid's fourth row by qualifying eighth ahead of the No. 4 Team ByKolles car.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 470s, Daoists fleeing from the Northern Wei court had {{transformed}} Louguan into an important religious center. According to legend, Louguan {{used to be}} the home of Yin Xi, the first recipient of the Dao de jing. At this time, the center's buildings were greatly expanded, and many Daoist scriptures were collected, including materials from the Lingbao and Shangqing schools. During the 7th century, the school had a prominent role in a series of debates that examined whether Buddhism or Daoism would be better suited to bring stability to the realm. The first debate surrounded Fuyi, a scholar and Daoist who proposed that Buddhism be abolished in China. Naturally, the Buddhists were <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> his suggestions and countered his arguments in several treatises. The second debate concerned Lu Zhongqing, a friend of Fu Yi, who wrote about Buddhism's inferiority to Daoism. The Tang emperors were in support of the Daoists, and in 637 issued an edict that secured the precedence of Daoism over Buddhism. This edict remained in place until 674, when Empress Wu Zetian came to power. At the same time, Louguan also served as a refuge for Daoists fleeing the persecution of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty to the south. The final Northern Celestial Master, Yin Wencao arrived at Louguan in 636 and later achieved the favor of the Gaozong Emperor. After Yin's death in 688, Louguan remained an important place of Daoist learning, but ceased to be considered part of a distinct school.|$|E
5|$|Friday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups that lasted 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and Am were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All vehicles were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The qualifying session took place in sunny weather conditions. Porsche led the time sheets early on with a flying lap from Hartley in the No. 1 entry before Bernhard improved it to clinch the team's first pole position of the season with an average time of one minute and 55.793 seconds. This was Hartley's, Bernhard's and Webber's seventh of their careers, and the 13th for the German manufacturer. They were joined on the grid's front row by team-mates Jani and Lieb who were nearly eight-tenths of a second off Bernhard and Hartley's pace but it marked the first occasion that Porsche began an World Endurance Championship in the first two starting positions since the 2015 6 Hours of Bahrain. Lieb was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> his fastest lap because he braked early and was unable to achieve a rhythm he liked.|$|E
5|$|Montagu, though, was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the new arrangements, and King Edward {{has been}} held {{responsible}} for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy. Warkworth's Chronicle describes him as condemning these grants to him as 'a pyes] nest.' Montagu {{had been on the}} Scottish border since at least January 1470. Following unrest in Lincolnshire and the subsequent Lincolnshire rebellion, the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the Battle of Empingham. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at Doncaster. Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion. The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais. On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy. Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick and Clarence had landed in Dartmouth.|$|E
