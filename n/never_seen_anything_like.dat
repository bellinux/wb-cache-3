5|$|This {{film was}} shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, {{and on his}} arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Cagney was mobbed by {{hundreds}} of fans.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, a guest {{was stabbed}} {{critically}} by another guest. The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this and that the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|E

500|$|The {{problem of}} how exactly Anna would save Elsa at the film's climax was solved by story artist John Ripa.

500|$|Their {{first stop}} was a {{dilapidated}} shotgun house in Cleveland, in which 15 people resided. Holes {{were present in}} the flooring and roofing, and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter. One boy told Kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses, and that he didn't eat any lunch. Walking to the next house, Kennedy whispered to Edelman, [...] "I've been to third-world countries and I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Pistons' 104-94 {{victory was}} a perfect {{farewell}} to the Pontiac Silverdome. [...] "I told Joe Dumars with a minute {{left in the game}} to look around and enjoy this because you'll <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it again," [...] Laimbeer said. [...] "Forty-one thousand people waving towels and standing. It was awesome." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{critically}} panned. It currently holds a 9% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews (20 negative, 2 positive). Roger Ebert gave the film a half-star {{of a possible}} four.

6000|$|Let me {{tell you}} one thing. I'd sooner feed mush and milk to feebs than milk cows with the frost on the ground. Mrs. Bopp was scared to let me play with her children. And I was scared, too. They used to make faces at me when nobody was looking, and call me [...] "Looney." [...] Everybody called me Looney Tom. And the other boys in the {{neighbourhood}} threw rocks at me. You <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that in the Home here. The feebs are better behaved.|$|R
500|$|Zito's fastball has hovered between [...] and [...] He augments it with {{a circle}} changeup and a curveball that he uses as a strikeout pitch. His curveball was voted {{the best in the}} Major Leagues in a player poll {{conducted}} by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> Zito's curveball, commenting: [...] "It's such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even look for it because you're not going to hit it." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{celebrated their}} victory by parading the trophy around Liverpool in an open-top {{double-decker}} bus {{the day after}} the final. They were cheered by approximately 1 million supporters, with an estimated 300,000 fans located around St George's Hall – the final destination of the parade. Business experts estimated that one in five workers took time off following the victory. It was also estimated that Liverpudlians drank around 10,000 bottles of champagne after the match, with supermarket chain Sainsbury's stating: [...] "We've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it. We would usually expect to sell this much champagne at Christmas".|$|E
500|$|King, who {{had been}} silent and then out of town while Bevel was {{organizing}} the children, {{was impressed by the}} success of using them in the protests. That evening he declared at a mass meeting, [...] "I have been inspired and moved by today. I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it." [...] Although Wyatt Tee Walker was initially against the use of children in the demonstrations, he responded to criticism by saying, [...] "Negro children will get a better education in five days in jail than in five months in a segregated school." [...] The D Day campaign received front page coverage by The Washington Post and The New York Times.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the king}} he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and {{then he looked}} around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, {{everybody}} dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying [...] "Sh!" [...] and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And {{when they got there}} they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it. Then one of them got {{on one side of the}} coffin, and t'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd <b>like</b> you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> so disgusting.|$|R
6000|$|They found Queen Bee perched {{upon the}} arm of her grandpapa's chair, with one hand holding by his collar. She had been coaxing him to say Henrietta was the prettiest girl he ever saw, and he was teasing her by declaring he should <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> Aunt Mary in her girlish days. Then he called up Henrietta and Fred, and asked them about their home doings, showing so {{distinct}} a knowledge of them, that they laughed and stood amazed. [...] "Ah," [...] said grandpapa, [...] "you forgot that I had a Queen Bee to enlighten me. We have plenty to tell each other, when we go buzzing over the ploughed fields together on a sunny morning, haven't we, Busy, Busy Bee?" ...|$|R
60|$|So he did it. He had {{a little}} wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching, but {{all the rest of}} the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels made him the {{greatest}} man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him--and there they'd stand and gawk, and he'd gabble. You <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it.|$|R
500|$|During this period, Ochs {{was taking}} drugs {{to get through}} performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, {{and he was also}} {{drinking}} heavily. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, [...] "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. I'd <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|After Nazi Germany {{surrendered}} in May 1945, General Arnold ordered Crump {{to document}} {{the extent of the}} damage caused by aerial bombardment. This project was code-named [...] "Special Film Project 186." [...] Crump and his crew, using color film, surveyed bomb damage inflicted on the major European cities. In addition, Crump recorded the debriefings of Nazi civilian and military personnel in Allied custody such as Hermann Goering, as well as the capture of the Ohrdruf and Buchenwald concentration camps by American soldiers. Upon viewing the film of the camps for the first time, Malvin Wald recollected, [...] "Even though it was a summer day, Reagan came out shivering—we all did. We’d <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|E
500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology. Christman told Morning Edition: [...] "It feels like we've been out in this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, {{and all of a}} sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..." [...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that before. This is incredible. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it on a Web cam." ...|$|E
50|$|The tour kicked of at Wellington on 21 November 1958. Over {{the next}} two weeks he {{performed}} for close to 20,000 ecstatic fans in Wellington, Palmerston North, Masterton, Napier, Gisborne and Tauranga. The press raved and chaos broke out at every performance. The shows exceeded everyone's expectations, with New Zealand having <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> remotely <b>like</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|Toby {{followed}} {{without a}} question, {{though he was}} wholly {{at a loss to}} understand what the [...] "women's wagon" [...] was, for he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> which looked <b>like</b> one.|$|R
60|$|What I {{wanted to}} see was a dervish, because I was {{interested}} in dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the camel-driver. So we found a lot {{in a kind of}} a church, and they called themselves Whirling Dervishes; and they did whirl, too. I <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it. They had tall sugar-loaf hats on, and linen petticoats; and they spun and spun and spun, round and round like tops, and the petticoats stood out on a slant, and it was the prettiest thing I ever see, and made me drunk to look at it. They was all Moslems, Tom said, and when I asked him what a Moslem was, {{he said it was a}} person that wasn't a Presbyterian. So there is plenty of them in Missouri, though I didn't know it before.|$|R
500|$|Hasbro and Hub Network (prior to its {{rebranding}} as Discovery Family) {{have also}} sought to market to bronies. Steiner said, [...] "You develop the best show you can, and hope the humour will translate to a broader audience. But I've {{been in the business}} for 25 years and I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this." [...] A company spokeswoman said that bronies are [...] "a small group of My Little Pony fans who don't necessarily fit what one might expect to be the brand's target audience", while its core audience in the older market is predominantly females. Despite the bronies being an unusual and unexpected audience, Hasbro and Hub Network chose to [...] "salute and embrace all the viewers who have embraced our brand", according to Margaret Loesch, CEO of Hub Network and former executive producer of the original My Little Pony animated series. Hasbro has allowed the fandom to be an organic movement leading to its growth and success, according to Stephen Davis, head of Hasbro Studios.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final, Maguire ended O'Sullivan's 14-match unbeaten {{run with a}} 6–1 victory to earn {{a place in the}} final against Higgins. Maguire made century breaks in the first two frames, {{becoming}} the first player to make five consecutive century breaks (including the three made in his previous match). Maguire won the third on the pink after O'Sullivan missed the yellow. O'Sullivan won the next with a break of 51, before Maguire made a break of 71 in each of the final two frames. After the match, O'Sullivan—who had won all three previous encounters against Maguire—said, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that on a snooker table before... He's a great player, probably {{the best in the world}} at the moment", and even before the match, O'Sullivan had described Maguire as [...] "of the young ones, definitely the best". The defeat meant that Reardon lost the £100 bet he placed at 150–1 that O'Sullivan would win all eight of the season's ranking events.|$|E
6000|$|So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this, their {{familiar}} fountainhead, [...] {{that though}} water is supplied in stand-pipes now from a Reservoir, the [...] folks won't have it, and {{come here to}} this spout-house, bucket and jug [...] in hand, morn, noon and night.

5000|$|... "The defeat which {{sticks in}} the memory is that 0-44 {{thrashing}} from the South Africans at Murrayfield on 24 November 1951. They were just awesome. It was like sevens played by fifteen men. I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> them.

60|$|And {{all this}} time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes, and trying to divide them up {{so there would be}} some for all, but there was a {{misunderstanding}} about it somewheres, on account of some of them trying to hog more than their share; so there was another insurrection, and you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it in the world. There must 'a' been fifty of them, all mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping and biting and tearing, legs and tails in the air, and you couldn't tell which was which, and the sand and fur a-flying. And when they got done, some was dead and some was limping off crippled, and the rest was setting around on the battlefield, some of them licking their sore places and the others looking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down and have some fun, but which we didn't want any.|$|R
500|$|Network Ten's {{national}} publicity director, Brian Walsh, {{believed the}} wedding episode {{would be an}} ideal marketing opportunity. He arranged for Minogue and Donovan to attend a wedding breakfast at the Park Royal Hotel in Parramatta and invited four hundred competition winners to join them. Minogue and Donovan later made an appearance with the wedding cake at Westfield Parramatta. Walsh recalled [...] "I'd <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it; {{there would have been}} 6000 people. Security had to prevent any more going inside. It was as simple as Jason and Kylie and a wedding cake on stage. There was a speech and the cutting of the cake. Then there was this near riot. We had to stop the appearance at this point to prevent people getting crushed." [...] The actors made several more appearances with replica cakes in shopping centres throughout Sydney and Melbourne. They would cut the cakes and then hand out slices to thousands of fans. The episode later become the main focus on covers of TV Week and the Australian edition of Time magazine.|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it. That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{is legal}} to possess a bat'leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are {{considered}} to be [...] "potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle." [...] They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. A replica bat'leth was surrendered to Gloucestershire Constabulary as part of the 2006 knife amnesty in the UK. In 2008, a miniature bat'leth was seized in Oxford after a 17-year-old was caught trying to smuggle it into a College. Police described the weapon as [...] "most horrendous". The person was arrested and sentenced to six months in a young offenders' institution. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of a miniature bat'leth in a public street. In the court documents, it was referred to as a [...] "multi-bladed sword", and the judge said [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it in my life before." [...] The accused pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, and he was later sentenced to thirteen weeks in prison. The court ordered that the bat'leth was to be forfeited and destroyed. A custom-made bat'leth was seized in 2009 in Accrington, Lancashire.|$|E
