The chemical compositions of the bands were measured with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which showed that the martensitic bands contained more alloying elements (Mn, Cr, Mo, Si) than bainitic bands. By using Oberhoffer reagent, the segregations of phosphorus were also revealed. These phosphorus segregations coincided with the positive segregations of the alloying elements. The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of steel were calculated.

40|$|In {{continuous}} casting of bronze, macrosegregations cause {{weaknesses in the}} final product. Besides sedimen-tation and flotation of equiaxed grains, feeding flow, ther-mal and solutal buoyancy driven flow, and inlet flow are potential convection mechanisms which cause the for-mation of macrosegregations. Since macrosegregations are formed during solidification processes where relative motion between melt and solidifying dendrites occurs, their formation {{is strongly dependent on}} the flow, espe-cially in the mushy zone. To study and compare the im-pact of the different flow phenomena, a numerical inves-tigation has been carried out. The presented study dis-cusses the impact of different convection types like inlet flow, thermal and solutal buoyancy flow, and feeding flow on the formation of macrosegregations for one highly and one low permeable mushy zone. It is shown that low mush permeability favors positive macrosegregations ad-jacent to the wall and strong <b>negative</b> <b>segregations</b> at the center line. In contrast, a higher permeability favors sig-nificant negative macrosegregations at the wall and at the center line and positive macrosegregations between wall and center line. It is demonstrated how the different flow phenomena contribute to this finding. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluid flow}} and {{solidification}} of ingot casting was studied. In this study, the fluid flow during the bottom teeming process was investigated with water model experiments and numerical simulation. A user-defined liquid-solid two-phase solidification solver was developed {{based on the}} software platform of OpenFOAM, using Euler-Euler two-phase approach. The solidification solver was performed on a 3 -dimensional model of steel ingot to simulate the solidification and macrosegregation distribution. In water model experiments, water and vegetable oil were used to simulate the molten steel and slag phase, respectively. The influence of model parameters, such as the filling rate, nozzle dimensions and oil film thickness, on the filling conditions was investigated, concerning two aspects: one is the slag entrapment, {{and the other is}} reoxidation of molten steel. Both of the two situations should be avoid to provide a better filling condition. The numerical simulation on water-air two-phase flow with the interFoam solver of OpenFOAM was performed. The obtained predictions were in good agreement with the water model experiments. The simulation of solidification can obtain the evolution of the solid fraction, velocity, temperature, concentration and grain density fields. The macrosegregation was indicated by the concentration of the only solute − carbon. The cone-shaped <b>negative</b> <b>segregation</b> at the bottom, positive segregation at the top, V-segregation at the upper center of the ingot, and the channel-shaped A-segregation were predicted.

40|$|Abstract. The {{simulation}} of macrosegregation in a 2. 45 -ton steel ingot with the three-phase mixed columnar-equiaxed model was presented previously. The results showed an overestimation of {{the intensity of}} bottom <b>negative</b> <b>segregation.</b> The reason {{is due to the}} assumed globular morphology for the equiaxed crystal. Therefore, in this paper a simple approach is suggested to treat the dendritic morphology of equiaxed crystals. Three aspects are improved: the drag force between the moving equiaxed crystals and the surrounding melt, the mechanism of the columnar-to-equiaxed transition, the packing limit of the equiaxed crystals. The modified model is used to calculate the macrosegre-gation of the same ingot. It is found that the modified model predicts less severe negative segrega-tion in the bottom equiaxed zone than the previous globular equiaxed model does, i. e. it agrees bet-ter to the experiment.

40|$|Abstract. The {{addition}} of grain refiners during industrial direct chill (DC) casting of aluminum billets promotes formation of smaller equiaxed grains with obvious advantages. However, {{the role of}} grain refining in the extent of macrosegregation in DC cast Al alloys is still unclear. This is particularly evident {{in the case of}} commercial aluminum alloys with various alloying elements. In this work, the structure and associated macrosegregation patterns in DC cast AA 2024 (Al–Cu–Mg) aluminum alloy billets were studied at different casting speeds. The concentration profiles of Cu and Mg, measured along the billet diameter, showed an expected <b>negative</b> <b>segregation</b> in the center and close to the surface. The severity of segregation increases at a higher casting speed. On the other hand, grain refining {{does not seem to have}} any dramatic effect on the macrosegregation patterns.

A deeper understanding of element segregation behavior will have a great significance on the prevention of segregation. In the study, the element segregation behavior of ZL 205 A aluminum-copper alloy was investigated by examining isothermally solidified samples using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The calculated results of segregation coefficients show that Cu and Mn are <b>negative</b> <b>segregation</b> elements; while Ti, V and Zr are positive segregation elements. The sequence of element segregation degree from the greatest to the least in ZL 205 A alloy is Cu, Mn, V, Ti, Zr and Al. The density of residual liquid {{is expected to increase}} with a decrease in the quenching temperature ranging from 630 ºC to 550 ºC. The calculated results confirm that the quenching temperature has an insignificant effect on the liquid density; and the variation of density is mainly due to element segregation. Consequently, segregations of Al, Cu and Mn lead to an increase in density, but Ti, V and Zr present the opposite effect. The contribution of each element to the variation of the liquid density was analyzed.

Moreover, the effects of EMS current intensity on the metallurgical behavior in the bloom mold were also investigated. The simulated solute distributions were basically consistent with the test results.

In the presence of a specific X chromosome, supp-X(SD), the proportion, k, of SD- 72 chromosomes recovered from the SD- 72 /cn bw males ranges from 0. 99 at 20 ° to 0. 11 at 28. 5 °, whereas with a standard-X chromosome, k ranges from 0. 99 to 0. 95 for the same temperature range. The temperature-sensitive period is during spermiogenesis. Using a mating system in which the sperm supply is nearly exhausted, it was shown that the negative distortion at high temperatures is due to an absolute {{reduction in the number of}} SD- 72 chromosomes and an absolute increase in the number of cn bw chromosomes recovered. After adjusting for non-SD-related temperature effects, the amount of decrease in the number of SD- 72 progeny is nearly the same as the amount of increase in the number of cn bw progeny, suggesting that the dysfunction switches from a spermatid carrying one homolog to one carrying the other.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} practical possibilities of the strand stirrer (S-EMS) {{for the improvement of}} inner quality and central segregation in high carbon billets. An optimal S-EMS setting was proposed for the billet caster producing billets 150 x 150 mm. Design/methodology/approach: Impact of different S-EMS settings on central segregation and inner quality of as-cast billets was investigated. A set of longitudinal and transverse samples were analysed including evaluation of baumann prints and central segregation by means of LECO method. Samples of wires for segregation survey in rolled products were picked up as well. Findings: It was observed that application of the strand stirrer (S-EMS) is capable to suppress central segregation. However, its impact is visible just to a certain stirring level. Subsequent increasing of stirring intensity does not cause further improvement of segregation in the analyzed central part. On the contrary, stronger white band {{can be seen in the}} solidification line. Moreover, concentration gradient between the central part and surrounding ring of <b>negative</b> central <b>segregation</b> is lowered.

40|$|Abstract Education shapes people’s {{perspectives}} and lives {{and can be}} a permanent solution for conflicts. One of the conflict areas is Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is a democratic European land home to three ethnic groups; Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats. For many years, Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats lived together as comparatively peaceful neighbors. The {{schools in the country}} were also united and students of the three nations were attending the same Bosnian schools. However, the rise of hard-line nationalists and the fall of communism helped to precipitate the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990 s. After the collapse of Yugoslavia, the national animosities within the country reached the point of inter-ethnic violence. From 1992 to 1995, a bitter war was fought among the three officially recognized ‘constituent peoples’ in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which affected all types of relationships between the people living in the country. One thing that suffered from this war was the education system and the students involved, leaving some students without any form of education. The main aspect which this study will examine is how the war affected the schools and education system in Bosnia-Herzegovina and how the schools deal with the post war conflicts. After the war, a conflict issue of segregation came off and like other issues, the education issue was segregated in the country. Three nations from different religions and cultures did not want to live together but they had to, thus the schools were segregated. ‘Two schools under one roof’, meaning divided and separated schools and classes appeared and Bosniacs, Serbs and Croats started to be educated in different schools or in the same school but in divided classes with different curricula and languages by different teachers. The main issue of this study is how education deals with the conflict and peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This study will focus on how education handles conflicts and contribute to conflict resolution and prevention in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in this aspect three different schools in Sarajevo will be observed. Three schools will be handled and their approaches to the conflict will be observed and compared via analysis of the interviews and observation with reference to the literature surrounding the concepts of education, conflict and peace. The findings in this study suggest that the <b>negative</b> <b>segregation</b> of education in Bosnia-Herzegovina could contribute to sustaining an already existing conflict. In order to resolve this conflict and erase the effects of the war from the minds, education could be one contributing factor with its role in peace and conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina...|$|E
40|$|At the {{metropolitan}} level {{there is a}} striking negative correlation between residential racial segregation and population characteristics [...] particularly for black residents [...] but it is widely recognized that this correlation may not be causal. This paper provides a novel test of the causal relationship between segregation and population outcomes by exploiting the arrangements of railroad tracks in the 19 th century to isolate plausibly exogenous variation in cities' susceptibility to segregation. I show that, conditional on miles of railroad track laid, {{the extent to which}} track configurations physically subdivided cities strongly predicts the level of segregation that ensued after the Great Migration of African-Americans to northern and western cities in the 20 th century. At the start of the Great Migration, though, track configurations were uncorrelated with racial concentration, ethnic dispersion, income, industry, education, and population, indicating that reverse causality is unlikely. Instrumental variables estimates demonstrate that segregation leads to lower incomes and lower education among blacks. For whites, there is a mix of positive and <b>negative</b> effects: <b>segregation</b> decreases the probability of being a college graduate or a high earner, but also decreases the probability of being poor or unemployed. Segregation could generate these effects either by affecting human capital acquisition of residents of different races and socio-economic groups ('production') or by inducing sorting by race and SES into different cities ('selection'). This paper provides evidence that is most consistent with a combination of both production and selection. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine several optimization problems in the batch mixing of segregating particulate solids that can be set up and solved using Markov chain models. To improve the adequacy of such models and exclude some physical contradictions that arise in the linear form, a non-linear Markov chain model for the mixing of segregating components is proposed. Optimal solutions are obtained by controlling the particle flow outside the mixing operating volume while the components are being loaded, modifying particle circulation inside the mixing zone during the process, and by structuring the load in the mixing zone. Solutions are found that not only reduce the <b>negative</b> influence of <b>segregation,</b> but also exclude it altogether. The gain resulting from optimization grows with the rate of segregation.

The objective {{of the study was to}} compare agronomic traits and hardseed percentage of 268 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the cross between wild Vigna subspecies sublobata “ACC 41 ” with the mungbean cultivar “Berken”. The RIL population and their parents were evaluated under controlled conditions in a glass house at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. The results showed significant differences among the RILs and among the parents in all traits under study. Berken had a longer flowering date and a higher seed weight per plant, but less total leaf number and pod number per plant than ACC 41. A germination test between papers revealed that ACC 41 was 100 % hard-seeded and did not germinate at all, while Berken germinated up to 100 %. Their RILs distributed well between 0 to 100 % hardseed. Upon scarification, all hardseed germinated within seven days.

Hallonbergen, north west of Stockholm city, is no exception and is also the neighborhood concerned in this essay. The purpose of the thesis is to examine two aspects of urban renewal and to analyze place-making as strategy for current urban renewal. The research strategy applied is a qualitative method and specific strategies utilized is qualitative interview and content analysis, in addition to literature sources such as earlier research in the form of scientific articles and books, official documents deriving from public authorities, news articles and internet sources. The result shows that urban renewal {{can be seen as a}} reason for segregation and hence a contributor to urban injustices as it causes a gentrification process leading to inequality for inhabitants, but also as a solution for segregation if a change in focus areas were to adapt, and thus, possibly, counteract the <b>negative</b> consequences of <b>segregation</b> and urban injustices. By way of conclusion, suggested improvement of urban renewal development combines regional development planning, a policy focused to involve a greater emphasis on retention and raised awareness of the risks associated with place-making. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} hedonic price {{modeling}} {{is to establish}} the relationship between housing prices and housing attributes. Typically, housing attributes refer to structural characteristics of the unit. However, {{it is obvious that}} the price of a house is not just determined by its structural attributes, but also attributes of the neighborhood in which the unit is located. Neighborhood attributes can be physical properties of the neighborhood, such as street condition and proximity of employment centers, or environmental characteristics such as the types of vegetative cover. Another set of neighborhood attributes is associated with the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the residents. The intensity and nature of interaction between the population and the physical environment can also be regarded as neighborhood characteristics. The overall objective of this chapter is to evaluate how segregation is relevant in housing price determination and to suggest effective segregation measures that can be incorporated into housing price modeling. In other words, this chapter intends to provide insights on capturing neighborhood population characteristics as inputs to hedonic models. The objective is accomplished through the discussions of different facets of segregation at the conceptual level and various issues in using segregation measures at the operational level. I will first offer taxonomies of segregation based upon several defining dimensions. Then I will discuss the concepts of segregation in residential space in reference to housing price determination. Segregation is generally regarded as undesirable, but specific impacts (positive or <b>negative)</b> of <b>segregation</b> on a neighborhood and the processes have not been concretely addressed. There are also many types of segregation and only those that are relevant to housing price modeling will be discussed. Then I will address several segregation measurement issues that are relevant to housing price modeling in general. The issue of geographical scale and the nature of segregation will be the major emphases. Some measures appropriate for hedonic modeling will be reviewed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Formal paid {{supports}} {{for people with}} disabilities, citizens with severe mental health problems, or the frail elderly have traditionally been provided by either institutional services or community agencies. During the last decade, however, {{there has been a}} growing critique of formal services for these vulnerable citizens. Three significant issues have been the focus of these criticisms: the compliance expected of vulnerable citizens within service settings, the segregation of individuals from community life, and the limited social support and relationships that people have in their lives. 1 Much {{has been written about the}} marginalization and isolation of people with disabilities and of people who are the poor, frail and elderly. There are many explanations for the lack of relationships and limited social support. It is likely that vulnerability is constructed through all kinds of early experiences, including low expectations, <b>negative</b> attitudes and <b>segregation.</b> 2 Many citizens with disabilities, for example, grow up disconnected from their non-disabled peers and from their communities, often with identities formed by rehabilitation thinking. There is extensive research on relationships, social networks and social support. Social support has been identified as a critical moderator of stress and provides a key to sustaining human relationships. 3 Social support is also considered as one of the most significant predictors o...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 France's universalistic idea of citizenry {{has been}} {{complicated}} by {{a history of}} colonialism, racialization, and selective acceptance of difference. Although Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité (Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood) is France's motto, the consequences of colonial rule continue to impact the lives of non-autochthonous French citizens today. Since the colonial days, immigrants and citizens of non-European descent {{have been subjected to}} structural violence, which has resulted in marginalization, poverty, limited opportunities, and racism. By taking a critical perspective of historical, political, and economical factors, this research traces the building blocks of structural violence that has been exerted on the Franco-Maghrebian minority population in France. This thesis is meant to not only expand the understanding of the lived experiences French citizens of Maghrebian origins, but it also sets out to expand and complicate the anthropological research relating to structural violence. Through extended interviews and participant observation, this research highlights the consequences of structural violence from the perspective of Franco-Maghrebian women in Marseille, France. In these interviews and observations, I found that my informants experienced structural violence through poverty, marginalization, limited resources, restricted opportunities, <b>segregation,</b> <b>negative</b> health consequences, and racism. Furthermore, all of these consequences lead my informants to feel different from their fellow French citizens. Ultimately, what they have experienced is second-class citizenship and alterity within their own country...|$|R
