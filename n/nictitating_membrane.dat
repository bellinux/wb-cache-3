5|$|Lemurs {{also have}} a third eyelid known as a <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane,</b> whereas most other {{primates}} have a lesser developed plica semilunaris. The <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> keeps the cornea moist and clean by sweeping across the eye.|$|E
5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane,</b> and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and night vision, and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fully {{developed}} <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> {{are found}} in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, but are rare in primates. In humans, the plica semilunaris (also known as the semilunar fold) and its associated muscles are homologous to the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> seen in some other mammals and other vertebrates. In most primate species, a plica semilunaris is present, although fully developed <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> {{can be found in}} lemurs and lorisoid primates. Some mammals, such as camels, polar bears, seals and aardvarks, have full <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes,</b> and many mammals retain a small, vestigial portion of the membrane remains {{in the corner of the}} eye. A gland of the third eyelid (nictitans gland) or Harder's gland are attached to the nictating membranes of some animals and may produce up to 50% of the tear film.|$|R

5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground sharks, the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, blacktail reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem sharks) {{along with the}} houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane,</b> a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E
5|$|Once {{placed in}} the family Triakidae, the whitetip reef shark is now {{recognized}} by most authors as belonging to the family Carcharhinidae {{on the basis of}} morphological characters, such as a full <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane,</b> well-developed precaudal pit, strong lower caudal fin lobe, and scroll-like intestinal valves. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the whitetip reef shark is grouped with the lemon sharks (Negaprion) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
50|$|The {{smalltooth}} sand tiger has a bulky {{body with}} a long, bulbous, slightly flattened snout. The eyes are medium-sized, with large round pupils (as opposed to slit-like in the grey nurse shark), and lack <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes.</b>|$|R
5|$|C. longimanus most {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger {{than most other}} shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular, with <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the order}} are {{distinguished}} by possessing two dorsal fins, an anal fin, five gill slits, eyes without <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes,</b> and a mouth extending behind the eyes. Also, unlike other sharks, they maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water.|$|R
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{is a member}} of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also {{including}} the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (Prionace glauca), lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Izak {{catshark}} is {{firm and}} stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> and is followed by a spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin. The eyes are large, circular, and green in life, with irregularly shaped pupils and a <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> (protective third eyelid). The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows {{at the corners}} and usually bears 15 tooth rows {{on either side of}} both jaws, plus 12 upper and 1 lower symphysial (jaw midline) tooth rows. Each upper tooth has a smooth to serrated edge, a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth, and 25 coarse serrations {{at the base of the}} trailing margin. The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative to those on the trailing margin as the animal grows older. The lower teeth are upright and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are rather short.|$|E
25|$|Like all crocodilians, the American {{crocodile}} is a quadruped, {{with four}} short, stocky legs, a long, powerful tail and a scaly hide {{with rows of}} ossified scutes running down its back and tail. Its snout is elongated and includes a strong pair of jaws. Its eyes have <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> for protection along with lacrimal glands, which produce tears.|$|R
5000|$|Humanoids: [...] Representative {{of human}} races who evolved {{away from the}} basic racial stock due to {{evolutionary}} adaptations to the local environment, and are generally not genetically compatible with Humans. Arrangement and even functions of internal organs differ. They may have adaptive extra organs, such as Desert planet humanoid's <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> and Olfactory organs more sensitive (similar to sharks and blood) to water.|$|R
50|$|Mackerel {{sharks are}} an order which {{includes}} {{some of the}} most familiar species of sharks, such as the great white shark, as well as more unusual representatives, such as the goblin shark and the megamouth shark. Members of the order are distinguished by possessing two dorsal fins, an anal fin, five gill slits, eyes without <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes,</b> and a mouth extending behind the eyes. Mackerel sharks may also refer specifically to the family Lamnidae.|$|R
5|$|The puffadder shyshark is more slender {{than other}} shysharks, with a short, broad, dorsally {{flattened}} {{head and a}} narrowly rounded snout. The large, oval-shaped eyes have cat-like slit pupils, a simple <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> (a protective third eyelid), and a prominent ridge underneath. The nostrils are very large, {{with a pair of}} greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin in front that are fused together and reach the mouth. There is a deep groove connecting the excurrent (outflow) opening of each nostril to the mouth, obscured by the nasal flaps. The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws. There are 26–30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27–33 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Tooth shape is sexually dimorphic: those of males are longer and three-pointed, while those of females are shorter and five-pointed. Unusually, the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage, which allows a more even distribution of teeth and may increase bite strength.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
500|$|The eyes of an emu are {{protected}} by <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes.</b> These are translucent, secondary eyelids that move horizontally from the inside edge of the eye to the outside edge. They function as visors to protect the eyes from the dust that is prevalent in windy arid regions. Emus have a tracheal pouch, which becomes more prominent during the mating season. At more than [...] in length, it is quite spacious; it has a thin wall, and an opening [...] long.|$|R
5|$|The common {{thresher}} is {{a fairly}} robust shark with a torpedo-shaped trunk and a short, broad head. The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to the pointed, conical snout. The eyes are moderately large and lack <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes.</b> The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other thresher sharks, has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the pectoral fin bases.|$|R
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes.</b> The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|R
25|$|The eyelids {{of a bird}} are {{not used}} in blinking. Instead the eye is {{lubricated}} by the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane,</b> a third concealed eyelid that sweeps horizontally across the eye like a windscreen wiper. The <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds when they are under water. When sleeping, the lower eyelid rises to cover the eye in most birds, {{with the exception of}} the horned owls where the upper eyelid is mobile.|$|E
25|$|Cats have {{a second}} eyelid, the <b>nictitating</b> <b>{{membrane}},</b> which is a thin cover that closes from the side and appears when the cat's eyelid opens. This membrane partially closes if the cat is sick, although in a sleepy state this membrane is often visible.|$|E
25|$|Birds that pursue fish {{under water}} like auks and divers have far fewer red oil droplets, {{but they have}} special {{flexible}} lenses and use the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> as an additional lens. This allows greater optical accommodation for good vision in air and water. Cormorants have a greater range of visual accommodation, at 50 dioptres, than any other bird, but the kingfishers are considered {{to have the best}} all-round (air and water) vision.|$|E
500|$|The {{bigeye sand tiger}} (Odontaspis noronhai) is an {{extremely}} rare species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a possible worldwide distribution. A large, bulky species reaching at least [...] in length, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes,</b> and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color.|$|R
2500|$|The larger Figaro species, F. boardmani, reaches [...] long, {{while the}} smaller F. striatus reaches [...] long. Members of this genus closely {{resemble}} Galeus, with firm, slender bodies and short heads. The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> (protective third eyelids); a narrow ridge is found beneath each {{eye and a}} tiny spiracle behind. The anterior rims of the nostrils are enlarged into triangular flaps. The mouth is wide, with relatively short furrows at the corners, and contains small multi-cusped teeth. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|R
40|$|Melanoides tuberculata that {{naturally}} harbored trematode larvae were {{collected at the}} Pampulha dam, Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), during malacological surveys conducted from 2006 to 2010. From 7, 164 specimens of M. tuberculata collected, 25 (0. 35 %) were infected by cercariae, which have been morphologically characterized as belonging to the Megalurous group, genus Philophthalmus. Excysted metacercariae were used for successful experimental infection of Gallus gallus domesticus, and adult parasites recovered from the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> of chickens were identified as Philophthalmus gralli. This is the first report of P. gralli in M. tuberculata in Brazil...|$|R
25|$|Like the capybara, {{the beaver}} is semiaquatic. The beaver has many traits suited to this lifestyle. It has a large, flat, {{paddle-shaped}} tail and large, webbed hind feet. The unwebbed front paws are smaller, with claws. The eyes {{are covered by}} a <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> which allows the beaver to see under water. The nostrils and ears are sealed while submerged. A thick layer of fat under its skin insulates the beaver from its coldwater environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{cause for}} initial ulceration is not commonly found, although {{in many cases}} it can be assumed to be traumatic in origin. The horse's eye is especially vulnerable to trauma due to its prominent position, compared with other species. Exposure keratitis (inflamed cornea) can occur in the horse, most commonly secondary to facial nerve paralysis. Hospitalised animals {{have been shown to}} have a decreased corneal reflex, and this corresponds to an increased incidence of ulcers in the hospitalised population. Foreign bodies embedded in the palpebral conjunctiva or the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> can cause persistent irritation and ulceration. Often the shape and distribution of the lesion is suggestive of this aetiology, but {{even in the absence of}} a characteristic lesion their presence should be considered and sought out.|$|E
25|$|A small species {{reaching}} a maximum known length of , the dark shyshark has a stocky {{body and a}} short, broad head. The snout is blunt and dorsally flattened. The eyes are large and oval-shaped, with a rudimentary <b>nictitating</b> <b>membrane</b> (protective third eyelid) and a strong ridge underneath. The nostrils are very large, and are flanked by greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin that reach the mouth. These nasal flaps cover a pair of deep grooves that connect the nasal excurrent (outflow) openings and the mouth. There are furrows {{at the corners of}} the mouth on both jaws. The teeth have a central cusp and a pair of smaller cusplets on the sides. The five pairs of gill slits are positioned on the upper sides of the body.|$|E
40|$|Faecal {{samples from}} 51 cats were {{examined}} by negative stain electron microscopy {{to investigate a}} possible association between the syndrome of bilateral protrusion of the <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes</b> and torovirus infection. Although toroviruses were not observed in any sample, other viruses or virus-like particles were observed in faeces from one of 15 cats with the syndrome, six of 21 cats which had experienced prior episodes of the syndrome and four of 15 healthy control cats. The {{findings of this study}} do not support the hypothesis that the syndrome is associated with torovirus infection...|$|R
50|$|The {{bigeye sand tiger}} (Odontaspis noronhai) is an {{extremely}} rare species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a possible worldwide distribution. A large, bulky species reaching at least 3.6 m in length, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without <b>nictitating</b> <b>membranes,</b> and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color.|$|R
