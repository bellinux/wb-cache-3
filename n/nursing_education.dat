40|$|Background: International {{large-scale}} {{research has}} found that <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> at degree level contributes to reduced mortality and failure-to-rescue rates. The influences of hospital and national contexts and of different types of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> levels towards improved patient care seem often overlooked. Aim and objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the role of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> in improving patient outcomes and patient satisfaction with nursing care, taking into account different types of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> levels within different hospital-based and country-specific contexts. The objectives were: (1) to explore and compare <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> levels, hospital and nurse structures, care processes and patient-related outcomes for selected nursing teams from the Irish and German arms of the RN 4 CAST project (2) to explore factors other than <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> affecting patient outcomes, including country-specific factors. Methodology: A multiple case study design was utilised to conduct an in-depth exploration of the findings generated from the Irish and German arms of the RN 4 CAST (Nurse Forecasting: Human Resources Planning in Nursing) project. Three nursing teams, with different proportions of degree (pre-registration, post-registration and international degree) and apprenticeship trained nurses working in hospitals in Ireland and Germany were selected. Data were explored and compared based on Donabedian’s (2005) Structure-Process-Outcome model for health care practice. Patient outcomes included falls with injury, medication errors and pressure ulcers developed after admission. Patients rated nurse communication, pain control and discharge information provided. Findings: Findings suggest that degree level education, and type of degree, play a role in improving patient-related outcomes. The team with both degree and apprenticeship trained nurses reported the best patient outcomes, which were also attributed to better working conditions and lower levels of hospital bed occupancy. Country-specific factors such as nurse-to-patient ratios and skill mix further affected the care provided by the nursing teams. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the role of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> in improving patient-related outcomes. It also provides new information about hospital-based and country-specific contexts, within which nurses with different educational backgrounds provide care...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that about 2000 people die {{as a result of}} venous thromboembolism (VTE) each year, with a further 30 000 being hospitalized. Prophylaxis significantly reduces VTE morbidity and mortality, and thus represents a real long-term health-care benefit. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to assess the current level of compliance to VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis best practice guidelines within an Australian rural hospital; and (ii) to determine the effectiveness of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> on that compliance. VTE compliance information was obtained from auditing patient notes for a 3 -month period prior to <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> and was repeated after the <b>education.</b> <b>Nurse</b> knowledge of VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis use was also measured. Both compliance with and knowledge of best practice VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis increased following <b>nurse</b> <b>education.</b> Although the sample size was relatively small, this study has shown <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> to be effective at increasing VTE compliance and awareness within an Australian rural hospital. This relatively inexpensive and simple intervention bears consideration and could lead to reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with VTE, as well as reduction in associated health-care costs.

40|$|Background: The European Society of Cardiology and the Council on Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions share a vision; to {{decrease}} the burden of cardiovascular disease in Europe. Nurses represent the largest sector of the health professional workforce and have {{a significant contribution to}} make, which has not yet been fully realised. Recent evidence highlights an association between the level of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> and inpatient mortality making this an important topic, particularly as the provision of <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> in Europe is variable. Aim: To develop a core curriculum to inform the <b>education</b> of <b>nurses</b> following initial qualification for work in cardiovascular settings. Method: A syllabus was developed using published literature, policy documents and existing curricula with expert input from service users, specialist nurses, cardiologists, educationalists and academics. The syllabus formed the framework {{for the development of the}} core curriculum. Results: Eight key themes characterise the core curriculum which are presented together with an account of the development process. While the curriculum is not intended to cover all aspects of the highly complex role of the cardiovascular nurse, the themes do exemplify the science and art of nursing and are transferable across different levels of clinical practice and settings. The curriculum functions both as a ‘map’, which identifies key themes to include in <b>nurse</b> <b>education,</b> and as a ‘tool’ to inform educational provision that bridges’ the gap between initial <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> and advanced specialist practice. Content can be adapted for use to fit the national context and reflects the specific needs, health priorities, legislative and regulatory standards that govern safe nursing practice across different countries. Conclusion: The core curriculum can be used as a learning framework to guide <b>nurse</b> <b>education,</b> in particular the continuing professional <b>education</b> of post-qualifying <b>nurses</b> working in cardiovascular settings. This represents a significant step towards streamlining cardiovascular <b>nurse</b> <b>education</b> in Europ...|$|R
