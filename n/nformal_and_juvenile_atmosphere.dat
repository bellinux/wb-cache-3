40|$|Ten {{years after}} Betsie van der Westhuizen’s (1999) argumentation, this article {{attempts}} {{to take stock}} of the state and place of Afrikaans children’s <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> books in the Afrikaans literary system. By making use of analyses of production profi les, selected published texts in scientifi c journals and the broad media, interviews with role players and histories of publishers, the interaction between the broader Afrikaans literary system – which includes authors, illustrators, publishers, media, reviewers, literary histories, academics, readers and other role players – and the subsystem of children’s <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> literature is investigated synoptically here. The following factors are identifi ed as themes for discussion: (i) restructuring of publishing companies involved in Afrikaans children’s <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> books after 1994; (ii) markets for Afrikaans children’s <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> books; (iii) visibility of Afrikaans children’s <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> books in the broader media; (iv) academic foundation of the genre of Afrikaans children’s <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> books; <b>and</b> (v) development of local authors and illustrators.
