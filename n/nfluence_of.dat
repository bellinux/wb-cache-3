40|$|The {{existence}} and participation of associated ion-pairs in an ionic reac-tion mechanism are demonstrated by rate {{behavior of the}} bromoacetate-thiosulfate ionic reaction. Whereas the salts of the reactants are presumed to provide the ion which takes part in reaction, the electrostatic <b>nfluence</b> <b>of</b> the cations present in solu-tion becomes evident when solvent mixtures other than water are employed. The observed results may be best interpreted by assuming that the thiosulfate ion associated with its cation becomes {{a part of a}} critical complex structure. The size and charge of the cation, and the dielectric constant of the reaction medium, can be correlated with the observed bimolecular rate constants. The nature of the ion-pair involved conforms with a species in which the cation and anion are separated sufficiently that they retain their discrete identities. However, the ion-pair may behave as a single entity with an effective net charge which is the algebraic sum of the cation and anion charges. The latte...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the study were: to characterise h ousehold resources and determine their interdependencies and relationships, {{to find out the}} levels of adoption of dairy production technologies and to estimate milk produc tion levels of crossbred cows and calf growth performance under farm conditions. The study sites Bilalo and Lemmu, are located in the Arsi highland of Ethiopia. The sites were selected because it was in these areas where major crossbreeding and dairy developme nt activities were undertaken by CADU/ARDU/SEAD projects and as the result, crossbre d animals were mainly concentrated here. The methods of data collection were a combination o f formal survey, on-farm performance monitoring and the use of secondary dat a. A total of 204 farmers, 96 from Bilalo and 108 from Lemmu, who reared crossbred dai ry cows, were interviewed once through questionnaires between Jul. 96 -Feb. 97. Ser vice co-operative lists were used to select the farmers in question, in other words, a s ub-population of farmers in the area, i. e. all those with crossbred animals were included in the survey. For dairy performance study, however, a random sampling technique was emp loyed, although accessibility of the area was considered in the selection too. In th is case, 68 farmers, 37 from Bilalo and 31 from Lemmu, with crossbred animals in their herd were monitored for milk production, calf growth and mortality from July 96 to May 98. The information collected included: household size and household age structur e, livestock number and composition, cattle herd composition, cattle breed composition, farm size, cultivated area, grazing area, grain production, costs and inc ome from crop and livestock activities, livestock management practices and information on d airy technology adoption, which were: concentrate feeding, forage cultivation, buck et feeding, pasture fencing, cow shed and AI service utilisation. The recorded milk produ ction and reproductive traits were: lactation length, lactation yield, 305 -days lactati on, annual yield and calving interval. Factors affecting milk yield and reproduction such as upgrading levels, lactation number, season of calving, year of calving and calf rearing method were also recorded. Factors affecting calf growth such as dam upgrading levels, parity, sex, season of birth, year of birth and calf rearing methods were recorded. Calf mortality was also recorded. The overall mean for household size was 7. 9 persons per family with an average household size of 7. 8 and 8. 0 for Bilalo and Lemmu, respectively. The overall mean proportions of children and adults in the area were 61. 3 % and 38. 7 %, respectively. The smallest proportion of the population was for those older than 50 years with overall proportion of only 5. 8 %. The average farm size in the area was 4. 27 ha per h ousehold, 4. 81 ha for Bilalo and 3. 79 for Lemmu. The average cultivated area was 2. 44 ha or 57. 1 % of the farm size, with 2. 67 ha at Bilalo and 2. 22 ha at Lemmu. The average holding of grazing land was 1. 56 ha of 36. 5 % of the farm size with households at bot h sites allocating equivalent amount of area for grazing. Farmers on average allocated 1. 22 ha or 500 /o of the cultivated area to barley, which was the dominant crop in the area. The second most important crop was wheat with an average allocation of 0. 48 ha or 19. 7 %. Teff (Eragrostis abessinica) and linseed occupied the least proportion of cultivated, area at both sites. The annual average amount of fertiliser used per household was 3. 16 q with 3. 95 q and 2. 45 q for Bilalo and Lemmu, respectively. Other inputs such as improved seeds, herbicides and insecticides were very small. The annual average grain output pe r household was 39. 53 q and comparable at both sites. The average livestock holding per household was 21. 24 animals or 11. 86 TLU, with 10. 77 TLU for Bilalo and 12. 83 TLU for Lemmu area. Cattle was the most important animal and constituted on average 80. 4 % (9. 53 TLU) of the live stock herd. The average holdings per household for horses, sheep, asses and goats were 1. 61 TLU (13. 5 %), 0. 42 TLU (3. 5 %), 0. 23 TLU (1. 9 %) and 0. 07 TLU (0. 6 %), respectively. On average, composition of cows was 30. 3 % (2. 89 TLU) of the cattle herd. The propor tion of oxen was the largest in the cattle herd which was 43. 2 %. The overall proportion of cows of local breed (Arsi) in the cattle herd was 16. 60 / 0 (1. 58 TLU) and those of cro ssbred cows was 13. 8 % (1. 31 TLU). The estimated total amount of annual dry matter sup ply per household, which was from crop residues, individual grazing area, fodder cult ivation and purchased concentrates was 17502 for Bilalo and 15722 kg for Lemmu. Crop resid ues provided 51. 2 % and 53. 3 % of the annual dry matter supply per household at Bilal o and Lemmu, respectively. The annual dry matter supply per household from individ ual grazing area was estimated to be 40. 1 % for Bilalo and 44. 4 % for Lemmu. The contribu tions of purchased concentrates and cultivated fodder were small. In the analyses of crop livestock interdependencies, factors affecting grain production, cultivated area and herd size were studied. Among f actors affecting grain yield per household, area cultivated was the only factor whic h affected the annual grain yield per household significantly at both sites. Relationship between grain yield and cultivated area was the highest as evidenced by the regression anal yses. Other factors such as household size, oxen holding and fertiliser amount did not exert significant influences. Cultivated area was, however, significantly influen ced by farm size, cattle holding and sheep holding. Herd size per household was signific antly influenced by household size, cultivated area and grazing area. The significant a nd positive effect of household size on herd size would indicate that farmers can probably change the size of their livestock enterprises much more flexibly than their cropping activities since land is scarce, thereby insuring income and livelihood through larger lives tock herd. Partial correlation analyses among various household resources showed high and s ignificant correlations. The highest correlation was between oxen holding and herd size which was 0. 85 - 0. 90. Results of dairy production technology adoption sho wed that forage cultivation, bucket- feeding and pasture fencing were the least adopted dairy production technologies with less than 40 % adoption rates. Artificial inseminati on was adopted by 46 % of all farmers. The highest adoption rates were for cow shed and co ncentrate feeding with over 60 % adoption rates. The effects of credit, extension and age household heads did not influence the adoption of all dairy production technologies. Cultivated ar ea had positively and significantly affected pasture fencing. The adoption of artificia l insemination was negatively and significantly affected by area cultivated. The rela tionship between crossbred cow herd size and pasture fencing technology was positive an d significant. However, the relationship between labour devoted to crop product ion and the adoption of concentrate feeding and cow shed was negative and significant, suggesting that there was a competition between dairy and crop production for l abour. The effect of formal education on most of the technologies was positive and signif icant for concentrate feeding, evidence of importance of education in technology a doption process. The average contribution of livestock products to g ross farm income of households was 47 %, out of which, 46 % carne from milk and milk pro ducts. The overall average gross margin in the study area was 5852 Birr per year, of which, livestock contributed 56 %. The high contribution of milk and milk products to farmers’ income clearly demonstrates the positive effect of integrating smallholder dair y production in the farming system. Calving intervals of crossbred cows were found to b e very long. The overall means of calving intervals at Bilalo and Lemmu were 558 and 582 days, respectively. Only number of lactation and calving season exerted significant influences. The overall mean for lactation length of crossbred dairy cattle was 363. 5 days at Bilalo and 383. 7 days at Lemmu. Year and season of birth had significantly i <b>nfluenced</b> the lengths <b>of</b> lactation. The overall means for lactation yield, 305 -days lactati on and annual yield were 2235. 9, 1850. 5 and 1460. 6 litres, respectively, for Bilalo. The corresponding figures were 1708. 4, 1477. 7 and 1064. 8 litres, respectively, for Lemmu. Upgrading levels and calf rearing methods significantly influenced the milk yield tra its. High grade and hand milked cows produced higher yields than the low grade and parti ally suckled cows. In the study area, the growth rates of calves were generally poor. Calves reached 60 and 54 kg at 9 months of age at Bilalo and Lemmu, respe ctively. Dam upgrading levels significantly influenced body weights of calves at most ages, with high grade dams producing heavier calves. Parity and sex of calves did not influence body weight at most ages. Calf rearing methods showed significant effec t on body weights of calves at 210, 240 and 270 days at Bilalo with partially suckled c alves being heavier than those bucket- fed calves, At Lemmu, however, calf rearing methods did not influence body weights of calves. Year of birth did not influence body weight s at almost all ages, while season of birth significantly influenced body weights at earl y ages. Mortality rates of calves were 16. 7 and 11, 5 % for B ilalo and Lemmu area, respectively. The main causes of mortality were diarrhoea and bla ckleg diseases, accounting for 27. 8 and 22. 2 % of all mortalities, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 68 - 70. An {{investigation}} {{involving the}} vibratory cavitation erosion of WC-Co alloys was undertaken {{in order to}} determine the mechanisms of material removal. Nineteen grades of WC-Co alloys were studied. These alloys had been previously characterised according to microstructural and mechanical properties. Further characterisation by way of Young's modulus and density of the materials was undertaken. An investigation of the i <b>nfluence</b> <b>of</b> various parameters on cavitation erosion established a binder content dependence on erosion. For two grain sizes, erosion was found to increase to a maximum at 12 vo 1 -% binder content (1. 8 μm grain size) and 23 vol-% binder (2. 8 μm grain size). The main mode of material removal was found to be cobalt removal followed by WC grain pull-out. In high binder content alloys, cobalt removal was predominant with little loss of WC grains. X-ray diffraction showed that the allotropic phase transformation of the binder under cavitational attack was beneficial to the erosion resistance of these alloys. The erosion of low binder content alloys was controlled by the contiguity of the WC skeleton. Maximum erosion occurred at binder contents which corresponded to the combination of a fragile WC skeleton and a small volume of available cobalt for strain induced transformation...|$|E

While {{a growing number of}} both theoretical and empirical studies analyze the <b>nfluence</b> <b>of</b> corporate performance and size or the ownership structure on this decision, the role of multiple board memberships within the CEO recruitment process has been widely neglected so far. The present study is based on panel data of the largest German companies covering the period from 1996 to 2008. Applying competing risk esti- mations we find a weak and positive association between the number of external directorships of the {{supervisory board}} members and internal CEO replacements. Distinguishing between different groups of external board positions, we find that external executives on the supervisory board increase the likelihood of external CEO replacements. In line with empirical findings for the US we argue that external executives improve the assessment of potential CEO successors leading to more outside CEO replacements. In contrast, we find evidence that external supervisory board mandates of the supervisory board members cause more internal CEO replacements. This finding indicates a substitution of external expertise of the executives by multiple supervisory board mandates but could also reflect a reduction of the monitoring intensity of the supervisory board. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Putting {{agricultural}} {{systems on}} a more sustainable path is a crucial policy issue. Within that context, {{the objective of this}} paper is to show how the unsustainable character of current agricultural systems is strongly related to the prevailing rationale of mainstream economics and the Cartesian-Newtonian worldview on which it is founded. Using the example of the ransformation of post-war agriculture in France, our analysis underlines the profound <b>nfluence</b> <b>of</b> the logic of mainstream economics on the modernisation of agricultural systems. The resulting transformation of agricultural systems based on the triptych specialisationintensification-concentration is then further explored regarding its negative impacts in terms of sustainability. Particular attention is dedicated to environmental impacts, given their magnitude and the fact that mainstream economics, because of its “mechanistic reductionist” framework, has intrinsic difficulties in dealing with them. Since the fundamental assumptions of mainstream economics are being strongly challenged, it becomes legitimate to resort to an alternative economic framework for designing appropriate policies and measures. Given that many empirical studies demonstrates that agricultural systems may be locked-in to some extent, the choice an evolutionary line of thought in an ecological perspective is quite straightforward. This approach of economic change both underlines its historically-contingent nature and the role played by systemic interdependencies. Through underlining the pathdependence of agricultural systems, the use of the evolutionary framework in an ecological perspective allows us to shed a new light on their transformation by suggesting some strategies (i. e. niche accumulation and hybridisation) that have proven efficient in overcoming cases of lock-in in other fields...|$|E

40|$|Es wurden 167 Patienten an 171 Hüften in den Jahren 1984 bis 2000 mit einer Hüftgelenktotalprothese versorgt und anhand der Auswertung von Röntgenbildern und Krankenblattunterlagen in einer randomisierten retrospektiven Studie betrachtet. Risikogruppen wurden mit erfasst. Es fanden sich unter den Untersuchten 56 Männer und 111 Frauen. Das vordergründige Untersuchungsziel bestand darin, den Einfluss dreier unterschiedlicher Bestrahlungsfeldgrößen auf die Suppression der Heterotopen Ossifikationen zu erfassen. Zum anderen sollte die Auswirkung des zeitlichen Abstandes des Bestrahlungstermins zum Operationszeitpunkt untersucht werden. Darüber hinaus ging es darum, durch eine umfangreiche Registrierung von Laborparametern und weiterer Kriterien Aufschluss über möglicherweise vorliegende Risikofaktoren für verstärkte Bildung von Heterotopen Ossifikationen zu erhalten. Alle Patienten wurden einzeitig (unfraktioniert) mit einer Herddosis von 7 Gy (ca. 700 rad) bestrahlt. Die Feldgröße betrug in Gruppe 1 (102 operierte und radiotherapierte Hüften) 3 cm x 8, 5 cm bis 5 cm x 10 cm. Gruppe 2 (29 Hüften) wurde mit einer konstanten Feldgröße von 10 cm x 10 cm therapiert. Zuletzt lieferte die Gruppe 3 (40 Hüften) Ergebnisse eines Bestrahlungsfeldes der Größe von 14 cm x 14 cm bis 17 cm x 20 cm. Die Nachuntersuchung erfolgte erstmals 14 bis 16 Wochen nach dem Eingriff und bezog sich primär auf den radiologischen Befund. In Gruppe 1 betrugen die klinisch und radiologisch {{relevante}}n Knochenneubildungen 4, 9 %, und Gruppe 3 war mit 12, 5 % vertreten. Eine Patientin war als „non responder“ zu bezeichnen. Sofern man diese Patientin herausrechnet, beziffern sich die Prozentangaben in Gruppe 1 auf 3, 9 %, in Gruppe 2 auf 0, 0 % und in Gruppe 3 auf 7, 5 % klinisch und radiologisch relevante Knochenneubildungen. Der postoperative Bestrahlungstermin lag zwischen Tag 0 und 6. Dabei wurden 94, 2 % der Hüften innerhalb der Tage 1 bis 4 therapiert. Die Patenten der Gruppen 1 und 2 wurden mittels eines 6 MV-Linearbeschleunigers nachbestrahlt. Die Patienten aus der Gruppe 3 wurden mittels Telekobalt 60 -Isotop radiotherapiert. Ein Einfluss der Strahlengenerierung auf die Ossifikation ließ sich nicht nachweisen. Strahleninduzierte Wundheilungsstörungen fanden sich nicht. Es wurde 39 -mal eine vollzementierte Prothese, 7 -mal eine zementfreie Prothese und 125 -mal eine Hybridprothese implantiert. Ein Zusammenhang zwischen verwendeten Prothesenarten und vermehrter Entstehung von HO konnte nicht aufgezeigt werden. Der operative Zugang erfolgte bei allen Eingriffen über den antero-lateralen Zugang nach Watson-Jones. Bezüglich der Operationsdauer, die im Mittel bei 68 Minuten lag, konnte die bisherige Erfahrung, wonach höhergradige Ossifikationen infolge langandauernder Eingriffe verstärkt auftreten, erneut bestätigt werden. Es wurden multiple labortechnische Parameter analysiert, ohne nachweisbaren Einfluss auf vermehrte HO. Die unfraktionierte Kleinfeldbestrahlung mit 7 Gy, idealerweise zwischen Tag 0 - 2, jedoch nicht später als bis zum 4. postoperativen Tag appliziert, konnte weiterhin als sinnvolle, schonende und für Patient und Personal weniger unaufwendige sowie kostengünstige Therapiestrategie herausgearbeitet werden. Von der Großfeldbestrahlung ist aufgrund schlechterer Ergebnisse hinsichtlich relevanter Ossifikationen und der größeren Strahlenbelastung des Gewebes unter dem Aspekt einer Malignomprävention, künftig besser kategorisch abzusehen. Die Bestrahlung mittlerer Feldgröße lieferte hinsichtlich der Verhinderung höhergradiger Ossifikationen die besten Ergebnisse, jedoch um den Preis einer etwas größeren Strahlenbelastung. Unter dem Aspekt des Schutzes des gesunden Gewebes, sollte künftig im Sinne des Shieldings mit der kleinen oder mittleren Feldgröße therapiert werden. Wobei sich hier bzgl. der Verwendung der Feldgrößen eine Gradwanderung in der Risiko-Nutzen-Relation vollzieht. In {{a random}} and retrospective {{study with the}} help of X-ray photographs and medical reports, the case histories of 167 patients, who between 1984 and 2000 received a total of 171 artificial hip joints, were analyzed. Risk-groups were included. 56 of the patients were male, 111 female. The main objective {{of the study was to}} ascertain the <b>nfluence</b> <b>of</b> the size of the area exposed to radiotherapy with regard to the suppression of heterotopic ossification (HO). Also taken into consideration were the consequences resulting from the length of time between the operation and subsequent treatment with radiotherapy. Further extensive analysis of laboratory parameters and other criteria should reveal the possible presence of a particular risk-factor with regard to the increased tendency towards heterotopic ossification. All patients received a single radiotherapy treatment (one-staged) with a focal dose of 7 Gy. The size of the area exposed to radiation (field quantity) was in group 1 (102 hips) between 3 cm x 8, 5 cm and 5 cm x 10 cm. In group 2 (29 hips) the area exposed to radiation was a constant 10 cm x 10 cm. Group 3 (40 hips) provided findings resulting from an area exposed to radiation which was between 14 cm x 14 cm and 17 cm x 20 cm. The first follow-up examinations were carried out between 14 and 16 weeks after the operation. In many cases the development was recorded over a period of several years. In the first group clinically and radiologically relevant heterotopic ossification occurred in 4, 9 % of the cases discussed. In group 2 the percentage was 0, 0 % and in the third group it was 12, 5 %. One patient (female) was a “non-responder”. If her case is reduced from the total sum, the percentage of clinically and radiologically relative heterotopic ossification is then 3, 9 % for the first, 0, 0 % for the second and 7, 5 % for the third group. The time set for postoperative radiation treatment lay between days 0 and 6. 94, 2 % of the hips were treated between the first and fourth day. The patients from Group 1 and 2 were treated by a 6 MV-linear accelerator. Patients from group 3 (large field quantity) received their treatment by telecobalt 60 -isotope. The radiation generated had apparently no influence to the rate of ossification. Disturbances in the healing process induced by radiation were not recorded. In 39 cases the artificial joint was only secured by fully cemented prosthesis. In 7 cases non cemented prosthesis was used and in 125 cases a hybrid-prosthesis artificial joint was implanted. No difference between the typ of the prosthesis an increase of HO was found. In all cases the operations were carried out via the antero-lateral access using the method perfected by Watson-Jones. As far as the length of the operation is concerned, no new aspects were discovered. The theory that the longer the operation takes the more likely that the tendency towards ossification will increase, was once again shown to be true. Clinical laboratory diagnostics were analyzed with the result that they had no provable influence on increased HO. Results from a linear discriminantal analysis showing, that later dates (norm: 0 - 6 days) for postoperativ radiotherapy could have a positive influence with regard to the prevention of HO (Heterotopic Ossifikation) must be discarded due to the failing selection creteria. The single radiotherapy treatment (one-staged, 7 Gy) with only a small area exposed to radiation (small field quantity), applied ideally between the days 0 - 2, however no later than the fourth day after the operation, can still be considered a sensible, gentle herapy, easy on both patient and hospital staff and at the same time relatively inexpensive. In future it would seem best to avoid exposing large areas (large field quantity) to radiation; as far as relevant ossification is concerned, the results after such treatment improve the chances of contracting cancer. The exposure of medium sized areas (were worse and the increased exposure of healthy tissue to such large doses of radiation medium field quantity) provides as far as the prevention of increased ossification is concerned the best results, although the patient is then submitted to the dangers resulting from increased radiation. Under the aspect of protecting healthy tissue, future radiation treatment should involve the exposure from small to medium areas thus protecting the patient from further injury. However, an evaluation towards a risk / benefit treatmeant for the patient should be concidered...|$|E
