The Jaquith system is a prototype archive server that lets network users archive their own files using automated storage.

Jaquith presents an FTP interface whereby whole files are moved between the client and its storage archive.

A wildcard query mechanism lets users manipulate arbitrary subsets of their files.

40|$|Advances {{in storage}} {{technology}} have made <b>near-line</b> tertiary <b>storage</b> {{a viable alternative}} for database and data warehouse systems. Tertiary storage systems are employed in cases where secondary storage can not satisfy the data handling requirements or tertiary storage is more cost effective option. Tertiary storage devices have traditionally been used as archival storage. The new application domains require on-demand retrieval of data from these devices. This paper investigates issues in optimizing I/O time for a query whose data resides on automated tertiary storage containing multiple storage devices. We model the problem as a limited storage parallel two-machine flow-shop scheduling problem with additional constraints. Given a query, we establish an upper bound {{on the number of}} storage devices for an optimal I/O schedule and provide experimental proof for it.

40|$|Large {{multimedia}} document archives hold most {{of their}} data in <b>near-line</b> tertiary <b>storage</b> libraries for cost reasons. This paper de- velops an integrated approach to the vertical data migration between the tertiary and secondary storage in that it reconciles specu- lative preloading, to mask the high latency of the tertiary storage, with the replacement policy of the secondary storage. In addition, it considers the interaction of these policies with the tertiary storage scheduling and controls preloading aggressiveness by taking con- tention for tertiary storage drives into account. The integrated migration policy {{is based on a}} continuous-time Markov-chain (CTMC) model for predicting the expected number of accesses to a document within a specified time horizon. The parameters of the CTMC model, the probabilities of co-accessing certain documents and the interaction times between successive accesses, are dynami- cally estimated and adjusted to evolving workload patterns by keep [...] ...|$|R

Thus, such libraries have become a crucial component of modern largescale storage servers, given the very large storage requirements of modern applications. Although the subject of optimal data placement (ODP) strategies has received considerable attention for other storage devices (such as magnetic and optical disks and disk arrays), the issue of optimal data placement in tertiary libraries has been neglected. The latter issue is more critical since tertiary storage remains three orders of magnitude slower than secondary storage. In this paper, we address this issue by deriving such optimal placement algorithms. First, we study the ODP problem in disk libraries (jukeboxes) and subsequently, in tape libraries.

Jaquith throughput is about 135 KB/second when archiving small (10 KB) user files to disk buffers. The use of synchronous disk writes by the server to ensure durability of each user file degrades throughput to 40 KB/second. The performance when writing disk buffers to Exabyte or Metrum tape is severely limited by the time to write a hardware filemark. Consequently, it is important to write several megabytes of data between filemarks for good performance.

The first two releases of SDPS, Release A and Release B, will be operational in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Release B will be deployed at eight Distributed Active Archiving Centers (DAAC's). Individual DAAC's will archive different collections of earth science data, and will vary in archive capacity.

It is anticipated that by the year 2001, the Data Server subsystem at the Goddard DAAC must support a <b>near-line</b> data <b>storage</b> capacity of one petabyte.

The ECS project will not undertake major custom development efforts to provide these capabilities. Instead, SDPS and its Data Server subsystem are designed to support initial implementations with current products, and provide an evolutionary framework that facilitates the introduction of advanced COTS products as they become available.

40|$|In today's large {{mainframe}} and supercomputer environment {{there exists}} a continuous demand for increased performance in digital storage systems. The user need for <b>near-line</b> <b>storage</b> capacity is currently doubling every four years. In addition to higher capacity, a desire exists for higher data transfer rates, and longer term database archivability, at lower, and lower cost. Each component of this quartet of demands appears to be insatiable. Magnetic tape technology presently dominates the digital mass storage markets, but the continuous growth of requirements is drawing attention to {{the limitations of the}} technology as an archival mass storage medium. The lowest cost option currently available for long term data storage is to use magnetic tape, although it is not well suited to meeting the need for many tens of years of reliable storage. Today, the majority of magnetic tape mass storage systems are based on the IBM 3480 / 3490 (or compatible) tape drives. These drives offer only moderate transfer rates and relatively small increments of storage, both of which create a logistics problem due to the large numbers of cartridges necessary in a typical system and the time taken to transfer data. Both higher cartridge capacity and data transfer rates are available in some helical scan magnetic tape systems; however, these command a substantially higher price, exacerbating the cost problem, and are not compatible with most installed systems or tape databases...|$|E

This paper describes the policies specifically related to lunar science data. NSSDC presently archives 660 lunar data collections. Most of these data (423 units) are stored offline in analog format. The remainder of this collection consists of magnetic tapes and discs containing approximately 1. 7 TB of digital lunar data. The active archive for NASA lunar data is the Planetary Data System (PDS). NSSDC has an agreement with the PDS Lunar Data Node to assist in the restoration and preparation of NSSDC-resident lunar data upon request for access and distribution via the PDS archival system. Though much of NSSDC's digital store also resides in PDS, NSSDC has many analog data collections and some digital lunar data sets that are not in PDS. NSSDC stands ready to make these archived lunar data accessible to both the research community and the general public upon request as resources allow. Newly requested offline lunar data are digitized and moved to <b>near-line</b> <b>storage</b> devices called digital linear tape jukeboxes. The data are then packaged and made network-accessible via FTP for the convenience of a growing segment of the user community.
