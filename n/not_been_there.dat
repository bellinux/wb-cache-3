The photos were shown to Mangum as a powerpoint presentation, with each photo projected individually to Mangum, instead of displaying all the pictures arrayed together. For the first time, Mangum identified photos of Seligmann, Evans, and Finnerty as her attackers. She also identified {{at least one other}} photo as being a player who was present at the party; further investigation showed he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ten weeks later, a local woman {{turned in}} Froon's blue backpack, {{which she said}} she had found in a rice paddy by a {{riverbank}} near her village of Alto Romero, in the Bocas del Toro region; she said she was sure it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> the day before. The backpack contained two pairs of sunglasses, $83 in cash, Froon's passport, a water bottle, Froon's camera, two bras, and the women's phonesall packed, dry, and in good condition. The women's phones showed that for some hours after the start of their hike someone had dialed 112 (the emergency number in the Netherlands) and 911 (the emergency number in Panama).|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{young man}} accosted Romalis in the medical {{building}} where he works and stabbed him. The doctor was not seriously injured. The criminal was not identified. Several witnesses had seen the attacker waiting for some time before Romalis arrived and even used a restroom in a pharmacy that opens onto the lobby. They described him as a white man in his 20s or 30s wearing a dark grey or black sweatsuit with a hood. When Romalis arrived, the attacker stabbed {{him in the back}} of the lower left ribcage. The man escaped through the parking lot of the building. A parking valet, Jesse Brouwer, chased the attacker for more than a block without success. News reports stated that about an hour before the stabbing, police were called to another clinic, Everywoman's Health Centre because of aggressive anti-abortion protesters on the lawn of the house next door. Three white men, two of whom had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> before, were trying to intimidate women entering the clinic. The staff became so concerned about the level of intimidation that they called police. After police talked to them, the three men left about noon. Romalis was stabbed just before 1 p.m.|$|E

500|$|The English tour raised {{little money}} but {{restored}} Wagner's spirits. On his return he {{began work on}} what {{would prove to be}} his final stage work, Parsifal, a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years. Cosima's influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note, had she <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> On a practical level, when the festival's creditors began to press for payment, Cosima's personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and {{open the door to the}} prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival. For Cosima's birthday on 25 December 1878, Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to Parsifal. The concert also included the Siegfried Idyll; Cosima wrote afterwards: [...] "There stands he who has called forth these wonders, and he loves me. He loves me!".|$|E
500|$|Favre died in {{the summer}} of 1813, and though he was living along the Pearl River, court {{testimony}} by Peter Moran in 1845 stated that he died in Mobile, and had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> long before his death. A letter by Mississippi governor David Holmes, dated August 1, 1813, mentions the [...] "absence of Colonel Favre at Mobile" [...] and [...] "his subsequent death". [...] Favre's daughter Mary stated that he died on July 21, but an obituary that appeared in a New Orleans newspaper on July 20 gives his death date as July 3. Several years after his death, in 1817 or 1818, his widow married Isaac Graves, with whom she had one additional child, and they lived in Pearlington, Mississippi. Graves had been the operator of Favre's schooner, Pearl, and had very little estate, but following his marriage to Favre's widow, he utilized Favre's estate as his own, much to the disadvantage of Favre's heirs.|$|E
500|$|MacLaurin's Hill is a 1,000 yard (910m) long {{section of}} the Second Ridge [...] that connects Baby 700 to 400 Plateau, with a steep slope on the ANZAC side down to Monash Valley. In the coming days Quinn's, Steel's and Courtney's Posts would be built on the slope. The first ANZAC troops to reach the hill, from the 11th Battalion, found that the Turkish {{defenders}} had already withdrawn. As the Australians crested the hill they came under fire from Baby 700, but to their front was a short, shallow slope into Mule Valley. When Major James Denton's company of the 11th Battalion arrived at the hill they started digging in, and soon after received orders from MacLagen to hold the position at all costs. At 10:00 Turkish troops, advancing from Scrubby Knoll, got to within [...] of the Australians on the hill, opening fire at them. Altogether there were {{two and a half}} companies from the 11th Battalion between Courtney's Post, Steele's Post, and Wire Gully. They had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> long before the 3rd Battalion arrived to reinforce them.|$|E

500|$|The bottom {{section of}} Tilden's [...] "promontory" [...] extension, {{the dining room}} {{contains}} the original suite of table and dining chairs designed by Heal's to Churchill's exacting requirements – (see box). An early study for an planned picture by William Nicholson entitled Breakfast at Chartwell hangs in the room. Nicholson, a frequent visitor to Chartwell who gave Churchill painting lessons, drew the [...] study for a finished picture which {{was intended as a}} present for the Churchills' Silver Wedding anniversary in 1933 but, disliking the final version, Nicholson destroyed it. The picture depicts the Churchills breakfasting together, which in fact they rarely did, and Churchill's marmalade cat, Tango. The tradition of keeping a marmalade cat at Chartwell, which Churchill began and followed throughout his ownership, is maintained by the National Trust in accordance with Churchill's wishes. In a letter to Randolph written in May 1942, Churchill wrote of a brief visit to Chartwell the previous week, [...] "the goose and the black swan have both fallen victim to the fox. The Yellow Cat however made me sensible of his continuing friendship, although I had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for eight months".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons was {{the first}} {{successful}} animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like Capitol Critters, Fish Police, and Family Dog, which were expensive and unsuccessful. The Simpsons use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park, Family Guy, King of the Hill, Futurama and The Critic. For Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, [...] "The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation that had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for many, many years... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium." ...|$|E

Then shock took over, and when words wouldn't come a paralyzing feeling did."

2500|$|Clash of the Champions XXIV saw WCW's {{reputation}} {{take another}} hit. In 1993, Ric Flair returned to WCW from his WWF tenure, but was constrained by a no-compete clause from his WWF contract. In response, WCW {{gave him a}} talk show segment on its television shows called [...] "A Flair for the Gold," [...] in the mold of the old [...] "Piper's Pit" [...] segments from 1980s WWF programming starring [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper. During {{a segment of the}} talk show at the Clash, WCW decided to introduce a [...] "mystery partner" [...] for the babyfaces, a masked man known as The Shockmaster. The Shockmaster (Fred Ottman, previously known as [...] "Typhoon" [...] in the WWF) was supposed to crash through a fake wall and intimidate the heels. Instead, he tripped through the wall and fell on his face on live television, inadvertently rendering himself a joke character (despite winning some matches). Dusty Rhodes later claimed that a 2x4 was placed {{on the bottom of the}} wall, which had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> on a successful rehearsal, which caused Ottman to trip and stumble.|$|E
2500|$|The inquest proper began {{early in}} December 2008.

Witness Anne Marie Hannigan claimed that all of her statement had not been read out in court, a statement which she alleged was to have contradicted that of Garda Pádraig Jennings and Garda Pádraig Frawley. She told the inquest that the gardaí had used force when they were arresting Rossiter and his friend, Anthony O'Sullivan, denying that she was making this up for her own satisfaction. A GP described her shock and despair upon her discovery of Rossiter's comatose body. Brian Rossiter's father told the inquest that a detective garda had informed him that his son had taken as many as sixteen ecstasy tablets, was [...] "drunk out of his mind" [...] and [...] "as high as a kite", and yet later toxicology reports showed no evidence of this.|$|E

2500|$|In the 60s and 70s {{a simple}} creationist model {{proposed}} that, [...] "The Flood split the land mass {{into the present}} continents." [...] Steve Austin and other creationists proposed a preliminary model of catastrophic plate tectonics (CPT) in 1994. Their work built on earlier papers by John Baumgardner and Russell Humphreys in 1986. Baumgardner proposed a model of mantel convection that allows for runaway subduction and Humphrey associated mantle convection with rapid magnetic reversals in earth history. Baumgardner's proposal holds that the rapid plunge of former oceanic plates into the mantle (caused by an unknown trigger-mechanism) increased local mantle pressures {{to the point that}} its viscosity dropped several magnitudes according to known properties of mantle silicates. [...] Once initiated, sinking plates caused the spread of low viscosity throughout the mantle resulting in runaway mantle-convection and catastrophic tectonic motion which dragged continents {{across the surface of the}} earth. Once the former ocean plates, which are thought to be denser than the mantle, reached the bottom of the mantle an equilibrium resulted. [...] Pressures dropped, viscosity increased, runaway mantle-convection stopped, leaving the surface of the earth rearranged. [...] Proponents point to subducted slabs in the mantle which are still relatively cool, which they regard as evidence that they have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for millions of years which would result in temperature equilibration.|$|E
2500|$|Once the King was gone, Thiers and {{the other}} Deputies moved quickly to the Chamber of Deputies {{to decide what to}} do next. They had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> long before an immense crowd invaded the Chamber, {{shouting}} [...] "Long live the Republic!" [...] Thiers fled on foot, and made his way back to his house. A new government was quickly formed by the republicans Lamartine and Ledru-Rollin, but Thiers had no part in it. The new interim government quickly decreed the freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and called for new parliamentary elections, in which all men over the age of 21, who had been resident in their home for six months, could vote, raising the number of eligible voters from 200,000 to nine million. The Chamber was expanded to a National Assembly with nine hundred members. New elections were held; [...] Thiers ran as a candidate in Marseille, and, for the first and only time in his career, was defeated. However, on 15 May, the more radical socialists staged effort to seize the government; [...] they invaded the chamber and proclaimed a new government. This time, the Republican National Guard responded quickly to defend the government, recapturing the hall and the government. The socialist deputies who had taken part were expelled from the Assembly, leaving open seats. New elections for the open seats were held on 4 June, and Thiers was elected in four departments; [...] Seine, Gironde, Orne, and Seine-Inferiure. He chose to be deputy for Seine-Inferieure.|$|E
2500|$|During his January 1989 {{visit to}} Shevardnadze Najibullah wanted {{to retain a}} small {{presence}} of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and called for moving Soviet bombers to military bases close to the Afghan–Soviet border and place them on permanent alert. Najibullah also repeated his claims that his government could not survive if Massoud remained alive. Shevardnadze again repeated that troops could not stay, since {{it would lead to}} international outcry, but said he would look into the matter. Shevardnadze demanded that the Soviet embassy created a plan in which at least 12,000 Soviet troops would remain in Afghanistan either under direct control of the United Nations or remain as [...] "volunteers". The Soviet military leadership, when hearing of Shevardnadze's plan, became furious. But they followed orders, and named the operation Typhoon, maybe ironic considering that Operation Typhoon was the German military operation against the city of Moscow during World War II. Shevardnadze contacted the Soviet leadership about moving a unit to break the siege of Kandahar, and to protect convoys from and to the city. The Soviet leadership were against Shevardnadze's plan, and Chernyaev even believed it was part of Najibullah's plan to keep Soviet troops in the country. To which Shevardnadze replied angrily [...] "You've <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> [...] You've no idea all the things we have done there in the past ten years." [...] At a Politburo meeting on 24 January, Shevardnadze argued that the Soviet leadership could be indifferent to Najibullah and his government; again, Shevardnadze received support from Kryuchkov. In the end Shevardnadze lost the debate, and the Politburo reaffirmed their commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan. There was still a small presence of Soviet troops after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and special forces and reconnaissance troops still operated in the [...] "outlying provinces", especially along the Afghan–Soviet border.|$|E

2500|$|In season 2, {{although}} she has initial success with getting the all-ages club TRIC opened, and with encouraging Haley to perform at the club, which eventually fuels Haley's {{desire to be a}} singer, Peyton begins to get involved with cocaine. She feels alone, as her father is away again, and she does not know where Jake is. She feels down that everyone is dealing with their issues and not helping her or realizing that she is upset and going through a difficult time in her life. She is accused of being a lesbian by Felix Taggaro and faces public humiliation when he writes DYKE on her locker, just so his sister, Anna Taggaro, will not be presumed a lesbian (it is later revealed that Anna is bisexual, but also uses the word gay to assert her sexuality). Hope comes for Peyton, who is in deep despair and about to buy some cocaine, when Jake comes back into her life; it turns out that an argument between Lucas and Peyton made Lucas realize that he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> for Peyton, and felt she needed someone else. As a result, {{he was the one who}} called Jake, knowing that Jake would have a positive effect on her. This does, and sparks a turnaround for Peyton, and she and Jake fall in love. This happiness is short-lived, as Nicki comes back wanting custody of Jenny. Nicki eventually takes Jenny away from Jake and runs off, causing Jake to run after her, which leaves Peyton alone and heartbroken. Soon, someone named Ellie Harp gets in contact with Peyton saying that she is from Alternative Press magazine and wants to do an interview. When Peyton starts receiving strange e-mails from someone named WATCHMEWATCHU, she begins to suspect that it is Ellie. Ellie, however, denies sending the e-mails and shockingly informs Peyton that she is her mother. The finale ends with a crying, bewildered Peyton on a beach, and Lucas coming to comfort her.
