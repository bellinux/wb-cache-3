5000|$|Example {{taken from}} the Journal of Biology, Volume 3, Issue 2.:The hydrodynamics of dolphin draftingby Daniel Weihs, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.Abstract:BackgroundDrafting in {{cetaceans}} {{is defined as the}} transfer of forces between individuals without actual physical contact between them. This behavior has long been surmised to explain how young dolphin calves keep up with their rapidly moving mothers. It has recently been observed that a significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> become permanently separated from their mothers during chases by tuna vessels. A study of the hydrodynamics of drafting, initiated inmechanisms causing the separation of mothers and calves during fishing-related activities, is reported here.ResultsQuantitative results are shown for the forces and moments around a pair of unequally sized dolphin-like slender bodies. These include two major effects. First, the so-called Bernoulli suction, which {{stems from the fact that}} the local pressure drops in areas of high speed, results in an attractive force between mother and calf. Second is the displacement effect, in which the motion of the mother causes the water in front to move forwards and radially outwards, and water behind the body to move forwards to replace the animal's mass. Thus, the calf can gain a 'free ride' in the forward-moving areas. Utilizing these effects, the neonate can gain up to 90% of the thrust needed to move alongside the mother at speeds of up to 2.4 m/s. A comparison with observations of eastern spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) is presented, showing savings of up to 60% in the thrust that calves require if they are to keep up with their mothers.ConclusionsA theoretical analysis, backed by observations of free-swimming dolphin schools, indicates that hydrodynamic interactions with mothers play an important role in enabling dolphin calves to keep up with rapidly moving adult school members.© 2004 Weihs; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Four commercial Saskatchewan ranches with 7 breeding groups collaborated in this study, where all potential sires and progeny were sampled to determine the sire of each calf. Expected vs observed calf {{data were analyzed using}} Chi-square analysis. In all but 2 of the 7 breeding groups, it was determined that each bull sired a different (P< 0. 01) <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves.</b> Age of sire was found to effect (P< 0. 01) bull prolificacy or <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> sired. A bull prolificacy index (BPI) was developed to compare which bulls are siring more or less than expected number of progeny. All bulls were required to pass a breeding soundness exam (BSE) before breeding season, therefore weak correlations were found between scrotal circumference (R 2 = 0. 04) or percent normal sperm (R 2 = 0. 13) and BPI values. No sire match ranged from 2 - 7 % of calves tested. Testing only calves born in the 3 rd week of calving, indicated that bulls could be assigned accurately to high or low prolificacy categories, but bulls with the fewest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> sired could not be detected. Economic models were developed to evaluate the value of adopting parentage testing on farm using a cost benefit analysis. The model showed bulls that sired more calves had a lower cost per calf sired. Based on the model, if bulls were siring < 25 calves it would be more economical to use AI in the breeding program. The model also determined that if one bull was causing increased dystocia rates in a herd, testing calves from difficult births to cull responsible bulls did provide an economic return on investment to the operation. There is potential to increase overall bull prolificacy in a herd and increase other economically important traits by using DNA parentage to aid in sire selection...|$|E
30|$|The {{average age}} at which cows in our sample gave birth to their first calf was 4.5 years old. The average age of cows that had a calf on the rope was 7.5 years. The average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> that cows in our sample had {{produced}} was two {{with a minimum of}} one and a maximum of six. The reproductive history of the cows allowed us to estimate a calf mortality rate of 14 % (30 of the 222 calves had died). There were no statistically significant differences between mobile and sedentary herds for age at first calving, average age of mothers with current calves, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> per cow, or calf mortality (Table 1). Only three observed abortions were reported amongst all the cows surveyed: two among the mobile herds and one among the sedentary herds.

Finally, herd fertility crudely measured as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> on the calf rope as percentage {{of the total number of}} animals in the herd was 13 % for sedentary herds and 26 % for mobile herds (Table 1). Because the calves on the calf rope are less than six months old, these rates are not the annual fertility rates. All the numbers reported here are within the range observed in other studies in the region (Moritz 2003; Njoya et al. 1997).

40|$|Abstract: This report {{describes}} the first translocation of reindeer Rangifer tarandus from South Georgia to the Falkland Islands, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Reindeer were introduced from Norway to the subantarctic island of South Georgia on three occasions {{in the early}} 1900 s by Norwegian whalers, and today they exist as two discrete herds, numbering approximately 2600 individuals in total. Because of concerns over the impact on native vegetation, the long-term eradication of reindeer from South Georgia has recently been proposed. A translocation of reindeer to the Falkland Islands was undertaken in 2001 by the Falkland Island Government with two objectives: (1) to preserve the genetic resources {{of at least one}} of the South Georgia herds; and (2) to facilitate the diversification of the agricultural sector of the Falkland Islands by establishing a commercial reindeer herd. Techniques developed and used in North America for the successful relocation <b>of</b> large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>calves</b> were adopted for the translocation. A total <b>of</b> 59 <b>calves</b> (26 females and 33 males) were successfully translocated from South Georgia to the Falklands Islands in 2001, and subsequently produced their first offspring in 2003. Good husbandry practices and an understanding of biology and behaviour are essential for the successful translocation of reindeer...|$|R

Little difference in rebreeding was attributed to calving difficulty, although heifers that had Caesarean deliveries rebred about two weeks later than those giving natural birth...|$|R
