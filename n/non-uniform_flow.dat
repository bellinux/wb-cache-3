40|$|This paper investigates why the {{observed}} critical Shields stress for incipient sediment motion deviates from the Shields curve. This deviation {{is often described}} in the literature as due to measurement errors and non-uniformity of channel-bed slope or flows. On the contrary, this paper hypothesises the deviation as due {{to the presence of}} vertical velocity in open channel flows. We found that the existence of vertical velocity in <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flows</b> can lead to the deviation of critical shear stress from the standard Shield 2 ̆ 7 s diagram that is valid only in uniform flows, and the channel bed slope could not contribute to the flow 2 ̆ 7 s non-uniformity. The new hypothesis was successfully tested with the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, a new theory for critical shear stress has been developed, which shows that the decelerating flows promote the mobility of sediment, but accelerating flows constrain its mobility. A unified critical Shields stress for sediment transport has been established, that can predict the critical shear stress for sediment initial motion in both uniform and <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{entrance region}} {{refers to the}} area of a pipe where fluid entering a pipe develops a velocity profile due to viscous forces propagating from the interior wall of a pipe. This region is characterized by a <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow.</b> The fluid enters a pipe at a uniform velocity, then fluid particles in the layer in contact with the surface of the pipe come to a complete stop due to the no-slip condition. Due to viscous forces within the fluid, the layer in contact with the pipe surface resists the motion of adjacent layers and slows adjacent layers of fluid down gradually, forming a velocity profile. For the conservation of mass to hold true, the velocity of layers of the fluid {{in the center of the}} pipe increases to compensate for the reduced velocities of the layers of fluid near the pipe surface.

A time harmonic boundary integral solution is proposed for low Mach number potential <b>flows</b> with small <b>non-uniform</b> mean <b>flow</b> velocities and a free-field Green’s function is recovered {{to solve the}} corresponding kernel. The boundary integral formulation {{can be used as}} a means of solving both wave extrapolation and boundary element problems. For boundary element solutions to external sound propagation, the non-uniqueness issue is worked around by extending the conventional combined Helmholtz integral equation formulation and the Burton–Miller approach to <b>non-uniform</b> mean <b>flows.</b> Nonetheless, the proposed integral formulation is shown to be consistent with a combination of the physical models associated with the Taylor and Lorentz transforms. The combined Taylor–Lorentz transformation allows mean flow effects on acoustic wave propagation to be resolved by using a standard boundary integral formulation for the Helmholtz problem with quiescent media in a transformed space. Numerical experiments are performed to benchmark the proposed integral formulations against finite element solutions based on the linearised potential equation. Numerical examples are also used to validate a weakly-coupled approach exploiting the proposed integral formulations in order to predict forward fan noise installation effects. Nonetheless, the integral formulations in a transformed space are used to simulate mean flow effects based on standard boundary element solvers for quiescent media. The results suggest that, for low Mach numbers, boundary element solutions to wave propagation with <b>non-uniform</b> mean <b>flows</b> represent a good approximation of finite element solutions based on the linearised potential equation.

40|$|LectureIn {{the case}} of {{centrifugal}} compressors, minor <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> upstream of the impeller is induced by an asymmetrical configuration in the circumferential direction at the compressor suction casing. This <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> is transmitted to the impeller discharge, but this minor <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> does not usually cause an adverse effect on the impeller stage performance. However, we found this is amplified at the return channel due to flow separation at reduced flows (depending on return channel geometry), and the amplified <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> did induce impeller stall by reverse propagation from the return channel to the impeller. These non-uniform flows caused a significant operating range reduction for a large flow coefficient impeller. The aerodynamics issues were mitigated using CFD analysis techniques, and eventually confirmed by the compressor performance during shop performance testing. The OEM conducted the CFD analyses using two (2) return channel geometries with several CFD models to verify {{the effect of the}} return channel geometry on impeller stall and to confirm the most suitable CFD modeling method for stall evaluation. Shop performance tests utilizing both return channel geometries were conducted and compared to the CFD analyses. These studies were conducted while collaborating with the end-user.

The modeling of diffuser and return channel was varied as follows: 1) 1 -pitch model for the return channel with mixing plane at diffuser? 2) Full-annulus model for the return channel with a mixing plane at the diffuser? 3) Full-annulus model for the return channel without a mixing plane at the diffuser. From the above studies and the shop performance testing, it was confirmed that the proposed CFD modeling method could simulate the measurements taken during the shop performance tests and that the CFD modeling method utilized was key to properly evaluating stall phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The flow characteristics, such as {{velocity}} profiles and turbulence intensities, are of high practical {{relevance in}} the assessment of riverbed stability. So far, the Shields diagram remains the most widely accepted approach for defining the initiation of sediment motion. However, it faces a number of shortcomings. In principle, it is only valid for uniform flow conditions and, under <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> conditions, it fails to account properly for the influence of turbulence in sediment entrainment. In this paper, we focus on a more detailed description of quasi-uniform and <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics {{in the vicinity of the}} critical flow conditions for inception of motion of gravel beds. Laboratory experiments were designed, involving two configurations. First, the entire bottom of the flume was paved with stones of uniform diameter (8 or 15 mm), leading to quasi-uniform flow conditions. Second, the flume bottom was smooth upstream of the zone of measurement while the downstream part was covered with gravels, leading to a sudden smooth-to-rough transition. The flow velocity was obtained by acoustic measurements and the turbulence intensity was calculated for both configurations. By fitting the velocity profile to a modified logarithmic law, the shear velocity was estimated. Standard approaches for predicting the threshold of motion, initially developed for uniform flows, were compared to other methods, based on depth-averaged turbulence kinetic energy, recently proposed in literature for <b>non-uniform</b> <b>flow</b> conditions.
