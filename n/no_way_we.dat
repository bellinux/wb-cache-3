500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the game stems {{primarily from the}} graphic {{manner in which the}} player executes enemies. In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence. We all knew there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> could explain away that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{wrote in}} his review of the episode; [...] "As with many epic sagas, the story and action in “Game of Thrones” are driven largely by {{characters}} moving toward and eventually becoming the people {{they are supposed to}} be. While we tend to focus on the big-ticket destinies, whether it’s Daenerys Targaryen emerging triumphantly from the flames last week or Jon Snow rising from the dead to fight again, the smaller figures have their own slots to fill." [...] James Hunt of What Culture noted, [...] "The Door ... delivered not only the best episode of the season to date, but one that is likely to go down as an all-time favourite." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "The Door was BRUTAL in its final minutes, and you're still crying over it, admit it." [...] Lauren O'Callaghan of SFX Magazine wrote in her review, [...] "The Door, was the midseason episode. <b>No</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> were getting through that without taking some serious damage to our delicate hope-filled hearts." [...] She gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5.|$|E
500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very concerned, because {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> were going to put an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of [...] and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good {{foundation on which}} to base [...] "a new chapter" [...] in the Pirates series. Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, [...] "but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." [...] However, they denied {{that it would be a}} straight version of the novel: [...] "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." [...] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, [...] "kind of a James Bond sort of thing", instead of the [...] "designed to be a trilogy" [...] structure of the previous installments. They hoped to [...] "design a story that would support new characters," [...] as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to [...] "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.|$|E

He said that, [...] "We went in after those targets... which would hurt the enemy's defense system, {{so that we could}} operate." [...] Lavelle cited the example of a January 1972 observation of 55 to 60 tanks 11 miles north of the DMZ.

2500|$|What {{was from}} a spectator's {{perspective}} a remarkable series—a closely fought 1-0 victory by lowly New Zealand against the then unofficial cricket world champions—was marred by acrimony and complaints from the teams involved. [...] The West Indies maintained their bitterness towards the umpiring after the series, with Rodriguez complaining that the umpiring had not been biased so much as incompetent and that the West Indies had been [...] "set up; that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> could win a Test." [...] Lloyd later conceded, however, {{that he should have}} taken a firmer line with his players and that some of the incidents had not been {{in the best interests of}} the game. [...] New Zealand's Goodall, however—the principal target of the West Indies' anger—compounded the bitterness by allegedly making racist comments about the West Indies at an after-dinner speech following the series.|$|E
2500|$|Although Team USA {{would win}} all eight {{games in the}} 1996 Olympics, with the closest game being a 15-point victory over Japan, VanDerveer was not certain of victory, even as the team was {{en route to a}} 52–0 pre-Olympic record against college and {{national}} teams. After beating the Cuban national team on May 26, 1996, in Townsville, Australia, the team record reached 44–0. In their next game against the Ukraine national team, played in Adelaide on May 14, the USA team won again, but VanDerveer was not happy. Ukraine, at full strength, was not {{the best team in the}} world, and was not seen to be as strong as Russia or Brazil. Moreover, Ukraine was expected to add better players before the Olympics, yet the USA team won by only 11 points, 62–51. VanDerveer recalled worrying at the time: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can play like this and win a gold medal." ...|$|E

With over eleven million views, it was the third-highest viewed trailer on YouTube {{in the second quarter}} of 2014. NetherRealm Studios said they are only working on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game.

[...] "The courts should punish him and he should be put to death," [...] said Kabul dweller Abdul Zahid Paymen. Mohammed Qadir agrees that he must be executed: [...] "According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because Christianity is forbidden in our land". Abdul Rahman's neighbor remarked: [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> are going to allow an Afghan to insult us by becoming Christian." [...] Religious intellectual Shahnawaz Farooqui, speaking on Abdul Rahman's conversion, said [...] "he will have to be executed… If somebody at one point affirms the truth and then rejects it or denies it, it would jeopardize the whole paradigm of truth. This is such a big offense that the penalty can only be death.
