Increased use of helicopters for commercial applications and public awareness of aircraft noise are cited as factors making development of helicopter noise standards necessary both {{for the protection of the}} environmental interest of the community and to ensure the orderly growth of the helicopter industry itself. Noise sources, technology trends in helicopter design, and design concepts to control helicopter noise are discussed along with the regulatory background and specific helicopter regulatory concepts...|$|R
50|$|The {{class has}} {{undergone}} updates; {{other than the}} lower-geared class 66/6 produced for Freightliner, most of the updates have been in relation to conforming to specifications for exhaust particulate emissions.Despite being popular with rail operators, especially due to its high reliability, the class has not been universally successful: one recurring problem has been driver comfort. In particular, noise levels (including noise from the cab horn), vibration, and excessive cab-temperatures in hot weather have brought serious complaints. The cab is not isolated from the main frame, causing engine noise to be the dominant background noise; notwithstanding the implications for safety (audibility of warning signals etc.), {{and the potential for}} hearing damage in the long term, the conditions drivers face led to threats of industrial action in the UK in 2007, and an agreement for increased pay for drivers using this type of locomotive (in Norway). By modifying using noise absorbing materials EMD succeeded in meeting TSI <b>Noise</b> <b>Certification</b> <b>standards</b> in 2008. Tests on retrofitted cooling systems and improved seating have been carried out on some UK locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Air transportation, {{while having}} many benefits, has raised {{numerous}} environmental concerns, {{one of the}} most contentious being aircraft noise. Thus, the national and international communities have been forced to take measures to cope with this problem, seeking to balance the needs of all interested parties. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the aircraft noise problem on the national and international levels. Each chapter highlights a distinct area of the problem. Chapter 1 covers the technical aspects of aircraft noise measurement, as well as recounts the general history, sources and effects of aircraft noise. Chapter 2 focuses specifically on the <b>noise</b> <b>certification</b> <b>standards</b> developed by the United States and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Chapter 3 discusses the liability issues of aircraft noise on the international level, concentrating primarily on the 1952 Rome Convention and on attempts to formulate an international instrument dealing with Liability for Damage Caused by Noise and Sonic Boom. Chapter 4 examines liability issues in the United States, defining various legal theories available. Finally, Chapter 5 articulates some methods that have helped to reduce or to mitigate the effects of aircraft noise in noise-sensitive areas...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} one of the most {{controversial}} environmental concerns in the aviation industry, partly due to the difficulty in harmonizing countries' regulation regarding this issue. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the ways in which aircraft noise is regulated at the national and international levels, and to compare the legislative responses to aircraft noise issues in Europe and North America. Each of the four main chapters of the thesis takes into consideration a different aspect of the problem. The first chapter describes the objective and subjective ways of measuring aircraft noise. This process is necessary in order to allow the legislation to meet its purpose, namely, to protect the environment, the sources of the aircraft noise, and the effects of the aircraft noise on people. The second chapter describes the evolution of aircraft noise issues at the national levels in the US and throughout the EU, respectively, as well as at the international level, such as at the ICAO. The third chapter analyses the EU Regulation 925 / 1999, which created tension between the EU and the US due to its alleged discriminatory nature. This thesis examines the arguments of both sides. Finally, the fourth chapter analyses the <b>noise</b> <b>certification</b> <b>standards</b> developed by ICAO, namely the "balanced approach"...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{are likely to}} impose some restrictions on {{the next generation of}} supersonic commercial transport. There is a global concern over the effects of engine emissions on the ozone layer which protects life on Earth from ultraviolet radiation. There is also some concern over community noise. The High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) must meet at least the current subsonic <b>noise</b> <b>certification</b> <b>standards</b> to be compatible with the future subsonic fleet. Concerns over sonic boom represent another environmental and marketing challenge to the HSCT program. The most attractive feature of the supersonic transport is speed, which offers the traveling public significant time-savings on long range routes. The sonic boom issue represents a major environmental and economic challenge as well. Supersonic operation overland produces the most desirable economic results. However, unacceptable overland sonic boom raise levels may force HSCT to use subsonic speeds overland. These environmental and economic challenges are likely to impose some restrictions on supersonic operation, thus introducing major changes to existing route structures and future supersonic network composition. The current subsonic route structure may have to be altered for supersonic transports to avoid sensitive areas in the stratosphere or to minimize overland flight tracks. It is important to examine the alternative route structure and the impact of these restrictions on the economic viability of the overall supersonic operation. Future market potential for HSCT fleets must be large enough to enable engine and airframe manufacturers to build the plane at a cost that provides them with an attractive return on investment and to sell it at a price that allows the airlines to operate with a reasonable margin of profit. Subsonic overland operation of a supersonic aircraft hinders its economic viability. Ways to increase the market potential of supersonic operation are described...|$|R

Findings – The high variation in Lean Six Sigma <b>certification</b> <b>standards</b> makes it very difficult to judge the actual competence of a certified Belt and to evaluate a Lean Six Sigma program in organisations. As such, the need for a globally accepted <b>certification</b> <b>standard</b> is identified, similar to what is already in place for other professions.

As the standard demands higher quality, {{the costs of}} proving that higher quality (which are different than the costs of producing a higher quality good) increase. The cost of certification is also {{a function of the}} quality of the good (Q) because when the product quality is below the <b>certification</b> <b>standard,</b> it forces a producer who wants certification to take costly action to “cover up” deviations from the standard.

40|$|Auralization of {{aircraft}} flyover noise provides an auditory experience that complements integrated metrics obtained from system noise predictions. Recent efforts {{have focused on}} auralization methods development, specifically {{the process by which}} source noise information obtained from semi-empirical models, computational aeroacoustic analyses, and wind tunnel and flight test data, are used for simulated flyover noise at a receiver on the ground. The primary focus of this work, however, is to develop full vehicle auralizations in order to explore the distinguishing features of NASA's N+ 2 aircraft vis [...] vis current fleet reference vehicles for single-aisle and large twin-aisle classes. Some features can be seen in metric time histories associated with aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>certification,</b> e. g., tone-corrected perceived noise level used in the calculation of effective perceived noise level. Other features can be observed in sound quality metrics, e. g., loudness, sharpness, roughness, fluctuation strength and tone-to-noise ratio. A psychoacoustic annoyance model is employed to establish the relationship between sound quality metrics and <b>noise</b> <b>certification</b> metrics. Finally, the auralizations will {{serve as the basis for}} a separate psychoacoustic study aimed at assessing how well aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>certification</b> metrics predict human annoyance for these advanced vehicle concepts...|$|R
