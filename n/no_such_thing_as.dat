5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a collective clan crest, just as there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a clan coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her there are <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock {{the door of the}} same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E

25|$|In Wicca, {{there is}} <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> hell because Wiccans largely {{do not believe}} in the concept of {{punishment}} or reward.
