25|$|In digital {{electronics}} terminology, {{the binary}} NAND gate and the binary <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> {{are the only}} binary universal logic gates.|$|E
25|$|NOR and NAND flash {{get their}} names from the {{structure}} of the interconnections between memory cells. In NORflash, cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines, allowing cells to be read and programmed individually. The parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a CMOS <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b> In NANDflash, cells are connected in series, resembling a NAND gate. The series connections consume less space than parallel ones, reducing the cost of NANDflash. It does not, by itself, prevent NAND cells from being read and programmed individually.|$|E
25|$|While the Block I version used 4,100 ICs, each {{containing}} a single three-input <b>NOR</b> <b>gate,</b> the later Block II version (used in the crewed flights) used 2,800 ICs, each with dual three-input NOR gates. The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor-transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack. They were connected via wire wrap, and the wiring was then embedded in cast epoxy plastic. The {{use of a}} single type of IC (the dual NOR3) throughout the AGC avoided problems that plagued another early IC computer design, the Minuteman II guidance computer, which used a mix of diode-transistor logic and diode logic gates.|$|E
50|$|This example {{assumes the}} Apollo parts inventory: 3-input <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> only, but the {{discussion}} is simplified by supposing that 4-input <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> are also available (in Apollo, those were compounded out of pairs of 3-input NORs).|$|R
5000|$|If no {{specific}} <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> are available, {{one can be}} made from NAND gates, because NAND and <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> are considered the [...] "universal gates", meaning that they {{can be used to make}} all the other gates.|$|R
50|$|If no {{specific}} OR gates are available, {{one can be}} made from NAND or <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> in the configuration shown in the image below. Any logic gate {{can be made from}} a combination of NAND or <b>NOR</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But {{certainly}} it is always to the Condition of Fire, where emotion is not brought to any sudden stop, where there is neither wall <b>nor</b> <b>gate,</b> that we would rise; and the mask plucked from the oak-tree is but my imagination of rhythmic body.

6000|$|For years Bedford Park was {{a romantic}} excitement. At North End {{my father had}} {{announced}} at breakfast that our glass chandelier was absurd and was to be taken down, and a little later he described the village Norman Shaw was building. I had thought he said, [...] "there {{is to be a}} wall round and no newspapers to be allowed in." [...] And when I had told him how put out I was at finding neither wall <b>nor</b> <b>gate,</b> he explained that he had merely described what ought to be. We were to see De Morgan tiles, peacock-blue doors and the pomegranate pattern and the tulip pattern of Morris, and to discover that we had always hated doors painted with imitation grain and the roses of mid-Victoria, and tiles covered with geometrical patterns that seemed to have been shaken out of a muddy kaleidoscope. We went to live in a house like those we had seen in pictures and even met people dressed like people in the storybooks. The streets were not straight and dull as at North End, but wound about where there was a big tree or for the mere pleasure of winding, and there were wood palings instead of iron railings. The newness of everything, the empty houses where we played at hide-and-seek, and the strangeness of it all, made us feel that we were living among toys. We could imagine people living happy lives as we thought people did long ago when the poor were picturesque and the master of a house would tell of strange adventures over the sea. Only the better houses had been built. The commercial builder had not begun to copy and to cheapen, and besides we only knew the most beautiful houses, the houses of artists. My two sisters and my brother and myself had dancing lessons in a low, red-brick and tiled house that drove away dreams, long cherished, of some day living in a house made exactly like a ship's cabin. The dining-room table, where Sinbad the sailor might have sat, was painted peacock-blue, and the woodwork was all peacock-blue and upstairs there was a window niche so big and high up, there was a flight of steps to go up and down by and a table in the niche. The two sisters of the master of the house, a well-known pre-Raphaelite painter, were our teachers, and they and their old mother were dressed in peacock-blue and in dresses so simply cut that they seemed a part of every story. Once when I had been looking with delight at the old woman, my father who had begun to be influenced by French art, muttered, [...] "imagine dressing up your old mother like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|This is made {{by joining}} the inputs of a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b> As a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> is {{equivalent}} to an OR gate leading to NOT gate, this automatically sees to the [...] "OR" [...] part of the <b>NOR</b> <b>gate,</b> eliminating it from consideration and leaving only the NOT part. output= NOT(A+A) ...|$|E

50|$|If no {{specific}} XNOR gates are available, {{one can be}} made from four <b>NOR</b> <b>gates</b> or five NAND gates in the configurations shown below. In fact, any logic gate {{can be made from}} combinations of only NAND <b>gates</b> or only <b>NOR</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|R
50|$|An XOR gate {{is made by}} {{connecting}} the output of 3 NOR gates (connected as an AND gate) and the output of a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> to the respective inputs of a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b> This expresses the logical formula (A AND B) NOR (A NOR B). This construction entails a propagation delay three times that of a single <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
50|$|An AND gate gives a 1 output {{when both}} inputs are 1; a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate</b> gives a 1 output only when both inputs are 0. Therefore, an AND gate {{is made by}} {{inverting}} the inputs of a <b>NOR</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
