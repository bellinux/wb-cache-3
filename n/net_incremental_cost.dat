40|$|Abstract-If {{fuel cells}} are {{introduced}} for vehicular applications, hydrogen might become an energy carrier for transport applications. Manufacture via steam-reforming {{of natural gas}} is a lowcost option for hydrogen production. This study deals with the feasibility of combining the production of hydrogen from natural gas with CO 2 removal. When hydrogen is produced from natural gas, a concentrated stream of CO 2 is generated as a by-product. If manufacture is carried out near a depleted natural gas field, the separated CO 2 can be compressed and injected into the field and securely sequestered there. The incremental cost of the produced hydrogen (for CO 2 compression plus transport, injection and storage) would typically be about 7 % relative to the case where the separated CO 2 is vented. Moreover, CO 2 injection leads to enhanced natural gas recovery {{as a result of}} reservoir repressurization. Though the extra natural gas is somewhat contaminated with CO 2, it is a suitable feedstock for hydrogen production. Taking credit for enhanced natural gas recovery reduces the penalty for sequestration to a <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of typically 2 %. These cost penalties are much lower than those typical of CO 2 removal schemes associated with electricity production. Attention is required for optimum plant siting in order to keep CO 2 transport costs low...|$|E
40|$|The Fistula First Initiative {{set a goal}} of 66 % {{arteriovenous}} (AV) fistula-based access among US hemodialysis patients. This study modeled {{the impact}} of achieving the target AV fistula placement rate on Medicare expenditures and on dialysis patient survival and also reviewed economic disincentives for providers that will inhibit achieving this target. The model projects lifetime costs and survival in the US 2003 incident hemodialysis population. Annual treatment costs were estimated from previous analyses of Medicare expenditures by access modality. Patient survival by mode of access was derived from the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS). These parameters were applied to a cohort of patients who meet the 66 % AV fistula target and an identical cohort with the current vascular access case mix. Comparison of outcomes yields estimates of differential total expenditures and total patient life-years. If prevalence AV fistula-based access in the 2003 incident hemodialysis cohort were 66 % rather than the observed 35 %, then the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services would save $ 840 million in access-attributed expenditures over the expected lifetime of these patients. However, population survival would increase by 35, 000 additional life-years, increasing total lifetime expenditures by a net of $ 1. 4 billion. Relative to the current mix of access modality, the shift to 66 % AV fistula would be achieved at a <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of $ 40, 000 per year of life gained. Economic barriers to reaching this goal include financial disincentives to providing adequate predialysis care, performing AV fistula surgical procedures, and monitoring vascular access flow.

40|$|Davies et al. (1), {{presenting}} {{the results of}} a survey conducted in Europe, showed that health economics assessments do not {{play an important role in}} decision-making processes. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) (2) investigated in 2003 the use of economic health information, they evidenced that the main issue affecting the relevance of these studies is that do not explore budgetary impact, in fact the Cost-Effectiveness-Analysis gives as information the cost-effectiveness ratio measurement indicating the value for money from a therapy, but it says nothing about total cost. On the other hand, the decision maker is often more concerned about affordability, which depends on the overall budgetary impact. The local decision maker, waiting on local community, are also interested to the impact that a new strategy have in health and social terms relevant to the population of interest with its particular epidemiological and demographic characteristics, by means a contextualised information. Mauskopf et al. (3) affirm that impact evaluations have to include a classification of the policy-maker’s information needs and a full and detailed breakdown of resource uses, costs and expected results in health terms. This method, described by Mauskopf et al. and defined “cost-consequence analysis”, systematically sets out, and measures the value of, the variables that should be taken into consideration in health intervention decision-making. Objective: The main objective is define the methodology to calculate some indicators of intervention’s effects on a local setting which are useable and useful for local decision-maker process about resource planning and management. In particular this study will evaluate the economic, health and social impact of the introduction in the Veneto region of Italy of new cancer drug, Trastuzumab a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that shows a high binding affinity with the Her- 2 /neu protein and is capable of inhibiting Her- 2 /neu-mediated malignant transformation of epithelial cells. We explore the indication for early breast cancer treatment, this drug intervention is in addition to standard therapy. Methods: The methodology to calculate the four useful indicator in a perspective of a decision maker is: 1) TARGET POPULATION INDICATOR. The first indicator useful for decision-making purposes is the target population, that is, the number of residents who, in accordance with measures the frequency of disease like incidence and with clinical appropriateness criteria, are potential users of the innovative drug in a year. 2) 	 HEALTH INDICATORS. The proportion of subjects saved by the therapy or proportion who receive a benefit from therapy 3) INDICATOR OF ECONOMIC IMPACT. This indicator corresponds to the <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> generated by the use of the new drugs. This impact is measured considering the difference between the costs and the savings generated by the use of the new drug. 4) INDICATOR OF SOCIAL IMPACT. It was assumed that the indicators denotes the number of children saved from losing their mother by the introduction of the project. The statistical method used to work out the health-social-economic indicators will be the Markov model. This model is particularly useful for analysing events that can occur, even repeatedly, in an unspecified moment in time, such as, for example, the onset and development of a tumour. A Markov model is composed of a finite number of exhaustive and mutually exclusive states of health. From a temporal point of view, the analysis is divided into equal intervals defined Markov cycles. Markov models was implemented through cohort simulations or Monte Carlo analyses to produce a sort of trace from which it is possible to observe the movement of the cohort among the different states of health and to estimate the efficacy and overall cost associated with each of them, estimating not only mean, efficacy and cost values, but also some of the characteristics of their distribution, such as standard deviations. Markov models can all be derived from a basic model composed of the following four states of health: (1) presence of tumour; (2) presence of local relapse tumour; (3) metastasis; (4) death. A patient with a localised tumour can remain in this state or move into another state: metastasis or deceased. Death is, by definition, the “state of absorption”, i. e., the state from which, once entered, it is no longer possible to move to other states. Results TARGET POPULATION INDICATOR The new cases each year of breast cancer in Region Veneto are 4209 cases, among which the new cases are in a range of 527 to 751. HEALTH INDICATORS The incremental benefit of Trastuzumab are 32 avoided died in four years. INDICATOR OF SOCIAL IMPACT 14 orphan avoided INDICATOR OF ECONOMIC IMPACT The average cost of a treated patients with Trastuzumab is 60. 096 euro (range 40. 874 - 79. 497) instead the average cost for teat a patient with standard therapy is 4644 euro (range 9. 338 - 33. 966). The incremental cost in four years are 28. 000. 000. Discussion: It is clear that a public policy-maker that is enabled to appreciate clearly all the costs of a health intervention in a population will be far better equipped to negotiate with its own industrial interlocutors (providers) than it would be (or is, in many cases) in the absence of this information. At this purpose is very useful the indicator estimating the <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>cost.</b> Furthermore as was debate by Ann Barrett, when a institution decide to adopt a new technology, it has to provide extra funding and suggest what cuts should be made to release these extra funds.

40|$|Background: Recent {{randomised}} {{trials have}} demonstrated {{a statistically significant}} effect of trastuzumab on disease-free survival when used as adjuvant therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER 2) -positive resectable early stage breast cancer, with a treatment course lasting either 9 or 52 weeks. However, the cost effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab with respect to mortality remains uncertain, especially in an Australian setting. Objective: To estimate the cost effectiveness of trastuzumab in Australia, in a cohort of 50 -year-old patients with HER 2 -positive breast cancer over a lifetime, using (i) disease-free survival and cardiotoxicity data from recent randomised trials; (ii) information on long-term survival of patients with treated primary breast cancer; and (iii) costs of treating local and distant relapses and disease from causes other than breast cancer. Methods: A Markov model consisting of four health states (remission, loco-regional recurrence, metastatic disease and death) was developed. Transition probabilities corresponded to patterns of relapse and metastases seen in recent trials. The model was run until age 100 years to allow calculation of average survival. Outcome measures were life-years and QALYs (calculated using utility weights reported in the literature). The model was calibrated to reflect literature evidence {{that the risk of}} breast cancer recurrence following primary treatment diminishes progressively to zero after about 20 years. It was assumed that the morbidity benefit of trastuzumab observed in trials would be present for 5 years but would then diminish progressively to zero after 8 years. Costs (year 2005 values) and benefits were discounted at 3 % per annum. Results: For every 1000 patients treated with a 52 -week course of trastuzumab, there were 136 fewer breast cancer deaths (relative risk reduction 28 %). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were Australian dollars ($A) 13 _ 730 per year of life saved (YOLS) and $A 22 _ 793 per QALY. The <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> was $A 56. 3 million ($A 414 _ 012 /cancer death avoided). Cost effectiveness declined (ICER_=_$A 27 _ 734 /QALY) in older patients (age 65 years at treatment initiation). The ICER was driven mainly by the drug acquisition costs, the assumption of the duration of benefit and the discount rate. Cost offsets from reduced costs of treating recurrent or metastatic breast cancer during follow-up were present but these factors were of less importance according to sensitivity analyses. The 9 -week treatment schedule approached economic dominance (ICER_=_$A 1700 /QALY) because of decreased costs, improved relative risk for prevention of metastases and more cancer deaths avoided (196). Conclusion: The results suggest that trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer may be cost effective when given over either 52 or 9 weeks at current acquisition costs in Australia. However, the overall budget impact of the 52 -week course is significant, and the 9 -week course appears economically attractive.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine from a {{societal}} perspective, the relative cost-effectiveness of diabetes prevention through promotion of behavioural change by GPs, compared to current GP practice. For policy and practical relevance, the initiative is examined as a stand-alone program, as well as nested within the context of a public health program for the reduction of cardiovascular disease(CVD). The `piggy-backed' design reflects the joint risk factors shared by non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and CVD, together with significant cost savings and, potentially, improved rates of participation and adherence. Results are compared to recent cost-effectiveness findings for NIDDM prevention through media campaigns and other settings (weight loss clinics and the workplace). Methods A hypothetical NIDDM program is evaluated, where estimated costs are based upon recent trials of multiple risk factor reduction programs in Australia. Program effectiveness in reducing Body Mass Index (BMI), the impact of that weight reduction on the incidence of NIDDM, and the associated mortality effects, are drawn from a survey of studies reported in the literature on dietary and lifestyle change. The value of health care savings from a fall in NIDDM is estimated and deducted from program cost to provide an estimate of the net cost of the NIDDM initiative. Central to the methodology is disease modelling incorporating the literature findings. A simple Markov model has been utilised, which includes age specific all-cause mortality estimates adjusted for overweight and metabolic status. Available evidence on current practice suggests that preventive care within GP consultations is provided to approximately 22 % of those who are overweight (BMI > 24. 9), with verbal advice being the most usual approach. Screening for associated pathology occurs infrequently, either for cholesterol levels (6 % of eligible patients) or NIDDM (25 % of eligible patients). The benefits of current weight related preventive activity are assumed to be reflected in the current incidence of NIDDM. The annual cost of care for current cases of NIDDM has been estimated at $ 1, 800 per patient. The costs and benefits of current practice are deducted from the costs and benefits of the NIDDM program to provide the incremental impact of the new initiative. Results Using a 5 % discount rate, <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per life year saved is estimated to be approximately $ 63, 000, if implemented as an independent program, or $ 4, 000 if piggy-backed onto a CVD intervention. One of the problems in considering the efficiency of the hypothetical NIDDM program evaluated is the great variability in results. Sensitivity analysis reveals a wide range of outcomes under varied but plausible assumptions. For the NIDDM program run in `stand-alone' mode, cost-effectiveness varies from $ 96, 000 per life year through to $ 18, 500 per life year. In other words, the hypothetical NIDDM program could be excellent value-for-money or a white elephant. Such variability casts particular importance on understanding the nature and predictability of the program's costs and outcomes. While some cost containment measures can improve efficiency (`piggy-backing' the program, reducing set-up costs and overheads, use of nurses in patient recruitment), others can dramatically reduce efficiency (ie decreasing GP participation). Apart from the stand-alone/piggy-backing decision and reduced set-up costs, the major improvements in efficiency all come from improvements in effectiveness. The extent of GP participation, patient recruitment criteria and participation rates, as well as the level and duration of weight loss are all major determinants. Of these factors, GP participation and patient selection criteria seem the most amenable to improvement through program design. The extent and duration of weight loss will be harder to control. The results suggest that irrespective of what improvements are achieved in GP participation and in the economy of program establishment, the share of program funding that is likely to go into program establishment and management, should focus attention on what potential exists for co-ordinating related health promotion campaigns that address shared or related risk factors, and in better utilising existing infrastructure (such as Divisions of General Practice). Comparison with other NIDDM primary prevention programs suggests that some caution is warranted in encouraging general practitioners into behavioural modification programs. The results of our study suggest that an economic case for their involvement is yet to be demonstrated. This is consistent with the findings of other researchers on promoting lifestyle change in general practice (Ashenden et al. 1995; Salkeld et al. 1995). The answer to the question of whether GP-led behavoural change for weight reduction is `value-for-money' is therefore: `possibly, but proceed with caution'. The analysis suggests that smaller health gains achieved over a more broadly defined `at risk' group (ie only requiring one risk factor, such as overweight) is more cost-effective than larger gains achieved for a more selectively defined `at risk' group (ie overweight plus second CVD risk factor). Further, despite the impact of discounting, weight loss maintained over a long period (ie 25 years) is more cost-effective than larger weight loss achieved for shorter periods (ie 5 years). This confirms the view that lifestyle changes that can be sustained over the longer period are better than dramatic changes that cannot be sustained. It also suggests that more effort should be put in to the maintenance of newly acquired healthy behaviours, vis-a-vis effecting the change in the first place. Finally, while recipients of new health promotion initiatives often receive subsidised services and pay a lower percentage of total program costs than under the `status quo', it is often forgotten that in absolute terms they are being asked to give more and maintain it over longer periods. Failure to recognise the absolute/relative cost differential may lead to unrealistic expectations of patient compliance and health cost offsets...|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether meal fatty acids influence insulin and glucose responses to mixed meals and whether these effects can be explained by variations in postprandial NEFA and Apo, which regulate the metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (Apo C and E). A single-blind crossover study examined the effects of single meals enriched in saturated fatty acids SFA), n- 6 PUFA and MUFA on plasma metabolite and insulin responses. The triacylglycerol response following the PUFA meal showed a lower <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> area under the curve than following the SFA and MUFA meals (P < 0. 007). Compared with the SFA meal, the PUFA meal showed a lower <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> area under the curve for the NEFA response from initial suppression {{to the end of the}} postprandial period (180 - 480 min; P < 0. 02), and both PUFA and MUFA showed a lower <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> glucose response (P < 0. 02), although insulin concentrations were similar between meals. The pattern of the Apo E response was also different following the SFA meal (P < 0. 02). There was a significant association between the <b>net</b> <b>incremental</b> NEFA (180 - 480 min) and glucose response (r(s) = 0. 409, P= 0. 025), and in multiple regression analysis the NEFA response accounted for 24 % of the variation in glucose response. Meal SFA have adverse effects on the postprandial glucose response that may be due to greater elevations in NEFA arising from differences in the metabolism of SFA- v. PUFA- and MUFA-rich lipoproteins. Elevated Apo E responses to high-SFA meals may have important implications for the hepatic metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins...|$|R

Main outcome measures. <b>Incremental</b> <b>cost</b> effectiveness ratio of P-NMES, compared to slings and anti-inflammatory injections. Results. The <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> effectiveness ratio (ICER) of p-NMES, compared to anti-inflammatory injections is € 6, 061 (± 3, 285). The <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of the first quality-adjusted life year after implantation of the P-NMES device compared to anti-inflammatory injections is € 33, 007 (± 5, 434).

40|$|Abstract: Recently the {{potential}} development of green architecture {{in our country}} is huge, but inaccurate control of green building’s <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> is the key reason for restricting its development. After analyzing influencing factors of green building’s <b>incremental</b> <b>cost,</b> four influencing factors are put forward:technical measures, project regions,fixed position and time to research feasibility. On basis of the factors, the ways are proposed to reduce green building’s <b>incremental</b> <b>cost,</b> which provides theoretical basis {{for the development of}} green architecture. introduction China has promoted green building thoroughly,but people still have misunderstanding about green building’s cost at present: cost of building will increase much when connecting with “green”. Green building signifies high cost. Professionals in architecture and real estate also overestimate green building’s cost that even reaches up to 300 %. The reason that causes misunderstanding is the choice of pilot projects with relatively high price in previous green real estate; the theory of high technological mansion is propagated greatly. Although the primary investment cost of green building is higher than normal building, we should also notice the profit brought by green building except <b>incremental</b> <b>cost.</b> （ 1 ）direct benefit-energy conservation and expense-saving produced by incrementa...|$|R
