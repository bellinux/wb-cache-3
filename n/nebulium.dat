50|$|The green {{emission}} {{lines of}} the Cat's Eye Nebula at 4959 and 5007 Ångström were discovered by William Huggins in 1864. Because no known element was showing these emission lines in the experiment it was concluded in the late 1890s that a new element was responsible for that lines, it was called <b>nebulium.</b> Bowen was able to calculate the forbidden transitions of doubly ionized oxygen to be exactly where the lines had been found. The low probability for collisions in the nebula {{made it impossible for}} the oxygen to get from the excited stated to the ground state and so the forbidden transitions were the main path for the relaxation. Bowen published his findings in 1927 and concluded that <b>nebulium</b> was not really a chemical element.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nebulium</b> was a {{proposed}} element found in astronomical observation of a nebula by William Huggins in 1864. The strong green emission {{lines of the}} Cat's Eye Nebula, discovered using spectroscopy, led to the postulation that an as yet unknown element was responsible for this emission. In 1927, Ira Sprague Bowen showed that the lines are emitted by doubly ionized oxygen (O2+), and no new element was necessary to explain them.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, John William Nicholson {{theorized that}} all known {{elements}} consisted of four protoelements, {{one of which}} was Nebulium.The development of the periodic table by Dimitri Mendeleev and the determination of the atomic numbers by Henry Moseley in 1913 left nearly no room for a new element. In 1914 French astronomers were able to determine the atomic weight of <b>nebulium.</b> With a measured value of 2.74 for the lines near 372 nm and a slightly lower value for the 500.7 nm line indicating two elements responsible for the spectrum.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{analyses of}} the star's spectrum are descriptions of visual observations from 1869, of prominent emission lines [...] "C, D, b, F, and the principal green nitrogen line".

50|$|CELs {{are only}} seen in gases {{at very low}} densities (typically less than a few {{thousand}} particles per cm³) for forbidden transitions. For allowed transitions, the gas density can be substantially higher. At higher densities, the reverse process of collisional de-excitation suppresses the lines. Even the hardest vacuum produced on earth is still too dense for CELs to be observed. For this reason, when CELs were first observed by William Huggins in the spectrum of the Cat's Eye Nebula, {{he did not know}} what they were, and attributed them to a hypothetical new element called <b>nebulium.</b> However, the lines he observed were later found to be emitted by extremely rarefied oxygen.|$|E
5000|$|The green hue was {{a puzzle}} for astronomers {{in the early}} part of the 20th century because none of the known {{spectral}} lines at that time could explain it. There was some speculation that the lines were caused by a new element, and the name <b>nebulium</b> was coined for this mysterious material. With better understanding of atomic physics, however, it was later determined that the green spectrum was caused by a low-probability electron transition in doubly ionized oxygen, a so-called [...] "forbidden transition". This radiation was all but impossible to reproduce in the laboratory at the time, because it depended on the quiescent and nearly collision-free environment found in the high vacuum of deep space.|$|E
5000|$|Ira Sprague Bowen {{was working}} on UV {{spectroscopy}} and on the calculation of spectra of the light elements of the periodic table when {{he became aware of}} the green lines discovered by Huggins. With this knowledge he was able to suggest that the green lines might be forbidden transitions. They were shown as due to doubly ionized oxygen at extremely low density, rather than the hypothetical <b>nebulium.</b> As Henry Norris Russell put it, [...] "Nebulium has vanished into thin air." [...] Nebulae are typically extremely rarefied, much less dense than the hardest vacuums produced on Earth. In these conditions, lines can form which are suppressed at normal densities. These lines are known as forbidden lines, and are the strongest lines in most nebular spectra.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of {{telescopic}} astronomy, the word nebula was used to describe any fuzzy patch of light that did not look like a star. Many of these, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra that looked like stellar spectra, and these turned out to be galaxies. Others, such as the Cat's Eye Nebula, had very different spectra. When William Huggins looked at the Cat's Eye, he found no continuous spectrum like that seen in the Sun, but just a few strong emission lines. The two green lines at 495.9 nm and 500.7 nm were the strongest. These lines did not correspond to any known elements on Earth. The fact that helium had been identified by the emission lines in the Sun in 1868, and had then also been found on Earth in 1895, encouraged astronomers to suggest that the lines were due to a new element. The name <b>nebulium</b> (occasionally nebulum or nephelium) was first mentioned by the wife of Huggins in a short communication in 1898, although it is stated that Huggins occasionally used the term before.|$|E
50|$|Confirmation of Herschel's {{hypothesis}} {{of star formation}} had to wait another hundred years, when William Huggins together with his wife Mary Huggins turned his spectroscope on various nebulae. Some, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra quite {{similar to those of}} stars, but turned out to be galaxies consisting of hundreds of millions of individual stars. Others looked very different. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Orion Nebula and other similar objects showed {{only a small number of}} emission lines. In planetary nebulae, the brightest of these spectral lines was at a wavelength of 500.7 nanometres, which did not correspond with a line of any known chemical element. At first it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named nebulium—a similar idea had led to the discovery of helium through analysis of the Sun's spectrum in 1868.

40|$|Spectrophotometry of {{the nucleus}} of the X-ray galaxy NGC 2110 shows a typical Seyfert Type 2 {{spectrum}} with a strong galactic continuum. The widths of the forbidden lines are about 360 km/s (FWHM), H-beta being somewhat broader. The moderate Balmer decrement implies that the interstellar reddening is approximately 2. 1 mag. The average electron density and temperature in the line-emitting region are approximately 300 per cu cm and 35, 000 K, respectively. From measurements of the <b>nebulium</b> line, it is found that the extent of the nucleus measured along the major axis of the galaxy is about 10 arcsec (2100 pc) and the full range of gas velocities is about 700 km/s. A direct plate is discussed which shows faint spirallike features in NGC 2110, a galaxy currently classified as elliptical. NGC 2110 is a member of a new class (about 5 members) of very nearby (cz less than 2500 km/s) X-ray galaxies. Bradt et al. (1978) tentatively concluded that they are Seyfert Type 2 galaxies. This conclusion is supported, and it is shown that this is not inconsistent with the narrowness (less than 500 km/s FWHM) of their emission line...|$|E
