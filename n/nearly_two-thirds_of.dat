5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. <b>Nearly</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} {{efficient}} algorithms for modular reduction to derive novel systolic and non-systolic archi-tectures for polynomial basis finite field multipliers over GF (2 m) {{to be used}} in Reed-Solomon codec. Using the proposed algorithm for unit degree reduction and optimization of implementation of the logic functions in the processing elements (PE), we have derived an efficient bit-parallel systolic design for finite field multiplier which involves <b>nearly</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the area-complexity of the existing design having the same time-complexity. The proposed modular reduction algorithms are also used to derive efficient non-systolic serial/parallel designs of field multipliers over GF (28) with different digit-sizes, where the critical path and the hardware-complexity are further reduced by optimizing the implementation of modular reduction operations and finite field accumulations. The proposed bit-serial design involves nearly 55 % of the minimum of area, and half the minimum of area-time complexity of the existing bit-serial designs. Similarly, the proposed digit-serial/parallel designs involve significantly less area, and less area-time complexities compared with the existing designs of the same digit-size. By parallel modular reduction through multiple degrees followed by appropriate logic-level sub-expression sharing; a hardware-efficient regular and modular form of a balanced-tree bit-parallel non-systolic multiplier is also derived. The proposed bit-parallel non-systolic pipelined design involves less than 65 % of the area and <b>nearly</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the area-time complexity of the existing bit-parallel design for a Reed-Solomon codec, while the non-pipelined form offers nearly 25 % saving of area with less time-complexity.
