40|$|In urban economics, {{and more}} {{recently}} in the international economics literature, agglomeration has been offered as a principal determinant of new investment. Yet agglomeration has rarely been subject to precise statistical tests. In this paper, the availability of detailed urban and regional data for Portugal allowed for a close study of the spatial choices for <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> foreign-owned <b>plants.</b> It appears that agglomeration economies are decisive location factors. Service agglomeration has a notably strong effect, while industry-level localization economies and urbanization externalities are verifiable location determinants as well. Distance from the princi-pal cities is statistically significant, {{but there is no}} evidence that local labor costs matter. Q 2000 Academic Press I...|$|R
5000|$|In 1949 {{a former}} BMW {{engineer}} then {{known for his}} work on early post-war racing cars and named Hermann Holbein acquired the production rights for the car. One year later, Holbein introduced the Champion, which would be assembled at the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> Champion Automobilwerke <b>plant</b> in Paderborn until 1952. In 1952 production was taken over by the Ludwigshafen based [...] "Rheinische Automobilfabrik Hennhöfer & Co" [...] company. When this business went into liquidation a Dane named Henning Thorndahl took charge of assembling the vehicles until October 1954 when the last car was produced.|$|R
40|$|The native Hawaiian flora {{is under}} severe stress because of habitat loss {{and effects of}} {{invasive}} plants and animals introduced into the ecosystem. These factors are threatening to push many of the endemic species to extinction. In an effort to provide a broad genetic base from which research projects on native species may be initiated, DNA was isolated from endemic and indigenous species from Hawai'i, Kaua'i, Uina'i, Maui, Moloka'i, and O'ahu and included in a <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> Native Hawaiian <b>Plants</b> DNA Library. DNA accession numbers and collection information are presented for 206 species representing 75 families and 128 genera...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the food}} crops, yam takes up quantitatively {{the first place}} in the {{gabonese}} diet. Unfortunately, it can stay available only 6 to 7 months in the year because of difficulties of harvest and post- harvest. This problem is little studied in the case of Dioscorea cayenensis-D. rotundata complex. In order to optimize the use of micro tubers for the growing in green house or field, it is important to control the duration of storage before the germination. The present study concerns microtubers obtained by in vitro culture. When microtubers were harvested (after 9 months of culture) and directly transferred on a new medium without hormone, the tubers rapidly sprouted in in vitro conditions. Harvested microtubers were also stored dry in jars in sterile conditions during 2 to 18 weeks before in vitro sprouting. In this case, microtubers stored during 18 weeks sprouted more rapidly than those stored 8 weeks. The size of the tubers used for the storage had great influence on further sprouting. The upper microtubers in 25 mm can be kept to the darkness, under 50 % of relative humidity, in 25 °C during at least 18 weeks. Sprouting is 100 % whatever the substrate of culture. The plant tissue culture technique constitutes a serious alternative for the preservation of plant kinds and for the production of planting material. These techniques allow multiplying in a short time of thousands of copies of new varieties of <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> <b>plants.</b> These in vitro plants can be used on one hand, for the production planting material, {{and on the other hand}} for ex vitro storage of breeding grounds with decelerated growth, to struggle against genetic erosion. These results should allow improving in practice the multiplication of yam, while guaranteeing phytosanitary qualities. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{symbolic}} approach for classification {{of plant leaves}} based on texture features is proposed. Modified Local binary patterns (MLBP) is proposed to extract texture features from plant leaves. Texture of plant leaves belonging to same plant species may vary due to maturity levels, acquisition and environmental conditions. Hence, the concept of clustering is used to choose multiple class representatives and the intra-cluster variations are captured using interval valued type symbolic features. The classification is facilitated using a simple nearest neighbor classifier. Extensive experiments {{have been carried out}} on <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> UoM Medicinal <b>Plant</b> Dataset as well as publically available Flavia, Foliage and Swedish plant leaf datasets. Results obtained by proposed methodology are compared with the contemporary methodologies. The Outex dataset is also considered for experiments and the results are promising even on this synthetic dataset...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to explore the {{survival}} factors of <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> firms. To do this we have mobilized the survival theories of the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> company while taking into account theories that analyze the success and failure of <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> companies. In this paper, we studied the concepts around the new company. We based on theories that deal with {{the life cycle of}} the company, by which we talked about the survival of the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> company that is a spiral between success and failure (e.g., Khelil et al., 2010).|$|R

40|$|Four {{models are}} {{employed}} in the landscape change detection of the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland. The models include ones for patch connectivity. ecological diversity, human impact intensity and mean center of land cover. The landscape data of the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland in Yellow River Delta in 1984, 1991, and 1996 are produced from the unsupervised classification and the supervised classification {{on the basis of}} integrating Landsat TM images of the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland in the four seasons of the each year. The result from operating the models into the data shows that the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland landscape in Yellow River Delta had a great chance. The driving focus of the change are mainly from natural evolution of the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland and rapid population growth, especially non-peasant population growth in Yellow River Delta because a considerable amount of oil and gas fields have been found in the Yellow River Delta. For preventing the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland from more destruction and conserving benign Succession of the ecosystems in the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> wetland, six measures are suggested on the basis of research results.
