30|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{little research}} has been done on using this technique to design an experiment evaluating the impact of chemical coagulation addition to improve the performance of decolorizing dye wastes. The purpose of this experiment is {{to determine the effects of}} varying pH, dye weight, current density, applied coagulant, and dose on the color removal of azo dyes (Acid Yellow 11 (AY 11) and Acid Orange 7 (AO 7)) and <b>nitroso</b> <b>dye</b> Naphthol Green B (NGB) by electrocoagulation using a Box Behnken experimental design.|$|E
30|$|<b>Nitroso</b> <b>dyes</b> are {{prepared}} by nitrosation {{of the appropriate}} phenol or naphthol. They are generally metal complex derivatives of o-nitrosophenols or naphthols. <b>Nitroso</b> <b>dyes</b> are polygenetic because they form differently colored complexes with different metals. They have good light fastness.|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} conducted {{analyzed the}} color removal of both azo and <b>nitroso</b> <b>dyes.</b> Azo dyes {{are one of}} the most popular dyes present in the textile industry as these dyes represent 50  % of the total dyes present. Azo dyes contain one azo group (–N=N–). Acid Yellow 11 and Acid Orange 7 are examples of low-molecular azo dyes (Hunger 2003). Azo dyes are also anionic and very water soluble (Verma et al. 2012). Körbahti (2007) explains the degradation of both azo and <b>nitroso</b> <b>dyes</b> by means of electrochemical treatment. According to the authors, the products of azo dye degradation include carbon dioxide, nitrates, and sulfates with intermediates of aromatic esters, phenols, aromatic carboxyl acids, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons. On the other hand, <b>nitroso</b> <b>dyes</b> consist of o-nitrosophenols or naphthols used on dyeing animal skins and silk (Hunger 2003). Dyes from nitro and nitroso groups are usually degraded into amino groups (Körbahti 2007). It is possible that similar degradation patterns occur within electrocoagulation. Acid Yellow 11, Acid Orange 7, and Naphthol Green B were chosen because they represent a small sample of dyes within these categories. In addition, these dyes have also been decolorized using other treatment methods which allows for a comparison between the chemical coagulation addition of ECF and other treatment methods.|$|R
30|$|Nitro and <b>nitroso</b> <b>dyes</b> are minor {{commercial}} {{importance and}} constitute {{only a fraction}} of the total dyes market. Nitro dyes have simple chemical structures. They are small aromatic molecules which contain minimum one nitro group and one or more amino or hydroxy groups. Initially, the nitro dyes were acid dyes which were used for dyeing the natural animal fibers i.e. wool and silk. Picric acid was the first synthetic nitro dye which imparted a greenish-yellow color to silk but could not be used for longer period of time because of its toxicity and poor fastness properties.|$|R
50|$|The main use {{of sodium}} nitrite {{is for the}} {{industrial}} production of organonitrogen compounds. It is a reagent for conversion of amines into diazo compounds, which are key precursors to many dyes, such as diazo <b>dyes.</b> <b>Nitroso</b> compounds are produced from nitrites. These {{are used in the}} rubber industry.|$|R
