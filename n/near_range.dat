60|$|By {{this time}} it was daybreak, and our danger, within <b>near</b> <b>range</b> of the other monitors, of course became very great. Just then an {{incident}} occurred which might have proved fatal to us. Our screw fouled, and the boat became unmanageable. Observing this, a Turkish launch from one of the monitors bore down upon us. One of our sailors, who chanced to be a good diver, jumped over the side and cleared the screw. Meanwhile the men opened so heavy fire on the enemy's launch that she veered off, and a few minutes later we were steaming down the Danube towards the place from which the boats had set forth on their deadly mission.|$|E
60|$|We resumed our way: Suez {{now stood}} near. In the blue {{distance}} rose the castellated peaks of Jabal Rahah {{and the wide}} sand-tracts over which lies the land-route to Al-Hijaz. Before us the sight ever dear to English eyes,-a strip of sea gloriously azure, with a gallant steamer walking the waters. On the right-hand side the broad slopes of Jabal Mukattam, a range of hills which flanks the road {{all the way from}} Cairo. It was at this hour a spectacle not easily to be forgotten. The <b>near</b> <b>range</b> of chalk and sandstone wore a russet suit, gilt where the last rays of the sun seamed it with light, and the deep folds were shaded with the richest purple; whilst the background of the higher hills, Jabal Tawari, generally known as Abu Daraj (the Father of Steps), was sky-blue streaked with the lightest plum colour. We drew up at a small building called Bir Suways (Well of Suez); and, under pretext of watering the cattle, I sat for half an hour admiring the charms of the Desert. The eye never tires of such loveliness of hue, and the memory of the hideousness of this range, when a sun in front exposed each gaunt and barren feature, supplied the evening view with another element of attraction.|$|E

5000|$|Molecules {{interact}} {{at close}} range through intermolecular forces (the [...] "van der Waals forces"), which cause minute shifts of the electron density distributions (relative the distributions of electrons when the molecules are not interacting). Intermolecular forces are repulsive at <b>near</b> <b>range,</b> where electron exchange forces dominate the interaction, and attractive at somewhat greater separations, where the dispersion forces are active. (If separations are further increased, all intermolecular forces fall off rapidly and may be totally neglected.) Repulsion and attraction are due, respectively, to the small defects or excesses of electron densities of molecular complexes {{in the space between}} the interacting molecules, which often result in interaction-induced electric dipole moments that contribute some to interaction-induced emission and absorption intensities. The resulting dipoles are referred to as exchange force-induced dipole and dispersion force-induced dipoles, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Primarily the {{treatment}} is for a condition called presbyopia. Laser Blended Vision can be achieved through laser eye surgery, usually performed as LASIK, although surface laser eye surgery PRK or LASEK {{can be used to}} produce the effect. Laser Blended Vision works by increasing the depth of field of each eye through subtle changes in the optics of the corneal spherical aberration. The increase in depth of field allows for the eyes to be corrected {{in such a way that}} the dominant eye is set for distance and intermediate vision while the non-dominant eye sees best in the intermediate to <b>near</b> <b>range.</b> Because of the similarity in the visual performance of each eye in the intermediate range the brain is able to fuse the images between the eyes rendering a binocular visual environment. This is in contradiction to traditional monovision where the image disparity between the eyes is too high for image fusion by the brain and instead the brain needs to apply suppression of the blurred eye in order to perceive a clear visual field. In Laser Blended Vision, the eyes are effectively working together to allow good vision at near, intermediate and far, without the use of glasses. The effects of Laser Blended Vision tend to last between 5 and 10 years but can be further adjusted by enhancement procedures.|$|E

40|$|Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes (PMSE), {{which are}} {{regularly}} observed in summer months at polar latitudes, are strong radar backscatter {{from the upper}} mesosphere. They have been studied with ground-based radars whose frequency ranges from VHF to UHF. Recently, peculiar echos, which are interpreted as PMSE, were found {{to appear in the}} <b>near</b> <b>range</b> observations of Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). This suggests a possibility that SuperDARN becomes a powerful tool for studying PMSE as a global scale phenomenon. In this paper, we statistically analysed occurrence frequency of the near backscatter echoes using two years measurements of the SuperDARN radars in Antarctica and Iceland. Occurrence percentage of the <b>near</b> <b>range</b> backscatter is enhanced significantly in summer months. Maximum is located at the summer solstice, where occurrence percentage reaches 80 - 90 % in Iceland and 70 - 80 % in Antarctica. Local time distribution of the echo occurrence has its maximum around local noon and minimum at 20 LT. These characteristics of the <b>near</b> <b>range</b> echoes are quite similar to those of PMSE at VHF frequencies, which implies that <b>near</b> <b>range</b> observation of SuperDARN contains huge amount of PMSE. Interhemispheric difference of the echo occurrence probabilities are also estimated. Occurrence percentage averaged over summer months is 1. 5 times larger in the Northern Hemisphere than that in the Southern Hemisphere, suggesting that occurrence of PMSE has actually an interhemispheric asymmetry. However, degree of interhemispheric asymmetry is much smaller than that predicted from the earlier VHF radar observation...|$|E
