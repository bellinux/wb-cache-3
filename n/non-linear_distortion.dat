50|$|A transistor's {{operating}} point may move with temperature, so higher power output {{may lead to}} compression due to collector dissipation. But it's not a change in gain; it's <b>non-linear</b> <b>distortion.</b> The output level stays relatively {{the same as the}} input level goes higher. Once the non-linear portion of the transfer characteristic of any amplifier is reached, any increase in input will not be matched by a proportional increase in output. Thus there is compression of gain. Also, at this time because the transfer function is no longer linear, harmonic distortion will result.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{systems have}} their own problems. Digitizing adds noise, which is {{measurable}} and depends on the audio bit depth of the system, regardless of other quality issues. Timing errors in sampling clocks (jitter) result in <b>non-linear</b> <b>distortion</b> (FM modulation) of the signal. One quality measurement for a digital system (Bit Error Rate) relates to the probability of an error in transmission or reception. Other metrics {{on the quality of}} the system are defined by the sample rate and bit depth. In general, digital systems are much less prone to error than analog systems; However, nearly all digital systems have analog inputs and/or outputs, and certainly all of those that interact with the analog world do so. These analog components of the digital system can suffer analog effects and potentially compromise the integrity of a well designed digital system.|$|E
50|$|Active {{crossovers}} can {{be implemented}} digitally using a DSP chip or other microprocessor. They either use digital approximations to traditional analog circuits, known as IIR filters (Bessel, Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley etc.), or they use Finite impulse response (FIR) filters. IIR filters have many similarities with analog filters and are relatively undemanding of CPU resources; FIR filters {{on the other hand}} usually have a higher order and therefore require more resources for similar characteristics. They can be designed and built so that they have a linear phase response, which is thought desirable by many involved in sound reproduction. There are drawbacks though—in order to achieve linear phase response, a longer delay time is incurred than would be necessary with an IIR or minimum phase FIR filters. IIR filters, which are by nature recursive have the drawback that if not carefully designed they may enter limit cycles resulting in <b>non-linear</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{transmitter}} broadcasts an NTSC signal, it amplitude-modulates a {{radio-frequency carrier}} with the NTSC signal just described, while it frequency-modulates a carrier 4.5 MHz higher with the audio signal. If <b>non-linear</b> <b>distortion</b> {{happens to the}} broadcast signal, the 3.579545 MHz color carrier may beat with the sound carrier to produce a dot pattern on the screen. To make the resulting pattern less noticeable, designers adjusted the original 15,750 Hz scanline rate down {{by a factor of}} 1.001 (0.1%) to match the audio carrier frequency divided by the factor 286, resulting in a field rate of approximately 59.94 Hz. This adjustment ensures that the sums and differences of the sound carrier and the color subcarrier and their multiples (i.e., the intermodulation products of the two carriers) are not exact multiples of the frame rate, which is the necessary condition for the dots to remain stationary on the screen, making them most noticeable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ––High power {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} requirement in cellular transmitter radios. OFDM systems require very linear transmission because of high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR). However, linear power amplifiers (PA) have very low efficiency.

We estimate both the non-linearity and inverse non-linearity of the RF transmitter modeled by a memory-less polynomial with Least Square Error (LSE) method.
