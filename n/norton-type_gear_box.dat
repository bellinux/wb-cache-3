Thus the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> casing is an important component to be taken into account while designing. <b>Gear</b> <b>box</b> casing i. e. the top and bottom cover casing is typically made up of an aluminum material using casting process. The objective of the project is to build the model (<b>Gear</b> <b>box</b> casing) and to analyze the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> casing used for permanent magnet DC motors for Static stress and Modal analysis. The load for static stress analysis is calculated by Rope and pulley method setup. The <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> casing is modeled using CATIA V 5 software and analyzed using ANSYS workbench software. The static stress analysis is used to analyze the stresses and deformations of the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> casing and the modal analysis is executed to govern the vibration features (Mode shapes and natural frequencies) of <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> casing in order to prevent the resonance for <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> casing component.

In the present study parametric solid model of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> with three planets having involute profiled spur gears is modelled by Pro-Engineer Wildfire 5. 0 software. Contact stress analysis of the three dimensional solid model of the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> requires huge computational resources, therefore plane stress frictionless contact analysis of the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is carried out in ANSYS Workbench 12. 0 {{and the results are}} verified by theoretical calculation of contact stress as per ISO 6336 standard.

40|$|The <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{represents}} an important mechanical sub system. In machine tools, the propose of a <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{is to provide}} a series of useful output speeds so that the machining operation can be carried out at its most optimum operating conditions high spindle speeds with low feed rate for roughing operations. An important aspect in the design of machine tool transmission is to keep the cost and volume of the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> to a minimum. The probabilistic approach to design has been considered to be more rational compared to the conventional design approach based on the factor of safety. The existence of uncertainties in either engineering simulations or manufacturing processes calls for a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) model for robust and cost-effective designs. In the present work a three shaft four speed <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is designed using reliability principles. For the specified reliability of the system (<b>Gear</b> <b>box),</b> component reliability (<b>Gear</b> pair) is calculated by considering the system as a series system. Design is considered to be safe and adequate if the probability of failure of <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is {{less than or equal to}} a specified quantity in each of the two failure modes. A FORTRAN program has been developed to calculate the mean values of face widths of gears for the minimum mass of <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> By changing the probability of failure of system variations in the face widths are studied. The reliability based optimum design results are compared with those obtained by deterministic optimum design.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{the control of}} {{magnetic}} gears. A decade ago (2001) the first modern prototype magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> was constructed using rare earth magnets (NdFeB). Magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have some desirable properties not found in their mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> counterparts, these include: contact-less torque transmission, lubrication-free, reduced noise and vibration, and non-destructive torque overload capability. Hitherto, no detailed investigation or analysis has been conducted {{on the effects of}} using a magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in place of a mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> As will be demonstrated in this thesis, magnetic gears possess a number of undesirable properties which must be given due consideration when designing speed and position controllers. In particular, unlike mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>boxes,</b> magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have extremely low torsional rigidity. Furthermore, the torque transfer characteristic is fundamentally nonlinear and magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have the potential to ‘slip’. On the one hand, ‘slipping’ is a great benefit as a non-destructive ‘torque fuse’; but on the other, this represents a consequential loss of control. This thesis examines the control issues that arise {{through the use of a}} specially constructed magnetic coupling integrated into an experimental test rig. The development of a linearized mathematical model of the experimental magnetic coupling is used to derive optimized classical controllers for speed and position, demonstrating outstanding theoretical and experimental results. To compensate for the possibility of ‘slip’, a methodology is presented for the detection and recovery from what is defined as ‘pole-slip’ in a magnetic coupling. To avert ‘pole-slip’, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed that prevents over-torque pole-slipping. Feedback linearization is considered for a nonlinear model of the magnetic coupling and nonlinear control laws and state transformations are derived to produce perfect linearization, for both speed and position control, over the entire operating range of the experimental magnetic coupling...|$|R
