5|$|After the {{previous}} year's race showed lower-than-expected tyre degradation, Pirelli opted {{to supply the}} yellow-banded soft compound as the prime selection and the red-banded supersoft tyre as the option selection. The previous season's event saw Nico Rosberg complete 52 of 53 laps on the white-banded medium compound {{on his way to}} a second-place finish. Even with the softer tyre choice, tyre degradation was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> at the event, with drivers able to record fast lap times all through the race on a one-stop strategy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his success with United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E

5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid {{for participation in the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{are known}} for the great number of deities they honoured, a {{capacity}} that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples {{rather than try to}} eradicate them. One way that Rome promoted stability among diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous cults of pseudo-foreign gods (Roman reinventions of foreign gods) were cultivated at Rome and in the provinces, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or one cult only, religious tolerance was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> {{in the sense that it}} is for competing monotheistic systems.|$|E

5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E
