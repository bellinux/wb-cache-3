5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{contains}} the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, {{it is unclear}} how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases.</b> This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.|$|E

25|$|Other {{concerns}} {{included an}} NOE between U4 and U7 of the cleaved hammerhead ribozyme that {{had also been}} observed during NMR characterization, which suggested that these <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> must approach one another closer than about 6 Å, although close approach of U7 to U4 {{did not appear to}} be possible from the crystal structure.

25|$|For example, the {{invariant}} core residues G5, G8, G12 and C3 in {{the minimal}} hammerhead ribozyme were each observed {{to be so}} fragile that changing even a single exocyclic functional group on {{any one of these}} nucleotides results in a dramatic reduction or abolition of catalytic activity, yet few of these appeared to form hydrogen bonds involving the Watson-Crick faces of these <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> in any of the minimal hammerhead structures, apart from a G-5 interaction in the product structure.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} is {{the inclusion of}} phosphorothioate bonds. In a phosphorothioate bond, one of the non-bridging oxygens between <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> is replaced with a sulfur atom, changing the chemical properties. This modification is necessary in oligo design because it results in decreased susceptibility to exonuclease degradation. At maximum, four of these bonds should be situated near the 5’ end of the oligo. Too many phosphorothioate bonds can be problematic; each modified site creates a chiral center, {{which can lead to}} a racemic mixture of isomers with varying characteristics and properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} processes {{that took place}} on the early Earth are called chemical evolution. Both Manfred Eigen and Sol Spiegelman demonstrated that evolution, including replication, variation, and natural selection, can occur in populations of molecules as well as in organisms. Spiegelman took advantage of natural selection to synthesize the Spiegelman Monster, which had a genome with just 218 <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases,</b> having deconstructively evolved from a 4500-base bacterial RNA.

25|$|Epigenetic markers are {{stable and}} {{potentially}} heritable {{modifications to the}} DNA molecule {{that are not in}} its sequence. An example is DNA methylation at CpG sites, which has been found to influence gene expression. Histone modifications are another example. The current generation of sequencing technologies rely on laboratory techniques such as ChIP-sequencing for the detection of epigenetic markers. These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|E
25|$|This is {{a genetic}} {{mutation}} {{at the level}} of <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases.</b> Why and how frameshift mutations occur are continually being sought after. An environmental study, specifically the production of UV-induced frameshift mutations by DNA polymerases deficient in 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity was done. The normal sequence 5′ GTC GTT TTA CAA 3′ was changed to GTC GTT T TTA CAA (MIDT) of GTC GTT C TTA CAA (MIDC) to study frameshifts. E. coli pol I Kf and T7 DNA polymerase mutant enzymes devoid of 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity produce UV-induced revertants at higher frequency than did their exonuclease proficient counterparts. The data indicates that loss of proofreading activity increases the frequency of UV-induced frameshifts.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of leaving King's College for Birkbeck College, Franklin was asked by John Randall {{to give up her}} work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the {{supervisors}} of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the <b>nucleotide</b> <b>bases</b> pack into the core of the DNA double helix.|$|E
