They were reduced to training ships by World War I, and both ships were lost with heavy death tolls during the conflict. Benedetto Brin exploded in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita struck a mine and sank in December 1916.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12.

They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and they spent the war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly {{after the end of the}} war, both having been stricken in 1920.|$|E

It continued to serve as provincial capital of the Zirids until 1057, when it was destroyed by the invading Banu Hilal tribes. Any useful objects or relics were scavenged during the centuries that followed. Today, only faint traces remain.|$|E
