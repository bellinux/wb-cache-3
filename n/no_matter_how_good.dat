They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past.

40|$|As {{analysis}} of Kant’s account of virtue in the Lectures on Ethics shows that Kant thinks of virtue {{as a form}} of moral self-mastery or self-command that represents a model of self-governance he compares to an autocracy. In {{light of the fact that}} the very concept of virtue presupposes struggle and conflict, Kant insists that virtue is distinct from holiness and that any ideal of moral perfection that overlooks the fact that morality is always difficult for us fails to provide an appropriate model of human virtue. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> morally <b>good</b> we are or become, virtue remains a disposition to do one’s duty from duty, out of necessitation by practical reason. Yet, even though finite rational beings require a power of self-constraint in accordance with the commands of duty to comply with the law (which we obey reluctantly), the virtuous agent displays a unified soul that is at peace. This picture of virtue uncovered from the Lectures on Ethics thus reveals the way in which Kant’s conception of virtue accords with his foundational commitments in his moral theory, while at the same time representing a more complex theory of moral character and a life lived in accordance with practical reason...|$|R

40|$|Gourna, a vernacular {{village in}} Upper Egypt, was built over a Pharonic {{heritage}} site. During the 1940 s, {{and in order}} to protect the monuments from theft, the Egyptian government commissioned the renowned Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy to design a new settlement for the Gournii. Despite the great effort exerted by Fathy to design The New Gourna in an environmentally and socially responsive manner, the project had consider-ably failed as most of the residents refused to move to the new village. Recently, the government repeated the attempt but this time the second version of the New Gourna came significantly different. In order to force them to move, the government demolished most of the houses of the residents of Gourna and left only a few houses to be re-used as museums for the vernacular architecture of the village. The main objective of the paper is to investigate if the second version of the New Gourna is going to overcome the sustainability problems associated with Fathy’s New Gourna and if it is going to deal successfully with the sustainable vernacular architecture of the region. In order to undertake this investigation the paper first reviews the vernacular architecture of Gourna and then discusses both Fathy’s approach and the recent New Gourna village’s approach from the sustainabil-ity point of view.

40|$|Abstract. A salvage-embedding (S-embedding) maps a {{complete}} binary tree G {{into a larger}} complete binary tree H some fraction of whose leaves have been labeled good. The S-embedding maps leaves of G one-to-one to good leaves of H; it may be many-to-one on internal nodes. We measure the quality of an S-embedding by its harvest, the fraction H of good leaves of H that are images of leaves of G, and its congestion, {{the largest number of}} edges of G that get “routed ” across the same edge of H. We consider three scenarios for an N-leaf tree H. In the worst-case scenario: if the fraction G of H’s leaves are labeled good, then one can S-embed an HGN-leaf G in H with congestion log log N+ a constant depending only on G and H, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> the <b>good</b> leaves are distributed; this congestion cannot be lowered by more than a small constant factor. In the expected-case scenario, where leaves of H are labeled good or not, independently, with fixed probability: with probability exceeding 1 − N −Ω(1), for any 0 < H ≤ 1 / 8, one can S-embed an HN-leaf G in H with congestion O(log log log N); we do not know if this congestion can be lowered. In the salvaging scenario: we present an algorithm that, in time O(N(log N) 3 C+ 2), S-embeds in a given a leaf-labeled H the largest possible G, subject to the prespecified bound C on congestion. This work is motivated by the problem of salvaging a fault-free subnetwork of a leaf-tree machine — a tree architecture whose leaves hold “full-power ” PEs and whose nonleaf nodes hold “rudimentary ” PEs that route messages and perform simple combining tasks...|$|R
40|$|Doping, and anti-doping, is in {{the news}} on a {{continuous}} basis. At the core of these stories and discussions is the question how effective anti-doping policies are to curb the use of doping in sports. Anti-doping policies are based on ethical values, a juridical framework, laboratory analyses, educational efforts and the input of numerous other scientific disciplines. An evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} these policies can only be made when this multidisciplinary aspect is truly appreciated. In this thesis various aspects of anti-doping policies are discussed, with specific emphasis on the extent of doping use (both intentional and unintentional), the effectiveness of doping substances and methods, and the consequences of current policies. All available evidence shows that a minority of elite athletes use doping intentionally. Current estimates range from 4 - 39 % The prevalence of doping is considerably different between types of sport, levels and nationalities. Regarding unintentional doping, it can be concluded that in approximately 40 % of all anti-doping rule violations the juridical panels involved are not convinced that the athletes concerned were completely at fault, that mitigating circumstances were applicable, or that full responsibility of the suspected violation should not be held against them. Anti-doping organisations should strive to improve this situation in various ways. Valuable evaluations of the effectiveness of anti-doping policies can be performed, and they must be performed far more often. It is clear that improvements in the anti-doping framework can and should be made in order to strengthen it and to strike the right balance between the main task of anti-doping (eradicating doping use) and the burdens the burdens placed on all athletes. This requires a multidisciplinary scientific approach, transparent discussions, and more focus on ‘true’ doping dilemmas. The voice of the athletes is essential in these efforts. With such a concerted effort it can be expected that meaningful policy evaluations, and consequently policy improvements, can be made. This is necessary as a system that fails too many athletes will ultimately implode, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> many <b>good</b> intentions have formed its basis. The issue of doping in sports is just too important to let that happen...|$|R
40|$|Subjective {{well-being}} {{is a broad}} {{term that}} encompasses the various ways people evaluate their lives, including concepts such as life satisfaction, pleasant emotions, satisfaction with domains such as work and health, feelings of fulfillment and meaning, {{and low levels of}} unpleasant emotions. Subjective well-being (SWB) is one component of the good life because lives that are bereft of joy, affection, feelings of fulfillment and meaning, and laden with dissatisfaction, anger, and depression cannot be thought of as ideal, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> many other <b>good</b> qualities might be present. On the other hand, we argue that subjective well-being is not the sufficient and final good for which people strive, and to which all other desirable objects are merely a means. People want to be happy, but for the right reasons, and they want certain valued things {{even in the absence of}} feelings of happiness. Thus, we argue that subjective well-being is only one of several valued ends that comprise the good life. Social scientists have developed some understanding based on empirical studies of what leads people to evaluate their lives in positive terms. In very recent years, there has also been an analysis of the outcomes of subjective well-being, with the tentative finding that happiness helps people to be successful in some life tasks such as social relationships and earning money. However, there might be optimal levels of certain forms of SWB, such as pleasant emotions, that are only functional when in the long-term they are at submaximal levels – that is, SWB is likely to be dysfunctional if a person is locked into a state of intense positive emotions, and is not able to react to good and bad events. A challenge for future research is to determine whether it is possible to produce interventions to heighten happiness, which at the same time allow people to function effectively in the pursuit of valued social goals...|$|R
