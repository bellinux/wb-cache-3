As an essential component of vehicle, <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> must be observed especially in distortion assessment. During this time, the assessment of <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> product is finished by experts. Thus, faults of inspection can be occurred.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of hydrophobic treatment on distance estimation under conditions of simulated rain and wind when applied to the driver-side window and driver-side exterior <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror.</b> The dependent measure was the estimate of distance to a target vehicle viewed through the driver-side window and <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror.</b> The following independent variables were examined: actual distance, hydrophobic treatment of the driver-side window, hydrophobic treatment of the driver-side exterior <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror,</b> participant age, and participant sex. While {{the results of this}} study indicate no significant effect of hydrophobically treating driver-side windows or mirrors, one marginally nonsignificant interaction of interest was observed. Specifically, there was a tendency for older drivers to report shorter (more conservative and presumably safer) distance estimates when viewing vehicles through a driverside window that has received hydrophobic treatment. This tendency, in combination with over-representation of older drivers in lane change/merge crashes, suggests that additional research efforts should be focused on examining the potential for safety benefits from applying hydrophobic treatment to driver-side windows...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that nonpictorial distance cues, including accommodation and binocular disparity, play at most a minor role in driving relative to pictorial cues, such as relative size and linear perspective. However, the possibility that nonpictorial cues play a nontrivial role {{in at least some}} driving situations is of interest because of current and proposed applications of camerabased displays in driving. Such applications include the use of video systems as replacements for <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors</b> and to enhance forward vision at night. By their nature, camera-based displays selectively eliminate or distort nonpictorial distance cues.
