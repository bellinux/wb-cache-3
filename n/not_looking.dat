5|$|Bottomley {{also holds}} the single-season {{record for most}} unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley {{is also known as}} the only man to be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player in {{baseball}} history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.|$|E
5|$|Dot and Abi make a rum {{cake for}} Patrick's {{birthday}} {{but as soon}} as Abi leaves the house for Exeter, Dot trips over Dave and nobody knows she is seriously injured until another step-granddaughter Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames the residents for <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is left worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation after her fall has caused problems to her hip. Dot refuses physio and loses her temper with the doctors when they won't let her have a cigarette. Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave shows up at the hospital alive.|$|E

5|$|Further delay meant play {{began after}} the tea break, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce in the surface. With Australia <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to chase the runs because the time {{available}} was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed the catch. Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.|$|E
5|$|High {{states that}} {{afterward}} Skaði {{went back up}} to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around, hunts animals with a bow, and lives in her fathers old house. Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr as the father of two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} match, The Allied Powers (Davey Boy Smith and Lex Luger) faced the Blu Brothers (Eli and Jacob). Smith started {{out on the}} offensive, but Jacob gained control with a running bulldog throw. The Blus {{capitalized}} {{on the fact that}} they are identical twins by switching places while the referee was <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Luger came into the match near the end and performed a running forearm smash on Eli. Jacob tried to throw Luger with a powerbomb, but Luger tagged in Smith, who performed a sunset flip to pin Jacob and win the match.|$|E

5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} LAX against Beer Money, Inc. {{in the next}} encounter. Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money to the ring, while Salinas and Héctor Guerrero accompanied LAX. The duration of the encounter was 14 minutes and 15 seconds. Filthee, Grandmaster Caz, and Melle Mel performed LAX's theme during their entrance. Near {{the end of the}} contest, Jacqueline and Salinas both interfered in the match. This led to Roode smacking Homicide in his injured right eye with a beer bottle while the referee was <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Storm then gained the pinfall to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month at Saturday Night's Main Event, a title match was scheduled between Edge and Cena. Cena won the match by disqualification, after Lita interfered {{on behalf of}} Edge. A singles match was booked between Edge and Cena for the WWE title at Summerslam, with the stipulation that if Edge disqualified himself, he would have lost the WWE title. At SummerSlam, Edge retained the title after he hit Cena {{with a pair of}} brass knuckles, this occurred when the referee was <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E

He closed his eyes, and she wiped his cheeks and his mouth. Still he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at her. She bent very close to him, feeling her heart crushed with grief for him.|$|R

5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> up and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although {{the contents of}} the cage were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled most of the early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including once when Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman was <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues that she was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> forward to spending the weekend alone {{as it would be}} her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-licence, Bargain Booze.|$|E

5|$|Play {{began after}} the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 {{in the last}} session if they wanted victory. The pitch played very slowly due to the excess moisture, which meant the ball slowed {{significantly}} upon hitting the ground surface. As Australia were <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to chase the runs, {{there was no need}} for run-saving fieldsmen, so Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Jack Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp and falling for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Australia batted for another two hours without further loss, to reach 1/92 from 61 overs before the match was finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions. Johnson had an unhappy game, scoring only seven runs in two innings, dropping a catch and taking match figures of 0/93.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Edrich {{came to the}} crease, Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, {{fearing that}} it would be {{interpreted}} as retaliation for Edrich's bouncing of Lindwall in the first innings and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. Although Lindwall did not retaliate, Miller did so with four consecutive bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop, before apologising to Edrich. England reached 3/174, a lead of 316, at the end of day three, but declared on the fifth morning after the fourth day was washed out. Bradman chose the light roller and play was supposed to begin after lunch. However, play did not begin until after tea and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture. With Australia <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> to chase the runs, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. Australia showed little attacking intent and Bradman joined Morris with Australia at 1/10 after 32 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore <b>not</b> <b>looking.</b> Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E
