5|$|The meat ant {{was first}} {{described}} in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Formica purpurea from a holotype worker ant he collected in Melbourne, Victoria. The type material is currently {{housed in the}} Natural History Museum, London. In 1862, Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr erected the genus Iridomyrmex, and reclassified the meat ant {{as a member of}} Iridomyrmex rather than the genus Formica. The ant was named Iridomyrmex purpurea in 1862; however, Mayr renamed the ant as Iridomyrmex purpureus one year after. I. purpureus was later classified as a synonym of Iridomyrmex detectus, and this taxon was designated as the type species of Iridomyrmex in 1903. In 1993, I. detectus was synonymised with I. purpureus and grouped into the I. purpureus species complex. I. detectus was described as a separate species by Smith the same year as I. purpureus from two syntype queens he collected from the Hunter River in New South Wales. Although the <b>name</b> <b>I.</b> purpureus was used by many authors, Karl Wilhelm von Dalla Torre reused I. detectus and this was adopted by several authors, replacing I. purpureus. By the 1960s, however, I. purpureus once again became preferred over I. detectus. While the two names were described in the same year and publication, the <b>name</b> <b>I.</b> purpureus is the valid name for the species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Entomologist B.T. Lowne {{was the first person to}} revise I. purpureus and I. detectus, and he synonymised the two species.|$|E

25|$|Fondane's actual debut {{dates back}} to 1914, during {{the time when he}} became a student at the National High School Iași and {{formally}} affiliated with the provincial branch of the nationwide Symbolist movement. That year, samples of lyric poetry were also published in the magazines Valuri and Revista Noastră (whose owner, writer Constanța Hodoș, even offered Fondane a job on the editorial board, probably unaware that she was corresponding with a high school student). Also in 1914, the Moldavian Symbolist venue Absolutio, edited by Isac Ludo, featured pieces he signed with the pen <b>name</b> <b>I.</b> Hașir. Among his National High School colleagues was Alexandru Al. Philippide, the future critic, who remained one of Fondane's best friends (and whose poetry Fondane proposed for publishing in Revista Noastră). Late in 1914, Fondane also began his short collaboration with the Iași Symbolist tribune Vieața Nouă. While several of his poems were published there, the review's founder Ovid Densusianu issued objections to their content, and, in their subsequent correspondence, each writer outlines his stylistic disagreements with the other.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Widmerpool" [...] {{was assumed}} by many critics {{to derive from}} Widmerpool a Nottinghamshire village. In a 1978 interview, Powell said he first came across the name in a 17th-century book, Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson, which {{features}} a Captain of Horse, Major Joseph Widmerpoole, who served in Cromwell's army under John Hutchinson during the English Civil War. Powell viewed this Widmerpoole as a mean-spirited and disagreeable character and [...] "had his name down for really {{quite a long time}} as a <b>name</b> <b>I</b> was going to use".|$|E

[...] After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife, he described them as [...] "a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke".

In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my <b>name.</b> <b>I</b> always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them.

500|$|A Russian Academy of Sciences {{expedition}} {{later found}} fossils in the Aral Formation near the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan; {{it was the}} most complete indricothere skeleton known, but it lacked the skull. In 1916, based on these remains, Aleksei Alekseeivich Borissiak erected the genus Indricotherium named for a mythological monster, the [...] "Indrik beast". He did not assign a species <b>name,</b> <b>I.</b> asiaticum, until 1923, but Maria Pavlova had already named it I. transouralicum in 1922. Also in 1923, Borissiak created the subfamily Indricotheriinae to include the various related forms known by then. In 1939, Borissiak also named a new species of Paraceratherium from Kazakhstan, P. prohorovi.|$|E
500|$|The lead {{character}} of Casino Royale is James Bond, {{an agent of}} the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, Birds of the West Indies. Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". He further explained that [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest <b>name</b> <b>I</b> ever heard." ...|$|E

500|$|For the episode, McCreary {{composed}} a {{theme for the}} character of Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name with the notes arranged [...] "so that the syllables in her name land with the right emphasis.

Starting with this association with her name was a fun way to kickstart my creative process, and it also produced a malleable melody that could be adapted to my needs throughout the episode." [...] The theme is initially used with low strings or brass to sound ominous, or even evil, but when she [...] "reunites with Coulson for an emotional conversation, the strings repeat her theme in twisting, circular statements, adding angst and heartbreak." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, it was unknown if she was a male or female, as it was {{considered}} too dangerous to approach her and her parents. [...] Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her [...] "Sonny Jim". When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name. [...] "Patty Cake", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. [...] "It just so happens that we have three boys and I told my wife that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her <b>name.</b> <b>I</b> thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime," [...] O'Connor told reporters.|$|E
500|$|Maimonides {{was named}} in honor of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who is {{respected}} by both Jews and Muslims.

[...] Zayat also had difficulty obtaining the name from the Jockey Club, as it had been reserved by Earle I. Mack, who owned race horses and also happened to be the chairman of the board of Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, at Zayat's alma mater, Yeshiva University. After Zayat donated $100,000 to the school to [...] "promote peace," [...] Mack released his reservation of the name. But, in the first of Zayat's many racing disappointments, the colt's promising racing career was cut short by injury after two races.|$|E
