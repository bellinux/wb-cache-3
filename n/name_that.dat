5|$|In November 1912, a {{bill was}} publicised under the LER <b>name</b> <b>that</b> {{included}} {{a plan to}} extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks.

Post-war, a shortage of funds and other priorities meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her <b>name,</b> <b>that</b> person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa var.spinulosa: The {{nominate}} race is an autonym, a <b>name</b> <b>that</b> was automatically {{created for}} the original material of the species as the other subspecies were described. The original hairpin banksia, this plant is coastal in Queensland, seen in such places as Walshs Pyramid (near Cairns), Byfield National Park and the Blackdown Tableland, then again in New South Wales south of the Hawkesbury River, just north of Sydney, down the New South Wales South Coast and into Victoria. Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a gradation between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than other varieties at 1–2mm in width and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E
