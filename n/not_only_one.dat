5|$|The {{hexagonal}} Great Tower {{was probably}} {{begun in the}} 1430s and 1440s, possibly on the motte of a previous castle. The tower today has lost <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of its walls but part of its upper structure, and would originally have been three storeys high with probably additional machicolations on top similar to those on the gatehouse. It {{was designed to be}} a self-contained fortification, with its own water and food supplies, and luxurious quarters lit by large windows on the upper floors. Originally the tower was reached by a bascule drawbridge, usually considered to be drawn from contemporary French designs, such as those at Ferté-Milon and Vannes. This drawbridge was designed to have two parts— a wide, heavy bridge that would be raised or lowered when the family was in residence, and a thinner bridge, easier to lift, designed for the use of servants at other times. The Herberts used the bridge as their badge, and it {{can be seen in the}} carved window designs around the castle. The drawbridge was replaced with a grander stone bridge in the 1460s, probably at a cost of around £900 to £1000. An apron wall with six turrets was also added around the tower at around the same time.|$|E

25|$|A slotted Aloha {{wireless}} network employs the Aloha MAC protocol where the channels access the medium, independently at each time interval, with some probability p.

The Dean of Arches, George Hay, agreed that clergy who lacked knowledge of Welsh should not be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes. However, Hay therefore concluded that clergy should be examined in Welsh before being inducted into the benefice. Bowles had been lawfully inducted and instituted to the benefice, and therefore held the ecclesiastical freehold, so Hay doubted whether he {{had the power to}} deprive him of it.|$|E

25|$|The Riesling grape, {{grown on}} 59.7% of the region's {{cultivated}} vineyard surface in 2008, {{is widely considered}} the most prestigious and highest quality wine grape of the Mosel but it cannot be planted on every vineyard site due to difficulties the grape has in ripening in particularly cool climates. Factors such as altitude, aspect and sunlight exposure can have a pronounced effect <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> the resulting quality of the wine but also whether the Riesling grape will even ripen at all. A positive characteristic of the Riesling grape is that despite less than perfect ripeness it can still create a wine of finesse and elegance that would escape most other grape varieties.|$|E

They concluded their season in the 2015 Alamo Bowl with a win over the Kansas State Wildcats, 40–35, and a 10-win season. It was the ninth 10-win season in school history, and just the third time in their history that they have won 10 games in consecutive seasons.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the roughly}} 10,500 {{actions of the}} U.S. Civil War, 384 (3.7%) were {{identified}} by the commission as principal battles and rated according to their significance and threat of loss. The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having {{a direct impact on}} the course of the war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as Gettysburg and Antietam. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the most important, but {{also one of the most}} highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.|$|E

25|$|One {{test of the}} {{reformed}} RAOU {{was to be the}} extent of its involvement with the International Ornithological Congress (IOC), held in Canberra in 1974 with about 800 delegates attending. The secretary-general of the congress (i.e. the principal organiser) was Dr Harold Frith who was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the hardliners of the ‘scientists’ faction of the pre-reform RAOU, but had also threatened to start a competing group with its own journal if the reforms had not proceeded. Ultimately the RAOU contributed {{to the success of the}} IOC through provision of funding (along with the Australian Academy of Science (AAC) and the administrative assistance of the CSIRO), and with the organisation of excursions for delegates. The appointment in 1974 of Tommy Garnett as RAOU secretary was also a move that assisted in bringing order to the growing administrative demands of the evolving organisation.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Eddington was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, {{which meant}} {{he was the first}} to receive a series of letters and papers from Willem de Sitter {{regarding}} Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Eddington was fortunate in being <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs, one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist. He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and Astronomer Royal Frank Watson Dyson organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of Einstein’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson’s argument for the indispensability of Eddington’s expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.|$|E

Additionally, individual volumes of One Piece have broken publishing records in Japan. Volume 56 received the highest initial print run of any manga, 2.85 million copies, in 2009. Volume 57's print of 3 million in 2010 was the highest first print for any book in Japan, not just manga. A record that was broken several times by subsequent volumes and currently held by 67's 4.05 million initial printing in 2012.

500|$|As {{described}} above, {{there are}} arguments about whether {{these and other}} early bands truly qualify as [...] "heavy metal" [...] or simply as [...] "hard rock". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, [...] "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC". Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, [...] "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.... were a rock 'n' roll band that {{just happened to be}} heavy enough for metal". The issue is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band [...] "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition".|$|E
500|$|After World War II {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of housing and office space in Canberra, so a Senate Select Committee hearing was held in 1954 to address its development requirements. This Committee recommended {{the creation of a}} single planning body with executive power. Consequently, the NCPDC was replaced by the National Capital Development Commission in 1957. The NCDC ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin, and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the centrepiece of Griffin's design finally the laid the platform for the development of Griffin's Parliamentary Triangle. In the four decades since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront. According to the policy plan of the government, [...] "The lake is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the centrepieces of Canberra's plan in its own right, but forms the immediate foreground of the National Parliamentary Area."
