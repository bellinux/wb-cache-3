5000|$|Donald Trump (R) - In June 2015, in Donald Trump's speech {{announcing his}} {{candidacy}} for President of the United States, Trump {{made a very}} controversial and widely publicized statement about Mexicans: [...] "When Mexico sends its people, they're <b>not</b> <b>sending</b> their best. They're <b>not</b> <b>sending</b> you. They're <b>not</b> <b>sending</b> you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." ...|$|R

5|$|The Weather Bureau {{had issued}} {{the first of}} its twice-daily reports at {{approximately}} 8:00a.m.; it did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> another report to Washington, D.C. until 8:00p.m. This proved to be a serious problem: the storm would have {{the better part of a}} day to build up hurricane forces before the Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C., would have detailed information.|$|E
5|$|The entire Lackawanna {{region is}} idle. Week before last this region sent nearly 150,000 tons of coal to market. Last week it did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> any... The {{situation}} here is absolutely painful, {{and there is}} no knowing what moment an outbreak will occur.|$|E

5|$|Afghanistan did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E

50|$|However, if a {{relative}} of a person has died during that year, they will send a postcard written in black before the New Year apologizing for <b>not</b> <b>sending</b> a New Year's card. The rationale {{for this is that}} since their relative has died they cannot wish or experience a happy new year. In this case, the etiquette is <b>not</b> to <b>send</b> them a New Year's Greeting either.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could <b>not</b> <b>send</b> the supporting army that San Martín had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 1958 World Cup that Pelé began {{wearing a}} jersey with number 10. The event {{was the result of}} disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt to Pelé who was a {{substitute}} on the occasion. The press proclaimed Pelé the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi.|$|E
5|$|Spanish EAV-8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight, {{enforcing}} the UN's no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spain did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> its aircraft carrier {{to participate in}} the Iraq War in 2003, instead deploying F/A-18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 {{due to a lack of}} funds for a replacement aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{army was}} not ready as of the summer of 1815, delaying the crossing. Given the harsh {{conditions}} on the mountains, the crossing could only {{be done in the}} summer season, when there is less snow. Buenos Aires did <b>not</b> <b>send</b> more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Martín proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, if they would support the campaign. San Martín and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director Antonio González de Balcarce the full military plan of operations.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Japanese {{maintained}} separate {{army and}} navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated {{with each other}} but were responsible to different higher authorities. Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka. Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army, consisting of the XVII Army in the Solomon Islands, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's XVIII Army in New Guinea, and the 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul. As {{a result of the}} destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the Japanese decided <b>not</b> <b>send</b> any more convoys to Lae, but instead to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak and move them forward to Lae by barge or submarine. In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} XXXVI Corps had reached total exhaustion. With the {{transfer}} of the SS Division Nord to the south, and a return of the Finnish 6th Division to III Corps, Feige deemed any further advance in this sector impossible. With the Soviets bringing more reinforcements to the front every day, Feige requested more men if he was to start a new attack. Plans were made by AOK Norwegen for a resumption of the offensive, but the German High Command was unable to reinforce the Arctic theatre with additional units and AOK Norwegen could <b>not</b> <b>send</b> anything meaningful itself to aid Feige. Consequently, all offensive plans were scrapped. Due to the more spectacular gains at the main front in Central Russia during Operation Barbarossa, the OKW deemed the current situation acceptable and an end was ordered to the offensive operations of XXXVI Corps. This, combined with heavy German casualties, led to the attack finally being called off at the end of September.|$|E
