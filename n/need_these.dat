5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial <b>need.</b> <b>These</b> two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1980s, {{a number}} of {{initiatives}} began to combine mental health and substance abuse services {{in an attempt to}} meet this <b>need.</b> <b>These</b> programs worked to shift the method of treatment for substance abuse from a confrontational approach to a supportive one. They also introduced new methods to motivate clients and worked with them to develop long-term goals for their care. Although the studies conducted by these initiatives did not have control groups, their results were promising and became the basis for more rigorous efforts to study and develop models of integrated treatment.|$|E

25|$|Persistence {{of hunger}} and {{starvation}} after 2000: After 1990s famine, food and basic supplies {{have continued to}} be in short supply. The government has curtailed market-based efforts for private citizens to find the food they <b>need.</b> <b>These</b> efforts included a botched currency reform aimed at undermining private enterprise and restoring the centrally planned economic system. This effectively resulted in eliminating the savings of many families and creating further starvation. At the same time, the Public Distribution System has failed to regain the level of subsidized services provided before 1990s collapse. Inflation has spiked making food unaffordable; in 20 years the price of rice has risen {{by a factor of}} 500. Poor government policy has been exacerbated by periodical floods that reduce agricultural yields. Deaths from starvation seem to have fallen since 2000, but they continue to occur and spike periodically. The Commission noted that organizations like the World Food Programme and World Health Organization report that large swathes of the population continue to suffer from critical food security; between 36% and 40% of the population suffer from malnutrition, with stunting among children remaining widespread.|$|E

500|$|To {{support his}} family, Fauré {{spent most of}} his time in running the daily {{services}} at the Madeleine and giving piano and harmony lessons. His compositions earned him a negligible amount, because his publisher bought them outright, paying him an average of 60 francs for a song, and Fauré received no royalties. During this period, he wrote several large-scale works, in addition to many piano pieces and songs, but he destroyed most of them after a few performances, only retaining a few movements in order to re-use motifs. Among the works surviving from this period is the Requiem, begun in 1887 and revised and expanded, over the years, until its final version dating from 1901. After its first performance, in 1888, the priest in charge told the composer, [...] "We don't <b>need</b> <b>these</b> novelties: the Madeleine's repertoire is quite rich enough." ...|$|E

[...] Some species of corvid and raptor birds have the Carabidae family compose of {{a significant amount of}} the adult diet as well. [...] Farmland birds in particular depend heavily on the presence of the Carabidae family. [...] Small mammals, amphibians and reptiles also prey on the Carabidae family, B. cephalotes included. [...] All European bats are protected, and many of these bats specialize in preying on beetles. [...] Mammals, such as hedgehogs, shrews and mice inhabiting areas far from crops often consume these beetles. [...] The beetles constitute a significant (20%) portion of these mammals’ diet in June. [...] This is primarily due to the beetles’ life cycle. [...] Most of the beetles, that matured during the winter and spring, emerge in June, live throughout the summer and fall, reproducing in the fall, and dying during the winter. [...] Thus there is a surplus of beetles in June of which most mammals take advantage.|$|E
2500|$|The Sunday Houses {{are unique}} to the German {{immigrant}} culture of the Texas Hill Country. In reverse of the old European tradition of living in town while working the rural farms, the early Fredericksburg German settlers made their main homes on the acreage they worked. [...] On their town lots, they erected Sunday Houses for overnight stays on their weekly travels into town for supplies and church attendance. [...] Older generations would use the houses as a retirement house, as the younger generations inherited the acreage and the work. [...] These houses were often made of limestone rock coated with whitewash inside and out. [...] Depending on the individual family's <b>need,</b> <b>these</b> relatively small 2-story houses were designed for limited stays, {{with one or two}} ground floor rooms and an upper loft for sleeping. [...] Standard design was a fireplace and a porch. Often there was an outside staircase leading to the loft. [...] Many of these homes in Fredericksburg have been restored, with some of them being used as [...] Bed and Breakfast retreats.|$|E
2500|$|Donald Winnicott, {{who was a}} {{pediatrician}} and child psychoanalyst, had an immense influence on Bowlby's work and career. Bowlby and Winnicott had several similarities within their professional work as {{they were the first}} to explain the importance of social interactions at an early age. Both Bowlby and Winnicott argued that humans come into the world with a predisposition to be sensitive to social interactions and to <b>need</b> <b>these</b> interactions {{in order to have a}} healthy development. However, although Bowlby and Winnicott's ideas were similar, they took vastly different approaches when dealing with their research. For example, Bowlby was interested in how a child's environment is internalized and affects the child's development, while Winnicott was more interested in [...] "the way the inner world engages with and thereby is affected by external events". Despite their differences in approaching their research interests, Bowlby explained in an interview that his research for the World Health Organization influenced policies regarding child care; however, none of this would have been possible without the help of Winnicott. Winnicott worked more at a clinical level than Bowlby which influenced several social workers as he spent his career working to change policies. Bowlby explained that Winnicott is one of the more important individuals who was able to push Bowlby's work to change policies.|$|E
