40|$|Food security, {{intended}} as the {{agricultural production capacity}} to satisfy the nutritional needs of the world’s population, is closely tied to water availability, the latter being essential {{for the production of}} any type of food. The water volume required to produce an established quantity of food is called the “virtual water content ” and is the amount of water virtually embedded in the good, though not physically present in it. Italy is an exemplary case of high virtual water con-sumption and dependence on food imports. It is among the leading countries in the world for <b>net</b> virtual water <b>importation,</b> with a high per capita consumption and a persistent reduction in land surface used for agricultural production. Local con-tradictions arising from the global food supply model are the issue dealt with in this contribution, with particular reference to Italy. Agriculture, often neglected in press campaigns on water saving, is, instead, the main consumer of water; the production of food goods corresponds to a global consumption of about 80 – 90 % of the total water used to satisfy anthropic demand (Falkenmark and Rockström 2004). The water volume required to produce an established quantity of food is called th...|$|R
