5000|$|With the {{advancement}} of computer software technology {{at the end of}} the 20th century, many hardware-based telephony capabilities for auto dialing can be implemented in software.

Touch tones, <b>call</b> <b>transfer,</b> <b>call</b> progress detection, detection of answering machine and voice mail, and other telephony card features, are available in voice modem-based auto dialing systems. For a simple autodialer supporting only a few phone lines per PC, telephony cards offer few advantages over simple voice modems.|$|R
