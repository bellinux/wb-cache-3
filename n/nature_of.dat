40|$|The {{way people}} or {{organizations}} describe or depict nature conveys their view <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> In the Dutch discourse, views <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are mostly conceived as socio-cultural constructs regarding the character, value, and appreciation <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Views <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{tell us how}} we perceive nature and how we want to relate to it. Likewise, they shape our preferences for certain types <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Views <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> function as frames and provide an interpretive and reflective context for our experiences with <b>nature.</b> Views <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are also digestions of meaningful experiences. It is through communication that we become aware of such experiences. We argue that meaningful experiences have religious depth. On {{the basis of this}} argument any discourse on nature contains, in a sense, religious subtexts. We examine the Dutch discourse on nature...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} the article is to analyze the {{different}} roles and <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> objects in organizational process. Furthermore, {{the concept of the}} mediation object is developed to understand how the objects help to structure interactions and collective activities over time. Design/methodology/approach - The article employs data from a case study (the Pupitre Virtuel) in order to highlight and illustrate the relevance of a process analysis of the roles and <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> objects. Findings - We demonstrate that the roles and <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> objects evolve over time through controversies and compromises. On the one hand, the evolution of interactions drives the evolution of the roles and <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> objects. On the other, the evolution of objects help the actors to structure their interactions and activities. Originality/value - We argue that, rather than a static analysis, human-object interaction needs to be understood and observed through a process analysis, taking into account the evolution of objects and interactions. This article shows that mediation objects can play three roles - as carriers of controversies, of compromises, and of prescriptions - and that it can appear in one of three aspects - interpretable, modifiable, and non-interpretable/non-modifiable...|$|R
