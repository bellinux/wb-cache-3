5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{presented}} in two dimensions, spread across approximately 50 game screens. Locations contrast between spaceship interior and rock surfaces. Players control a jet pack wearing astronaut who must deactivate the five engines of the titular spacestation Obsidian, {{which is located}} in the hollow centre carved out of an asteroid. Objects are stored in gravity boxes on the station's ceilings, only one object can be held at a time. These are used to solve the game's puzzles and allow the player to continue further into the game. Each object's purpose must be discovered as they are <b>not</b> <b>labelled.</b>|$|E
25|$|The National Service Board for Religious Objectors offered {{civilian}} {{bonds in}} the United States during World War II, primarily {{to members of}} the historic peace churches as an alternative for those who could not conscientiously buy something meant to support the war. These were U.S. Government Bonds <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> as defense bonds. In all, 33,006 subscriptions were sold for a total value of $, mostly to Mennonites, Brethren, and Quakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} adapted in 2013 {{starring}} David Suchet as Poirot. It {{was the final}} episode of the final series of Agatha Christie's Poirot, and {{the first of the}} final series to be filmed. Hugh Fraser again returned to the role of Hastings after appearing in The Big Four earlier in the series, following a ten-year absence; stars such as Alice Orr-Ewing (Judith Hastings), Helen Baxendale (Elizabeth Cole), Anne Reid (Daisy Luttrell), Matthew McNulty (Major Allerton), Shaun Dingwall (Dr Franklin), Aidan McArdle (Stephen Norton) and Philip Glenister (Sir William Boyd-Carrington) were among the other cast. The program was aired in Britain on 13 November 2013, and later on Acorn TV on 25 August 2014. The adaptation mentions only the Litchfield, Sharples, and Etherington murders. Margaret Litchfield is hanged during the opening credits, whereas in the novel she dies in an asylum. The killer is <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> 'X' as in the novel, although it is alluded when Poirot speaks to others. Otherwise, the adaptation remains extremely faithful to the novel. The Poirot series is set in the 1930s, regardless of when the novels were written, or the contemporary features in each of the novels; this last story sets the year as 1949.|$|E

500|$|Gould met Darwin {{and told}} him that the Galápagos mockingbirds from {{different}} islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a [...] "wren" [...] was also in the finch group. Darwin had <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands. The two rheas were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.|$|E
500|$|Deutch related {{conclusions}} from the DAT report on December 7, 1995. Noting that Ames assisted Soviet/Russian [...] "'perception management operations'," [...] Deutch acknowledged that disinformation was channeled to policymakers {{unaware of the}} reports' suspect provenance, but maintained that the operations' scope and success were unclear. Deutch said that the DAT had identified 900 reports from 1985 to 1994, then found {{that many of the}} reports were sourced from Russian- and Soviet-controlled agents. While some reports indeed came with warnings, 95 reports from suspected double agents were <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> as such. Of those, [...] "at least three" [...] featured in reports to the president, including two from questioned sources and one from an agent believed to be controlled. He stated that it was critical to prevent the incident from reoccurring by informing policymakers whether reports are derived from suspected double agents, reviewing whether the disinformation influenced any decisions, and, if so, deciding if and how to react.|$|E
2500|$|Yin {{and yang}} are {{universal}} aspects all {{things can be}} classified under, this includes diseases in general {{as well as the}} Eight Principles' first three couples. For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang. Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> this way anymore. Exceptions are vacuity-cold and repletion-heat patterns, who are sometimes referred to as [...] "yin patterns" [...] and [...] "yang patterns" [...] respectively.|$|E

2500|$|For equipment, UNGERIN {{basically}} uses commercial scuba diver equipment. All operatives also {{equipped with}} lightweight PRO-TEC helmets, fire-resistant Nomex coveralls, or BDUs (battle dress uniform), Plate Carrier for carrying ammunition and specialist equipment, tactical gloves, balaclava or protective face covering, protective eye goggles, Gas mask, flashlight (usually a Surefire or Heckler & Koch brand), combat steel reinforced boots, flexi-cuffs, and thigh ammo. Ballistic vests including rigid plate inserts, are standard issue. These vests are labelled with [...] "POLICE", RMP insignia, or <b>not</b> <b>labelled,</b> {{to allow for}} easy identification. They often use drop leg holsters, while some officers prefer hip holsters.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kirshbaum, {{over the}} years the Israeli Government has {{continued}} to cancel and modify some of the Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, but mostly it has added more as it has continued to extend its declared state of emergency. For example, even though the Prevention of Infiltration Law of 1954 is <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> as an official [...] "Emergency Regulation," [...] it extends the applicability of the [...] "Defence (Emergency) Regulation 112" [...] of 1945 giving the Minister of Defence extraordinary powers of deportation for accused infiltrators even before they are convicted (Articles 30 & 32), and makes itself subject to cancellation when the Knesset ends the State of Emergency upon which all of the Emergency Regulations are dependent.|$|E
2500|$|The Companion {{considers}} Torikaebaya to {{deal with}} issues of sex, sexuality and gender [...] "more profoundly" [...] than William Shakespeare or Ben Jonson. The princess's acceptance of the male Naishi no Kami as a female and a lover has been variously described as either that she is very sheltered, or that sexual relationships were common between court ladies at the time. Although the tale has been regarded as immoral, Gregory Pflugfelder says that ultimately, the tale conforms to traditional roles. The father of the children initially considers their condition to be preordained as [...] "retribution" [...] for something they did in their past lives, {{as part of a}} Buddhist worldview. Pflugfelder says that in the original text, the siblings' condition is <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> definitively — where Willig adds [...] "confusion of sexual identity", the original text says merely [...] "such a condition". [...] The tengu were considered at the time to be evil, and the enemies of Buddhism.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Bopol began {{recording}} {{as a solo}} artist. [...] What {{some may}} consider to be his first solo albums are <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> as such: they are three of the series of eight albums released under the name Orchestre Mode Succes, Innovations (vols. 1-8). [...] Volumes 1, 3, and 4 in that series feature Bopol and Baba Ley Assaka. [...] By 1982 Bopol was living in Paris and recording solo albums. [...] That year he formed Les Quatre Étoiles (the Four Stars), with Wuta Mayi, Nyboma, and Syran Mbenza. [...] Les Quatre Etoiles played together as a band, but {{also served as a}} core group of talented musicians who often played on each other's records, and those of other artists—as is evident from Bopol's discography during the 1980s. [...] He recorded and performed with that band, as a solo artist, and in support of other artists through the 1980s and early 1990s. [...] On some of his records, the producer or a songwriter is listed as Don Paolo, another name for Bopol.|$|E

Some of the pictures are not good likenesses, and so I have <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> them, which you may do as fast [as] you discover whom they represent, as some of them resemble others more than themselves, but the poems are good without exception, and will compare favorably with Baron Alfred's latest on spring.|$|E

60|$|It is not {{possible}} to reverse this judgment or to take away a single count from it. Is there, then, anything whatever to be said for the English in the matter? There is: though the English never by any chance say it. Nor do the Irish say it; though it is in a sense a weakness as well as a defence. One would think the Irish had reason to say anything that can be said against the English ruling class, but they have not said, indeed they have hardly discovered, one quite simple fact--that it rules England. They are right in asking that the Irish should have a say in the Irish government, but they are quite wrong in supposing that the English have any particular say in English government. And I seriously believe I am not deceived by any national bias, when I say that the common Englishman would be quite incapable of the cruelties that were committed in his name. But, most important of all, it is the historical fact that there was another England, an England consisting of common Englishmen, which not only certainly would have done better, but actually did make some considerable attempt to do better. If anyone asks for the evidence, the answer is that the evidence has been destroyed, or at least deliberately boycotted: but {{can be found in the}} unfashionable corners of literature; and, when found, is final. If anyone asks for the great men of such a potential democratic England, the answer is that the great men are labelled small men, or <b>not</b> <b>labelled</b> at all; have been successfully belittled as the emancipation of which they dreamed has dwindled. The greatest of them is now little more than a name; he is criticised to be underrated and not to be understood; but he presented all that alternative and more liberal Englishry; and was enormously popular because he presented it. In taking him as the type of it we may tell most shortly the whole of this forgotten tale. And, even when I begin to tell it, I find myself in the presence of that ubiquitous evil which is the subject of this book. It is a fact, and I think it is not a coincidence, that in standing for a moment where this Englishman stood, I again find myself confronted by the German soldier.|$|E
