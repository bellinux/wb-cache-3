In the following, his brother’s, sons’ and grandsons’ lives are analyzed from the viewpoint of a more and more controversial social development during the first half of the 20 th century. The signs of belonging to a rather noble strata appeared in the second generation: marriages show high connectedness, but values were constant. A new administrative stratum evolved in this period showing a fairly integrated image as a historical formation, but behind the employment groups, social positions, digging deeply into personal fates we found very altering value systems.
