40|$|Convergent-divergent nozzles, when run at {{pressure}} ratios {{lower than the}} design value, often undergo a flow resonance accompanied by the emission of acoustic tones. The phenomenon, different in characteristics from conventional 'screech' tones, has been studied experimentally. Unlike screech, the frequency increases with increasing supply pressure. There is a 'staging' behavior; 'odd harmonic' stages resonate at lower pressures while the fundamental occurs {{in a range of}} higher pressures corresponding to a fully expanded Mach number (M(sub j)) around unity. The frequency (f(sub N)) variation with M(sub j) depends on the half angle-of-divergence (theta) of the nozzle. At smaller theta, the slope of f(sub N) versus M(sub j) curve becomes steeper. The resonance involves standing waves and is driven by unsteady shock/boundary layer interaction. The distance between the foot of the shock and the nozzle exit imposes the lengthscale (L'). The fundamental corresponds to a quarterwave resonance, the next stage at a lower supply pressure corresponds to a three-quarter-wave resonance, and so on. The principal trends in the frequency variation are explained simply from the characteristic variation of the length-scale L'. Based on the data, correlation equations are provided for the prediction of f(sub N). A striking feature is that tripping of the boundary layer near the <b>nozzle's</b> <b>throat</b> tends to suppress the resonance. In a practical nozzle a tendency for the occurrence of the phenomenon is thought {{to be a source of}} 'internal noise'; thus, there is a potential for noise benefit simply by appropriate boundary layer tripping near the <b>nozzle's</b> <b>throat...</b>|$|R

The major focus {{is the study of}} the separation itself concerning position, length, temperature rise and oxygen entry. A separation criterion is developed and validated with a large set of separation data gained from literature.

5000|$|During a Slam Acceleration on {{a single}} spool turbojet, the working line of the {{compressor}} tends to deviate from the steady state working line and adopt a curved path, initially going towards surge, but slowly returning to the steady state line, as the fuel flow reaches a new higher steady state value. During the initial overfuelling, the inertia of the spool tends to prevent the shaft speed from accelerating rapidly. Naturally, the extra fuel flow increases the turbine rotor entry temperature, '''''' [...] Since the turbine operates between two choked planes (i.e. the turbine and <b>nozzle</b> <b>throats),</b> the turbine pressure ratio and the corresponding temperature drop/entry temperature, '''''', remain approximately constant. Since '''''' increases, so must the temperature drop across the turbine and the turbine power output. This extra turbine power, increases the temperature rise across the compressor and, therefore, the compressor pressure ratio. Since the corrected speed of the compressor has hardly changed, the working point tends to move upwards, along a line of roughly constant corrected speed. As time progresses the shaft begins to accelerate and the effect just described diminishes.|$|R

The separators should be easily accessible or removable {{so that they can be}} cleaned if plugging occurs.|$|R

All other terms are constants that depend only on the composition of the material in the flow. Although the gas velocity reaches a maximum and becomes choked, the {{mass flow rate}} is not choked. The mass flow rate can still be increased if the upstream pressure is increased as this increases the density of the gas entering the orifice.|$|E

50|$|The minimum {{pressure}} ratios {{required for}} choked conditions to occur (when some typical industrial gases are flowing) {{are presented in}} Table 1.

Forward-thrust and pitch-vectored nozzle configurations were tested with each yaw vectoring concept. Four basic yaw vectoring concepts were investigated on the nonaxisymmetric convergent-divergent nozzles: (1) translating sidewall; (2) downstream (of throat) flaps; (3) upstream (of throat) port/flap; and (4) powered rudder. Selected combinations of the rudder with downstream flaps or upstream port/flap were also tested. A single yaw vectoring concept, post-exit flaps, was investigated on the single expansion ramp nozzles. All testing was conducted at static (no external flow) conditions and nozzle pressure ratios varied from 2. 0 up to 10. 0...|$|R

Upon making impact on its substrate, {{the surface of the}} material, the graphene evenly stretches out and expands due to the high kinetic energy delivered by the de Laval nozzle.

For example, a jet engine's physical properties such as turbine and <b>nozzle</b> <b>throat</b> areas can be explicitly calculated given a design thermodynamic cycle (air and fuel flow rates, pressures, and temperatures) at a specific flight condition and power setting, but the engine's operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties.|$|E
