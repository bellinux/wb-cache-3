5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
5|$|It {{took two}} and a half hours to control the fire. <b>Navigation</b> <b>lights</b> used for the heavy barge traffic were being changed at the time of the report. The Coast Guard shut down river traffic for about a mile around the bridge because debris was falling off the aging bridge. An {{official}} determination on the cause of the fire was expected in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{monitored}} by 132 sensors, including sensors on hatches to the pontoons, on {{doors to the}} steel box girder, for corrosion, strain gauges on the girder and on flexible elements, and weather information. On the cable-stayed section, the bridge is marked with <b>navigation</b> <b>lights,</b> {{as well as the}} center of the sailing area having a racon. The bridge is the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E

5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
5|$|RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command {{attempted}} to warn {{all of their}} airborne units of the potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate landing sites {{in the event of}} an attack on their airfields. All bomber and fighter groups were linked by telephone and ground control passed on all details of intruder operations to pilots including height and heading when they occurred. Station Commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could be ordered to switch the <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> off at any time. Only the Mosquito groups remained active against intruders, though the majority of these units were supporting Allied operations on the continent.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tidal}} {{section of the}} river below Gloucester, the Gloucester Harbour Trustees are the {{competent}} harbour authority. The Trustees maintain <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> at various points along the river (including on Chapel Rock and Lyde Rock, and leading lights at Slime Road, Sheperdine and Berkeley Pill).|$|E

25|$|In 2017, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the SR22 G6 (Generation 6), with several major upgrades to the avionics and new <b>navigation</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
25|$|According to Kim's {{account of}} the attack, the {{interceptor}} approached his aircraft from the right side rather than the left as required by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulation. Kim decreased his speed {{and turned on the}} <b>navigation</b> <b>lights,</b> indicating that he was ready to follow the Soviet fighter for landing.|$|E
25|$|Other {{alterations}} to {{the wings}} included new <b>navigation</b> <b>lights,</b> {{mounted on the}} wingtips, rather than the smaller lights {{above and below the}} wings of the earlier Mustangs, and retractable landing lights which were mounted {{at the back of the}} wheel wells; these replaced the lights which had been formerly mounted in the wing leading edges.|$|E
25|$|The initial kit {{price was}} US$24,500 and {{included}} the Rotax 582 powerplant, fiberglass enclosure, basic instrumentation, electric starter, landing lights and <b>navigation</b> <b>lights.</b> The components came pre-painted {{in a variety}} of optional colors. The composite tail and main rotor blades were advertised as “lifetime on condition", indicating no fixed lifespan. Assembly time was advertised as 40 hours.|$|E

50|$|The Wisconsin DNR {{purchased}} {{the island and}} buildings from Thordarson's heirs in 1965. Today the only other landholder on the island is the US Coast Guard, which maintains an automated <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> near the old lighthouse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island is}} about 500 m long and 250 m wide. It {{is almost entirely}} {{surrounded}} by a coral reef with some above-water rocks. A <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> is installed on the island. Its highest point is 64 m above sea level.|$|R
25|$|Looking {{over to the}} east, at 03:50, those aboard these LCAs {{could see}} the gunfire and flares that marked the {{collision}} of the Yellow Beach flotillas with the German convoy. Once the fire of the engagement far off to port died away, navigation was aided again by the spectacle of red and green <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> shining steadily on Dieppe's harbour entrance.|$|E
25|$|The ship left Britain {{again on}} 28 April 1940. In wartime {{merchant}} and naval ships were blacked out, including their <b>navigation</b> <b>lights.</b> In May Dominion Monarch {{collided with a}} coaster {{that was part of}} a convoy in the English Channel. Damage seems to have been slight, as she continued via Cape Town to Australia, calling at Fremantle, Adelaide and Melbourne before reaching Sydney on 6 June.|$|E
25|$|At 00:25 as the Monarch {{was to the}} {{northeast}} of Douglas, Isle of Man, her lookout, George Caddell, spotted {{the light on the}} Peveril's masthead away to port. On board the Peveril, First Officer Thomas Webb and the Peveril's lookout, A.B. Joseph Corris observed the masthead light and then the port <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> of another vessel which could be seen off the Peveril's starboard quarter, with the range decreasing and the bearing remaining constant.|$|E
50|$|The Heugh {{lighthouse}} is a <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> on The Headland in Hartlepool, in north-east England. The current lighthouse {{dates from}} 1927; it is {{owned and operated}} by PD Ports. It is claimed that its early-Victorian predecessor was the first lighthouse in the world reliably lit by gas.|$|R
50|$|Cape Mendocino <b>Light</b> was a <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> at Cape Mendocino, California. The former {{lighthouse}} was {{relocated to}} Shelter Cove near Point Delgada, California in 1998, and the historic Fresnel lens to Ferndale, California, in 1948. An automated beacon operated {{for a number}} of years but was removed in May 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system include an engine-driven hydraulic pump, a hydraulic reservoir/accumulator, and filter. The electrical systems involve a 24-volt battery, a high-energy ignition system, generator, landing and taxi lamps, <b>navigation</b> <b>lighting,</b> and an anti-collision beacon. Pneumatic systems comprise a bleed air compressor, de-icing/de-misting measures, and {{elements of the}} environmental control system.|$|R
25|$|Lanyon {{designed}} Sinclair Seaman's Presbyterian Church in 1856. Thomas Sinclair {{commissioned the}} church in memory of his father John Sinclair, who was a merchant from Belfast. Located on Corporation Square in Belfast's docks area, locally known as Sailortown, the church has a distinctive maritime theme. The lectern {{is made in the}} shape of a ship's prow. It also features a brass wheel and capstan from a World War I wreck, <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> from a Guinness barge, and the ship's bell from the pre-World War I battleship HMS Hood.|$|E
25|$|The Hawker Hurricane is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{outfitted with}} retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for the pilot. A clean, single-seat fighter, {{it was developed}} to provide a competent combatant for aerial combat against the latest fighter designs that were emerging amongst the air services of other powers of the era. The Hurricane was initially armed with an arrangement of eight remotely-operated wing-mounted Browning machine guns, intended for conducting rapid engagements. The Hurricane was typically equipped for flying under both day and night conditions, being provided with <b>navigation</b> <b>lights,</b> Harley landing lights, complete blind-flying equipment, and two-way radios. Upon its entry to service, much of the performance data was intentionally concealed from the general public, but it was known that the type possessed a speed range of 6:1.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 February 1942, Jacob Jones {{departed}} New York harbor and steamed southward along the New Jersey coast to patrol and search the area between Barnegat Light and Five Fathom Bank. Shortly after her departure, she received orders to concentrate her patrol activity in waters off Cape May and the Delaware Capes. At 1530 she spotted the burning wreckage of tanker R. P. Resor, torpedoed the previous day east of Barnegat Light; Jones circled the ship for two hours searching for survivors before resuming her southward course. Cruising at a steady 15 knots through calm seas, she last reported her position at 2000 and then commenced radio silence. A full moon lit the night sky and visibility was good; throughout the night the ship, completely darkened without running or <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> showing, kept her southward course.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> to {{actually}} be installed on Lady Elliot Island was installed two years later, in 1866, {{in connection with the}} guano mining company operating on the island which started in 1863. It was a temporary light installed on a tall mast, which survived until 1871 when it was destroyed by a gale and rebuilt.|$|R
2500|$|The {{remains of}} the boom and deep channel post are noted as {{potential}} hazards on shipping charts of the area. [...] A modern <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> with accompanying mooring bollards and accessway {{is located at the}} southern end of the boom. [...] On 25 July 2015 the boom was struck by an empty and drifting fishing vessel.|$|R

25|$|On June 20, 2012, Aguiar's 31-foot, {{center console}} Jupiter boat, named the T.T. Zion, landed on Fort Lauderdale Beach east of East Las Olas Boulevard around 1:15a.m., with its <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> on and engines still running, {{according}} to the Sun-Sentinel. Sea Tow, the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found. Authorities on ATVs searched {{up and down the}} beach, but found no sign of Aguiar. The Coast Guard commenced a search at sea. A search of his house found that his watch and wedding band had been left behind. In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department said that even though the investigation remains open, there have been no significant leads in the case.|$|E
25|$|The ship left Danzig at 12:30 pm on 30 January 1945, {{accompanied}} by the passenger liner Hansa, also filled with civilians and military personnel, and two torpedo boats. Hansa and one torpedo boat developed mechanical problems and could not continue, leaving Wilhelm Gustloff with one torpedo boat escort, Löwe. The ship had four captains (Wilhelm Gustloffs captain, two merchant marine captains and {{the captain of the}} U-Boat complement housed on the vessel) on board, and they could not agree on the best course of action to guard against submarine attacks. Against the advice of the military commander, Lieutenant Commander Wilhelm Zahn (a submariner who argued for a course in shallow waters close to shore and without lights), Wilhelm Gustloffs captain—Friedrich Petersen—decided to head for deep water which was known to have been cleared of mines. When he was informed by a mysterious radio message of an oncoming German minesweeper convoy, he decided to activate his ship's red and green <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> so as to avoid a collision in the dark, making Wilhelm Gustloff easy to spot in the night.|$|E
25|$|At 04:30 on 3 September, {{approximately}} an {{hour before}} first light, LCAs carrying British 5th Division and Canadian 1st Division troops of the 13th Corps, Eighth Army, touched down after crossing the Strait of Messina into Calabria. This was a shore to shore landing craft operation with the assault forces embarking at Mili Marina, south of Messina, and travelling an average of 12,000 yards to their assault beaches. The LCAs and LCMs that comprised the initial assault wave were joined by DUKWs and LCI(L)s in later waves. The flotillas were led in by Motor Launches, and guided by directional tracer from Bofors guns along with four vertical searchlight beams to allow coxswains to keep their bearings. Still, navigation proved difficult. The rapid and irregular currents, whirlpools, and winds of the Messina Strait hampered navigation. Though the night was starlit, with no moon, the prodigious artillery barrage accompanying the assault contained {{a high number of}} smoke rounds (500). The <b>navigation</b> <b>lights</b> of the guiding Motor Launches, which LCA coxswains were to follow, became lost among the lights on the opposing shore.|$|E
50|$|Under {{increasing}} commercial {{pressure from}} the docks at West Hartlepool the Tees Navigation Company decided to improve access to the River Tees by providing a pair of leading lighthouses (<b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> towers) on the coast at Seaton Carew.These were not the first lighthouses in Seaton Carew as {{there is evidence of}} an earlier lighthouse in the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|In its {{commanding}} {{position in}} San Pedro's middle breakwater, the lighthouse {{was considered an}} uncanny mechanical wonder when first established. Later, another <b>navigation</b> <b>light</b> in the Long Beach area was erected atop the pilot station at the Port of Long Beach in 1968. Marking the harbor entrance channel, the light is accompanied {{by one of the}} United States Coast Guard's radar scanners.|$|R
50|$|An t-Iasgair (Scottish Gaelic for the Fisherman) is a skerry in the Little Minch, to {{the north}} of the Trotternish {{peninsula}} of Skye. It lies 1.5 miles north north west of Ru Bornesketaig and is marked by a <b>navigation</b> <b>light.</b> It is the largest and highest in a group of three rocks, with smaller neighbours of Sgeir nan Ruideag and An Dubh Sgeir.|$|R
