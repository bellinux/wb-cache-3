25|$|This {{icy water}} rescue {{is said to}} have {{exacerbated}} Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge is}} the subject of several local legends. Its {{construction}} was said to have been financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiancés, however, had to meet with the local barons {{on the far side of}} the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen. Eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback. Both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> suffer the tragedy they had suffered. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Philoctetes was Heracles' friend, {{and because}} he lit Heracles's funeral pyre when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would,</b> he {{received}} Heracles' bow and arrows. He sailed with seven ships full of men to the Trojan War, where he was planning on fighting for the Achaeans. They stopped either at Chryse Island for supplies, or in Tenedos, {{along with the rest}} of the fleet. Philoctetes was then bitten by a snake. The wound festered and had a foul smell; on Odysseus's advice, the Atreidae ordered Philoctetes to stay on Lemnos. Medon took control of Philoctetes's men. While landing on Tenedos, Achilles killed king Tenes, son of Apollo, despite a warning by his mother that if he did so he would be killed himself by Apollo. From Tenedos, Agamemnon sent an embassy to Priam, composed of Menelaus, Odysseus, and Palamedes, asking for Helen's return. The embassy was refused.|$|E

25|$|In early August, Hansen {{suggested}} to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler's application, and Rigler initially {{balked at the}} idea but decided to talk it over with his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training {{as a social worker}} and had just completed a graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in nursery schools and Head Start Programs. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, which Jay Shurley said made them consider themselves more suitable guardians for Genie than Butler. They ultimately decided that, if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would,</b> they were willing to temporarily care for Genie until another suitable foster home became available. Rigler acknowledged the proposed arrangement would clearly put him in a dual relationship with her, but Children's Hospital and authorities decided that, in the absence of other adequate options, they would consent to making the Riglers Genie's temporary foster parents.|$|E
25|$|A new villainous Star Sapphire {{debuted in}} Green Lantern Vol 5 #21 (August 2013). Prixiam Nol-Anj {{was a former}} {{prisoner}} of the Oan sciencells, imprisoned for a slew of different crimes: racketeering, smuggling, extortion, murder for hire, abduction, trafficking in organisms, larceny, grand theft starship, and assault with an energy weapon. Over time, she uses her wiles to beguile her guard, a Green Lantern named Cossite, and he {{falls in love with}} her. When Larfleeze attacks Oa {{in the aftermath of the}} First Lantern's defeat and the death of the Guardians, his constructs kill a Star Sapphire who arrived to aid in the defense of the planet. The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence is proof that her love for him is true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to slip the ring onto her fingers and acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Munna Bhai series {{began after}} Vidhu Vinod Chopra agreed to produce Rajkumar Hirani's 2003 film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> (Hirani {{had worked as}} an editor on Chopra's 2000 film Mission Kashmir). They also collaborated on the script. Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. was a runaway success that {{prompted}} the duo to contemplate a sequel. The sequel was initially known as Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi and was later titled [...] Munnabhai 2nd Innings before being given its current name.|$|E

'I {{knew you}} would be a friend, and I knew <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> who <b>would.</b> You won't be afraid, Lord Nidderdale, that I shall ever think any more of all those things which he was planning?' She paused a moment, {{but he was not}} ready enough to have a word to say in answer to this. 'You know what has happened?' ...|$|R
500|$|Sumner largely {{acted as}} the band's director, a role he {{continued}} in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument {{on a few}} recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, [...] "He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> play like Ian". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would.</b> Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they {{had asked me to}} write Barbie, I would have done that, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacteria {{were first}} {{observed}} by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope {{of his own}} design. He then published his observations {{in a series of}} letters to the Royal Society of London. Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek's most remarkable microscopic discovery. They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and, {{in one of the most}} striking hiatuses in the history of science, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> see them again for over a century.His observations had also included protozoans which he called animalcules, and his findings were looked at again in the light of the more recent findings of [...] cell theory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Mershone {{might be}} an enemy, because I laughed at his love-making," [...] {{continued}} Louise, musingly. [...] "Would a man who loved a girl try to injure her? But perhaps his love has turned to hate. Anyhow, I can think of <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> who <b>would</b> do such a thing, or of any reason why Charlie Mershone should do it." ...|$|R
60|$|As it chanced we {{were among}} the last to leave the Castle, whence, to tell the truth, I was loath to go, for by now my blood was up, and with a few others fought till I was driven out. I prayed the lady Blanche to run forward with the other women. But she would not, {{answering}} that she trusted <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else,</b> but <b>would</b> stay to die with me, as though that would help either of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he is a lout and a beast," [...] said Ayala, jumping up. [...] "I {{wonder you}} should ask me;--as if that had {{anything}} to do with it. Would you fall in love with a lout because you had <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else?</b> I <b>would</b> rather live for ever all alone, even in Kingsbury Crescent, than have to think of becoming the wife of my cousin Tom." [...] At this Nina shrugged her shoulders, showing that her education in Italy had been less romantic than that accorded to Ayala in London.|$|R
500|$|The {{director}} was insistent that panel labels contain descriptive instructions {{that might be}} found on a starship, rather than made-up gibberish, greeking, or gag text. Designer Michael Okuda had finished a schematic of the Enterprises decks when Nimoy pointed out he had misspelled [...] "reclamation"; while Okuda was fairly certain <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> notice the single spelling error on the print, he had to fix it. Meyer also made a contentious decision to feature a kitchen in the film, a move that attracted fan controversy. Although the original series mentioned a galley in the episode [...] "Charlie X", only machines able to synthesize food had been shown before.|$|E
500|$|Although Nash's {{high school}} coach, Ian Hyde-Lay, sent letters of inquiry and {{highlight}} reels on Nash's behalf to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university, until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video {{footage of the}} young guard. After watching Nash in person, Davey said he [...] "was nervous as hell just hoping that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> see him. It didn't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy's pretty good. It was just a case of hoping {{that none of the}} big names came around." [...] However, Davey also told Nash that he was [...] "the worst defensive player" [...] he had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned we had to do it ourselves, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> do it for us." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} he only cared {{for his life}} because it was needed for the {{complete}} success of his schemes. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> he knew <b>would</b> have that note of personal hatred towards the enemy of France which was necessary now in order to carry out successfully the plans which he had formed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe you, Mr. Maddison," [...] he said cordially, {{holding out}} his hand. [...] "I think that the charge is absurd. In any case, please reckon me amongst your friends. If there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> whom you <b>would</b> prefer to see, I will go and get Dewes down from town in the morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{does not}} mean, however, {{they do not}} get along outside of work. Though they do not {{consider}} each other to be friends, their deep business relationship and {{respect for each other}} is evident. Hamada has said if they ever parted ways, he would [...] "never do comedy again," [...] as there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> he <b>would</b> like to make his partner (Matsumoto has expressed similar views). He has also said he saves his best tsukkomi material for Matsumoto. Tanaka of Cocorico reports seeing Matsumoto become visibly concerned whenever Hamada is sick and unable to come to work.|$|R
500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Ethical Culture School, Marshall spent a year at Columbia University. In 1920, he {{transferred}} to the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. [...] Marshall had decided in his teens {{that he wanted to}} be a forester, writing then about his love of [...] "the woods and solitude;" [...] he wrote that he [...] "should hate to spend the greater part of my lifetime in a stuffy office or in a crowded city". For a while he was unhappy and withdrawn at Syracuse. But, he succeeded academically and was known for his individuality. As one classmate put it, Marshall was [...] "always doing something <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> ever think of doing. He was constantly rating things—the Adirondack peaks, his best days with George, and dozens of others." [...] Marshall became a member of Alpha Xi Sigma, the forestry college's honor society. He ran on the Syracuse University freshman track team and participated in both junior varsity lacrosse and cross country running. Halfway through school, Marshall had become a class leader; he was elected as class secretary and appointed an associate editor of the Empire Forester, the College's yearbook.|$|E
2500|$|Tobias has low {{self-esteem}} and was often bullied in school before becoming an Animorph. [...] With both his parents dead, {{he lives with}} his aunt and uncle who share custody of him. [...] Tobias is trapped in a red-tailed hawk morph in the first book. [...] During the series, he regains the power to morph, but his natural form is now as a hawk. [...] He admires Jake because he always showed him respect and kindness when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would.</b> He also develops a close friendship with Ax.|$|E
2500|$|At trial Duško Vučković {{admitted}} {{he had been}} a member of the Serb Radical Party (SRS). He said that he joined the SRS because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> have taken him because of his mental health problems. [...] He had made plans to go to the frontline with SRS colleagues Zoran Dražilović, Ljubiša Petković and Zoran Rankić and received military training under supervision of Rankic and his brother. He had been arrested on 15 April 1992 after an incident in Zvornik but was released a few days later thanks to the efforts of the president of the SRS in Loznica and a lawyer hired by the party.|$|E
25|$|Libya {{made three}} stipulations, when agreeing {{to hand over}} the two accused to the Scottish police: {{that they would not be}} interviewed by the police; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> in Libya <b>would</b> be sought for the bombing; and, that the trial should be before three Scottish judges, sitting without a jury. On 5 April 1999, over a year ahead of the start of the trial, Megrahi and Fhimah arrived in the Netherlands.|$|R
6000|$|He shrugged {{away the}} thought {{that he ought to}} give some {{explanation}} of his question, and got into the cab again, telling the man to drive to Curzon Street. If she had not been to [...] "that Aunt Rosamund" [...] either it would be all right. She had not. There was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> she <b>would</b> go to. And, with a sigh of relief, he began to feel hungry, having had no breakfast. He would go to Rosek's, borrow the money to pay his cab, and lunch there. But Rosek was not in. He would have to go home to get the cab paid. The driver seemed to eye him queerly now, as though conceiving doubts about the fare.|$|R
5000|$|The Báb {{eliminated}} {{any form}} of successorship or vicegerency from his religion and stated that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else's</b> writings <b>would</b> be authoritative after his death {{to the time of}} He Whom God shall make Manifest. [...] Some of the followers of Subh-i-Azal state that the Báb actually made Subh-i-Azal his vicegerent because the Báb in a tablet written to Azal stated that he should manifest the remaining paths of the Bayán if He Whom God shall make Manifest is made manifest during Azal's days. The Azalis interpret this to mean the Báb gave Sub-i-Azal the right to complete the unfinished text of the Bayán. [...] However, the Báb affirms to Subh-i-Azal himself that He Whom God shall make Manifest may appear in Subh-i-Azal's own lifetime, and thus eliminates any viceregency for Subh-i-Azal.|$|R
2500|$|Sir Alan {{remarked that}} {{had it not}} been for circumstances, both Alex and Raef would have been fired. Although Alex avoided this, {{primarily}} for stepping up as PM when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would,</b> issues were raised for his lack of sales strategy and being less concerned over the split in the team that he oversaw. Despite giving a stronger defence, backing Alex up when questioned about his education, and stating he would work with someone irrespective of their background or interests, Raef was held responsible for incorrectly identifying several of the fish as cheaper varieties, while his [...] "Prince or Pauper" [...] statement was considered to be pompous by both Sugar and Alex.|$|E
2500|$|While Steve Canyon never {{achieved}} the popularity that Terry and the Pirates {{had as a}} World War II military adventure, it was a successful comic strip with a greater circulation than Terry ever had. A short-lived Steve Canyon television series was produced in 1958. Steve Canyon was often termed the [...] "unofficial spokesman" [...] for the Air Force. The title character's dedication to the military produced a negative reaction among readers during the Vietnam War, and the strip's circulation decreased as a result. Caniff nonetheless continued to enjoy enormous regard in the profession and in newspapering, and he produced the strip {{until his death in}} 1988. The strip was published {{for a couple of months}} after he died, but was ended in June 1988, due to Caniff's decision that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> continue the feature.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Woodward, {{a surgeon}} with the 22nd Illinois Infantry {{and a friend}} of Bickerdyke's, wrote home about the filthy, chaotic {{military}} hospitals at Cairo, Illinois. [...] The letter was read aloud in their church and Galesburg's citizens collected $500 worth of supplies and selected Bickerdyke to deliver them (<b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>would</b> go). [...] After meeting Mary Livermore, she was appointed a field agent for the Northwestern branch of the Sanitary Commission. Livermore also helped Bickerdyke find care for her two sons in Beloit, Wisconsin, while she was in the field with the army during the later part of the war. [...] Her sons complained about living in Beloit. She stayed in Cairo as a nurse, and while there, she organized the hospitals and gained Grant's appreciation. Grant endorsed her efforts and detailed soldiers to her hospital train, and when his army moved down the Mississippi, Bickerdyke went, too, setting up hospitals where they were needed. Bickerdyke became a matron of the hospital in only five months.|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not know}} why I should write all this to you except [...] that there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> to whom I can say it. There [...] is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> who <b>would</b> give a moment of time to such [...] lamentations. My friends will expect me to talk to them of [...] my {{experiences}} in the dock rather than politics, and will [...] want to know what rations I had in Newgate. I went to call [...] on the Governor only yesterday, and visited the old room. [...] "I never could really bring myself to think that you did [...] it, Mr. Finn," [...] he said. I looked at him and smiled, but [...] I should have liked to fly at his throat. Why did he not [...] know that the charge was a monstrous absurdity? Talking [...] of that, not even you were truer to me than your brother. [...] One expects it from a woman;--both the truth and the [...] discernment.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the series, Septimus and Jenna {{have been}} {{considered}} the main protagonists and are usually found together in the novels. Their relationship has also been brought to question {{a number of times}} in the series. For example, in the novel Physik, the ghost Etheldredda points out to Jenna that Septimus is her adoptive brother, to which Jenna steely asserts that he is her brother, leaving the [...] "adopitve" [...] out. In The Magykal Papers (a supplementary work for the series), Jenna Heap's biography states that of all people, there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> she <b>would</b> rather be with than Septimus. This same trend seems to have continued in the TodHunter Moon moon series as Jenna shows an instant dislike to a girl Septimus brings and expresses what seems like romantic jealousy over Septimus for going on a string of girlfriends.|$|R
25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could {{be done on the}} three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and <b>one</b> in Manchester. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else,</b> he said, <b>would</b> ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|R
