40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{considerable}} advances {{have been made}} in the study of the proteins and polypeptides of the cytoskeleton, and its three main components: microfilaments (MF), intermediate filaments (IMF) and microtubules (MT). The principal properties of these elements and those of many associated proteins are recalled. The actin MF are mainly involved in cell contractility, the IMF in cell shape, while the MT and their associated proteins are involved in intracellular transport. Some pathological modifications of the cytoskeleton will be considered. In the liver, accumulations of keratin result in the formation of Mallory's hyalin, found in several types of cirrhosis and hepatomas. In muscle, accumulations of desmin are observed in various myopathies. An accumulation of alpha-actinin at the Z bands characterizes <b>nemalin</b> myopathy. In several forms of hemolytic anemias, alterations of the membranous cytoskeletal components of the red blood cells [...] spectrin, ankyrin, actin [...] may explain their abnormal shape and excessive fragility. In the nervous system, many pathological conditions are related to abnormal cytoskeletal components. In Parkinson's disease, Lewy bodies are an accumulation of neurofilaments (IMF). In Alzheimer's disease, and some related conditions, the intraneuronal tangles are associated with modifications of MT and neurofilaments. The role of MT and in particular of the MT-associated protein tau, as demonstrated recently, confirms the involvement of the MT. The observed disturbances of MT-related axonal flow may explain some of the known functional changes in these forms of dementia. English AbstractJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Alpha-actinin (α-actinin) is a {{ubiquitous}} cytoskeletal protein, which {{belongs to}} the superfamily of filamentous actin (F-actin) crosslinking proteins. It is present in multiple subcellular regions of both muscle and non-muscle cells, including cell-cell and cell-matrix contact sites, cellular protrusions and stress fiber dense regions and thus, it seems to bear multiple important roles in the cell by linking the cytoskeleton to many different transmembrane proteins {{in a variety of}} junctions. Four isoforms of human α-actinin have already been identified namely, the "muscles" α-actinin- 2 and α-actinin- 3 and the "non-muscles" α-actinin- 1 and α-actinin- 4. The precise functions of α-actinin isoforms as well as the precise role and significance of their binding to F-actin particularly in-vivo, have been elusive. They are generally believed to represent key structural components of large-scale F-actin cohesion in cells required for cell shape and motility. α-Actinin- 2 has been implicated in myopathies such as <b>nemalin</b> body myopathy, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy and it may have at least an indirect pathogenetic role in diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like schizophrenia, epilepsy, ischemic brain damage, CNS lupus and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of "non-muscle" α-actinins in the kidney seems to be crucial as an essential component of the glomerular filtration barrier. Therefore, they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and minimal change disease. α-Actinin is also expressed on the membrane and cytosol of parenchymal and ductal cells of the liver and it seems that it interacts with hepatitis C virus in an essential way for the replication of the virus. Finally α-actinin, especially α-actinin- 4, has been implicated in cancer cell progression and metastasis, as well as the migration of several cell types participating in the immune response. Based on these functions, the accumulating reported evidence of the importance of α-actinin as a target autoantigen in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune hepatitis, is also discussed along with the possible perspectives that are potentially emerging from the study of this peculiar molecule in health and disease. © 2011 Elsevier B.
