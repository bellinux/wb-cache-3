5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently {{in retaliation for the}} Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. When he was on the field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E

25|$|Surrey captain John Edrich won the toss {{and decided}} to bat first. Openers Edrich, and Alan Butcher {{got off to a}} solid start, taking them to 48 for the first wicket. Their {{partnership}} was broken when Butcher was caught behind by Rod Marsh off the bowling of Len Pascoe for 23. Lonsdale Skinner contributed 17, but then Edrich was joined by Pakistan Test batsman Younis Ahmed, and the pair added 66 for the third wicket. Their stand was broken by the medium bowling of Max Walker who had Ahmed caught by Kim Hughes for 40, and dismissed Edrich caught behind for 70 soon after. Walker then dismissed David Smith for a duck, and at 165 for 5 the tourists were in a commanding position. New batsman Graham Roope had other ideas though, and was in commanding form. He formed lower order partnerships with Intikhab Alam (16), Robin Jackman (16), and Geoff Arnold (11) who all supported him ably {{as he made his way}} to 107 not out, guiding Surrey to a respectable 327 for 8. <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in the match, play was abandoned early on the second day due to rain, and no play occurred on the third day, with the match ending in a draw.|$|E
25|$|Galla Placidia, as Augusta, {{mother of}} the Emperor, and his {{guardian}} until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power {{and she could not}} herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius (magister militum in Gaul), Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa, and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy. Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire. Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum. <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in Rome's history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable.

It was {{at this time that}} musical relationships had also been struck with members of Rising Sons who would later feature in the band's recordings. The A deal also brought some contention between members of the band, torn between a career as an experimental [...] "pop" [...] group and that of a purist blues band. Working with young producer David Gates also opened up horizons for Vliet's skills as a poet-cum-lyricist, with his [...] "Who Do You Think You're Fooling" [...] on the flipside of the band's first single, a cover of the Ellas McDaniel/Willie Dixon-penned hit, [...] "Diddy Wah Diddy".

It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner."

Regardless {{of his recent}} double-century at Adelaide Morris (50) [...] "mistimed, misjudged and mishit", but managed to stay in as he and captain Lindsay Hassett (92) slowly increased the Australian innings. They were barracked heavily by the small crowd of 7,000 (in a stadium capable of holding 80,000) who wanted them {{to make way for}} the strokemakers Neil Harvey and Keith Miller. Their quality only became apparent when Morris was lbw to Brown at 111/2, closely followed by Harvey caught behind on 114/3 and Miller caught-and-bowled on 123/4 to give the England captain a spell of 3/0. The crowd increased to 20,000 as news of the England success traveled during the day and people came into see the fun. Hassett continued to hold the innings together, but Bedser worked his way through the line-up, bowling Graeme Hole and catching Ian Johnson lbw. Len Hutton took an excellent catch off Brown to dismiss the Australian captain 8 runs short of his century and another off Bedser to dispose of Don Tallon. Ray Lindwall (21) and Bill Johnston (12 not out) led a small fight back to get Australia from 187/8 to 206/8 at stumps and <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> England had the advantage on the first day.
