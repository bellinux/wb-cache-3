5|$|The Landing at Jacquinot Bay was an Allied amphibious {{operation}} undertaken on 4 November 1944 during the <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> Campaign of World War II. The landing was conducted {{as part of}} a change in responsibility for Allied operations on <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> with the Australian 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, taking over from the US 40th Infantry Division, which was needed for operations in the Philippines. The purpose of the operation was to establish a logistics base at Jacquinot Bay on the south coast of <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> to support the 5th Division's planned operations near the major Japanese garrison at Rabaul.|$|E

5|$|In December 1945, {{most of the}} {{battalion}} (except one platoon) was withdrawn to <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> to rejoin the 11th Brigade. In February 1946, the platoon that had remained on Nauru arrived in Rabaul. As the demobilisation process began, the 31st/51st stayed on <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> until May when they received orders to return to Australia. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Donald Lamb took over as battalion commander. As personnel were discharged or transferred to other units for further service, {{the battalion}}'s numbers declined until eventually, on 4 July 1946, the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, the Australian Government {{agreed to}} take on {{responsibility}} for the military operations in the northern Solomon Islands and Australian New Guinea, including <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b> The Australian Army's 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, was selected to replace the 40th Infantry Division on <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> in August, with the unit to assume responsibility for the island on 1 November. Instead of maintaining the American bases in western <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> the Australians planned to operate closer to the Japanese forces which were positioned around the Gazelle Peninsula in the north-east of the island. By {{the time of the}} Australian take-over, Allied intelligence estimated that the Japanese forces on <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> amounted to 38,000 personnel, but in actuality there were 93,000 Japanese on the island, forming part of General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army. The Japanese personnel were focused upon sustaining themselves, with rice-growing and gardening being undertaken to supplement the limited supplies that were arriving. Japanese supporting elements were limited, with only two aircraft capable of action and no ships other than 150 barges that could move up to 90 personnel or 15 tons of stores.|$|E

5|$|Sturdee's {{operations}} were effective. On Bougainville, {{at a cost}} of 516 Australian dead and 1,572 wounded, Savige's troops had occupied much of the island and killed 8,500 Japanese; another 9,800 died from malnutrition and disease. On <b>New</b> <b>Britain,</b> where 74 Australians died and 140 were wounded, the heavily outnumbered 5th Division had overrun central <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b> Meanwhile, the 6th Division at Aitape and Wewak had lost 442 dead and 1,141 wounded while clearing the Japanese from the coast and driving them into the mountains, killing 9,000 and taking 269 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division {{replaced}} the US 40th Infantry Division on <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> during October and November 1944 and continued the <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> Campaign {{with the goals}} of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul. In late November the 5thDivision established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau. The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay {{at the base of the}} Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas. By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force's aggressive patrolling. The 5th Division suffered 53fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign. After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong, which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Arawe (also {{known as}} Operation Director) was fought between Allied and Japanese forces during the <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> Campaign of World War II. The battle formed {{part of the}} Allied Operation Cartwheel, and had the {{objective}} of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western <b>New</b> <b>Britain,</b> and was reinforcing the region {{at the time of}} the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} 5th Division's planned {{offensive}} operations the Australian high command in the New Guinea area, New Guinea Force, {{determined that a}} logistics base needed to established closer to Rabaul than those used by the US Army forces on <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b> At a conference held on 24 August involving the commanders of New Guinea Force and the 5th Division, {{it was decided to}} investigate whether the Talasea-Hoskins area on the north coast of <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> and the Jacquinot Bay area on the south coast of the island could accommodate bases for the 5th Division.|$|E
5|$|As Allied {{intelligence}} {{regarding the}} Japanese was still uncertain, Ramsay, who officially assumed {{command of the}} forces on <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began sending out patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both {{the northern and southern}} coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the Gazelle Peninsula. The AIB also continued to operate in the area, passing information to the 5th Division. The Japanese lacked information on the movements of Allied forces in <b>New</b> <b>Britain,</b> and only learned of the change in command from Australian radio broadcasts.|$|E

5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population {{wanted to be part of}} a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E

5|$|On 22September 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) {{directed}} Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Alamo Force {{to secure}} western <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> {{and the surrounding}} islands. This operation had two goals, {{the first of which}} was to establish air and PT boat bases to attack the Japanese forces at Rabaul. The second objective was to secure the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits between New Guinea and <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> so that convoys could safely pass through them en route to conduct further landings along New Guinea's north coast and beyond. To this end, GHQ directed that both Cape Gloucester and Gasmata on New Britain's south coast be captured. This offensive was code-named Operation Dexterity. The 1stMarine Division was selected for the Cape Gloucester operation, and the heavily reinforced 126thRegimental Combat Team from the 32nd Infantry Division was to attack Gasmata.|$|E

5|$|Once a {{base was}} {{established}} at Jacquinot Bay {{it was used}} to support Australian operations near Rabaul which were conducted in early 1945 in conjunction with advances on the northern side of <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b> The campaign was effectively one of containment as the larger Japanese force was isolated while the Allies conducted further operations elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Komori Force {{was also}} {{directed}} to withdraw on 24February {{as part of}} the general Japanese retreat from western <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b> The Japanese immediately began to leave their positions, and headed north along inland trails to join other units. The Americans did not detect this withdrawal until 27February, when an attack conducted by the 2ndSquadron, 112thCavalry and the Marine tank company to clear the Arawe area of Japanese encountered no opposition. The Director Task Force subsequently established a number of observation posts along the southern coast of <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> and increased the distances covered by its reconnaissance patrols. Komori fell behind his unit, and was killed on 9April near San Remo on New Britain's north coast when he, his executive officer and two enlisted men they were travelling with were ambushed by a patrol from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, which had landed around Volupai and captured Talasea, on the Willaumez Peninsula, in early March.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of <b>New</b> <b>Britain.</b> Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed {{that he would not}} be required to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of <b>New</b> <b>Britain</b> east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
