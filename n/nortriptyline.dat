25|$|Traditionally, {{antidepressants}} such as sertraline, fluoxetine,citalopram, <b>nortriptyline</b> and amitriptyline {{have been}} prescribed with some efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} shown {{clinically}} to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, <b>nortriptyline,</b> gabapentin, and desipramine in humans.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline {{is readily}} absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and is extensively metabolized on first {{pass through the}} liver. It is metabolized mostly by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19-mediated N-demethylation into <b>nortriptyline,</b> which is another TCA in its own right. It is 96% bound to plasma proteins, <b>nortriptyline</b> is 93-95% bound to plasma proteins. It is mostly excreted in the urine (around 30–50%) as metabolites either free or as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Small amounts are also excreted in feces.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and TCAs amitriptyline, <b>nortriptyline</b> (Pamelor) and imipramine. Sertraline had much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurred more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appeared to be more effective than fluoxetine or <b>nortriptyline</b> in the older-than-70 subgroup. A 2003 trial of sertraline vs. placebo in elderly patients showed a statistically significant (that is, unlikely to occur by chance), but clinically very modest improvement in depression and no improvement in quality of life.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{statistical}} or meaningful clinical differences in remission rates, response rates, or times to remission or response among {{any of the}} medications compared in this study. These included bupropion sustained release, bupropion, citalopram, lithium, mirtazapine, <b>nortriptyline,</b> sertraline, triiodothyronine, tranylcypromine, and venlafaxine extended release.|$|E
25|$|Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran, {{as well as}} {{tricyclic}} antidepressants such as amitriptyline, <b>nortriptyline,</b> and desipramine {{are considered}} first-line medications for this condition. While amitriptyline and desipramine {{have been used as}} first-line treatments, the quality of evidence to support their use is poor.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include <b>nortriptyline</b> (noramitriptyline, N-desmethylamitriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Amitriptyline is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite <b>nortriptyline</b> being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of amitriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocycloheptene-5-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C20H23N with a molecular weight of 277.403g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely and the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-48-6, of the hydrochloride is 549-18-8, and of the embonate is 17086-03-2.|$|E
25|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressant}}s: Tricyclic antidepressant {{prescription drugs}} with anti-muscarinic properties {{have been proven}} successful in treating bedwetting, but also have {{an increased risk of}} side effects, including death from overdose. These drugs include amitriptyline, imipramine and <b>nortriptyline.</b> Studies find that patients using these drugs are 4.2 times as likely to stay dry as those taking a placebo. The relapse rates after stopping the medicines are close to 50%.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, <b>nortriptyline,</b> protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, <b>nortriptyline,</b> protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline acts {{primarily}} as a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), with strong actions on the serotonin transporter (SERT) and moderate effects on the norepinephrine transporter (NET). It has negligible influence on the dopamine transporter (DAT) and therefore does not affect dopamine reuptake, being nearly 1,000times weaker on inhibition of the reuptake of this neurotransmitter than on serotonin. It is metabolized to <b>nortriptyline,</b> a more potent and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and this may serve to complement its effects on norepinephrine reuptake.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline is a {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased {{blood levels of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and <b>nortriptyline,</b> {{as well as the}} CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Sertraline is often used in combination with stimulant medication for the treatment of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety in ADHD. Amphetamine metabolism inhibits enzyme CYP2D6, but has not been known to interfere with Sertraline metabolism.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and <b>nortriptyline),</b> and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|The inquest on 27 October 1980 {{showed that}} in 24 hours, Bonham had {{consumed}} around 40 shots (1–1.4 litres) of 40% ABV vodka, after which he vomited and choked. The finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body, {{in keeping with his}} recent abstention from heroin, which he had used intermittently for several years; although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant <b>nortriptyline)</b> to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.|$|E
500|$|A North American tour, the band's {{first since}} 1977, was {{scheduled}} to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham {{was picked up by}} Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (between 16 and 24 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, [...] "breakfast". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house—the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant <b>nortriptyline)</b> to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} some {{antidepressants}} that have been proven to be helpful {{in the context of}} smoking cessation/nicotine addiction, these medications include bupropion and <b>nortriptyline.</b> Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and has been FDA approved for smoking cessation, while <b>nortriptyline</b> is a tricyclic antidepressant which has been used to aid in smoking cessation though has not been FDA approved for this indication.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs), such as <b>nortriptyline,</b> {{have been}} used in the treatment of post-stroke depression. [...] More recently, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and citalopram, have become the pharmacologic therapy of choice due to the lower incidence of side effects. [...] Also, psychologic treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy, group therapy, and family therapy are reported to be useful adjuncts to treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only are}} tissues from maggots {{used to detect}} toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and {{identify}} toxins present in corpses upon death. [...] An instance of {{this finding was demonstrated}} by Edward McDonough, a medical examiner in Connecticut. [...] A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home. [...] Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: ampicillin, Ceclor, doxycyline, erythromycin, Elavil, Lomotil, pentazocine, and Tylenol 3. [...] McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of amitriptyline and <b>nortriptyline.</b> [...] Insect feces, shed pupal cases of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae), and shed larval skins of Dermestes maculates (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were gathered from the corpse at the scene. [...] McDonough sent these to an FBI lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis. [...] The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and <b>nortriptyline.</b> [...] Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues. [...] The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies. [...] The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after death.|$|E

50|$|In {{one study}} of {{long-term}} efficacy, <b>nortriptyline</b> showed a higher relapse rate in comparison with phenelzine in individuals being treated for depression, possibly due to the metabolite 10-hydroxynortriptyline being produced. The authors of a review noted that the <b>nortriptyline</b> group had more episodes prior to treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nortriptyline</b> {{should not}} be used in the acute {{recovery}} phase after myocardial infarction (viz, heart attack). Unlike the TCAs clomipramine and imipramine, concurrent use of <b>nortriptyline</b> with monoamine oxidase inhibitors does not pose a risk of serotonin syndrome, although there is still a risk of hypertensive crisis.|$|E
50|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding <b>nortriptyline</b> {{in persons}} who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due {{to the risk of}} a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. If use of <b>nortriptyline</b> is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of <b>nortriptyline</b> in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers.|$|E
50|$|These effects {{account for}} some {{therapeutic}} actions {{as well as}} for most side effects such as sedation, hypotension, anticholinergic effects, etc. <b>Nortriptyline</b> may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. In the short term; however, <b>nortriptyline</b> may disturb sleep due to its activating effect.|$|E
