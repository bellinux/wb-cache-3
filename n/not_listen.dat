5|$|Thumbelina {{tries to}} protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old field mouse and tends her {{dwelling}} in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to her protests.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E

5|$|Fàbregas' {{increase}} in exposure drew transfer speculation during the summer; Real Madrid {{expressed a desire}} to sign the Spaniard despite his long-term contract with Arsenal, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger stated that Arsenal would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to any offers. In September 2006, with six years left on his deal, Arsenal offered a new five-year deal (with an option to extend by a further three years) to the midfielder, which he signed on 19 October 2006. While the contract was unusually long, Fàbregas cited Arsenal's playing style and Wenger as reasons for his long-term commitment to the club.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Waugh {{accepted}} {{a fee of}} £250 from the BBC for an adaptation of Pinfold, as a radio play, by Michael Bakewell. The broadcast, on 7 June 1960, was well received by the critics, although Waugh did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to it. In September 1977 a staged version of the book, written by Ronald Harwood and directed by Michael Elliott, opened at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester. The play was brought to London, and performed at the Roundhouse Theatre in February 1979, where Michael Hordern's depiction of Pinfold was highly praised—"a man suffering from chronic indigestion of the soul".|$|E
5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E

5|$|The use of violence, {{with scores}} dead and injured, is totally {{incompatible}} with the policies and principles of any social democratic party anywhere in the world. Consequently, we consider that a party in government that does <b>not</b> <b>listen,</b> that does not move {{and that does not}} immediately initiate a process of meaningful change in these circumstances, cannot {{be a member of the}} Socialist International. We are, as of today, ceasing the membership of the NDP, however we remain determined to cooperate with all the democrats in Egypt striving to achieve an open, democratic, inclusive and secular state.|$|E
5|$|When {{the train}} crossed into Poland, he tells them, {{it was taken}} over by the Gestapo, the German secret police. The Jews were {{transferred}} to trucks, then driven to a forest in Galicia, near Kolomaye, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would <b>not</b> <b>listen,</b> making Moshe Night's first unheeded witness.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{met with}} Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace on October 9, 1941, {{to discuss the}} project. He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had {{concluded}} that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him that it would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.|$|E

5|$|Charizard {{appeared}} {{as the main}} Pokémon in the short novel, Charizard Go! Adapted by Tracey West, the novelisation retells Ash's journey with his Charmander, and it reaches its climax as Ash and Charizard battle in the Pokémon League at the Indigo Plateau against his good friend Ritchie. The story covers Ash and his companions finding the abandoned Charmander, the battles in which Charmeleon did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to Ash, and Charizard's battle against Blaine's Magmar. Charizard Go! is the sixth novel in the Pokémon Chapter Books series. Another chapter novel, All Fired Up: Pokémon the Johto Journeys, adapted by Jennifer Johnson, covers the portion of Ash's journey near Violet City and the Characific Valley. In the novel, Ash wonders if Charizard should leave his team forever; it covers the capture of Ash's Cyndaquil, his new fire Pokémon.|$|E

25|$|As a genre, reggae {{contains}} much Rastafari symbolism; however, most Rastas do <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to reggae music. The {{connection between}} reggae and Rastafari {{has often been}} over-exaggerated by those outside the religious movement.|$|E

25|$|Nderi wa Riera – {{the local}} {{politician}} for Ilmorog's district, he {{lives and works}} in Nairobi. He is a demagogue who does <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to the appeals of the villagers when they meet him. Rather, he is interested in Ilmorog merely for business, and is in league with Kimeria. With Kimeria and Chui, he is a director of the widely successful Theng'eta Breweries.|$|E
25|$|Ira Forman, {{executive}} director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicates that Obama will <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to the wrong people regarding the U.S.–Israel relationship. Some commentators opined that Emanuel {{would be good for the}} Israeli–Palestinian peace process because if Israeli leaders make excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel will be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply.|$|E
25|$|VIOLATION of INTERDICTION. The prior rule is violated. Therefore {{the hero}} did <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to the command or forbidding edict. Whether {{committed}} by the Hero by accident or temper, a third party or a foe, this generally leads to negative consequences. The villain enters the story via this event, although not necessarily confronting the hero. They may be a lurking and manipulative presence, or might act against the hero's family in his absence.|$|E

25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would <b>not</b> <b>listen</b> to people who had anything to say to him.|$|E
25|$|Verbs were {{conjugated}} in {{the past}} and future. The present tense was a compound tense, and was artificial (i.e., it wasn't in the language originally); it was made using forms of the verb ಆಗು/ಆ (= to become). There was a negative mood (e.g. from ಕೇಳ್ - To listen, ಕೇಳೆನ್ = I do <b>not</b> <b>listen,</b> I have not listened, I won't listen). Note that the negative mood is devoid of time aspect, and could and can be used with a past, present, or future meaning. Apart from the negative mood, all tenses were formed using personal terminations attached to participles of verbs.|$|E

Walter the Earl tries to tell the Periods mayor and council about the coming Mushroom army but they will <b>not</b> <b>listen.</b> He decides to raise the village {{without the help of}} the Periods. He is successful, but the Periods tell the villagers the Walter is deranged and the villagers are uncertain what to do. An eerie chanting is heard from the mountains.|$|E
