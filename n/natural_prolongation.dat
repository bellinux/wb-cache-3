5000|$|Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, party {{states may}} submit {{claims to the}} Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to extend its {{continental}} shelf beyond the 200-mile buffer that comprises a state’s exclusive economic zone. [...] This requires that the proposed extension be a <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of the state’s continental shelf, which can be concluded through bathymetric mapping and analysis. If a state can prove that a subsea formation is a <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of its continental shelf, it must consequently locate {{the foot of the}} slope, the physical boundary between the <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> and the abyssal plain of the ocean basin. The foot of the slope is then applied to two equations that inform the claim made by a state for the legal extension of its continental shelf.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} a Lie algebroid structure on an affine bundle whose base manifold is fibred over IR. It is argued that this is the framework which one needs for coming to a time-dependent generalization of the theory of Lagrangian systems on Lie algebroids. An extensive discussion is given of a way one can think of forms acting on sections of the affine bundle. It is further shown that the affine Lie algebroid structure gives rise to a coboundary operator on such forms. The concept of admissible curves and dynamical systems whose integral curves are admissible, brings an associated affine bundle into the picture, on which one can define in a <b>natural</b> way a <b>prolongation</b> of the original affine Lie algebroid structure...|$|R
60|$|The objectors perhaps may {{doubt whether}} human beings, if taught to {{consider}} happiness {{as the end}} of life, would be satisfied with such a moderate share of it. But great numbers of mankind have been satisfied with much less. The main constituents of a satisfied life appear to be two, either of which by itself is often found sufficient for the purpose: tranquillity, and excitement. With much tranquillity, many find that they can be content with very little pleasure: with much excitement, many can reconcile themselves to a considerable quantity of pain. There is assuredly no inherent impossibility in enabling even the mass of mankind to unite both; since the two are so far from being incompatible that they are in <b>natural</b> alliance, the <b>prolongation</b> of either being a preparation for, and exciting a wish for, the other. It is only those in whom indolence amounts to a vice, that do not desire excitement after an interval of repose; it is only those in whom the need of excitement is a disease, that feel the tranquillity which follows excitement dull and insipid, instead of pleasurable in direct proportion to the excitement which preceded it. When people who are tolerably fortunate in their outward lot do not find in life sufficient enjoyment to make it valuable to them, the cause generally is, caring for nobody but themselves. To those who have neither public nor private affections, the excitements of life are much curtailed, and in any case dwindle in value as the time approaches when all selfish interests must be terminated by death: while those who leave after them objects of personal affection, and especially those who have also cultivated a fellow-feeling with the collective interests of mankind, retain as lively an interest in life on the eve of death as in the vigour of youth and health. Next to selfishness, the principal cause which makes life unsatisfactory, is want of mental cultivation. A cultivated mind--I do not mean that of a philosopher, but any mind to which the fountains of knowledge have been opened, and which has been taught, in any tolerable degree, to exercise its faculties--finds sources of inexhaustible interest in all that surrounds it; in the objects of nature, the achievements of art, the imaginations of poetry, the incidents of history, the ways of mankind past and present, and their prospects in the future. It is possible, indeed, to become indifferent to all this, and that too without having exhausted a thousandth part of it; but only when one has had from the beginning no moral or human interest in these things, and has sought in them only the gratification of curiosity.|$|R

50|$|In {{invertebrate}} biology, an appendage (or outgrowth) is {{an external}} body part, or <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation,</b> that protrudes from an organism's body (in vertebrate biology, an {{example would be}} a vertebrate's limbs). An appendage is any of the homologous body parts that may extend from a body segment. These include antennae, mouthparts (including mandibles, maxillae and maxillipeds), gills, walking legs (pereiopods), swimming legs (pleopods), sexual organs (gonopods), {{and parts of the}} tail (uropods). Typically, each body segment carries one pair of appendages.|$|E
50|$|The first {{equation}} calculates the Hedberg Line, {{which is}} derived by adding 60 nautical {{miles to the}} foot of the slope of the <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation.</b> The second yields the Gardiner Line, which refers to the point at which the measurement of subsea sediment thickness is 1% of the distance back {{to the foot of}} the slope. The two formulae for deriving these values can be substituted in order to form a composite continental shelf for a coastal state that yields the most advantageous possible maritime territory extension.|$|E
5000|$|This strait {{remains the}} subject of a {{maritime}} boundary dispute between Canada and the United States. The dispute is only over the seaward boundary extending 200 mi west {{from the mouth of the}} strait. The maritime boundary within the strait is not in dispute. Both governments have proposed a boundary based on the principle of equidistance, but with different basepoint selections, resulting in small differences in the line. Resolution of the issue should be simple, but has been hindered because it might influence [...] maritime boundary issues between Canada and the United States. In addition, the government of British Columbia has rejected both equidistant proposals, instead arguing that the Juan de Fuca submarine canyon is the appropriate [...] "geomorphic and physiogeographic boundary". The proposed equidistant boundary currently marks the northern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. British Columbia's position is based on the principle of <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> which developed in international law. It poses a dilemma for the federal government of Canada. If Canada holds that the principle of <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> applies to the Juan de Fuca Canyon on its Pacific Ocean coast, the assertion could undermine Canada's argument in the Gulf of Maine boundary dispute. In this Atlantic Ocean context, Canada favours an outcome based on the principle of equidistance.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{principle}} being agreed to via negotiations, its use {{had been a}} constant point of discontent {{on the part of}} the Indonesians, with its former Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja saying that the country had been [...] "taken to the cleaners" [...] by Australia. With the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Indonesia argued that the median line - the equidistant line from the baselines of both countries - was the correct location of the boundary. The growing strength of Indonesia's argument over Australia's <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> principle had a significant bearing on the subsequent treaties between the two countries, namely the Timor Gap Treaty of 1989 and the 1997 Australia-Indonesia Maritime Delimitation Treaty.|$|E
50|$|The 1997 treaty saw Australia's <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> {{argument}} prevail {{as far as}} {{the seabed}} (essentially the continental shelf) claim is concerned. However, Indonesia's median line argument was accepted for establishing its rights over the water column or exclusive economic zone, resulting in the separation of the two types of boundaries. The treaty recognises Indonesia's full ownership of living resources in the water north of the water column boundary and south of the seabed boundary. The water column boundary, essentially the median line, has in fact been a de facto EEZ boundary since such a line was established by the Provisional Fisheries Surveillance and Enforcement Line (PFSEL) which was agreed to in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basis for}} {{establishing}} the boundary in the 1971 and 1972 treaties {{was that of}} the [...] "natural prolongation" [...] of the physical continental shelf. This resulted in the boundary running significantly north of the median line between the shores of Australia and Indonesia, thus benefiting Australia in terms of the division of the seabed ownership. The International Law view of settling overlapping claims has then moved towards the median-line concept, although Australia still holds the view that <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> was still relevant to determine the sovereignty of the seabed. This resulted in the separate treatment of establishing the seabed boundary and that for the water column, or essentially, the separation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone boundaries under the 1997 treaty.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dispute between}} Turkey and Greece is {{to what degree}} the Greek islands off the Turkish coast {{should be taken into}} account for {{determining}} the Greek and Turkish economic zones. Turkey argues that the notion of [...] "continental shelf", by its very definition, implies that distances should be measured from the continental mainland, claiming that the sea-bed of the Aegean geographically forms a <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of the Anatolian land mass. This would mean for Turkey to be entitled to economic zones up to the median line of the Aegean (leaving out, of course, the territorial waters around the Greek islands in its eastern half, which would remain as Greek exclaves.) Greece, on the other hand, claims that all islands {{must be taken into account}} on an equal basis. This would mean that Greece would gain the economic rights to almost the whole of the Aegean.|$|E

40|$|In the Libya/Malta case, the ICJ {{held that}} where {{the area to}} be delimited between two {{opposite}} States measures less than 400 nautical miles, distance, not <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> determines title to the continental shelf.

In the East China Sea which measures less than 400 nautical miles, China relies on <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> while Japan relies on the distance principle. This paper analyses the Libya/Malta decision to ascertain its correctness or otherwise, and its usefulness for resolving the East China Sea dispute. The central argument in this paper is that the decision is inapplicable to the East China Sea dispute because it is incompatible with Articles 76 (1), 77 (3) and 56 (3) of the Law of the Sea Convention...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{has nearly}} {{completed}} the surveying phase of its Continental Shelf Project. Some surveys {{have been designed}} to fill gaps in the 2, 500 m isobath and bathymetric foot of slope positions. Others {{have been designed to}} collect data to demonstrate <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> and to determine sediment thickness beyond the foot of slope. The seafloor around New Zealand is characterised by ridges and plateaus that reflect the complex tectonic history of the region. Rifting and subduction processes have resulted in continental fragmentation and continental growth by the accretion of terranes and the formation of island arcs. These complexities raise questions about how Article 76 should be interpreted in order to identify the edge of the Continental Shelf. The geological and morphological connection of two large continental fragments, Gilbert Seamount and Bollons Seamount, with the New Zealand landmass are discussed. Consideration of their relationship with the landmass highlights a number of issues concerning <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation.</b> The geological and morphological connection of the Hikurangi Plateau and the Resolution Ridge System with the New Zealand landmass are discussed. Their relationship with the New Zealand landmass shows that a subduction trench/plate boundary does not necessarily define foot of slope positions...|$|E

30|$|The {{generalized}} Maxwell distribution (GMD for short), a {{generalization of}} ordinary Maxwell (or classical Maxwell) distribution, was proposed by Vodă [1]. With the rapid development of economy {{and science and}} technology, some of the existing distribution functions cannot {{meet the needs of}} research. For example, for some skewed data, it is appropriate to describe and fit them only by using some logarithmic models. Therefore, the recent development of some new distribution functions and the study of logarithmic case of the distribution functions have become hot issues in the statistical field. For more details, please refer to [2 – 8]. In this paper, we define the logarithmic generalized Maxwell distribution (for brevity LGMD), which is a <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of the generalized Maxwell distribution. In addition to the previously mentioned, one motivation of thinking of LGMD is to obtain more efficient results as parameter estimators when random models were supposed with the LGMD error terms instead of normal ones. Other aspects, like compressive sensing, we hope the LGMD could be used to model impulsive noise [9].|$|E
40|$|The {{anomalous}} morphology of {{the seafloor}} is evidence which provide {{a clear idea}} of how dynamic the underwater world is and how often changes occur in geologic time scale. So, volcanic underwater chains linear or not appear as a common and sometimes distinctive submarine features. Additionally, tectonic and sedimentary processes, in conjunction or isolated, are responsible for the continental margin building and morphology. The UNCLOS in Article 76 mentioned the underwater features and Scientific and Technical Guidelines (STG) present details regarding the types of features cited on UNCLOS.

40|$|The East China Sea {{dispute between}} Japan and China has been intensifying {{although}} {{both parties have}} repeatedly declared their intention to turn the East China Sea into "the Sea of Peace，Cooperation and Friendship".

40|$|The {{legal status}} of Svalbard and its {{competence}} to generate maritime zones has long been disputed. Article 1 of the Svalbard Treaty grants Norway sovereignty over the Archipelago and its territorial waters and Norway holds that the Archipelago constitutes {{a part of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of the mainland continental shelf and that the continental shelf therefore is subject to Norwegian legislation. This thesis aims at investigating whether Svalbard can generate maritime zones and is indicative towards the conclusion that there is a discrepancy between state policy and state practice of recent years. This may indicate that there is a change in the Norwegian position. The thesis further raises the question on the consequences of Svalbard generating maritime zones and assumes consequently that the Svalbard Treaty and its regulatory framework applies to the continental shelf of Svalbard. The legal implications of the application of the Svalbard Treaty to activities related to the exploitation of non-living resources on the continental shelf is then discussed {{on the basis of the}} previous chapters concluding that Norway has the competence to apply Norwegian law to the extent it does not contravene with the non-discriminatory principle of the Svalbard Treaty...|$|E
40|$|I {{deal with}} three {{counterintuitive}} truisms: First, despite advances in inter-continental nuclear weaponry {{and the heavy}} buildup of land power over six decades, sea power {{continues to be a}} strategic imperative; and its importance has only increased {{after the end of the}} Cold War. Second, contrary to the expectations of nations, the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention is no panacea for resolving international maritime delimitation disputes. Its two cardinal principles [...] the <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of continental shelf, and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) — are potentially in conflict. When invoked by contending neighboring states, the two principles may lead to a deadlock that the Convention was meant to preclude. And, thirdly, in the neo-Mahanian age, maritime geography, rather than military power, is seen by some as a decisive criterion for determining who owns what bit of sea. A combination of these three conditions underscores the China-Japan conflict over the massive oil-gas deposits in the East China Sea. I go on to assess the conflict’s implications for the Liberal Theory of Peace that inspired the post-WWII global economic order, built on the premise that if world markets are freely open, then nations have no reason to go to war for the resources obtainable from the free market, at much lower costs. I discuss that the kind of “resource war ” gripping China and Japan in the oil-rich East China Sea today, quite typical of an age of resource scarcity, had not been foreseen by the proponents of the theory, thus calling for its updating and moderation.

40|$|Tensions between China and Japan over disputed {{maritime}} {{boundaries in}} the East China Sea have dramatically escalated {{in the past}} decade. This thesis examines how disputed delimitation in the East China Sea has impacted the development, interests, and policies of China s People s Liberation Army Navy. The key questions addressed in this paper are; how is China s interpretation of delimitation in the East China Sea unique? Why is maritime delimitation, particularly in the East China Sea, {{so important to the}} PLA Navy? And what policies is the PLA Navy promoting in support of China s East China Sea maritime delimitation claims and why? In brief, this paper will demonstrate and conclude that China has made a unique and controversially large maritime territory claim, based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea s 76 th article on <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of a nation s maritime shelf. The PLA Navy views maintaining and securing China s delimitated maritime territory as crucial to securing undersea natural resources and vital shipping lanes, thus securing China s economic power. The PLA Navy understands that a strong, blue-water navy is critical to a country s economic success and subsequent presence as an international political power. The key policies being promoted by the navy are the assertion and defense of maritime boundaries, especially rights to offshore resources with China s EEZ; securing sea lanes and freedom of navigation at sea; and being a presence in sovereignty disputes over offshore islands as well as Taiwan. All of these issues are critical to the PLA Navy s goals of preserving China s economic and political power...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Ottoman Empire, Greece and Turkey have each been vying for {{territory}} within their common waters in the Aegean Sea. For over five decades, the two governments have contested the territorial sovereignty of the two rocky islets of Imia, the delimitation of the continental shelf and the territorial sea, and whether the continental shelf is a <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> of Greece or Turkey’s mainland coast. Not surprisingly then, the two countries have disagreed on where to draw the respective border in the Aegean Sea and, perhaps more fundamentally, on the application of certain practices under international law. The Aegean Sea is itself unique being 400 miles long and 200 miles wide, with thousands of islands scattered throughout it. Of particular importance are the Imia rocks and islets, which are scattered approximately 4 miles off Turkey’s west mainland coast, in the southeast Aegean Sea, and are also approximately 2. 3 nautical miles from the Turkish island of Cavus. The islets are approximately 6 nautical miles east of the Greek island of Kalymnos, 1. 9 miles southeast of the Greek island of Kalolimnos, and 1 mile west of the boundary that divides the Greek and Turkish territorial sea. Being so close to Greek and Turkish territories, the islands {{are at the center of}} the Greek-Turkish dispute. This Article will examine possible maritime and airspace delimitations through the application of international law, including customary law and bi- and multi-lateral conventions. Part II begins with a brief discussion of the historical background that has shaped Greek- Turkish relations and led to the present-day dispute. Part III analyzes whether Turkey is bound by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and Part IV proposes delimitations of the maritime zones, while specifically discussing the Imia islets and whether they are juridical islands capable of generating any maritime zones. Part V provides possible territorial sea delimitations to the entire Aegean Sea, while Part VI discusses the relation between the territorial sea regime and the airspace above it. Lastly, Part VII outlines methods to delimit the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone areas in the entire Aegean Sea before concluding with a discussion on various dispute resolution methods that Greece and Turkey may consider to resolve their long-standing issues in the Aegean...|$|E
40|$|The Law of International Maritime Boundaries is {{characterized}} by an evolution that can be noticed at many levels. These levels include the application of equitable principles, the criteria for delimitation, the basis of title, the techniques, the methods and the applicable law. This legal evolution, which is deep-rooted in a case by case approach has not always led to greater predictability and consistency of the judicial and arbitral decisions. One {{should keep in mind}} the fact that each case is a unicum. From the 1969 pioneer North Continental Shelf Case to recent decisions, the position of the I. C. J. is well-established: there is not one method of delimitation which is predetermined or privileged, which takes priority or which is of mandatory application. The ultimate goal consists in drawing an equitable maritime boundary between coastal States. In Jan Mayen Case (Denmark/ Norway Case 1993), the I. C. J. made two major developments by considering in one hand the equidistance provision first codified at article 6 of Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf as a provisional method of delimitation. On the other hand, the Court gave notable effect to socio-economic factors which, prior to that case, had been constantly dismissed because of their subjectivity, variability and momentary nature (Tunisia/ Libya Case 1982). Regarding the basis of the title, progress from <b>natural</b> <b>prolongation</b> as the traditional basis of the title to 200 miles distance from the shoreline as the new basis of the title (Libya/ Malta Case 1985) should be noted. As for the application of equitable principles, one can say that they are progressively losing their variability. For the judge, in fact, equitable principles must be of an objective nature based mainly on coastal geography in order to be of general application. With regard to applicable law issues, besides the 1958 Geneva Convention, States now have recourse to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, States practice, jurisprudence, and rules of customary international law. In respect of that law which is evolving with its uncertainties, we have tried to lay stress on the contributions of African States to its development. We wanted to verify to what extent those States have played a significant part in the progressive development of the Law of the Sea in general and particularly with regard the law of maritime boundary delimitation. We have emphasized {{in the first part of}} our analysis, the evolution of the law of maritime boundaries. In the second part, we have analysed in two steps African contributions. We have concluded that African Coastal States should, as much as possible and in line with the trend to peaceful cooperation at sea in Africa, avoid resolving disputes through litigation. After having defined their maritime priorities, policies and strategies, States should use diplomatic negotiations to settle their maritime boundary disputes. They can also, as a supplementary approach, set up Joint Development Zones or provide for Joint Exploitation of their marine resources as an interim approach to disputes resolution. We have analyzed the legal implications of such regimes in the prospective case between Ivory Coast and Ghana. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
