40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM), in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical techniques {{have been used}} to study the electrochemical reactivity of transition metal (cobalt, <b>nickel,</b> and copper) <b>sulphides.</b> We show that cobalt and <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphides</b> react versus lithium through conversion reactions similarly to their homologous oxides with during the discharge step the formation of metallic nano-particles embedded in Li 2 S that on the following charge convert back into sulphides. In contrast, the electrochemical reactivity of CuS towards Li was shown to follow a displacement reaction leading to the growth and disappearance of large copper dendrites with a concomitant reversible decomposition/re-crystallization of the initial electrode material. We show from structural considerations that this mechanism is nested in the creation of Cu 2 -xS phases, since intermediary phases during cycling have both high copper mobility and a sulphur network close to that of Li 2 S. In spite of their attractive capacity, none of these compounds show good capacity retention over the studied voltage range (0 to 2. 5 V); the main reason being rooted in the partial solubility of Li 2 S into the electrolyte. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

40|$|The {{valuable}} {{components of}} the platinum group element (PGE) bearing ores of the Bushveld complex in South Africa constitute between 1 % and as little as 0. 1 % of the total mass. In the processing of these ores by flotation, the naturally hydrophobic talc minerals cause over stable froths. The drainage of liquid and entrained particles is reduced thus the recovery of other gangue minerals by entrainment increases and grade decreases. In the rougher float depressants are added to produce a manageable froth and improve the grade by reducing the overall amount of the naturally floating gangue in the concentrates. Depending on dosage, depressants may also affect {{the recovery of the}} valuable minerals in the ore positively by slime cleaning or negatively by depression. Depression of stabilising gangue minerals such as talc decreases the froth stability and may also affect the recovery of valuables. Frothers are added to flotation systems to create stable froths. They increase the water layer around bubbles and the carrying capacity of the froth and thus recovery by entrainment. The drainage of entrained particles from the froth may be further increased by increasing the froth depth. This study investigated the interactive effects of depressant dosage and type, frother dosage and froth depth on the recovery and grade of copper and <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphides,</b> recovery of water, floatable and entrained gangue in the flotation of a Merensky ore. Since it is known that water recovery is closely related to froth stability it was used to infer froth stability in this study. Two types of depressants carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and guar gums which are usually used in the flotation of PGE bearing ores were used. The frother was Dow 250. Results showed that increasing either guar or CMC dosages from 50 to 100 g/t enhanced the recovery of copper and <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphides.</b> This was attributed to the slime cleaning action of the depressants and their stabilising effects. A further increase of dosage to 300 g/t decreased the recovery of copper and nickel indicating that depression of sulphides occurs at high depressant dosages. Both the use of guar and CMC depressants reduced the recovery of floatable gangue with increasing dosage as expected. The guar depressant showed greater depression ability at 50 g/t dosage than the CMC depressant while the CMC was more effective at 100 and 300 g/t dosage. Reduction of water recovery by the CMC depressant was greater than that of the guar depressant indicating that the CMC depressant had greater destabilising effects on the froth. It is known that the CMC depressant has a strong negative charge while the guar depressant is only slightly charged. The guar depressant may have caused aggregation of particles which has less destabilising effects than the dispersed particles {{in the presence of the}} CMC depressant. The froth recoveries showed that the effects of depressant and frother dosages counteract each other and that the decrease in the recovery of copper and <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphides</b> obtained at higher depressant dosages can be reversed by increasing frother dosage. However although increased frother dosage readily reverses the depressant effects, an increase of water and recovery by entrainment reduces the grade. The effect of depressant dosage increase on the water and froth stability is small in comparison to the effect of increased frother dosage. Thus for the levels tested the benefit of improved grade obtained by depressant addition would be lost. The increase of froth depth to reduce entrainment resulted in a reduction of the recoveries of the valuable minerals but with the desired increase in grade. Smaller increments of frother dosage are required to produce effective reversal of depressant effects on the recovery of valuable minerals to achieve a good overall flotation performance...|$|R

Conventional processing of these minerals has, until rather recently, involved pyrometallurgical operations which convert the sulphides directly to metal in some cases (e. g. copper and lead) or to oxides in others (e. g. nickel and zinc). Alternative hydrometallurgical routes have received much attention {{in recent years as}} a result of many factors,the principal of which is the necessity of treating low-grade ores in a relatively pollution-free manner. The first step in such a process is the leaching of the sulphide mineral by a process which has, in most cases, involved the oxidation of the sulphide to the corresponding metal ion and elemental sulphur or, in some instances, to sulphate. Little attention has been given to an alternative dissolution reaction which one can write in the general form and which we have termed “non-oxidative” dissolution in that no change occurs in the formal oxidation states of the reactants. In the case of predominantly ionic sulphides such as those of the alkaline and alkaline-earth elements, the above reaction simply involves the transfer of ions across the double-layer from the lattice to the solution.

Samples of massive sulphides from three deposits with diverse deformation and metamorphic histories (the Silver Swan, Perseverance and Flying Fox deposits) {{have been studied}} by electron backscatter diffraction and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry. These ore bodies were selected to investigate the relationship between microstructures and mineral trace element chemistry in three dominant sulphide species in each deposit. In all three samples, pyrrhotite preserves a strong evidence of crystal plasticity relative to both pentlandite and pyrite. The trace element composition of pyrrhotite shows significant variation in specific elements (Pb, Bi and Ag). This variation correlates spatially with intragrain pyrrhotite microstructures, such as low angle and twin boundaries. Minor signatures of crystal plasticity in pyrite and pentlandite occur {{in the form of}} rare low angle boundaries (pentlandite) and mild lattice misorientation (pyrite). Trace element compositions of pentlandite and pyrite show no correlation with microstructures. Variations in pyrrhotite are interpreted as a result of intragrain diffusion during the syn- and post-deformation history of the deposit. Intragrain diffusion can occur either due to bulk diffusion, dislocation–impurity pair diffusion, or by “pipe diffusion”, i. e. along fast diffusion pathways at high and low angle, and twin boundaries. This contribution examines three different diffusion models and suggests that dislocation–impurity pair diffusion and pipe diffusion are the most likely processes behind increased trace element concentration along the microstructures in pyrrhotite. The same phenomenon is observed in samples from three different deposits that experienced widely different metamorphic conditions, implying that the final disposition of these elements reflects a post peak-metamorphic stage of the geological history of all three deposits...|$|R

A high resolution aeromagnetic survey {{has been carried out}} to help increase the knowledge of this area and encourage exploration. The Lake Harris Komatiite, approximately 500 km northwest of Adelaide forms a prominent linear magnetic anomaly which was drilled {{on the basis of this}} survey. Petrographic studies reveal that the komatiite is serpentinised. This low-temperature hydrothermal metamorphic process is important in understanding the magnetic properties of the komatiite as the degree of serpentinisation is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility. Magnetite is formed during this process as a by product of the breakdown of olivine into serpentine and chlorite. Various <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphides</b> were also formed during this process. Shear zones in the komatiite have been subsequently altered by hydrothermal fluids which have deposited native copper. A series of linear magnetic features are visible on the aeromagnetic map of the komatiite. The vertical gradient was used to model these features, interpreted to be komatiite flows. The vertical gradient enhances near surface anomalies and improves the resolution of such bodies. Modelling reveals that the komatiite has been folded twice, the first tightly on an east west fold axis; the second is a gentle north trending fold caused by doming when the Glenloth Granite intruded the komatiite. These folds are offset by a series of dip slip and strike slip north west. trending faults.

The wood’s Point dyke swarm, Victoria, consists of a set of abundant subparallel narrow dykes with occasional elliptical expansions (“bulges”) intruded into strongly folded Lower Palaeozoic sediments. The swarm represents a hisly differentiated calc-alkaline rock series derived by fractional crystallization of a single parent magma, possibly of periodotitic composition. The rock types present include both high and low Cr-Ni periodotites, pyroxenite, hornblendite, hornblende diorite and monzonite, biotite leucodiorite, and minor residual granophyre. Apart from this hornblende-bearing rock series, a few hornblende-free basaltic dykes of related chemical composition but intruded later, are petrographically and mineralogically distinct, displaying tholeiitic tendencies. The latter dykes appear to be genetically related to volcanics underlying the Upper Devonian Acheron and Cerberean cauldron subsidences. Fractional crystallization, flowage differentiation, crystal accumulation and chilling were important factors {{in the development of the}} members of the dyke swarm, whilst assimilation in situ was not. The dykes are zonod, ultramafic types having more basic interiors (“cores”) whereas basic to intermediate composition bulges have more basic margins (“rims”). Magmalic copper-nickel sulphides rich in precious metals (Pt, Pd, Au) occur in dyke bulges of all compositions, especially close to margins where they accumulated by gravitational settling or were trapped by chilling. The sulphides have high Cu/Ni (and Co/Ni) ratios indicative of a highly evolved magma and, along with Au, Pd and Ir are fractionated between dykes of different silicate compositions. The base metal contents of silicates and sulphides vary sympathetically. The dykes have undergone pervasive hydrothermal alteration during which sulphides were largely recrystallised and Au was leached from some copper-nickel sulphides. A zonal arrangement of increasing intensity of alteration inwards was observed in one ultramefic dyke bulge. Later the dykes were deformed and the basic to intermediate composition dykes were fractured and veined, and major gold deposits formed. The veins have associated wall rock alteration which may be mineralogically subdivided into inner and out zones. Dyke bulges, ultramafic rocks, copper <b>nickel</b> <b>sulphides</b> and Au mineralization are all concentrated along two main lineations paralleling the fold axes of the sedimentary trough. The eastern and more important trend (at the centre of the trough) marks the eastern limit of the dyke swarm except at its northern end.

The source of the Au could have been various rock types present at depth, including copper-nickel sulphides and Lower Palaeozoic sediments. Open Acces...|$|R
