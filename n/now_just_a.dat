5|$|St Aelrhiw's Church at Y Rhiw {{was built}} in 1860 on the {{footings}} of an earlier church. It consists of a small nave and short chancel; aisles {{to the north and}} south; and has boulder-built walls and a slate roof. The churchyard contains the graves of some of the bodies that were washed up at Porth Neigwl during the First World War. Above Porth Iago is the site of the ancient St Medin's Church; <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> mound {{in the middle of a}} field, it was the parish church of Bodferin.|$|E
5|$|The early {{breakaway}} included four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the breakaway, <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake on a corner and ended up in a field. On the climb, Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb, but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E

25|$|Realising {{that she}} and K-9 are {{effectively}} on their own, she tries {{to figure out how}} to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the when of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K-9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something that was right under their noses all along.|$|E

Crossing over a small waterway that drains into the Great South Bay, the route passes south of Amityville Memorial High School. After crossing another waterway, NY27A crosses into the town of Babylon. Now in the Copiague section of Babylon, the route proceeds northeast through Copiague, intersecting with the southern end of CR47 (Great Neck Road). Once again a four-lane boulevard, NY27A crosses into the village of Lindenhurst, now boasting the West Montauk Highway moniker.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{terrorism}} {{experts do}} not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda's leadership. Although bin Laden still held considerable ideological sway over some Muslim extremists before his death, experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another.

2500|$|By {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, {{less than a}} fifth of the pits on the Tyne and Wear were using keels to load coal. The {{introduction}} of coal staithes and steam tugs had already severely diminished the number of keelmen. The new docks with their efficient coal loading facilities brought the final demise of the keels and the men who worked them. The {{second half of the nineteenth}} century was a time of rapid industrial growth on Tyneside and Wearside, so that the keelmen would be readily absorbed within other industries. They are <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> distant memory with little to remind us of them, apart from the Keelmen's Hospital that still stands in Newcastle and the well known local song, [...] "The Keel Row".|$|E

2500|$|The Fringe's own {{position}} on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book Sore Throats & Overdrafts, [...] "No-one can say what the quality will be like overall. It does not much matter, actually, for {{that is not the}} point of the Fringe ... The Fringe is a forum for ideas and achievement unique in the UK, and in the whole world ... Where else could all this be attempted, let alone work?". Views from the middle ground of this perennial debate point out that the Fringe is not complete artistic anarchy. Some venues do influence or decide on the content of their programme, such as the Traverse and Aurora Nova, who used to run their own venue but are <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> production group.|$|E

[...] Anupa Mistry of Now felt that [...] "The features wouldn’t be so bad if Game didn’t yield to the wattage and personalities of his co-stars. (Again, he can rap when he tries.)

2500|$|The salmon {{has long}} been {{at the heart of}} the culture and {{livelihood}} of coastal dwellers, which can be traced as far back 5,000 years when archeologists discovered Nisqually tribes remnants. The original distribution of the Genus Oncorhynchus covered the Pacific Rim coastline. History shows salmon used tributaries, rivers and estuaries without regard to jurisdiction for 18–22 million years. Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based off the inconsistent historical data, but confirmed there have been massive depletion since 1900s. The Pacific Northwest was once sprawled with native inhabitants who practiced eco management, to ensure little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats. As animists, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon spirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning. Natives often used the entire fish and left no waste by creating items such turning the bladder into glue, bones for toys, and skin for clothing and shoes. The first salmon ceremony was introduced by indigenous tribes on the pacific coast, which consists of three major parts. First is the welcoming of the first catch, then comes the cooking and lastly, the return of the bones to the Sea to induce hospitality so that other salmon would give their lives to the people of that village. Many tribes such as the Yurok had a taboo against harvesting the first fish that swam upriver in summer, but once they confirmed that the salmon had returned in abundance they would begin to catch them in plentiful. The indigenous practices were guided by deep ecological wisdom, which was eradicated when Euro-American settlements began to be developed. Salmon have a much grander history than what is presently shown today. The Salmon that once dominated the Pacific Ocean are <b>now</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> fraction in population and size. The Pacific salmon population is now less than 1–3% of what it was when Lewis and Clark arrived at the region.

However, Jensen also made a mistake. His discovery was a chimera; the collection of fossils came from two different dinosaur species, both of which already had names.
