50|$|A Ti or tumour {{inducing}} plasmid is a plasmid that often, but not always, {{is a part}} of {{the genetic}} equipment that Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes use to transduce their genetic material to plants. The Ti plasmid is lost when Agrobacterium is grown above 28 Â°C. Such cured bacteria do not induce crown galls, i.e. they become avirulent. pTi and pRi share little sequence homology but are functionally rather similar. The Ti plasmids are classified into different types based on the type of opine produced by their genes.

A281 was genetically engineered through a double crossover, site-directed deletion to yield EHA101, a T-DNA deleted strain useful for target gene transfer into plants. EHA101 is resistant to kanamycin by way of an npt I gene in place of T-DNA. The parent strain, A281, does not show antibiotic resistances at higher levels than normal A. tumefaciens strains. Moreover, other transconjugant strains in the C58C1 background, do not show these increased resistances to antibiotics. Therefore, these characteristics are not simply {{a manifestation of the}} chromosomal background, but most likely an interaction of this Ti plasmid and the C58 chromosomal background.|$|E
50|$|The plasmid T-DNA is {{integrated}} semi-randomly into the genome {{of the host}} cell, and the tumor morphology genes on the T-DNA are expressed, causing {{the formation of a}} gall. The T-DNA carries genes for the biosynthetic enzymes for the production of unusual amino acids, typically octopine or <b>nopaline.</b> It also carries genes for the biosynthesis of the plant hormones, auxin and cytokinins, and for the biosynthesis of opines, providing a carbon and nitrogen source for the bacteria that most other micro-organisms can't use, giving Agrobacterium a selective advantage. By altering the hormone balance in the plant cell, the division of those cells cannot be controlled by the plant, and tumors form. The ratio of auxin to cytokinin produced by the tumor genes determines the morphology of the tumor (root-like, disorganized or shoot-like).|$|E

Panwar stumbles through the presentation, showcasing their life work: asterids (artificial neurons) known as LOVs. Although LOVs showed promise in initial experiments, the enhanced intelligence of the test animals was offset by the uncontrolled growth of the LOVs, which eventually killed their hosts. LOVs were therefore made dependent on two amino acids: <b>nopaline</b> for metabolism and octopine for reproduction. In {{the second phase of}} the experiment, the LOVs were encased in silicate shells. These LOVs were able to safely interact with the test animals. Unfortunately, an unrelated incident at a rival biotechnology company prompted a government crackdown, and the LOVs were exported to the Hammer, a space station in low Earth orbit.|$|E
40|$|Crown gall tumors {{produced}} octopine or <b>nopaline</b> or neither compound, {{depending on}} the bacterial strain that incited the tumor. The genes specifying production of octopine or <b>nopaline</b> by the tumor were transferred to recipient bacterial strains when the large plasmid associated with virulence was transferred by either conjugation or deoxyribonucleic acid-mediated transformation. Our results, which confirm the work of others (Bomhoff et al., 1976; Goldman et al., 1968; Petit et al., 1970), indicate that, in general, the strains that utilize octopine induce tumors that synthesize octopine, and those that utilize <b>nopaline</b> induce tumors that synthesize <b>nopaline.</b> However, there were several notable exceptions. One class utilized both octopine and <b>nopaline,</b> but the tumors induced by these strains produced only <b>nopaline.</b> Another class utilized <b>nopaline,</b> but their tumors synthesized neither <b>nopaline</b> nor octopine. Mutants were isolated {{from a number of}} either octopine- or nopaline-utilizing strains that no longer could utilize the relevant guanido amino acid. These strains, which were mutant in the gene specifying octopine or <b>nopaline</b> oxidase, still retained the permease for these amino acids as well as virulence. Tumors induced by these mutants still synthesized approximately the same levels of octopine and <b>nopaline</b> as tumors induced by their parents. These results suggest that the plasmid gene that determines production of octopine or <b>nopaline</b> by the tumor is distinct from the plasmid gene that determines their catabolism by the bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{vir genes}} of octopine, <b>nopaline,</b> and l,l-succinamopine Ti {{plasmids}} exhibit structural and functional similarities. However, we observed {{differences in the}} interactions between octopine and <b>nopaline</b> vir components. The induction of an octopine virEA 6 ::lacZ fusion (pSM 358 cd) was 2. 3 -fold higher in an octopine strain (A 348) than in a <b>nopaline</b> strain (C 58). Supplementation of the octopine virGA 6 in a <b>nopaline</b> strain with pSM 358 did not completely restore virEA 6 induction. However, addition of the octopine virAA 6 to the above strain increased virEA 6 induction to a level almost comparable to that in octopine strains. In a reciprocal analysis, the induction of a <b>nopaline</b> virEC 58 ::cat fusion (pUCD 1553) was two- to threefold higher in <b>nopaline</b> (C 58 and T 37) strains than in octopine (A 348 and Ach 5) and l,l-succinamopine (A 281) strains. Supplementation of <b>nopaline</b> virAC 58 and virGC 58 in an octopine strain (A 348) harboring pUCD 1553 increased induction levels of virEC 58 ::cat fusion to a level comparable {{to that in a}} <b>nopaline</b> strain (C 58). Our results suggest that octopine and l,l-succinamopine VirG proteins induce the octopine virEA 6 more efficiently than they do the <b>nopaline</b> virEC 58. Conversely, the <b>nopaline</b> VirG protein induces the <b>nopaline</b> virEC 58 more efficiently than it does the octopine virEA 6. The ability of Bo 542 virG to bring about supervirulence in tobacco is observed for an octopine vir helper (LBA 4404) but not for a <b>nopaline</b> vir helper (PMP 90). Our analyses reveal that quantitative differences exist in the interactions between VirG and vir boxes of different Ti plasmids. Efficient vir gene induction in octopine and <b>nopaline</b> strains requires virA, virG, and vir boxes from the respective Ti plasmids...|$|E

In addition, strains C 58 and Ach- 5 of A. tumefaciens have chromosomal ornithine catabolism genes. The chromosomal orc gene codes for ornithine dehydrogenase. Strain C 58 is normally orc, but orc+ mutants can be selected. We have characterized both chromosomal orc and pTiC 58 nocA plasmid genes. Complementation of most chromosomal orc mutants by pTiC 58 restored growth on both <b>nopaline</b> and L-ornithine {{but did not}} restore ornithine dehydrogenase activity. We conclude that ornithine is an intermediate of <b>nopaline</b> degradation and that the Ti plasmid and chromosome both code for ornithine-degradative enzymes. A model for <b>nopaline</b> catabolism is presented...|$|E
40|$|Several <b>nopaline</b> {{degrading}} strains and one octopine degrading strain {{are shown}} to loose oncogenicity {{as well as}} the ability to utilize these guanidine compounds when they are cured of their TI plasmid. To investigate whether the specific genes involved in the utilization of one or the other compound are located on the plasmid, plasmid-transfer experiments have been performed. The plasmid from a <b>nopaline</b> degrading strain has been transferred to a naturally non oncogenic Agrobacterium namely A. radiobacter. Furthermore, the plasmid from an octopine degrading strain has been transferred to a plasmid-cured strain which originally had the capacity to utilize <b>nopaline.</b> Both kinds of experiments prove that the TI plasmid determines the strain specificity with regard to the utilization of either octopine or <b>nopaline.</b> They also demonstrate that the synthesis of either octopine or <b>nopaline</b> in crown gall cells is also determined by genes located on the TI plasmid harboured by the transforming A. tumefaciens strains...|$|E
40|$|Transfer of octopine Ti {{plasmids}} to strains already {{carrying an}} octopine Ti plasmid {{was found to}} occur at the same (high) frequency as transfer to Ti plasmid lacking recipients, showing that resident Ti plasmids do not exhibit entry exclusion towards incoming Ti plasmids. The resident octopine Ti plasmid was lost by the recipient after {{the entrance of the}} incoming Ti plasmid, which is indicative of the incompatibility between the Ti plasmids. Octopine Ti plasmids were found to become established only infrequently in recipients with a <b>nopaline</b> Ti plasmid and, vice versa, <b>nopaline</b> Ti plasmids were only rarely established in recipients with an octopine Ti plasmid. Rare clones in which the incoming octopine (<b>nopaline)</b> Ti plasmid had been established despite the presence of a <b>nopaline</b> (octopine) Ti plasmid appeared to harbor cointegrates consisting of the entire incoming Ti plasmid and the entire resident Ti plasmid. The integration event invariably had occurred in a region of the plasmids that is highly conserved in evolution and that is essential for oncogenicity. These results show that octopine and <b>nopaline</b> Ti plasmids cannot be maintained as separate replicons by one and the same cell. Therefore, be definition, these plasmids belong to the same incompatibility group, which has been names inc Rh- 1. Agrobacterial non-Ti octopine and <b>nopaline</b> plasmids were found to belong to another incompatibility group. The tumorigenic properties of strains harboring two different Ti plasmids, in a cointegrate structure, were indicative of the virulence genes of both of them being expressed. The agrobacterial non-Ti octopine and <b>nopaline</b> plasmids did not influence the virulence properties encoded by the Ti plasmid...|$|E
40|$|The occ and noc {{regions of}} pTiAch 5 (octopine) and pTiC 58 (<b>nopaline)</b> Ti {{plasmids}} {{are responsible for}} the catabolic utilization of octopine and <b>nopaline</b> in Agrobacterium spp. The first enzymatic step is the oxidative cleavage into L-arginine and pyruvate or 2 -ketoglutarate, respectively, by membrane-bound opine oxidases requiring two polypeptides (subunits B and A) for function. The DNA sequences showed that the subunits of pTiAch 5 and pTiC 58 are related, but none of the proteins revealed significant similarities to the biosynthetic enzymes expressed in transformed plant cells. The four proteins had no extensive overall similarity to other proteins, but the 35 N-terminal amino acids contained motifs found in many enzymes utilizing flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, or NAD(P) + as cofactors. However, the activities were completely independent of added cofactors, {{and the nature of the}} electron acceptor remained unclear. Membrane solubilization led to complete loss of enzyme activity. The <b>nopaline</b> oxidase accepted <b>nopaline</b> and octopine (Vmax ratio, 5 : 1) with similar Km values (1. 1 mM). The octopine oxidase had high activity with octopine (Km = 1 mM) and barely detectable activity with <b>nopaline.</b> The subunits from the occ and the noc regions were exchangeable. The combinations ooxB-noxA and noxB-ooxA both produced active enzymes which oxidized octopine and <b>nopaline</b> at similar rates, suggesting that both subunits contributed to the substrate specificity. These experiments also showed that the formation of functional enzyme required close proximity of the subunit genes on the same plasmid and that even a reversal of the gene order (A-B instead of B-A) led to reduced activity...|$|E
40|$|Most biotype 2 {{strains of}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens and A. radiobacter which utilize <b>nopaline</b> also degrade octopine. In all such strains studied, {{the ability to}} degrade octopine {{did not appear to}} be {{transferred}} to plasmidless recipient cells under conditions of plasmid transfer in which the ability to utilize <b>nopaline</b> was transferred. An octopine-degrading mutant was isolated in a strain cured of its plasmid, suggesting that genes of octopine degradation may have a chromosomal location in some strains. In strains in which octopine utilization is coded by plasmid genes, octopine degradation was always inducible, whereas in strains which degrade both octopine and <b>nopaline,</b> octopine utilization was constitutive although <b>nopaline</b> degradation was inducible. When plasmids coding for octopine-utilizing ability were transformed into a strain containing either a nopaline- or null-type plasmid, transformants able to degrade octopine were either not observed or were unstable upon purification. All of these data suggest that plasmids associated with virulence are incompatible with one another, and therefore imply that the major groups of plasmids associated with virulence have a common origin...|$|E
40|$|We have {{employed}} the P type plasmid RP 4 and the transposons Tn 1 and Tn 7 to isolate insertion and deletion mutations in the <b>nopaline</b> Ti-plasmid pTiC 58.

They correspond to regions of homology between octopine and <b>nopaline</b> plasmids. One of these regions {{is part of the}} T-DNA, the Ti-plasmid DNA present in transformed plant cells.

40|$|Extracts {{prepared}} from sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) crown gall tissues {{induced by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains C 58 and T 37 (<b>nopaline</b> utilizers) catalyze {{the synthesis of}} <b>nopaline</b> and ornaline. These compounds are not synthesized in extracts of crown gall tissues induced by strains B 6, 15955 (octopine utilizers), and AT 1 (utilizes neither octopine nor <b>nopaline)</b> or in extracts of habituated sunflower callus. Both synthetic activities require NADPH, Î±-ketoglutarate, and either arginine or ornithine; histidine and lysine will not substitute. Incorporation of arginine or ornithine into product is inhibited by the other substrate but not by histidine or lysine. On the basis of inhibition and Km data, both activities appear to be catalyzed by one enzyme and the same enzyme is apparently present in crown gall tissues induced by strains C 58 and T 37...|$|E
40|$|Octopine and <b>nopaline</b> are two arginine-derived opines {{synthesized}} {{in plant}} cells transformed with octopine or <b>nopaline</b> plasmids. Utilization in Agrobacterium tumefaciens is mediated by Ti plasmid regions called occ or noc (octopine or <b>nopaline</b> catabolism), and recent experiments showed that noc in pTiC 58 codes for a pathway from <b>nopaline</b> to L-proline. The last enzyme is ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD), an unusual protein converting L-ornithine directly into L-proline. We investigated whether octopine plasmid pTiAch 5 also harbors a gene for OCD. The results revealed an ocd gene which is induced by octopine and maps in the occ region. DNA sequence analysis and {{comparison with the}} gene from pTiC 58 showed that the two genes are related (69 % homology in DNA and deduced amino acid sequence), and antiserum against OCD(C 58) also reacted with OCD(Ach 5). The enzyme activity was characterized, and a comparison with OCD(C 58) showed that the properties are similar, but not identical. Differences were detected in the regulation of enzyme activity by L-arginine and L-proline and in the response to varying ratios of NAD+/NADH. It is proposed that this reflects different mechanisms for integration of opine catabolism into general metabolism...|$|E

These chimeric genes were introduced into petunia plants and the copy number of the gene, the steady state level of NPTII transcript and the levels of NPTII enzyme activity were determined. In this paper, we report that the NPT II transcript levels are on the average 30 fold higher in plants containing CaMV 35 S promoter and leader sequences than in plants containing the same reporter gene but <b>nopaline</b> synthase promoter and leader sequences.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the molecular and ecological mechanisms involved in niche expansion, or generalism, versus specialization in sympatric plant pathogens. Nopaline-type and octopine-type Agrobacterium tumefaciens engineer distinct niches in their plant hosts that provide different nutrients: <b>nopaline</b> or octopine, respectively. Previous studies revealed that nopaline-type pathogens may expand their niche to also assimilate octopine {{in the presence}} of <b>nopaline,</b> but consequences of this phenomenon on pathogen dynamics in planta were not known. Here, we provided molecular insight into how the transport protein NocT can bind octopine as well as <b>nopaline,</b> contributing to niche expansion. We further showed that despite the ability for niche expansion, nopaline-type pathogens had no competitive advantage over octopine-type pathogens in co-infected plants. We also demonstrated that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the nocR gene was sufficient to allow octopine assimilation by nopaline-type strains even in absence of <b>nopaline.</b> The evolved nocR bacteria had higher fitness than their ancestor in octopine-rich transgenic plants but lower fitness in tumors induced by octopine-type pathogens. Overall, this work elucidates the specialization of A. tumefaciens to particular opine niches and explains why generalists do not always spread despite the advantage associated with broader nutritional niches.
