The {{requirements}} {{for a system}} are often specified as textual <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> Although they are written in natural language, the simple and uniform sentence structure used makes automated processing of <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> feasible. However, the <b>numerous</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> approaches vary in the permitted complexity and variations of sentence structure.

Such complexity makes the process of creating and maintaining requirements traceability links expensive. Also, obtaining useful project related information from existing traceability links is difficult. This is because understanding vital information about a software process requires insight into where information centres exist within the software project. For instance, which of the entities within the traceability network are potential single points of failure and where are the bottlenecks within the software project. This paper presents an approach that enables an automated generation of requirements traceability network of <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> code artefacts and developers.

40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables non-invasive, cyto-architectural {{mapping of}} in vivo tissue {{microarchitecture}} through voxel-wise mathematical modeling of multiple {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) acquisitions, each differently sensitized to water diffusion. DTI computations are fundamentally estimation processes and are sensitive to noise and artifacts. Despite widespread adoption in the neuroimaging community, maintaining consistent DTI data quality remains challenging given the propensity for patient motion, artifacts associated with fast imaging techniques, {{and the possibility of}} hardware changes/failures. Furthermore, the quantity of data acquired per voxel, the non-linear estimation process, and <b>numerous</b> potential <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> complicate traditional visual data inspection approaches. Currently, quality inspection of DTI data has relied on visual inspection and individual processing in DTI analysis software programs (e. g. DTIPrep, DTI-studio).

It is critical that these performance measures be developed in a cost effective manner allowing annual tabulation and longitudinal performance measurement. This dissertation describes performance metrics that were developed to assess the mobility of the interstate system using crowd sourced probe vehicle data. These measurements are illustrated in this dissertation using a series of case studies on both Indiana highways and Interstate 80 from coast to coast. ^ The proposed series of performance measures developed from crowd source data can be used to rank and prioritize decisions on all levels of roadway using mobility as the defining characteristic. The proposed performance measures have <b>numerous</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> The arterial performance measures can be used to determine reliability of a corridor, signal retiming needs for a corridor, and user cost savings from signal retiming of a corridor. The interstate corridor performance measures developed can be used to quickly assess conditions temporally and spatially. The statewide performance measures can be used to identify capital project allocation and to locate and understand potential deficiencies of the network. Adhering to the scalability message, these performance measures were designed such that they could scale nationally. This scaling ability allows these measures to be utilized by the Federal Highway Administration or the United States Department of Transportation to assess network performance. ^ This dissertation outlines the performance measures and their scalability from the arterial roadway to the national interstate system. Using a series of case studies the performance measures are introduced and demonstrated. The dissertation concludes with recommendations on how to use the performance measures and proposing the development of a real time performance measure dashboard for agency use. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing.

The benefits that are offered by the Internet are negated {{due to the fact}} that the intruders abuse and compromise the Internet through sophisticated cybercrimes and computer crimes. Cybercrime and computer crime has caused great havoc and panic in the Internet usage and network security. As a result it has become very important to protect the information residing in the computer systems that are connected especially to the networks, as it is the primary target for criminal activities. It is impossible to build a completely secure system as intruders find new methods to compromise the system. The least that can be done is to detect the intrusions; in–order to either fix the vulnerability or to avoid the intrusions from re–occurring. One such tool that detects intrusions is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However IDSs have their own challenges such as the incapability of detecting new intrusions and generating a multitude of false alarms. The focus of this research is to alleviate the current issues in IDSs by designing a Network IDS using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The study thus aims at making the intrusion detection process robust by detecting unknown intrusions with less number of false alarms using GA principles. Further, a prototype of an IDS using GAs was developed to substantiate the study and evaluate the effectiveness, uniqueness and flexibility. The results showed that the GA–NIDS proved to be flexible and unique in accepting any format of rule as well as detecting both known and unknown intrusions. Master...|$|E
40|$|Motivation. Finding {{relevant}} {{scientific literature}} {{is one of}} the essential tasks researchers are facing on a daily basis. Digital libraries and web information retrieval techniques provide rapid access to a vast amount of scientific literature. However, no further automated support is available that would enable fine-grained access to the knowledge ‘stored’ in these documents. The emerging domain of Semantic Publishing aims at making scientific knowledge accessible to both humans and machines, by adding semantic annotations to content, such as a publication’s contributions, methods, or application domains. However, despite the promises of better knowledge access, the manual annotation of existing research literature is prohibitively expensive for wide-spread adoption. We argue that a novel combination of three distinct methods can significantly advance this vision in a fully-automated way: (i) Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Rhetorical Entity (RE) detection; (ii) Named Entity (NE) recognition based on the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud; and (iii) automatic knowledge base construction for both NEs and REs using semantic web ontologies that interconnect entities in documents with the machine-readable LOD cloud. Results. We present a complete workflow to transform scientific literature into a semantic knowledge base, based on the W 3 C standards RDF and RDFS. A text mining pipeline, implemented based on the GATE framework, automatically extracts rhetorical entities of type Claims and Contributions from full-text scientific literature. These REs are further enriched with named entities, represented as URIs to the linked open data cloud, by integrating the DBpedia Spotlight tool into our workflow. Text mining results are stored in a knowledge base through a flexible export process that provides for a dynamic mapping of semantic annotations to LOD vocabularies through rules stored in the knowledge base. We created a gold standard corpus from computer science conference proceedings and journal articles, where Claim and Contribution sentences are manually annotated with their respective types using LOD URIs. The performance of the RE detection phase is evaluated against this corpus, where it achieves an average F-measure of 0. 73. We further demonstrate a number of semantic queries that show how the generated knowledge base can provide support for <b>numerous</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> in managing scientific literature.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{deals with the}} user-experience related to embodied music mediation technologies. More specifically, adoption and policy problems surrounding new media (art) are considered, which arise from the usability issues that to date pervade new interfaces for musical expression. Since {{the emergence of new}} wireless mediators and control devices for musical expression, there is an explicit aspiration of the creative industries and various research centers to embed such technologies into different areas of the cultural industries. The number of applications and their uses have exponentially increased over the last decade. Conversely, many of the applications to date still suffer from severe usability problems, which not only hinder the adoption by the cultural sector, but also make culture participants take a rather cautious, hesitant, or even downright negative stance towards these technologies. Therefore, this thesis takes a vantage point that is in part sociological in nature, yet has a link to cultural studies as well. It combines this with a musicological frame of reference to which it introduces empirical user-oriented approaches, predominantly taken from the field of human-computer-interaction studies. This interdisciplinary strategy is adopted to cope with the complex nature of digital embodied music controlling technologies. Within the Flanders cultural (and creative) industries, opportunities of systems affiliated with embodied interaction are created and examined. This constitutes an epistemological jigsaw that looks into 1) “which stakeholders require what various levels of involvement, what interactive means and what artistic possibilities?”, 2) “the way in which artistic aspirations, cultural prerequisites and operational necessities of (prospective) users can be defined?”, 3) “how functional, artistic and aesthetic requirements can be accommodated?”, and 4) “how quality of use and quality of experience can be achieved, quantified, evaluated and, eventually, improved?”. Within this multi-facetted problem, the eventual aim is to assess the applicability of the foresaid technology, both from a theoretically and empirically sound basis, and to facilitate widening and enhancing the adoption of said technologies. Methodologically, this is achieved by 1) applied experimentation, 2) interview techniques, 3) self-reporting and survey research, 4) usability evaluation of existing devices, and 5) human-computer interaction methods applied – and attuned – to the specific case of embodied music mediation technologies. Within that scope, concepts related to usability, flow, presence, goal assessment and game enjoyment are scrutinized and applied, and both task- and experience-oriented heuristics and metrics are developed and tested. In the first part, covering three chapters, the general context of the thesis is given. In the first chapter, an introduction to the topic is offered and the current problems are enumerated. In the second chapter, a broader theoretical background is presented of the concepts that underpin the project, namely 1) the paradigm of embodiment and its connection to musicology, 2) a state of the arts concerning new interfaces for musical expression, 3) an introduction into HCI-usability and its application domain in systematic musicology, 4) an insight into user-centered digital design procedures, and 5) the challenges brought about by e-culture and digitization for the cultural-creative industries. In the third chapter, the state of the arts concerning the available methodologies related to the thesis’ endeavor is discussed, a set of literature-based design guidelines are enumerated and from this a conceptual model is deduced which is gradually presented throughout the thesis, and fully deployed in the “SoundField”-project (as described in Chapter 9). The following chapters, contained {{in the second part of}} the thesis, give a quasi-chronological overview of how methodological concepts have been applied throughout the empirical case studies, aimed specifically at the exploration of the various aspects of the complex status quaestionis. In the fourth chapter, a series of application-based tests, predominantly revolving around interface evaluation, illustrate the complex relation between gestural interfaces and meaningful musical expression, advocating a more user-centered development approach to be adopted. In the fifth chapter, a multi-purpose questionnaire dubbed “What Moves You” is discussed, which aimed at creating a survey of the (prospective) end-users of embodied music mediation technologies. Therefore, it primarily focused on cultural background, musical profile and preferences, views on embodied interaction, literacy of and attitudes towards new technology and participation in digital culture. In the sixth chapter, the ethnographical studies that accompanied the exhibition of two interactive art pieces, entitled "Heart as an Ocean" & "Lament", are discussed. In these studies, the use of interview and questionnaire methodologies together with the presentation and reception of interactive art pieces, are probed. In the seventh chapter, the development of the collaboratively controlled music-game “Sync-In-Team” is presented, in which interface evaluation, presence, game enjoyment and goal assessment are the pivotal topics. In the eighth chapter, two usability studies are considered, that were conducted on prototype systems/interfaces, namely a heuristic evaluation of the “Virtual String” and a usability metrics evaluation on the “Multi-Level Sonification Tool”. The findings of these two studies in conjunction with the exploratory studies performed in association with the interactive art pieces, finally gave rise to the “SoundField”-project, which is recounted in full throughout the ninth chapter. The integrated participatory design and evaluation method, presented in the conceptual model is fully applied over the course of the “SoundField”-project, in which technological opportunities and ecological validity and applicability are investigated through user-informed development of <b>numerous</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> The third and last part of the thesis renders the final conclusions of this {{research project}}. The tenth chapter sets out with an epilogue in which a brief overview is given on how the state of the arts has evolved since the end of the project (as the research ended in 2012, but the research field has obviously moved on), and attempts to consolidate the implications of the research studies with some of the realities of the Flemish cultural-creative industries. Chapter eleven continues by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the conceptual model throughout the various stages of the project. Also, it comprises the evaluation of the hypotheses, how the assumptions that were made held up, and how the research questions eventually could be assessed. Finally, the twelfth and last chapter concludes with the most important findings of the project. Also, it discusses some of the implications on cultural production, artistic research policy and offers an outlook on future research beyond the scope of the “SoundField” project...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 The control-flow {{for five}} kinds of <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> is analysed: for common <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> variant <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> {{component}} <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> specialised <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> and for ordered <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> The control-flow semantics of <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> – {{and of the}} uses-relation, the extends-relation and the precedes-relation between use cases- is {{described in terms of}} flowgraphs. Sequence diagrams of <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> are refined to capture the control-flow adequately. Guidelines are given for <b>use</b> <b>case</b> de-scriptions to attain a well-defined flow of control...|$|R
30|$|Advice use case: The <b>use</b> <b>case</b> {{template}} {{describes the}} variabilities as advice <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> The advice <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> capture crosscutting requirements and are {{defined in the}} same form as normal <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> but they may only {{have some of the}} <b>use</b> <b>case</b> sections. The linking of advice <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> with affected base <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> is based on syntactical matching of joinpoints and pointcut expressions.|$|R
