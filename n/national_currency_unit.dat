40|$|Inflation {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} modern {{macroeconomic}} problems. Nowadays the issue of inflation is very relevant. Inflation is a constant and consistent increase in the general price level in the country, due to which the purchasing power of a <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> decreases. In practice, the measures of inflation are various price indices, such as a consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), or gross domestic product deflator. However, inflation is usually defined as a change in the HCPI over a year. Time series models, linear regression models and a vector autoregression model (VAR) can be used to model and forecast inflation processes. This paper examines Lithuanian consumer price inflation using a modern stationary time series and econometric theory. The vector autoregression model is proposed for inflation modelling. Theoretical aspects of model estimation are reviewed: time series stationarity, model identification, parameter estimation, model usage and forecasts. The stationarity of the HCPI index and exogenous variables are analyzed using the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. A vector autoregression model of Lithuanian inflation processes is investigated and proposed for inflation modelling. The obtained model is used for forecasting purposes and shows a fairly high degree of accuracy of the inflation forecast in the coming 12 -month period...|$|E
40|$|Background: Income is {{recognized}} as most important determinant of health expenditure in many empirical works. Statistical reports from OECD shows that health expenditure and GDP have growing positively in Norway for decades. However, there is gap in empirical researches examining long-run relationship between health care expenditure and income for longer time-series. Objective: To investigate long run relationship between health expenditure per capita and GDP per capita for the period 1970 - 2012 in Norway and estimate and compare income elasticity of health spending among some OECD countries. Method: A quantitative research method is adopted. This study investigates the relationship between per capita health care expenditure and GDP per capita in Norway over the period 1970 - 2012 by employing dynamic version of Engle and Granger error correction mechanism (ECM). It examines unit root properties of the series, by using Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, and cointegration between health spending and income. Income elasticity of healthcare expenditure for Norway and some other OECD countries is estimated. Both estimations of ECM and elasticity are conducted by OLS regression method. Data for total current health expenditure per capita (HCE) and GDP per capita (PGDP) at 2005 constant price in <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> <b>unit</b> are obtained from OECD online sources. Both HCE and PGDP are natural logarithmic transformed as lnHCE and lnPGDP respectively. Result: A time series unit root test showed that both lnHCE and lnPGDP are integrated of the same order, I(1). Estimation of Error correction model (ECM) confirmed presence of stable long- run equilibrium between health expenditure and income in Norway. Coefficient of error correction (ECT) is negative 0. 75 showing fast adjustment to steady sate equilibrium. Short- run parts of the ECM revealed both current and lagged GDP per capita positively determines health expenditure in short run, though they are not statistically significant. Last year s health expenditure has significant effect on current health expenditure. Income elasticities of health spending are more than unity Norway, US, UK, Australia, Finland, the Netherlands and Canada. It was equal to 1. 2 for Spain. Conclusion: Series of healthcare expenditure and income have unit root in level and are stationary in difference. There exists steady sate long-run equilibrium between health spending and GDP. Health care is necessary good for Norway. Income elasticity of health spending is not stable over time...|$|E

The theoretical model decomposes movements in the exchange rate into anticipated and unanticipated components. Unanticipated currency fluctuations determine aggregate demand through exports, imports, {{and the demand for}} domestic currency, and determine aggregate supply through the cost of imported intermediate goods. The evidence indicates that the supply channel leads to output contraction and price inflation in the face of unanticipated currency depreciation. In contrast, the reduction in net exports determines output contraction without reducing price inflation in the face of unanticipated currency appreciation.

40|$|European {{monetary}} {{integration policy}} nowadays {{centers on the}} search for a common money by opposition to a single monetary unit; but many problems remain as to the means of achieving this end. After reviewing the perennial discussions concerned with the foundations of this monetary integration (e. g. the problems of the optimum of a monetary area, where Mr. Bourguinat challenges the criteria based on differential factor mobility or on the relative degree of "openness"), the study analyses the narrowing of margins in the light of recent experience. Considering the events of 1972 and 1973 the narrowing of margins is a very difficult task; it means nothing less than creating for the E. E. C. members an island of stability in a world environment becoming evermore flexible. The freedom which has been lost on exchange rate fluctuations seems to have resulted in an increased instability of par values (e. g. the successive revaluations of the deutschmark, the florin, etc.). For the achievement of a truly common money the author suggests an alternative approach: it consists in issuing, side by side with <b>national</b> <b>currencies,</b> a <b>unit</b> called an Europa; serving initially as a unit of account, the Europa would gradually become a true means of payment...|$|R

40|$|If {{emerging}} markets are {{to achieve their}} objective of joining the ranks of industrialized, developed countries, they must use their economic and political influence to support radical change in the international financial system. This working paper recommends John Maynard Keynes's "clearing union" as a blueprint for reform of the international financial architecture that could address emerging market grievances more effectively than current approaches. Keynes's proposal for the postwar international system sought to remedy {{some of the same}} problems currently facing emerging market economies. It was {{based on the idea that}} financial stability was predicated on a balance between imports and exports over time, with any divergence from balance providing automatic financing of the debit countries by the creditor countries via a global clearinghouse or settlement system for trade and payments on current account. This eliminated <b>national</b> <b>currency</b> payments for imports and exports; countries received credits or debits in a notional unit of account fixed to <b>national</b> <b>currency.</b> Since the <b>unit</b> of account could not be traded, bought, or sold, it would not be an international reserve currency. The credits with the clearinghouse could only be used to offset debits by buying imports, and if not used for this purpose they would eventually be extinguished; hence the burden of adjustment would be shared equally - credit generated by surpluses would have to be used to buy imports from the countries with debit balances. Emerging market economies could improve upon current schemes for regionally governed financial institutions by using this proposal as a template for the creation of regional clearing unions using a notional unit of account...|$|R

So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY (Japanese yen) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such negligible value that it is no longer used.
