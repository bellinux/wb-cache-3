5000|$|In 2010, a {{group of}} {{students}} began to campaign for a <b>new</b> <b>student</b> center to be built on campus, replacing the Norris University Center. The <b>New</b> <b>Student</b> Center Initiative is a student-led movement {{for the creation of a}} <b>new</b> <b>student</b> center. The initiative includes an ad hoc committee in which all Northwestern students are invited to apply, join, and contribute to the lobbying of the <b>New</b> <b>Student</b> Center. [...] According to their proposal, the <b>New</b> <b>Student</b> Center Initiative is driven by a belief that a <b>new,</b> state-of-the art <b>student</b> center located closer to the center of campus will help create a greater sense of community throughout the University. A new building designed with this purpose in mind, they argue, would include more venue space, meeting space, centralized student services, food options and general entertainment. In addition, moving the student center to the Garret parking lot would be more of a focal point for students to congregate on campus. Those who argue the necessity of building a <b>new</b> <b>student</b> center cite the positive effect of peer institutions' larger or more comprehensive student centers.|$|R

Recommendations for <b>new</b> <b>student</b> orientation practitioners, directors, and administrators are discussed...|$|R

5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} <b>new</b> <b>students</b> was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E

Usually the seal is roped off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.|$|E

It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation.

After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
