25|$|Pluto's mass {{could not}} be {{determined}} until 1978, when its satellite Charon was discovered. This confirmed what had been increasingly suspected: Pluto's gravitational influence on Uranus and Neptune is negligible, certainly not <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> {{to account for the}} discrepancies in their orbits. In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union.|$|E
25|$|Poulidor's {{best chance}} of {{defeating}} Anquetil came in the 1964 Tour de France, in the finish on the Puy de Dôme. Anquetil rode beside Poulidor but both were so exhausted that {{only in the last}} few hundred metres could Poulidor take <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> time to threaten Anquetil's yellow jersey. The Tour organiser, Jacques Goddet, was behind the pair as they turned off the main road and climbed through what police estimated as half a million spectators.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{problems}} were obvious: the congregations soon grew in number, but were far apart; {{there were not}} <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> ministers; the church was treated in a hostile manner by the United Free Church; work was conducted under considerable hardship; and there was little success in appealing to the general popular sentiment of Scotland. However, the revenue of the church gradually increased; in 1901, the sustentation fund was able to support only 75 ministers, but by 1903 it maintained 167.|$|E
25|$|With nowhere <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> {{money on}} hand to begin {{construction}} by the legislatively mandated deadline, the memorial foundation petitioned Congress for an extension, arguing that fundraising would be complete by 2010.

The legislation died {{at the end of the}} 109th Congress on December 8, 2006. Representative Phil Hare (D-Illinois) introduced similar legislation (H.R. 995) in 2007, which passed the House on March 5, 2007.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, {{the trade}} {{appeared}} to make some sense from the Sixers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> in return. The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.|$|E

25|$|Hampshire Hawks got {{the four}} points from a closely fought match at New Road. Worcestershire Royals {{had won the}} toss and chosen to bat, and their innings was {{shortened}} to 34 overs out of a scheduled 45 due to rain. Wickets fell regularly, four batsmen being dismissed with scores in the thirties, and the final score of 185 for 7 did not look too threatening. John Crawley and Shane Watson put Hampshire back on track after two early wickets from Kabir Ali shook them, but an economical spell from Ray Price which yielded two wickets was <b>nearly</b> <b>enough.</b> However, the other spinner Gareth Batty {{was not nearly as}} economical, and Greg Lamb took him for runs to end with 16 not out and win the game for Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|There {{were not}} <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> troops to defend Byzantium's borders {{at the time}} and there {{certainly}} was not enough for the two factions to split; consequently, foreigner mercenaries were brought in. Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs — his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the Bey of Aydin, a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship. This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} {{potential}} for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online “e-tailer” or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site’s servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these “e-tailers” are not doing <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer’s data. However, with this being said, most “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information’s abuse can be tracked back to the site’s servers.|$|E

25|$|In sharp contrast, Congress and the American {{states had}} {{no end of}} {{difficulty}} financing the war. In 1775, there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> to cover current transactions, let alone finance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports.

Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise {{that it would be}} made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war.

25|$|Tulsa's {{downtown}} was {{the site}} of projects anchored by BOK Center, including a $42 million renovation of the Tulsa Convention Center, a $20 million renovation of downtown streets, a $4 million renovation and expansion of a nearby parking garage, streetscape improvements, and art deco-style signs directing visitors to parking garages, public buildings, specialty districts, and entertainment venues. The arena is expected to host 148 major and minor events in its first year, which are anticipated to generate $1.5 million in tax revenue and $92 million in economic impact. SMG is expected to earn $6,553,250 in revenue, giving it a $285,498 annual profit.

The arena reached $20 million in sales in 2008 and is projected to surpass at least $30 million in 2009, which would put it within the top 15 worldwide in sales according to the 2008 rankings.|$|E

25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number not <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We knew that there were strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E
25|$|From childhood, James Dunn was a {{voracious}} {{reader with}} an excellent memory.

After this, {{he made his way to}} the east coast where he was employed by a manufacturing company in Lynn, Massachusetts. However, before long he returned home where a job as a clerk at the law firm of George Gilbert, where he worked alongside Richard Bedford Bennett, led him to the decision to apply to Dalhousie University Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The small amount of money he had been able to save was not <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> to cover his education costs and Dunn worked at a variety of part-time jobs to pay his way through university, including a position in the university library. He graduated in 1898, then worked as a lawyer in Halifax before setting up a law practice in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a short time, Dunn was drawn to the booming economy of Montreal, Quebec where he landed a position with one of the city's prominent law firms.|$|E
