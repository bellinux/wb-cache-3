40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> forming problems with {{finite element method}} can lose considerable accuracy due to severely distortional meshes. By measuring the mesh equality of elements, a coupling algorithm for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> problems have been proposed based on the interface element method, which converts the FE analysis into the EFG computation to preserve the accuracy in the region where meshes have been severely distorted. Numerical example shows that the present algorithms exploit the respective advantages of both the FE method whose computational efficiency is high and the EFG method which can throws out mesh distortions and be suitable for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> forming analysis...|$|R

During the investigation the method for the problem solution of the <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> constructions, on the base of which the use of extremal principles of the limiting resistance theory and the formulation of the dynamics problem as the corresponding problem of linear programming are laying, has been used. As a result exact (in the frameworks of the assumptions accepted) solutions of the dynamic deformation problems for <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> rectangular plates with various conditions of resting, statically optimum round plates, three-layer gently sloping shells of revolution have been obtained and analyzed for the first time. The formulation realized for problems of the dynamic deformation of <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> plates and gently sloping shells of revolution as problems of linear programming has an advantage over other possible (numerical) methods for the problem solution both from theoretical and practical points of view and may be used in the calculation practice.

40|$|In this paper, we {{concentrate}} on <b>non</b> <b>rigid</b> motion analysis and synthesis in 3 D images using modal dynamics. Using the {{solid state physics}} formulation, we develop the analytic expression of eigenmodes of the multidimensional elastically-deformable model exposed in our previous publications. These analytic expressions are calculated for various topologies (plane, cylinder, torus). Thanks to these expressions, <b>non</b> <b>rigid</b> motion of a 3 D deformable object can be approximated in modal space in real time, by superimposing a few number of low-frequency modes that can be computed in a straightforward manner, whatever {{the size of the}} structure. The power of the approach for analyzing 3 D <b>non</b> <b>rigid</b> motion is demonstrated by a set of experimental results on a 3 D time sequence of the human heart. Then the heart is animated between the diastole and the systole. Real-time animation capturing a high level of details is shown on a 3 D magnetic resonance head data. Finally, the contribution of this paper is making modal analysis an efficient and easy-to-use tool for <b>non</b> <b>rigid</b> motion analysis and animation...|$|R

40|$|Copenhagen Municipality {{has with}} its plan ‘KBH 2025 Klimaplanen’ an overall target of {{becoming}} CO 2 neutral {{in the year}} of 2025. One of the means to reach this goal is to recycle all the <b>rigid</b> <b>plastic</b> in the combustible municipal household waste. This report views this change as a transition from the current incumbent regime to an alternative and more sustainable niche regime. We find that one of the required initiatives that make this plan possible is to establish a plastic sorting facility related to the waste stream in Copenhagen. The amount of <b>rigid</b> <b>plastics</b> generated within the municipality of Copenhagen is not enough to make the investment in a full-scale plastic sorting facility feasible. For the establishment of the facility to succeed, the municipality needs to cooperate with the neighbouring municipalities and combining their amount of <b>rigid</b> <b>plastics</b> waste and instead focus on a much smaller pre-sorting facility. We find that this can be done through their already established I/S Partnerships within the combined-heat-and-power plant Amagerforbrænding. Although this requires continuous work from the municipality we believe that the establishment of a pre-sorting facility is an important step in reaching the goal in ‘KBH 2025 Klimaplanen’...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tagged Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is {{currently}} the reference MR modality for myocardial motion and strain analysis. NMIbased <b>non</b> <b>rigid</b> registration {{has proven to be}} an accurate method to retrieve cardiac deformation fields. The use of αMI permits higher dimensional features to be implemented in myocardial deformation estimation through image registration. This paper demonstrates that this is feasible with a set of Haar wavelet features of high dimension. While we do not demonstrate performance improvement for this set of features, there is no significant degradation as compared to implementing the registration method with the traditional NMI metric. We use Entropic Spanning Graphs (ESGs) to estimate the αMI of the wavelet feature vectors WFVs since this is not possible with histograms. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that ESGs are used for <b>non</b> <b>rigid</b> registration. ...|$|R
