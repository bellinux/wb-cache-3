40|$|Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) are {{increasingly}} integral to flight deck information management. A piloted simulation {{study was conducted}} at NASA Langley Research Center, one aspect of which was to evaluate the usability and acceptability of EFBs for viewing and managing <b>Notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> (<b>NOTAMs)</b> and data linked aeronautical information services (AIS) and meteorological information (MET). The study simulated approaches and landings at Memphis International Airport (KMEM) using various flight scenarios and weather conditions. Ten two-pilot commercial airline crews participated, utilizing the Cockpit Motion Facility's Research Flight Deck (CMF/RFD) simulator. Each crew completed approximately two dozen flights over a two day period. Two EFBs were installed, one for each pilot. Study data were collected {{in the form of}} questionnaire/interview responses, audio/video recordings, oculometer recordings, and aircraft/system state data. Preliminary usability results are reported primarily based on pilot interviews and responses to questions focused on ease of learning, ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and acceptability. Analysis of the data from the other objective measures (e. g., oculometer) is ongoing and will be reported in a future publication. This paper covers how the EFB functionality was set up for the study; the NOTAM, AIS/MET data link, and weather messages that were presented; questionnaire results; selected pilot observations; and conclusions...|$|R
50|$|Nav Canada's FIC and Flight Service Stations (FSS) use {{a network}} of Remote Communications Outlets (RCOs) {{strategically}} located to provide maximum coverage and assistance to aircraft flying {{in all areas of}} Canada. Flight service specialists staff these stations providing essential aviation-related information to support mainly general aviation, commercial and private. Pilots can contact FICs to obtain any pre-flight information required 24 hours a day. The specialist will provide callers with an interpretation of the latest weather reports, forecasts, satellite images and weather radar, copies of the latest <b>Notice</b> <b>To</b> <b>Airmen</b> (<b>NOTAMs),</b> and file, modify, open, or close a flight plan. Only a few FICs provide for face to face briefings but all can be contacted on a toll free number, or via radio using an RCO (located at numerous aerodromes). Historically, the common en route frequency of 126.7 has been used to contact the FIC, but as general radio traffic has increased, the congestion on that frequency has resulted in a plan by Nav Canada to change over a significant number of RCOs to one of four dedicated FIC frequencies - 123.275, 123.375, 123.475, or 123.55 MHz. When this occurs in a particular area, 126.7 will no longer be monitored by the FIC, however, they will retain broadcast capabilities on 126.7 to transmit urgent messages such as SIGMETs or to aid in a search for an overdue aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The FAA issues Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) in {{the form}} of a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> (<b>NOTAM)</b> which are {{effective}} for the duration of an event, typically a few days or weeks. TFRs are issued for VIP movement such as the President's travels outside Washington, D.C., surface-based hazards to flight such as toxic gas spills or volcanic eruptions, air-shows, military security, and special events including political ones like national party conventions. TFRs have also been issued to ensure a safe environment for firefighting operations in the case of wildfires and for other reasons as necessary. A TFR was quickly issued around the crash site of Cory Lidle's airplane in New York City. Later, a broader TFR was issued to require pilots traveling over the East River to obtain air traffic control clearance.|$|E
50|$|By {{virtue of}} an {{agreement}} signed in 1952, the whole airspace over the Aegean, up to the boundary of the national airspace of Turkey, has been assigned to Athens FIR, administered by Greece. Shortly after the Cyprus crisis of 1974, Turkey unilaterally attempted to change this arrangement, issuing a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> (<b>NOTAM)</b> stating {{that it would take}} over the administration of the eastern half of the Aegean airspace, including the national airspace of the Greek islands in that area. Greece responded with a declaration rejecting this move, and declaring the disputed zone unsafe for aviation due to the conflicting claims to authority. This led to some disruption in civil aviation in the area. Turkey later changed its stance, and since 1980 has returned to recognizing Athens FIR in its original demarcation. In practice, the FIR demarcation is currently no longer a disputed issue.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> (<b>NOTAM)</b> is {{a notice}} filed with an {{aviation}} authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or {{at a location}} that could affect {{the safety of the}} flight. [...] NOTAMs are unclassified notices or advisories distributed by means of telecommunication that contain information concerning the establishment, conditions or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel and systems concerned with flight operations. NOTAMs are created and transmitted by government agencies and airport operators under guidelines specified by Annex 15: Aeronautical Information Services of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (CICA). The term NOTAM came into common use rather than the more formal Notice to Airmen following the ratification of the CICA, which came into effect on 4 April 1947. Notices to Airmen were normally published in a regular publication by each country's air authorities (e.g., in Flight Magazine in the UK). A number of developments and amendments to the CICA have resulted in the more automated system available today.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{navigation}} is deciding where one wishes to go. A private pilot planning a flight under VFR will usually use an aeronautical chart of the area which is published specifically {{for the use of}} pilots. This map will depict controlled airspace, radio navigation aids and airfields prominently, as well as hazards to flying such as mountains, tall radio masts, etc. It also includes sufficient ground detail - towns, roads, wooded areas - to aid visual navigation. In the UK, the CAA publishes a series of maps covering the whole of the UK at various scales, updated annually. The information is also updated in the <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>airmen,</b> or <b>NOTAMs.</b>|$|R
40|$|At {{airports}} sustaining commercial operations, Runway Incursions, {{defined as}} the incorrect presence or manoeuvre of an aircraft, vehicle or person on a runway, constitute the most severe hazard to flight safety. In fact, the worst-ever accident in civil aviation to date, the collision of two Boeing B 747 s on Tenerife in March 1977 with 583 fatalities, {{was caused by a}} Runway Incursion. As early as 1986, a special investigation report of the National Transportation Safety Boards (NTSB), which is responsible for investigating aviation incidents and accidents in the USA, concluded that Human Factors issues and not technical malfunctions were the primary causal factors of Runway Incursions. This is remarkable, because although surface movement {{is one of the most}} challenging cockpit tasks, pilots are currently not supported by sophisticated assistance systems in this critical phase of flight, but still mainly rely on visual acquisition of their environment and Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions conveyed via radio. The only mandatory additional equipment consists of paper charts, compass and <b>Notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> (<b>NOTAM).</b> Consequently, the goal of this thesis is to investigate to what extent Runway Incursions can be attributed to an inadequate presentation or lack of required information on the flight deck, and how flight deck instrumentation will possibly have to be supplemented in order to increase safety in the airport environment. Following a scrutiny of current procedures for surface movement with respect to potential deficiencies, an in-depth analysis of 40 incidents and accidents is conducted to identify and categorize generic, recurring causal factors of Runway Incursions. Apart from several exceptions that can be attributed to incorrect ATC instructions or clearances, results clearly indicate that the investigated Runway Incursions were primarily caused by a lack of pilot situation awareness. The underlying reasons are a lack of suitable navigation aids, missing means of acquiring the surrounding traffic including potential conflicts, insufficient presentation of information on the airport operational environment (such as closed or restricted runways) or misunderstandings in the communication with ATC. In order to address these deficiencies, a holistic flight deck visualisation and warning concept based on Airport Moving Map (AMM) technology, an already commercially available database-driven electronic airport chart presentation, is developed in the frame of this thesis, integrating all of the information required for Runway Incursion avoidance in an intuitive fashion. In case the mere presentation of information is not sufficient to prevent a hazardous situation, e. g. due to the dynamics of an emerging traffic conflict, pilots are alerted in a manner consistent with current flight deck alerting systems. A prototypic realisation of the resulting onboard surveillance system is validated with airline pilots in field trials at Frankfurt and Prague airport, using a Navigation Test Vehicle, followed by a further evaluation campaign employing a Research Flight Simulator...|$|R
