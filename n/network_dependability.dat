40|$|Due to a {{relentless}} {{increase in the}} amount of missioncritical real-time traffic over a revenue-generating <b>network,</b> <b>dependability</b> has come forth as a vital measure for such a network. To prevent extended downtimes and loss of critical data, most commercial routers achieve faulttolerance by adding substantial redundancies for critical components. However, they often fail to utilize existing resources efficiently, unduly limiting their achievable dependability. To significantly improve the dependability of existing routers, we propose an efficient dependable architecture for high-performance routers, called dependable router architecture (DRA).

Virtualized Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) {{is one of the}} NFV use cases that has got most attention, where dependability is a major concern. In the traditional EPC, functions are deployed in proprietary network elements with proven characteristics, e. g., a defined availability, and corresponding guarantees. Hence, network operators have a firm basis for the design of a robust mobile core network. On the other hand, in the vEPC, network operators face a more challenging environment, where functions, subsystems and requirements are interrelated in a more complex manner. Hence, the assessment of the network robustness, and the design to meet dependability requirements become hard. In order to address this challenge, we provide initial guidelines to model system availability in vEPC scenarios, we propose a stochastic activity <b>networks</b> <b>dependability</b> model to assess it, and finally, we identify the most relevant factors to be considered by providers to fulfill the demanding dependability requirements of the mobile core...|$|R

40|$|The data {{exchanged}} {{within the}} {{wireless sensor network}} often contains the information important to save the human lives, e. g. vital parameters of the firefighters during an action. The crucial issue here is that these data cannot be tampered or lost, thus the communication needs to be secured and resilient. Securing the data transmission within the sensor network has to take {{the constraints of the}} wireless sensor networks into consideration. The data resilience can be achieved by applying data redundancy supporting data storage or a distributed shared memory in the sensor network, also taking the network constraints into consideration. A distributed shared memory middleware provides means for data replication and sharing between the nodes in the sensor network. The data redundancy helps to reach the goal of a highly dependable network. Our proposal allows protecting the data within the distributed shared memory by using lightweight cryptography. Applying the lightweight cryptography reduces the time of the computations performed on the sensor nodes, what speeds up the delivery of the critical data to the control centers for example. Since the security related issues are an essential prerequisite for <b>network</b> <b>dependability,</b> providing a configurable and secured distributed shared memory is a very interesting topic...|$|E

In order to make an accurate and cognizant decision, there is a great need for a dependable wireless sensor <b>network.</b> Failure <b>dependability</b> relates to providing dependability against node and/or link failures. In multi-layered wireless sensor networks with data fusion, we observe that as the data propagates from the sensor node to the sink, the data packet represents an increasing number of sensor nodes (sub-tree) in the network. Hence, it is critical that this data packet reaches the sink, since the loss of a single packet eliminates the information sensed by a whole (possibly large) sub-tree of sensor nodes. We evaluate two dual-homed routing techniques for providing faulttolerance, namely 1 + 1 dual-homing and 1 : 1 dual homing. Based on extensive simulation results, we observe that 1 : 1 dual-homed routing minimizes packet loss, increases network throughput, and increases network lifetime compared to the 1 + 1 dual-homed routing and the traditional single-homed routing techniques.
