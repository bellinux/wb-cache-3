Messiaen's music in particular redefined many of the traditional <b>notions</b> of organ registration and technique.|$|E

Davidson’s {{influential}} {{criticism of}} the very <b>notion</b> of conceptual schemes, the <b>notion</b> continues enjoying its popularity in contemporary philosophy and, accordingly, conceptual relativism {{is still very much}} alive. There is one major reason responsible for Davidson’s failure which has not been widely recognized: What Davidson attacks fiercely is not the very <b>notion,</b> but a <b>notion</b> of conceptual schemes, namely, the Quinean <b>notion</b> of conceptual schemes and its underlying Kantian scheme-content dualism. However, such a <b>notion</b> simply cannot carry the weight of conceptual relativism for it does not catch the essences of conceptual relativism. Consequently, I argue that the very <b>notion</b> of conceptual schemes and conceptual relativism have survived Davidson’s attack. Therefore, the failure of the Quinean <b>notion</b> of conceptual schemes and Kantian scheme-content dualism, even if Davidson can claim victory, does not mark the end of the very <b>notion</b> of conceptual schemes...|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing <b>notions.</b> Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new <b>notions</b> as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E
