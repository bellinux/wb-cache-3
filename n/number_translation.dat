The discreteness properties of <b>translation</b> <b>numbers</b> have been studied for geometric groups such as biautomatic groups and hyperbolic groups. The Garside group is a lattice-theoretic generalization of braid groups and Artin groups of finite type. In this extended abstract, we show that the discreteness properties of <b>translation</b> <b>numbers</b> in Garside groups are as good as in hyperbolic groups: (i) <b>translation</b> <b>numbers</b> of elements in a Garside group are rational with uniformly bounded denominators; (ii) for ever...|$|R

50|$|Subscriber toll {{dialling}} (STD) {{was introduced}} into New Zealand telephone {{network in the}} mid 1970s, {{a result of the}} introduction of NEC crossbar based toll exchanges and their ability to perform <b>number</b> <b>translation.</b> One still needed to dial 0 to make a toll call, but instead of calling the operator, one could then dial the STD number directly. Access to the operator was via 010, while other service numbers remained unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defines several [...] "capability levels" [...] {{for this}} protocol, {{starting}} with Capability Set 1 (CS-1). A typical application for the IN is a <b>Number</b> <b>Translation</b> service. For example, in the United Kingdom, 0800 numbers are freephone numbers and are translated to a geographic number using an IN platform. The Telephone exchanges decode the 0800 numbers to an IN trigger and the exchange {{connects to the}} IN.|$|E

50|$|At the time, {{not having}} a {{standing}} charge for such a comprehensive service, especially the webspace, was a radical step. Further revenue was obtained from advertisements on Freeserve's homepage, which was set as the default page in the customers' web browsers upon installing the Freeserve connection software. BT sought to challenge Freeserve's business plan by arguing that under the regulatory model (known as <b>Number</b> <b>Translation</b> Services, or NTS), it should receive more money for each call, and in January 1999 Oftel {{announced that it would}} carry out a review.|$|E
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>translation</b> service {{translates}} a dialled telephone number, typically beginning 08 in the UK to {{a geographical}} 'connect number' beginning 01 or 02 in the UK. The connect number may be changed without changing the published dialled number. Originally NTS numbers were used, for example, to allow any caller to dial a local {{call to the}} called party irrespective of location, saving money if the connect number was not also a local call, but the system gradually {{came to be seen}} as a way of making money and now most phone companies charge the caller more for 08 numbers than for 01, 02 or 03 numbers.|$|E
50|$|From 1912, the British General Post Office, {{which also}} {{operated}} the British telephone system, installed several automatic telephone exchanges from several vendors in trials at Darlington on 10 October 1914 (rotary system), Fleetwood (relay exchange from Sweden), Grimsby (Siemens), Hereford (Lorimer) and Leeds (Strowger). The BPO selected the Strowger switches for small and medium cities and towns. However, {{the selection of}} switching systems for London and other large cities was not decided until the 1920s, when the Director telephone system was adopted. The Director systems used SXS switches for destination routing and <b>number</b> <b>translation</b> facilities similar to the register used in common-control exchanges. Using similar equipment as {{in the rest of}} the network was deemed beneficial and the equipment could be manufactured in Britain.|$|E

5000|$|American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) first {{introduced}} 800 Toll-Free service in 1967. When AT&T {{was the only}} Interexchange Carrier (IC), Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) automatically routed all Toll-Free calls directly to AT&T Points of Presence (POP) without performing a translation from the Toll-Free number to the terminating number. The LECs routed the calls to AT&T based on the first 3 digits (800) of the dialed number. AT&T then performed all <b>number</b> <b>translations</b> and service area validation screenings.|$|R
50|$|The major driver {{behind the}} {{development}} of the IN was the need for a more flexible way of adding sophisticated services to the existing network. Before the IN was developed, all new features and/or services had to be implemented directly in the core switch systems. This made for long release cycles as the software testing had to be extensive and thorough to prevent the network from failing. With the advent of the IN, most of these services (such as toll-free numbers and geographical number portability) were moved out of the core switch systems and into self-contained nodes, creating a modular and more secure network that allowed the service providers themselves to develop variations and value-added services to their networks without submitting a request to the core switch manufacturer and waiting for the long development process. The initial use of IN technology was for <b>number</b> <b>translation</b> services, e.g. when translating toll-free numbers to regular PSTN numbers; much more complex services have since been built on the IN, such as Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and prepaid telephone calls.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{advocates say}} network {{neutrality}} {{is needed in}} order to maintain the end-to-end principle. According to Lawrence Lessig and Robert W. McChesney, all content must be treated the same and must move at the same speed in order for net neutrality to be true. They say that it is this simple but brilliant end-to-end aspect that has allowed the Internet to act as a powerful force for economic and social good. Under this principle, a neutral network is a dumb network, merely passing packets regardless of the applications they support. This point of view was expressed by David S. Isenberg in his paper, [...] "The Rise of the Stupid Network". He states that the vision of an intelligent network is being replaced by a new network philosophy and architecture in which the network is designed for always-on use, not intermittence and scarcity. Rather than intelligence being designed into the network itself, the intelligence would be pushed out to the end-user's device; and the network would be designed simply to deliver bits without fancy network routing or smart <b>number</b> <b>translation.</b> The data would be in control, telling the network where it should be sent. End-user devices would then be allowed to behave flexibly, as bits would essentially be free and there would be no assumption that the data is of a single data rate or data type.|$|E

As a result, I-TNT numbering system is successfully implemented and able to allocate the expanded phone numbers to end-users in one service provider...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} simple but {{effective}} two different fuzzy wavelet networks (FWNs) for system identification. The FWNs combine the traditional Takagiâ€“Sugenoâ€“Kang (TSK) fuzzy model and discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). The proposed FWNs {{consist of a}} set of ifâ€“then rules and, then parts are series expansion in terms of wavelets functions. In the first system, while the only one scale parameter is changing with it corresponding rule <b>number,</b> <b>translation</b> parameter sets are fixed in each rule. As for the second system, DWT is used completely by using wavelet frames. The performance of proposed fuzzy models is illustrated by examples and compared with previously published examples. Simulation results indicate the remarkable capabilities of the proposed methods. It is worth noting that the second FWN achieves high function approximation accuracy and fast convergence...|$|E
40|$|Data {{protection}} and data security become more significant since telecommunication services and innovative applications {{based on these}} services handle an increasing amount of sensitive data. Modern services, e. g. call forwarding, tele-conferencing, and voice mail services use or store personal data to implement individual services. Sensitive data include personal identities or calling numbers, location information of the communicating parties, service indicators, <b>number</b> <b>translation</b> tables, reachability information, and time and duration of communication events. Generally usable open security services interfaces are proposed, that promote security services implemented in user terminals or Trusted Third Parties {{in order to satisfy}} currently ignored and evolving security requirements in a more flexible and scalable way. This approach will both save the huge investments in todayâ€™s telecommunication infrastructure and promote open security services that are independent of the underlying network infrastructure. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} the performability manager, a distributed system component {{that contributes to}} a more effective and efficient use of system components and prevents quality of service (QoS) degradation. The performability manager dynamically reconfigures distributed systems whenever needed, to recover from failures and to permit the system to evolve over time and include new functionality. Large systems require dynamic reconfiguration to support dynamic change without shutting down the complete system. A distributed system monitor is needed to verify QoS. Monitoring a distributed system is difficult because of synchronization problems and minor differences in clock speeds. The authors {{describe the}} functionality and {{the operation of the}} performability manager (both informally and formally). Throughout the paper they illustrate the approach by an example distributed application: an ANSAware-based <b>number</b> <b>translation</b> service (NTS), from the intelligent networks (IN) area...|$|E

40|$|Translation is {{a central}} {{biological}} process by which proteins are synthesized from genetic information contained within mRNAs. Here we study the kinetics of translation at molecular level through a stochastic simulation model. The model explicitly include RNA sequences, ribosome dynamics, tRNA pool and biochemical reactions in the translation elongation. The {{results show that the}} translation efficiency is mainly limited by the available ribosome <b>number,</b> <b>translation</b> initiation and the translation elongation time. The elongation time is log-normal distribution with mean and variance determined by both the codon saturation and the process of aa-tRNA selection at each codon binding. Moreover, our simulations show that the translation accuracy exponentially decreases with the sequence length. These results suggest that aa-tRNA competition is crucial for both translation elongation, translation efficiency and the accuracy, which in turn determined the effective protein production rate of correct proteins. Our results improve the dynamical equation of protein production with a delay differential equation which is dependent on sequence informations through both the effective production rate and the distribution of elongation time.

40|$|This article {{starts with}} {{a review of the}} major {{findings}} about the representation of written language in bilinguals, both at the level of word forms (lexical level) and at the level of word meanings (semantic level). Then, the most important model of bilingual word translation is described, followed by some recent findings on <b>number</b> <b>translation</b> that are problematic for the model. Finally, a new masked priming experiment is presented, in which Dutch-French bilinguals had to name Arabic digits (e. g. 5), number words of their first language (e. g. vijf), and number words of their second language (cinq) both in their first and second language. The targets were preceded by a masked Arabic prime numeral, which had a value ranging from Target minus three (e. g., prime 2 â€“ target 5 /vijf/cinq) to Target plus three (prime 8 â€“ target 5 /vijf/cinq). Previous research with monolinguals had shown that the priming effect of Arabic numerals depends on the difference in magnitude between prime and target (e. g. the target 5 is primed most by 5 and least by 2 and 8). This effect was repeated in the present study and extended to the translation conditions. Regression analyses revealed strong priming effects in both forward (from first to second language) and backward translation. Based on these findings, we argue that future models of bilingual memory should see all translations {{as the result of the}} summed activation from a semantically mediated route and a direct, lexical route...|$|E
40|$|Systems of free fermions are {{classified}} by symmetry, space dimensionality, and topological properties described by K-homology. Those systems belonging to different classes are inequivalent. In contrast, {{we show that}} by taking a many-body/Fock space viewpoint it becomes possible to establish equivalences of topological insulators and superconductors in terms of duality transformations. These mappings connect topologically inequivalent systems of fermions, jumping across entries in existent classification tables, because of the phenomenon of symmetry transmutation by which a symmetry and its dual partner have identical algebraic properties but very different physical interpretations. To constrain our study to established classification tables, we define and characterize mathematically Gaussian dualities as dualities mapping free fermions to free fermions (and interacting to interacting). By introducing a large, flexible class of Gaussian dualities we show that any insulator is dual to a superconductor, and that fermionic edge modes are dual to Majorana edge modes, that is, the Gaussian dualities of this paper preserve the bulk-boundary correspondence. Transmutation of relevant symmetries, particle <b>number,</b> <b>translation,</b> and time reversal is also investigated in detail. As illustrative examples, we show the duality equivalence of the dimerized Peierls chain and the Majorana chain of Kitaev, and a two-dimensional KekulÃ©-type topological insulator, including graphene as a special instance in coupling space, dual to a p-wave superconductor. Since our analysis extends to interacting fermion systems we also briefly discuss some such applications. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
