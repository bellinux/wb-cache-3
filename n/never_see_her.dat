5|$|After British {{victory in}} World War II, Kenyatta {{received}} a call to return to Kenya in September 1946, sailing back that month. Edna was pregnant with a second child, although she expected to <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> husband again; Kenyatta was aware that if they joined him in Kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws. On his arrival in Mombasa, Kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children. He built a bungalow at Gatundu, near {{to where he was}} born, and began farming his 32-acre estate. Kenyata met with the new Governor of Kenya, Philip Euen Mitchell, and in March 1947 accepted a post on an African Land Settlement Board, holding the post for two years. He also met with Mbiyu Koinange to discuss the future of the Koinange Independent Teachers' College in Githungui, with Koinange appointing Kenyatta as its Vice-Principal. In May 1947, Koinange moved to England, leaving Kenyatta to take full control of the college. Under Kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. It was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages. Gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell. Kenyatta built a friendship with Koinange's father, a Senior Chief, who gave Kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.|$|E
25|$|He {{first met}} his wife Vivien, an air {{stewardess}} with BOAC, in Bermuda whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 {{he told her that}} if she didn't agree to marry him, he would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.|$|E
25|$|Sills was a recitalist, {{especially}} in the final decade of her career. She sang in mid-size cities and on college concert series, bringing her art to many who might <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> on stage in a fully staged opera. She also sang concerts {{with a number of}} symphony orchestras. Sills continued to perform for New York City Opera, her home opera house, essaying new roles right up to her retirement, including the leading roles in Rossini's Il Turco in Italia, Franz Lehár's The Merry Widow and Gian Carlo Menotti's La Loca, an opera commissioned in honor of her 50th birthday. La Loca was the first work written expressly as a vehicle for Sills and was her last new role, as she retired the following year. Her farewell performance was at San Diego Opera in 1980, where she shared the stage with Joan Sutherland in a production of Die Fledermaus.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E

500|$|Mary soon {{returns to}} inform Precious of her father's death from AIDS. Precious later learns {{that she is}} HIV-positive, though Abdul is not. Feeling dejected, she steals her case file from Ms. Weiss's office. As she shares {{the details of her}} file with her fellow students, she begins to hope for the future. Later, Precious meets with her mother at the social worker's office. Ms. Weiss confronts Mary about her abuse of Precious, {{pointing}} to specific incidents going back to when Precious was 3 years old. Mary fails to see the error of her ways and instead of taking responsibility for her mistakes and bad parenting, she blames everything on her daughter. Mary tearfully says that it was Precious' fault that her father raped her because she [...] "let him", and admits that she resents Precious for [...] "stealing her man". Precious tells Mary that she finally sees her for what she is, and tells her mother that she will <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> or the children again. Mary begs Ms. Weiss to retrieve her daughter, but a shaken Ms. Weiss silently rejects Mary and walks away in disgust.|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Cady of E! News {{found the}} video [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "pretty {{stripped}} down", further writing: [...] "There are no catchy choreographed dances or freakum dresses, just Queen Bey looking gorgeous in lingerie and belting out her love and devotion to her man." [...] Cady {{added that the}} video was entertaining because of Beyoncé [...] "seriously magical hair" [...] and her skin, which was sparkling like Edward Cullen. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly concluded that although the video {{was different from the}} previous [...] "heavily produced spectacles" [...] Beyoncé has made, [...] "it's hard to take your eyes off it". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic criticized the sex appeal which was used in the videos for Lady Gaga's [...] "You and I" [...] (2011) and Katy Perry's [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2011) but felt that [...] "Beyonce's game is unique in its reliance on pure visual magnetism". He wrote that even when Beyoncé is [...] "inhabiting apocalyptic warzones or Mad Men-era domestic scenes", she is always classical. Kornhaber concluded that the video for [...] "1+1" [...] is [...] "catchy, fun dance, pretty face, pretty body", which according to him, is what [...] "Beyonce [...] always been about". Melinda Newman from the website HitFix found [...] "some lovely kaleidoscopic shots and billowing sheets". She added that [...] "we <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> '+1' other than an arm and back shot, but that works to the video's advantage".|$|E

500|$|Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge {{surprisingly}} agreeable, {{and slowly}} became reconciled to her situation. [...] At {{the end of}} July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her {{that her mother was}} about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent. [...] This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might say could change her mother's mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother's casualness in the leavetaking, [...] "for God knows how long, or what events may occur before we meet again". [...] Charlotte would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> mother again. [...] In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside. [...] She had asked to go to fashionable Brighton, but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to Weymouth. [...] As the Princess's coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, [...] "her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen". [...] On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece [...] "Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe's Hope and Britain's Glory". [...] Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths. [...] She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would [...] "take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence ... that man is the P of S-C" [...] In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she [...] "had a very sudden and great shock" [...] when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment. [...] In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "At {{the opening of the}} play, Granny Nichols' only daughter is leaving the farm to go to the city in search of employment. We next find her in the city, married to a wealthy man who has forbidden her to make their marriage public as he is afraid his family will object. One day, after a year of happy married life, the husband leaves his wife and baby daughter to go downtown on business. Through a case of mistaken identity, he is arrested, and before he can prove his innocence, to the satisfaction of the police, his wife - believing him to have deserted her - takes her baby and returns to her mother. The husband, upon regaining his freedom and returning home, finds only a note from his wife saying that he will <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> or the baby again. He mourns his loved ones as dead, thinking that his wife left him contemplating the death of herself and her child. The mother and child return to the farm and there, with her dying breath, the mother entrusts baby Lena to the care of Granny Nichols. Here, on the farm, Lena grows to womanhood never knowing her father's name. When Lena is 16 her Uncle John decides to take his mother to live with him in the city. Granny refuses to leave without Lena, so she also moves to Uncle John's home. In the meantime, Lena's father is a frequent visitor to the home of Uncle John, whom he little thinks is any relation to his dead wife. Here he meets Lena, and espying a locket containing the picture of her mother, which she wears around her neck, recognizes her as his daughter. Not only this but lucky Lena is enabled to marry the man she loves." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{provides}} the Beast with [...] "a stronger voice". The song occurs at a pivotal {{moment in the}} film during which the Beast bemoans his decision to free Belle, while uncovering both his inner pain and growth as a character as he voices [...] "a sad sense of longing." [...] For the first time, audiences learn exactly how the Beast feels when he allows Belle to rescue Maurice, summarizing his love for her. In the musical sequence, the Beast continues to climb higher up the turret of his castle to watch Belle as she rides away on her horse and gradually disappears into the distance. Staged {{in a way that}} resembles a live musical due to Stevens' performance and its cinematography, the orchestra increases and swells as the anguished Beast continues to climb. Menken explained that the character, singing [...] "with a raw emotion", watches Belle leave while thinking to himself [...] "I know what love is now, and it's wonderful, even though I'll <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> again", and [...] "Evermore" [...] captures the Beast's agony as he watches the woman he loves leave him. Citing the song {{as an example of the}} film's characters resorting to singing whenever they find that they are not able to speak, Condon described [...] "Evermore" [...] as one of the film's [...] "dramatic high points", proving that the Beast has finally become [...] "worthy of love". For the Beast, the song represents [...] "an ode to his love for Belle and his unending, longing devotion as she rides away from him, possibly forever", serving as [...] "a profound meditation on his own isolation and heartache". According to Menken, the character is [...] "basically singing about how he now knows what love is". The Beast is now shown to be capable of feeling and expressing human emotions, namely heartbreak, loneliness and helplessness, having learned about true love and sacrifice. According to Zoe Nicholson of The Daily Gamecock, [...] "Evermore" [...] "adds humanity not yet seen in a character regarded as savage or spoiled rotten." [...] Walt Disney Studios president of music and soundtracks Mitchell Leib described the scene as the film's [...] "Phantom of the Opera moment." [...] Traditionally in Disney films, heroines are typically assigned [...] "rousing" [...] musical numbers to perform. Screen Rant contributor Kacey Spivey observed that Belle's departure and the scene represents a reversal of the traditional fairy tale trope in which a princess is trapped in a tower. Instead the Beast is confined to his tower, longing for the heroine to return and free him from his enchantment. Brett Nachman compared the scene to Quasimodo performing [...] "Out There" [...] in Disney's animated musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).|$|E
