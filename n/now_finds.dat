5|$|Veerangan <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> himself {{saddled with}} the role of king for more days than he had {{initially}} bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that he}} is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E

25|$|Dale Malloy (Todd Stashwick) – Dale is {{cousin to}} Dahlia. He and Wayne were raised like {{brothers}} in the Malloy clan. Within the code of the family Dale expected {{that one day he}} would marry Dahlia and take his rightful place as head of the family once his father, Earl, died. A borderline sociopath whose life becomes slowly unhinged. Feeling wronged many times over by Wayne he is hell bent on revenge against Wayne and his family. Feeling the pain of his unrequited love and the fact that his father was going to pass the reins of the clan on to Wayne, Dale goes to murderous lengths to protect his legacy. Eventually discovering the Riches' secret, he <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> himself in an unholy alliance with Wayne, leveraging the truth to his selfish needs.|$|E
25|$|A second, longer eastern ridge {{runs out}} {{to the north of}} Bowscale Fell, forming the {{northern}} wall of Bullfell Beck. This has two subsidiary tops at 2,017ft and 1,981ft and ends steeply at Raven Crag above the Mungrisdale to Heskett Newmarket road. Perched in a bowl scooped out on the northern face of this ridge is Bowscale Tarn. This is a classic corrie tarn, held in by a whalebacked moraine and having a depth of around 60ft. Bowscale Tarn was a popular tourist attraction in Victorian times, visitors being brought by pony to observe its wild and moody setting. Tastes change and the tarn <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> itself on few itineraries for a grand tour of the District. Legend had it that the tarn was home to two immortal fish, one version of the tale also crediting them with the gift of speech. Above the water is Tarn Crag, the steepest face on the fell.|$|E

Complete with fashion shops and shopping centres promoting most international brands, it <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> itself {{in the top five}} most expensive shopping streets in Europe, and the tenth most expensive retail street in the world.

[...] Assad did not provide a timetable for a complete withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon – 14,000 soldiers and intelligence agents.

[...] Furthermore, the manifesto stated that the organization rejects all hate and illegality, believes firmly in law and order, backs police forces and will work actively in the courts to strike down all discrimination. When asked about Jewish Defense League members breaking the law, Kahane responded: [...] "We respect the right and the obligation of the American government to prosecute us and send us to jail. No one gripes about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dante <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> {{himself in}} the Eighth Circle, called Malebolge ("Evil Ditches"): {{the upper half of}} the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, {{concentric}} ditches or trenches called bolge (singular: bolgia). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like umbrella ribs or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is, [...] "the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence – all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified".|$|E

2500|$|Audrey Kurth Cronin of George Mason University {{argues that}} while drones are tactically savvy, {{they have failed}} to advance the {{strategic}} goals of U.S. counter-terrorism policy. Terrorism itself is a tactic, Cronin notes, but it succeeds on a strategic plane when a shocking event is successfully leveraged for political gain. [...] "To be effective, counter-terrorism must itself respond with a coherent strategy. The problem for Washington today is that its drone program {{has taken on a}} life of its own, to the point where tactics are driving strategy rather than the other way around." [...] Cronin agrees with Daniel Byman of Georgetown University insofar that drones have inflicted real damage upon al Qaeda. However, [...] "Washington <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> itself in a permanent battle with amorphous and geographically dispersed foe, one with an increasingly marginal connection to the original 9/11 plotters. In this endless contest, the United States risks multiplying its enemies and heightening their incentives to attack the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen: [...] former US Army Special Forces {{soldier and}} a current CIA {{contractor}} {{who has been}} burned (identified as an unreliable or dangerous agent) and <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> himself {{in his hometown of}} Miami, unable to leave. With his assets frozen, he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why. Highly skilled and extremely clever, he can think on his feet, often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape to cake frosting in highly unorthodox ways to complete a job. He has two black belts or, as he puts it in one episode, [...] "thirty years of karate" [...] and is [...] "rated with anything that fires a bullet or holds an edge". He has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities, working in numerous regional dialects and international accents; however, he cannot speak Spanish fluently. He believes that his unhappy childhood, largely at the hands of an abusive father, has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him. He has a younger brother, Nate (Seth Peterson), who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in Season 6. Michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft, and sometimes vulnerable, side. His favorite food is yogurt, which is featured or eaten by {{at least one of the}} characters in each episode. He has a romantic relationship with Fiona. In the series finale he and Fiona are living in Ireland raising Charlie (Nate's son) as their own child.|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{no secret}} that in music, as in life, success and failure are largely {{dependent}} on timing, and so {{with that in mind}} it's hard not to feel just a little bad for Michelle Williams, the Johnny-come-lately third member of Destiny's Child, who has always had a hard time establishing herself inside the group, let alone outside it, and who <b>now</b> <b>finds</b> herself releasing a new record at a time when her efforts will likely be eclipsed by her former group members. And so, after a series of delays, Williams's third solo album, Unexpected, arrives on shelves just as people have begun to buzz about Beyoncé's upcoming album, and when honorary DC sister Solange has made an unexpected critical impact with the oddball surrealism of her recent sophomore effort, Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dreams. Considering Unexpected is a fairly decent album and by far the least pretentious, unashamedly pop record to be made by a DC member so far, it's all a bit unfortunate. Anyone who has heard the first single, [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] already knows that Williams, whose solo work to date has been gospel-oriented, has on this occasion stepped outside of the confines of the church and into the dark of the clubs, embracing au courant euro-pop sounds, and it's a move that works well for her. [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] which boasts a chorus wrapped up in some awesome swirling synth-pop majestics, has done relatively well on the dance charts but deserved to cross over. Meanwhile, ignoring some atrocious lyrical hiccups, [...] "Til' the End of the World" [...] is a moody, frostbitten electro lament, and in the lush balladry of [...] "The Greatest," [...] Williams could find the hit she needs." ...|$|E
