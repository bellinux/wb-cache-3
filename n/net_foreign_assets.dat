40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{external adjustment}} in the United States, Japan and Germany {{from the perspective}} of <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> positions. It asks two questions: What are, in the long run, the determinants of <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> equilibrium? and: What are, in the short run, some of the adjustment mechanisms sustaining that equilibrium? An analysis of post-war data produces two insights. First, using a cointegration approach, the existence of long-run <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> equilibrium can be identified: it is a function of demographic variables and public debt. Second, deviations from long-run equilibrium give rise to feedback through different components of domestic absorption in the three countries.

5000|$|Valuation {{effects have}} been {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} U.S. {{in the last two}} decades, given a dramatic, sharp rise in international cross-country portfolio holdings.

50|$|Again in late 2016, {{after some}} years of {{relative}} improvement but with rising worries over Italy, {{the level of}} TARGET2 intra-eurozone balances at the ECB had surpassed 2012's record levels.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{balance of}} payment identity ignores valuation effects, only recognizes that changes in the <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> (NFA) are fully captured by the current account. The new {{balance of payment}} identity, however, considers the role of asset price changes and valuation effects. Changes in the NFA equal the current account plus valuation effects.|$|E
50|$|Traditional balance-of-payments {{accounting}} is {{that the}} change in the <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position equals the current account balance. In other words, if a country runs a $700 billion current account deficit, it has to borrow exactly $700 billion from abroad to finance the deficit and therefore, the country's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position falls by $700 billion.|$|R

5000|$|Global {{imbalances}} {{refers to}} the situation where some countries have more assets than the other countries. In theory, when the current account is in balance, it has a zero value: inflows and outflows of capital will be cancelled by each other. Hence, if the current account is persistently showing deficits for certain period {{it is said to}} show an inequilibrium. Since, by definition, all current accounts and <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> of the countries in the world must become zero, then other countries become indebted with the other nations.During recent years, global imbalances have become a concern {{in the rest of the}} world.

50|$|In economics, a country's {{current account}} {{is one of}} the two {{components}} of its balance of payments, the other being the capital account (sometimes called the financial account). The current account consists of the balance of trade, net primary income or factor income (earnings on foreign investments minus payments made to foreign investors) and net cash transfers, that have taken place over a given period of time. The current account balance is one of two major measures of a country's foreign trade (the other being the net capital outflow). A current account surplus indicates that the value of a country's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> (i.e. assets less liabilities) grew over the period in question, and a current account deficit indicates that it shrank. Both government and private payments are included in the calculation. It is called the current account because goods and services are generally consumed in the current period.|$|E
50|$|Since 1989, {{the current}} account deficit of the US has been {{increasingly}} large, reaching close to 7% of the GDP in 2006. In 2011, it was the highest deficit in the world. New evidence, however, suggests that the U.S. current account deficits are being mitigated by positive valuation effects. That is, the U.S. assets overseas are gaining in value relative to the domestic assets held by foreign investors. The <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> of the U.S. are therefore not deteriorating one to one with {{the current account}} deficits. The most recent experience has reversed this positive valuation effect, however, with the US net foreign asset position deteriorating by more than two trillion dollars in 2008, down to less than $18 trillion, but has since risen to $25 trillion. This temporary decline was due primarily to the relative under-performance of domestic ownership of foreign assets (largely foreign equities) compared to foreign ownership of domestic assets (largely US treasuries and bonds).|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{cross-border}} portfolio holdings of a large variety of assets have risen sharply. This has created an important role for changes in asset prices of a country's external assets and liabilities (i. e. "valuation effects") in affecting the country's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position. Valuation effects are commonly thought as stabilizing: they counteract current account movements and mitigate {{the impact of the}} current account on the country's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position. This paper shows that whether valuation effects are stabilizing or not depends critically on the nature of underlying productivity shocks. In response to transitory shocks, valuation effects are stabilizing; but in response to trend shocks, such effects amplify the impact of the current account on the <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position. These contrasting results arise because optimally smoothing consumers respond differently to a transitory shock than to a trend shock to income. The results are consistent with the pattern of external imbalances between the United States and other G. 7 countries since the 1990 s.

We examine this channel of adjustment in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with international equity trading. We find that two-way <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> holdings are necessary {{for the emergence of}} a valuation channel. Its quantitative importance depends on features of the international transmission mechanism such as the size of financial frictions, substitutability across goods, and the persistence of shocks.

Under flexible prices, the nominal exchange rate exhibits a unit root. However, today's exchange rate also depends on the stock of real <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> accumulated in the previous period. The predictive power of net assets for the exchange rate is stronger the closer assets to non-stationary and the higher the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods in consumption. When prices are sticky, the exchange rate still exhibits a unit root. The current level of the exchange rate depends on the past GDP differential, along with <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets.</b> Endogenous monetary policy and asset dynamics have consequences for exchange rate overshooting under both flexible and sticky prices. exchange rate, monetary policy, <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets,</b> overshooting...|$|E

The results show that financial development reduces a country's long-run <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> position. In addition, financial development leads to higher net equity and lower net debt positions. These findings confirm the theoretical predictions of Mendoza et al. (2009).

40|$|This paper studies <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> and the {{differential}} returns between gross foreign {{assets and liabilities}} for a sample of 49 countries between 1981 and 2007. It shows that investment income {{is more important than}} capital gains in imparting a drift to <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> over the long-run, whereas the latter dominate short-term dynamics. Excess returns on <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> of the United States are indeed exorbitant from a global perspective, only occasionally matched by other countries and mainly accounted for by positive valuation effects. The role of the United States as levered investor did not contribute to its exorbitant privilege. The econometric panel analysis also fails to find a robust positive relationship between leverage and excess returns. Notably, instead, real exchange rate depreciations increase excess returns through capital gains, proportionally to the relative foreign currency exposure. Excess yields on investment income are positively associated with the country risk rating.
