40|$|South Stream and Nabucco {{are planned}} {{southern}} corridor projects {{for natural gas}} supply to Europe. South Stream is a Russian construction project of the gas pipeline with the capacity of 63 bcm of natural gas per year. It will connect Russia with Austria through Black Sea, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary, and with southern Italy through Greece and Ionian Sea, respectively. Nabucco is a European Union planned gas pipeline with the capacity of 31 bcm per year. If built, it will connect Caspian Region and Middle East with Austria through Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. Gas sources for South Stream pipeline are known and available, however it’s construction will be expensive. <b>Nabucco</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline construction costs will be two times less, but the unresolved political relations and non-existent infrastructure have caused it to have no available gas sources at the moment. Countries like Bulgaria and Hungary are involved with both projects, indicating the importance of both projects. In this paper SWOT analysis of the proposed projects was done and it has shown {{that there is a}} great chance Nabucco won’t be built if South Stream materializes first (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

50|$|India {{has become}} world’s second largest LPG importer, a {{position}} that was previously occupied by Japan. China remains as the world’s top importer. According to Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell, LPG imports in the country has increased 23% during the financial year 2016-2017 to about 11 million tonnes. The main reason behind {{the increase in the}} consumption of LPG in India is due to the two government schemes coupled with free <b>gas</b> <b>connections.</b> From May 2016, the government is providing free cooking <b>gas</b> <b>connections</b> to women from extremely poor households, to reduce the use of polluting fuels such as wood and dried cow dung. This has increased India’s active LPG users to about 200 million, which is 60% more than Japan’s entire population. According to the World Health Organization, polluting fuels used for cooking purposes results in 1.3 million premature deaths in India every year. India has set an ambitious target of increasing LPG usage to cover 80% of the households by March 2019. As per the present estimates of the oil ministry, demand for fuel will touch 35 million tonnes by 2031-32 in India.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{implementation}} of the first gas project, nearly 3,000 families in the Moreno district of Greater Buenos Aires now have in-home <b>gas</b> <b>connections,</b> 1,000 of which have already finished repayment to the trust fund. The community members who acted as leaders and promoters for the project have formed a formal public services cooperative in order to independently continue improving their neighborhood. The gas company that decided to collaborate, Gas Natural Ban, has changed its perception of the poorest economic sectors as “high risk” into one of viable clients, thus incorporating an inclusive business model.|$|R

50|$|The real {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was a gas leak from a damaged pipe located underneath the sidewalk. The gas got into an underground telephone connection and gathered {{in the basement of}} the Rotunda. Frozen water and snow clogged all the air vents, and in those circumstances, one spark or the turning on of a light in the basement, was enough to ignite the powerful explosion. The Rotunda itself did not have a <b>gas</b> <b>connection.</b> The low temperature caused the odorant to condense, and nobody was warned of a leak.|$|R
