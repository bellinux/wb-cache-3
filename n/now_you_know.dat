She also starred in the short film Roadside Assistance with Adam Brody.|$|E
500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sanaa Hamri, who also directed the video for [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)." [...] Both videos were shot back to back, and were released simultaneously to music programs and channels for immediate circulation. The video begins with Carey lying in her bed, as she receives a text message from Snoop Dogg reading [...] "Yo what's happening? What you crying for? <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you look 2 damn good 2 be crying... Come here... Holla at a playa DPG style... Ya know," [...] to which Carey responds [...] "I can't sleep." [...] As the video progresses as the lyrics continue, {{it appears to be}} 5 AM, and Carey is still unable to sleep. She lies in bed with the lamp on, pondering on thoughts of a past lover until she takes a bath. Afterwards, she makes her way to the kitchen, and begins pouring an abundant amount of cereal and milk into a bowl, spilling it over the counter in a restless rage. As the scene finishes, Snoop's face is seen on a small monitor, directing his verse to Carey in the video. As the last chorus plays, Carey becomes restless and tosses a champagne glass and bottle at a large window, shattering it and sending glass around the living room. The video ends with Carey lying down on the couch one more, attempting to sleep once more.|$|E

DeFranco expressed, [...] "for you [...] who know what the original content was, {{and what it is}} <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that it's like, it's pretty much a completely different channel—both in content and the people running it."

2500|$|In January 1986, Tracht {{created an}} uproar by telling an on-air joke {{regarding}} {{the new federal}} holiday, Martin Luther King Day. [...] Tracht said, [...] "Why don't we shoot four more and get the whole week off?" [...] followed by, [...] "Come on, <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I don't mean nothin'!" [...] He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at Howard University in honor of Dr. King. The Washington Post noted {{that he was the}} highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the March 2006 {{incident}} with the Capitol Police officer, Rep. McKinney was in the news, and her office invited the media to attend one of her monthly [...] "District Days," [...] where she spends one full day meeting with constituents to discuss issues of concern. At her April 23, 2006, [...] "District Days" [...] event, Rep. McKinney was being interviewed by WGCL's Renee Starzyk, who repeatedly questioned her about the March 29 scuffle with a Capitol police officer. Frustrated, McKinney stood up and apparently forgot she was still wearing the microphone. Her offscreen comments were captured on tape. She was heard saying, [...] "Oh, crap, <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what ... they lied to , and Coz is a fool." [...] McKinney returned on screen with the microphone, this time with instructions on what parts of the interview the station was allowed to use: [...] "anything that is captured by your audio ... that is captured while I'm not seated in this chair is off the record and is not permissible [...] to be used ... is that understood?" [...] The comments from the interview were subsequently aired on CBS and eventually across the nation.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E
