40|$|SummaryObjectivesListeria monocytogenes is an {{important}} pathogen in neonates in Western countries, with a fatality rate of 20 – 30 %. There is limited information on <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> in Eastern countries. The {{purpose of this study}} was to delineate the occurrence and clinical picture of <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> in Taiwan. MethodsA questionnaire-based survey of all of the 17 medical centers in Taiwan was performed, and a literature review of <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> as reported in Taiwan from 1990 to 2007 was made. ResultsA total of 14 cases (10 male, four female) of <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> were identified, including 11 found from the survey of four medical centers and another three collected from the literature review. Three were found to have occurred prior to 2000 and 11 were found to have occurred after 2000. The age of onset was less than 3 days in all cases. L. monocytogenes was identified from blood in 13, cerebrospinal fluid in four, and gastric aspirate in two. Half of the cases (7 / 14) had involvement of the central nervous system with pleocytosis and hypoglycorrhachia in cerebrospinal fluid, and three of them even developed hydrocephalus. The mortality rate was 29 %. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that listeriosis may emerge as {{an important}} health threat among newborn infants in Taiwan...|$|E

40|$|In Western {{developed}} countries, Listeria monocytogenes is not {{an uncommon}} pathogen in neonates. However, <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> has rarely been reported in Taiwan. We describe two cases collected from a single medical institute between 1990 and 2005. Case 1 was a male premature baby weighing 1558 g with a gestational age of 31 weeks whose mother had fever with chills 3 days prior to delivery. Generalized maculopapular rash was found after delivery and subtle seizure developed. Both blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture collected on the 1 st day yielded L. monocytogenes. In addition, he had ventriculitis complicated with hydrocephalus. Neurologic development was normal over 1 year of follow-up after ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation. Case 2 was a 28 -weeks' gestation male premature baby weighing 1180 g. Endotracheal intubation and ventilator support were provided after delivery due to respiratory distress. Blood culture yielded L. monocyto-genes. Cerebrospinal fluid showed pleocytosis but the culture was negative. Brain ultrasonography showed ventriculitis. Sudden deterioration with cyanosis and bradycardia developed on the 8 th day and he died on the same day. <b>Neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> is uncommon in Taiwan, but has significant mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis of perinatal infection relies on high index of suspicion in perinatal health care professionals. [J Formos Med Assoc 2007; 106 (2) : 161 - 164...|$|E
40|$|Listeriosis {{is caused}} by Listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive {{bacillus}} common in the environment and acquired by humans primarily through consumption of contaminated food. Infection causes a spectrum of illness, ranging from febrile gastroenteritis to invasive disease, including sepsis and meningoencephalitis. Invasive listeriosis occurs predominantly in older adults and persons with impaired immune systems. Listeriosis in pregnant women is typically a mild “flu-like ” illness, but can result in fetal loss, premature labor, or <b>neonatal</b> infection. <b>Listeriosis</b> is treated with antibiotics. On September 2, 2011, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) notified CDC of seven cases of listeriosis reported since August 28. On average, Colorado reports two cases of listeriosis annually in August. By September 6, all seven Colorado patients interviewed with the Listeria Initiative * questionnaire reported eating cantaloupe in the month before illness began, and three reported eating cantaloupe marketed as “Rocky Ford. ” A case was defined as illness {{with one of the}} outbreak strains isolated on or after August 1. Outbreak strains initially were defined as 1) clinical isolates of L. monocytogenes with specimen collection dates in August 2) with a two-enzyme, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern combination that occurred in two or more persons and 3) that matched any of the three pattern combinations found among Colorado residents in August. Analysis of Listeria Initiative data comparing the first 19 outbreak-associated cases in 2011 with 85 cases among persons aged ≥ 65 years with sporadic listeriosis identified during August of the years 2004 – 2010 indicated that cantaloupe consumption was strongly associated with illness caused by the outbreak strains: 19 of 19 (100 %) versus 54 of 85 (64 %); (odds ratio = 14. 9; 95 % CI = 2. 4 –∞). Initial * The Listeria Initiative is a CDC-led, enhanced surveillance system that has routinely collected data on food consumption from all patients with listeriosis since 2004.

40|$|Perinatal listerial {{infection}} {{is the most}} common clinical syndrome caused by Listeria monocytogenes and includes abortion, still birth, neonatal sepsis, and meningitis. Reports of listeriosis from India are limited. Sub Himalayan. We report a case of <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> from Himachal Pradesh. A two-day-old full term male baby was referred from a peripheral hospital with fever listlessness, skin rash and non-acceptance of feed. Ceftriaxone was already started as an empirical therapy. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of the baby, and also from the genital tract of the mother. Unfortunately, the baby died before the preliminary report could be communicated...|$|E
40|$|Case: The case is {{presented}} including maternal history, clinical and laboratory findings leading to diagnosis, paraclinical {{monitoring of the}} infection, the established treatment and outcome of neonatal death. A review of national and international literature on infectious and epidemiology characteristics of L. monocytogenes infection, and its clinical presentation and implications during the gestational and the neonatal period is made. Discussion: <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> is a disease with high fatality whose epidemiology is not clearly described in the national and regional level which hinders the development of prevention strategies in high-risk groups. We suggest this infection becomes a notifiable event to allow the identification of risk factors, lethality, usual presentation and outcome of this infectious disease in Colombia...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> {{is widely}} {{reported}}, {{but this is}} the first case reported in Serbia. A newborn developed respiratory distress syndrome 2 hours after delivery and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Initial empirical therapy was inappropriate. Consequently, on the second day, the patient developed meningitis. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from the tracheal aspirate, blood, periumbilical swab, and cerebrospinal fluid. After bacteriology results, the therapy was changed to ampicillin and meropenem. On day 11 of hospitalization, the patient developed nosocomial infection due to multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Since therapeutic options were limited, the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin. After 26 days of hospitalization the patient showed complete recovery and was discharged with no apparent sequelae. This case showed the importance of bacteriological examination in cases of infections caused by uncommon organisms. Pediatricians should be aware of the neonatal infection caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia...|$|E
40|$|Three {{cases of}} <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> are reported. This local {{incidence}} in a busy neonatal unit over a 10 -year period {{would agree with}} other reports that the condition is rare in the United Kingdom. Two cases had septicaemia and one developed septicaemia and meningitis, contrasting with the previous view that the commonest presentation is with meningitis, and {{could be due to}} the greater use of blood cultures in babies suspected of having infection. The mode of delivery differed in each case which allowed certain conclusions to be made regarding pathogenesis of the condition. Thus evidence is presented against fetal infection through an ascending route or while passing through an infected birth canal. Maternal bacteraemia with a transplacental spread of infection would seem more likely. The possible use of Gentamicin in the treatment of this condition is discussed and the better prognosis with septicaemia, compared with meningitis, is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Listeria monocytogenes is a {{relevant}} foodborne pathogen in public health, responsible for outbreaks of listeriosis often associated to {{the consumption of}} ready to eat meat, dairy and fishery products. Listeriosis is a serious disease {{that can lead to}} death and mainly affect children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. In pregnant women causes abortion or <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis.</b> In Brazil, ready to eat food are appreciated and increasingly consumed by the population. Furthermore, products such as sausages, bologna, hams and cheeses have characteristics such as pH, Aw and sodium chloride content that favor the development of L. monocytogenes during their shelf life. The purpose of this paper was to present an overview of L. monocytogenes contamination in different meat, dairy and fishery products that are ready for consumption and thereby support the adoption of strategies to mitigate this risk, contributing to achieve the appropriate level protection for the consumers and thus strengthen Brazil's food safety system...|$|E
40|$|The {{records were}} {{reviewed}} of all patients treated at the Vancouver General Hospital over the 15 years from 1965 through 1979 for infections proved by culture {{to have been}} caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Although listeriosis is not common in humans, certain groups seem to be susceptible - immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, neonates and the elderly. All these groups were represented among the 22 cases reviewed. There were 17 adults, 3 of whom were pregnant women who had only a mild influenza-like illness. Of the remaining 14 adults 9 were immunocompromised and 5 apparently immunocompetent; 7 presented with meningitis and 7 with bacteremia only. Of the five infants with <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis,</b> two had early-onset disease (bacteremia) and three had the late-onset form (meningitis). Seven patients were treated with penicillin alone, seven with ampicillin alone and eight with penicillin or ampicillin combined with kanamycin, gentamicin or chloramphenicol. There were eight deaths: several were directly attributable to the listeriosis, but in others the severity of the underlying illness was an important factor. Serotypes 1 and 4 b were equally common among the 16 specimens of L. monocytogenes that were typed...|$|E
40|$|Between November 1996 and December 2006, {{two cases}} of early-onset and one case of late-onset <b>neonatal</b> <b>listeriosis</b> were {{reported}} in San Luis, Argentina. This article describes clinical and laboratory findings as well as treatment and outcome for newborns treated for Listeria monocytogenes meningitis or septicaemia. In one of the newborns with early-onset listeriosis, meningitis led to important complications including hydrocephalus. The two other newborns showed complete recovery following adequate treatment. The L. monocytogenes isolates from two patients belonged to PCR group IVb (including serovar 4 b strains) and to PCR group IIb (including serovar 1 / 2 b strains) in the third patient. Listeriosis, especially the maternal-fetal presentation, is still rare in Argentina for unknown reasons. Our data {{can be used in}} the future as an epidemiological survey.
