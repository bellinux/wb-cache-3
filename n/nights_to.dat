5|$|In {{areas where}} there was a high {{interest}} in air cadets, additional squadrons were established with different parade <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the numbers. These squadrons were often placed into air cadet wings (a formation of two or more squadrons) with a separate wing HQ staff of both officers and senior cadets overseeing the operation. The system was discontinued in the late 1960s and all squadrons became independent once again.|$|E

In only his ninth NRL game on 7 June 2009, playing against the Brisbane Broncos, Tomane scored three tries and {{took on the}} goal-kicking duties for the <b>night</b> <b>to</b> achieve six goals from nine {{attempts}} to bring his total points tally for the <b>night</b> <b>to</b> 24, half the Melbourne Storm's 48 total points for <b>night</b> <b>to</b> Brisbane Bronco's four points.|$|R
5|$|With {{its first}} season, The Simpsons became the Fox network's first series to {{rank among the}} top thirty highest rated shows of a {{television}} season. Due to this success, Fox decided to switch The Simpsons timeslot in hopes that it would result in higher ratings for the shows that would air after it. The series moved from 8:00p.m. on Sunday <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> the same time on Thursdays, where it competed with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, {{although}} the concept originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992). Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima, and Takashi Iizuka. Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character <b>Nights</b> <b>to</b> resemble an angel that could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character. The team conducted research on dreaming and REM sleep, and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. An analogue controller, known as the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and was included with some retail copies sold.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum {{depicted}} in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales {{took place in the}} closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place {{at the peak of the}} February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included a line in the script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.|$|E

50|$|Lorenzo {{speaks to}} his new bride, Jessica, {{comparing}} the moon and stars in the quiet <b>night</b> <b>to</b> harmony of their souls. He jokingly compares the soundless <b>night</b> <b>to</b> the one when Troilus committed a romantic act of daring for his lover Cressida. Jessica counters in kind, comparing the <b>night</b> <b>to</b> that on which Thisbe fled from {{the shadow of the}} lion. They agree that, on such a night, Dido stood upon the sea banks and waved for her love to return to Carthage.|$|R

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from {{inside one of the}} houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{takes place}} in January 1967. Pete asks Joan to make a {{personal}} and moral sacrifice to ensure the company lands the Jaguar account.

Don becomes furious after learning of the impact Megan's new profession will have on their life. Feeling unappreciated, Peggy has lunch with Freddy Rumsen, who encourages her to make a move. Later, Peggy meets with Ted Chaough, from rival firm CGC, and accepts an offer for chief copywriter at CGC.|$|E
5|$|The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set.|$|E

25|$|However, Mafia informers said Provenzano moved between farmhouses in {{the region}} {{every two or three}} <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> evade capture.

25|$|In 2014, Seven News Adelaide {{won every}} single ratings weeknight against the rival Nine News Adelaide, but in 2015 started {{to lose some}} <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> Nine as Seven News as a whole {{suffered}} its worst ratings figures for over a decade.
