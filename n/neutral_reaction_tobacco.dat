40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the effect of water quality on the pH value of fungicides, insecticides, mineral {{fertilizers}} and their mixtures. The fungicides propineb (Antracol WP- 70) and mancozeb (Dithane M- 70), insecticides pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic- 50) and imidacloprid(Confidor 200 -SL), several fertilizers (Ferticare I, Ferticare II, Ferticare III and Wuxal Super) and their mixtures were analyzed for pH value under laboratory conditions using a potentiometric pH meter. Measurements were made directly after preparation or mixing with tap and well water and 24 hours later. Tap water exhibited a <b>neutral</b> <b>reaction.</b> A slightly alkaline reaction of well water was mostlikely due to high ammonium content. The suspensions of Antracol WP- 70 exhibited slightly alkaline reactions with both water types during 24 hours. The spray liquids of Dithane M- 70 mixed with tap or well water had <b>neutral</b> <b>reaction</b> after preparation and slightly alkaline reaction after 24 hours. The emulsions of Actellic- 50 showed <b>neutral</b> <b>reaction</b> with both water types, followed by a pH increase in tap water after 24 hours. The solutions of Confidor 200 -SL had a slightly alkaline reaction after mixing and the pH value increased with both water types after 24 hours. It is therefore recommended to apply these insecticides directly after preparation. Mineral fertilizers considerably reduced pH values of the fungicide and insecticide components in double and triple mixtures, especially Ferticare nutrients which had a moderately acid reaction. Wuxal Super had a <b>neutral</b> <b>reaction</b> with both water types. The mixtures with well water increased pH values, which indicates that water pH does affect the pH value of the mixture. Both individual fertilizers and all mixtures (double and triple) with Ferticare had pH values between 2. 4 and 6, which allows their active liquids to be stored for 12 to 24 hours. The suspensions (Antracol WP- 70, double and triple mixtures), emulsions (Actellic- 50 and Actellic- 50 +Wuxal Super) and solutions (Confidor 200 -SL, Wuxal Super and Confidor 200 -SL+Wuxal Super) had pH values between 6. 7 and 7. 9; therefore, the optimum time of their application, especially in case of the mixtures with well water, is immediately after preparation. The suspensions of Dithane M- 70 with the insecticides and Ferticare III showed moderately acid reactions with tap water and slightly acid reactions with well water. Since both individual components and their mixtures showed slightly higher pH values with well water than with tap water, it was an indication that water pH may affect the pHvalue of active liquids...|$|R

30|$|One big {{challenge}} in this technique currently {{lies in the}} extension <b>neutral</b> to <b>reaction</b> products. The Penning ionisation studies performed to date benefitted from the simple and efficient detection of ions which means that even low numbers of reaction products can be monitored very efficiently. The detection of <b>neutral</b> <b>reaction</b> products requires an additional step, where the neutral is either ionized by REMPI or excited to be detected by Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Both of these processes have a limited total efficiency. Given {{that the number of}} reaction products produced at every experimental cycle is low already (single digits in certain cases of the systems studied here), both REMPI and LIF are not realistic. The solution will be to either develop new, ultra sensitive detection methods that enable the counting basically of single molecules, or do substantially increase the densities and thus the observed reaction rates.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigators}} (1) {{have demonstrated}} the presence in normal human gastric juice of a protease which is active at <b>neutral</b> <b>reaction.</b> Cer-tain properties were exhibited which distinguished the enzyme from pepsin and trypsin. Subsequent studies (2 - 4) showed that the protease and the so-called intrinsic factor of Castle possessed cer-tain identical properties: both are removed by ad-sorption with Lloyd's reagent, both are unable to penetrate a semi-permeable membrane, they are not destroyed by Berkefeld filtration or exposure to alkali, but are destroyed by exposure to heat and are inhibited by an environment more acid than pH 3. 5. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} this protease activity was absent or greatly diminished in patients with Addisonian pernicious anemia, but was normal in patients with pernicious tapeworm anemia.
