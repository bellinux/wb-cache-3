50|$|During {{his time}} as Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham was noted for gaining new powers to issue {{monetary}} penalties to those who breach the Data Protection Act 1998. He has also welcomed new powers to issue monetary penalties under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, as well as raising concerns over harm and distress caused by <b>nuisance</b> <b>call</b> to the public. Christopher Graham succeeded Richard Thomas in 2009. During Richard Thomas' tenure as Commissioner, the ICO was particularly noted for raising serious concerns over the Government's proposed British national identity card and database, {{as well as other}} similar databases such as the Citizen Information Project, Universal Child Database, and the NHS National Programme for IT, stating that the country is in danger of sleepwalking into a surveillance society, drawing attention to the misuse of such information by the former states of the Eastern bloc and Francisco Franco's Spain.|$|E

40|$|Rising {{numbers of}} {{complaints}} and surveys of consumer experiences show that <b>nuisance</b> <b>calls</b> are an increasing {{problem in the}} UK. Enforcement of regulations on <b>nuisance</b> <b>calls</b> has not been sufficient: illegal <b>nuisance</b> <b>calls,</b> such as recorded messages and repeated silent calls, as well as spam texts to mobile phones, are widespread and form a significant problem according to consumers. Calls which are legal but which consumers still find a nuisance are also a problem. To deal with these, various filtering technologies will be needed; the range of these should be improved and consumers must be properly informed about them. A review of the regulations may also be required. An integrated plan is needed, with a single point of overall control. Consumers will continue to suffer unless Government takes urgent action to enable coordination between the regulatory agencies responsible for dealing with <b>nuisance</b> <b>calls</b> and also the telephone companies who carry them.

Results. —From 1948 to August 1, 2004, 376 injuries and 15 deaths have been reported in the United States as a result of encounters with alligators.

To avoid VoIP users to manually label <b>nuisance</b> <b>calls,</b> our voice spam filter automatically marks all VoIP calls with short call durations as unsolicited. The preliminary simulation results show that our approach is effective to counter voice spam. I...|$|R

50|$|Industry {{observers}} have attributed {{the relatively low}} mobile phone penetration rate in the United States, {{compared to that of}} Europe, to the subscriber-pays model. In this model the convenience of the mobility is charged to the subscriber. Callers from outside the local-calling region of the assigned number, however, pay for a long-distance call, although domestic long-distance rates are generally lower than the rates in caller-pays systems. Conversely, an advantage of caller-pays is the relative absence of telemarketing and <b>nuisance</b> <b>calls</b> to mobile numbers. The integrated numbering plan also enables local number portability between fixed and wireless services within a region, allowing users to switch to mobile service while keeping their telephone number.|$|R
