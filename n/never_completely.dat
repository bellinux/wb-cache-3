5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} {{transformed from}} a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> abandoned, its preservation being {{due in part to the}} fact that its moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1880, Louis {{was posted}} to HMS Inconstant, the {{flagship}} of the Flying Squadron, which included HMS Bacchante on which Princes Albert Victor and George were serving. The ship sailed to South America, South Africa, Australia, Fiji, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, {{before returning to}} South Africa in April 1882. Seven months after Louis left Britain on the voyage, actress Lillie Langtry allegedly bore him an illegitimate daughter, Jeanne Marie. Langtry was also a one-time mistress of the Prince of Wales. Jeanne Marie's parentage was <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> verified, but Louis made a financial settlement nonetheless.|$|E

Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.|$|E
5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E

5|$|The {{individuals}} {{within a particular}} area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.|$|E
5|$|As {{is often}} the case with huge ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|The public stage ban 1642–60 {{imposed by}} the Puritan regime {{represents}} a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, {{as can be seen}} from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera The Siege of Rhodes (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, biding their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand, and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.|$|E

As French was frequently spoken in high circles, Victoria <b>never</b> <b>completely</b> mastered the Russian language. Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II, on her mother's side, and to Empress Alexandra, on her father's side, the relationship with them was neither close nor warm. As Kirill became a keen auto racer, the couple often took trips by car: a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces. Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days, and she traveled abroad frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother {{in the south of}} France or in Coburg. Victoria and her husband had a close relationship with their daughters, Maria and Kira. The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out.|$|E
