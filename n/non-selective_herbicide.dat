The esters and salts of nonanoic acid are called nonanoates. Nonanoic acid is a clear, oily liquid with an unpleasant, rancid odor. It is nearly insoluble in water, but very soluble in chloroform, ether, and hexane.

30|$|For in-field plants {{exposed to}} <b>non-selective</b> <b>herbicides,</b> it is {{important}} to consider that actually a specific weed community is the affected entity rather than the plant population of a specific taxon. However, if considering higher trophic levels and food web-related effects, the importance of a particular species may be valued higher than the weed community. This is demonstrated by the weed species Chenopodium album which is an important food resource for the skylark Alauda arvensis [96, 97]. An example from North America is the already mentioned Monarch butterfly, a species which is an obligate herbivore of milkweed species growing on agricultural land [98]. In Europe, 21 lepidopteran associations with weeds were identified and considered at high risk when cultivating GM herbicide-tolerant crops [99]. In particular, monophagous lepidopteran species occurring on weed species that cannot be controlled well by conventional herbicides were predicted to be prone to significant declines if <b>non-selective</b> <b>herbicides</b> were applied [99].|$|R

5000|$|Imazapyr is a <b>non-selective</b> <b>herbicide</b> {{used for}} the control of {{a broad range of}} weeds {{including}} terrestrial annual and perennial grasses and broadleaved herbs, woody species, and riparian and emergent aquatic species.

Additionally, imazapyr is used to control annual and perennial grass and broadleaved weeds, brush, vines and many deciduous trees. Imazapyr is absorbed by the leaves and roots, and moves rapidly through the plant. It accumulates in the meristem region (active growth region) of the plant.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, kills conventional soybeans. The bacterial gene is EPSP (= 5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase.

30|$|Both <b>non-selective</b> <b>herbicides</b> {{glyphosate}} and glufosinate {{are effective}} {{on a wide}} range of annual grass and broadleaf weed species. The simplicity and effectiveness of weed control in HR cropping systems can be undermined in several ways: (i) by shifts in weed communities and populations resulting from the selection pressure by the applied herbicides, (ii) by escape and proliferation of transgenic plants as weedy volunteers, and (iii) by hybridization with—and HR-gene introgression into—related weedy species. While point (i) indicates changes in biodiversity, points (ii) and (iii) could increase the overall herbicide use in chemical weed management and thereby affect biodiversity further.|$|R

In addition, reproductive and non-reproductive weed species should be separately assessed, particularly {{at the end of the}} growing season, because population numbers of reproductive species indicate whether their seed bank will be sufficiently replenished at the end of the growing season.

30|$|When {{evaluating}} {{the risk that}} weeds develop resistance due to GMHT crop cultivation, the crop needs to be assessed together with the <b>non-selective</b> <b>herbicide</b> and compared to different weed management options currently used [6]. Risk managers decide whether risk mitigation measures are to be applied {{in order to avoid}} that weeds develop resistance to the non-selective herbicides. EFSA used risk scenarios for the assessment of glyphosate resistance occurring in GMHT soybean [79]. The relative weed-resistance risk was determined for different crop rotations and weed management options which considered the frequency of glyphosate herbicides applied to the GMHT crop, the adoption of no or reduced tillage systems and crop rotational aspects (see [79] for details). Such risk scenarios can help to determine which changes in the management regime are considered as acceptable or not and, consequently, to set the LoC.|$|E
40|$|Possible non-target {{effects of}} the widely-used, <b>non-selective</b> <b>herbicide</b> {{glyphosate}} were examined in six cyanobacterial strains, and {{the basis of their}} resistance was investigated. All cyanobacteria showed a remarkable tolerance to the herbicide up to millimolar levels. Two of them were found to possess an insensitive form of glyphosate target, the shikimate pathway enzyme 5 -enol-pyruvyl-shikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase. Four strains were able to use the phosphonate as the only phosphorus source. Low uptake rates were measured only under P-deprivation. Experimental evidence for glyphosate metabolization was obtained also in strains apparently unable to use the phosphonate. Results suggest that various mechanisms may concur in providing cyanobacterial strains with herbicide tolerance. Data account also for their widespread ability to metabolize the phosphonate. However, such capability seems limited by low cell permeability to glyphosate, and is promptly repressed when inorganic phosphate is available...|$|E
