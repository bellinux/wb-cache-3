5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> {{that can}} be used to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
40|$|Software {{testing is}} a process of ratifying the {{functionality}} of software. It is one of the crucial area which consumes more time and high cost. The time spent on testing is mainly concerned with <b>testing</b> large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases, which are unreliable. Our goal is to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases and to give reliable test cases. To extract reliable test cases from large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases, clustering algorithm is used which is a data mining approach to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases...|$|R

Note that in these studies, we targeted optimal test sets with the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases as possible.|$|R
5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E

40|$|The all-du-paths {{software}} testing criterion {{is the most}} discriminating of the data flow <b>testing</b> criteria <b>of</b> Rapps and Weyuker. Unfortunately, in the worst case, the criterion requires an exponential <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases. To investigate the practicality of the criterion, we develop tools to count the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> complete program paths necessary to satisfy the criterion. This count is an estimate <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases required. In {{a case study of}} an industrial software system, we find that in eighty percent of the subroutines the all-du-paths criterion is satisfied by testing ten or fewer complete paths. Only one subroutine out of 143 requires an exponential <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases...|$|R
