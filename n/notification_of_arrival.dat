40|$|Security {{issues were}} always {{concerned}} ttie shipping industry, {{but after the}} tragic event of 11 th September, {{it was obvious that}} a standardized, consistent legal framework for evaluating risk was essential. This has recently resulted in more work and initiatives both within international forums and organisations and at regional level. Work on maritime security began within the IMO in February 2002. The IMO package of security measures included changes to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention - including a new Chapter XI- 2 that solely addresses ship security - and a new, 2 -part, International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. Furthermore non-IMO mandatory measures (e. g. U. S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, U. S. 96 -hour advance <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival,</b> U. S. 24 -hour advance manifest rule etc.) and Voluntary measures (e. g. Container Security Initiative etc.), but also EU Regulation have created a new port security scheme. The industry and all actors involved were fully concerned about an enormous number of impacts (not only economical), that have arisen from the new port security scheme. A limitation of the enquiry is that the academic literature is very limited. It is a very current issue that emerged in the industry after the tragic events of the 11 * September 2001 and that work aspire to be an endeavor of collecting and analysing the new legislation framework and the implementing difficulties, to assess the implications for the industry and furthermore to proceed with an impact analysis although the implementation period is very short and lots of them are expected to arise in later stages. Finally it is a first attempt in my country to commit to paper how ISPS is implemented so far in Greek ports. ivSchool of managemen...|$|E

50|$|IMAP4 clients need to {{maintain}} a TCP/IP connection to the IMAP server {{in order to be}} notified <b>of</b> the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> new mail. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> mail <b>arrival</b> is done through in-band signaling, which contributes to the complexity of client-side IMAP protocol handling somewhat. A private proposal, push IMAP, would extend IMAP to implement push e-mail by sending the entire message instead <b>of</b> just a <b>notification.</b> However, push IMAP has not been generally accepted and current IETF work has addressed the problem in other ways (see the Lemonade Profile for more information).|$|R
40|$|Modern {{networks}} of workstations connected by Gigabit networks {{have the ability}} to run high-performance computing applications at a reasonable performance, but at a significantly lower cost. The performance of these applications is usually dominated by their efficiency of the underlying communication mechanisms. However, efficient communication requires that not only messages themselves are sent fast, but also notification about message arrival should be fast as well. For example, a message that has arrived at its destination is worthless until the recipient is alerted to the message arrival. In this paper we describe a new operation, the remote-enqueue atomic operation, which can be used in multiprocessors, and workstation clusters. This operation atomically inserts a data element in a queue that physically resides in a remote processor's memory. This operation can be used for fast <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> message <b>arrival,</b> and for fast passing of small messages. Compared to other software and [...] ...|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} a {{question}} during the day as to whether Stanbury should let his sister know by letter that he was expected; {{but it had been}} decided that he should appear at Nuncombe without any previous <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> his <b>arrival.</b> Trevelyan had thought that this was very necessary, and when Stanbury had urged that such a measure seemed to imply suspicion, he had declared that in no other way could the truth be obtained. He, Trevelyan, simply wanted to know the facts as they were occurring. It was a fact that Colonel Osborne was down in the neighbourhood of Nuncombe Putney. That, at least, {{had been a}}scertained. It might very possibly be the case that he would be refused admittance to the Clock House,--that all the ladies there would combine to keep him out. But,--so Trevelyan urged,--the truth on this point was desired. It was essentially necessary to his happiness that he should know what was being done.|$|R
50|$|One {{major benefit}} of turning all {{incoming}} paper mail into images {{as soon as}} it is received, {{is the extent to which}} it shortens the decision cycle. Although it might be difficult to quantify exactly what the cost savings are, it seems an obvious advantage. Digital mailrooms allow users to receive immediate <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> a document's <b>arrival</b> at the company. Employees can access images in record time, regardless of where the documents were physically acquired. Files can then be processed very rapidly according to their level of urgency. Just as digital mailrooms facilitate the exchange of company information, they also facilitate the coordination of several people around the same document. The decision-making process becomes quicker and more accurate.|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

40|$|In many {{developed}} countries, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer {{cases is}} compulsory. Developing countries including India {{accounts for more}} than half of new cancer cases in the world, however <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer is not yet mandatory. The primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> is to effect prevention and control and better utilization of resources. It is also a valuable source for incidence, prevalence, mortality and morbidity <b>of</b> the disease. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer will lead to improved awareness of common etiologic agents, better understanding of common preventable causes and better utilization of health resources with better monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of health programs such as cancer screening and cancer treatment programs, which ultimately might improve survival. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be done by the doctor or the hospital. Akin to the integrated disease surveillance project where more than 90 % of the districts report weekly data through E-mail/portal, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be implemented if it is incorporated into the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke scheme.
