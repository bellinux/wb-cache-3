5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{revealed}} that the Anglican gentry of Birmingham were not averse to using violence against Dissenters whom they viewed as potential revolutionaries. They had <b>no</b> <b>qualms,</b> either, about raising a potentially uncontrollable mob. Many of those attacked left Birmingham; as a result, the town became noticeably more conservative after the riots. The remaining supporters of the French Revolution decided not to hold a dinner celebrating the storming of the Bastille the next year.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E

[...] Snake-like she draws at my finger, while I drag [...] it in horror away.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} Key West's {{prominent}} citizens {{were members of}} the [...] "Key West Avengers", and known personally by Secretary Mallory; he seemed to have <b>no</b> <b>qualm</b> with approving the requested transfers. On August 5, 1862, 10 men received orders transferring them from the [...] "Key West Avengers" [...] to [...] under construction at Saffold, Georgia. Between August 6, 1862, and March 1864, another 21 [...] "Key West Avengers" [...] would be transferred into the C. S.

5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear to him that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E
5|$|Bhimsen {{felt the}} need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take {{precaution}} before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet he felt <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the Baisathi Haran under Bhimsen's advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their parents, from the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching that disease. Now, after almost two-year, all of a sudden Rana Bahadur was made mukhtiyar (chief authority) and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur's faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox's mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved in the dialogue with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.|$|E
25|$|Andrew and Maria {{frequently}} argued on {{the task}} and in the boardroom. During the treat, they both admitted on camera {{that they did not}} get on, but had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about working with one another.|$|E
50|$|Flames of Passion proved {{controversial}} with critics, {{many of whom}} {{found the}} subject matter lurid, sensationalist and distasteful. Cinemagoers had <b>no</b> such <b>qualms,</b> and turned the film into a big box-office hit, Wilcox's first commercial success.|$|R
5000|$|The estrangement {{between the}} two groups only grew as the time passed, and due to their {{separation}} from the bigger community the smaller faction was unable to arrange suitable marriages for its members for the next 60 years, because of which its number shrank to the 300 from the original 400. Thereafter this [...] "Kanchole" [...] faction imperatively had to scatter in the nearby regions, marrying with the women from the other Suryavanshi and Somvanshi castes of Mumbai, and nearby areas. The smaller group had <b>no</b> <b>qualm</b> in retaining their original culture, customs, festivals and food habits, family goddess, and gotra, which they have been retaining till date.|$|R
60|$|The tomb, I {{have not}} the least doubt, was Gothic;--and the {{breaking}} of it to pieces was not in order to restore it afterwards, that a living architect might get the job of restoration. Here is a stone {{out of one of}} Giovanni Pisano's loveliest Gothic buildings, which I myself saw with my own eyes dashed out, that a modern builder might be paid for putting in another. But Pope Urban's tomb was not destroyed to such end. There was <b>no</b> <b>qualm</b> of the belly, driving the hammer,--qualm of the conscience probably; at all events, a deeper or loftier antagonism than one on points of taste, or economy.|$|R
25|$|Let's {{compare it}} to the somber Lutte of the funerary Mr Valotton and we will have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> in passing to the cubist Jean Metzinger the Ingresque qualities we so lightly accorded Mr. Valotton. I love the delicious chinoiserie of your canvas, dear Metzinger, almost as much as the Chinese {{contours}} of Ingres.|$|E
25|$|The RSS {{established}} {{a number of}} affiliate organisations after Indian Independence to carry its ideology to {{various parts of the}} society. Prominent among them is the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP, World Hindu Council), set up in 1964 with the objective of protecting and promoting the Hindu religion. Being an explicitly religious organisation, the VHP had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about using a Hindutva ideology, which came to mean in its hands political Hinduism and Hindu militancy.|$|E
25|$|In Bunker's work, {{there is}} often an element of envy and disdain towards the normal people who live outside of this circle and hypocritically ensure that those caught in it have no way out. Most of Bunker's {{characters}} have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about stealing or brutalizing others and, as a rule, they prefer {{a life of crime}} over an honest job, in great part because the only honest career options are badly paying and low-class jobs in retail or manual labor.|$|E
50|$|Fantômas was {{introduced}} {{a few years}} after Arsène Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has <b>no</b> such <b>qualms</b> and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion.|$|R
60|$|Anna laughed, {{and went}} back to her easy chair. She knew that her voice was {{superior}} to Annabel's, and she had <b>no</b> further <b>qualms.</b> Whilst she was wondering how to frame her request for an advance, Mr. Earles drew out his cheque book.|$|R
5000|$|Only 13 of {{the more}} than 500 known Late Roman vessel bottoms are identifiably Jewish, but these have still been said to {{represent}} [...] "the most appealing group of Jewish realia that have come down from antiquity". [...] They are all presumed to have been used in the Roman catacombs as grave-markers, though as with the examples identifiable with other religions, the exact find spot and context of the great majority is unrecorded. Rather surprisingly, the only two of the 13 with full histories were found in Christian catacombs, whereas the only gold glass remains found in Jewish catacombs have no Jewish iconography, [...] and show that [...] "some Jews felt <b>no</b> <b>qualm</b> in using gold glasses with pagan iconographical motifs".|$|R
25|$|In {{the heart}} of this diverse Chinese {{community}} is an important temple for Singaporean Tamils, the Sri Mariamman Hindu Tamil Temple, and mosques, Al-Abrar Mosque at Telok Ayer Street and Jamae Mosque at Mosque Street, as well as the Hokkien Thian Hock Keng Chinese Temple of 1830 to 1842. These catered to the pockets of non-Chinese residents in the area and shows that despite efforts to segregate the early immigrants, they had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> living together, and side by side.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding her serious roles, Rosal {{would become}} best {{known in the}} 1950s for her daring {{appearances}} in film. She had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> appearing onscreen in bathing suits, engaging in kissing scenes or in playing villainous roles. Offscreen, Rosal led a quiet and private life. She enrolled in night classes at the Cosmopolitan Colleges and obtained a degree in Business Administration in 1954. She was married briefly in 1957 to an American pilot, Walter Gayda, {{with whom she had}} a child, Toni Rose, who later became a television host.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{frequent}} power-struggles within the organization, {{and ultimately the}} Baroness and Major Bludd enacted a plot to assassinate the Commander, and seize control of Cobra. In a twist of fate, the conspirators recruited Billy {{to carry out the}} assassination, but he was intercepted by Destro. Cobra Commander had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy, yet Billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit. Storm Shadow later freed Billy, and they both escaped to New York, where Storm Shadow trained him in ninjitsu. Billy was later caught in the crossfire between the Soft Master and Cobra agent Scrap-Iron, resulting in an explosion which seemingly killed Billy and several others.|$|E
60|$|Yet I had <b>no</b> <b>qualm</b> of fear, <b>no</b> doubt, even, {{touching}} the issue. Not that I was an habitual ferrailleur. As I have indicated, I had fought but {{one man in}} all my life. Nor yet am I {{of those who are}} said to know no fear under any circumstances. Such men are not truly brave; they are stupid and unimaginative, in proof of which I will advance the fact that you may incite a timid man to deeds of reckless valour by drugging him with wine. But this is by the way. It may be that the very regular fencing practice that in Paris I was wont to take may so have ordered my mind that the fact of meeting unbaited steel had little power to move me.|$|R
50|$|A. Baldwin Sloane, who {{had contributed}} to The Wizard of Oz, wrote a musical called The Gingerbread Man around 1906. The main {{character}} was named John Dough and sings a song of that title, but {{had nothing to do}} with Baum's character, and had <b>no</b> particular <b>qualms</b> about being eaten.|$|R
50|$|The agents persuade Caypor to {{help them}} settle a concocted bet: which one of them can climb higher on a nearby mountain. As the moment approaches, Ashenden finds {{he is unable to}} commit cold-blooded murder, but the General has <b>no</b> such <b>qualms</b> and pushes the unsuspecting Caypor off a cliff.|$|R
25|$|Ben appears {{far less}} {{competent}} when he agrees to {{a green card}} marriage with his British co-worker Sara. He had just given up on his search for the perfect girl, {{who happens to be}} independently wealthy, enjoys mixed martial arts, and reads Sue Grafton novels. Once married, Ben immediately meets Cassidy while chasing a soul, and she fits every criteria for his perfect girl. Sara, far crueler and more shrewd than she initially lets on, forbids Ben to see Cassidy, though she has <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about her own extramarital affairs that she keeps secret from Ben. Ben is eventually able to negotiate a compromise with Sara after discovering she is pregnant with her married boyfriend Esteban's child.|$|E
25|$|The NCO {{spread like}} {{wildfire}} in the crisis-ridden Campanian towns {{of the late}} 1970s, offering alienated youths an alternative to a lifetime of unemployment or poorly paid jobs. Hundreds of young men were employed as enforcers. Initially, the main specialisation of NCO gangs was extorting money through protection rackets from local businesses. While the traditional Camorristic families held territorial powers and the consequent responsibility over their controlled areas, the NCO had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> over breaking the established social fabric by extorting shopkeepers, small factories and businesses, and building contractors. In its quest for cash, it even targeted individuals such as landlords, lawyers and professionals. The NCO's protection racket even included a transient circus.|$|E
25|$|The Saint {{starring}} Val Kilmer {{was made}} in 1997 but diverged far from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; {{this would have been}} unthinkable in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even the main villains live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about taking another life. Kilmer's Saint is presented as a master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Sir Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.|$|E
5000|$|Because of his doping shame, Vinokourov {{could not}} count on riding the 2010 Tour de France, but Giro {{organizers}} had <b>no</b> similar <b>qualms</b> about inviting him to their event.

5000|$|In another scene, Borat {{visits the}} Serengeti Range ranch in Texas, where {{the owner of}} the ranch confides that he {{believes}} the Holocaust was a necessity for Germany. He further implies that he would have <b>no</b> moral <b>qualms</b> about running a ranch where people can hunt, in Borat's words, [...] "deer... then Jew." ...|$|R
60|$|The little model rose obediently. Hilary {{noticed that}} her boots were split, and this--as {{though he had}} seen someone strike a child--so moved his indignation that he felt <b>no</b> more <b>qualms,</b> but rather a sort of {{pleasant}} glow, such as {{will come to the}} most studious man when he levels a blow at the conventions.|$|R
25|$|The German Palatinates {{who settled}} in Pennsylvania, erroneously {{known as the}} Pennsylvania Dutch, also left their homelands {{for a number of}} reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and {{economically}} they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay down roots in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.|$|E
500|$|Dow worked fervently {{on behalf}} of Whig {{candidates}} and came to detest Democrats as {{the tools of the}} alcohol industry. Maine's Whig governor, Edward Kent, granted Dow a colonel's commission in the state militia in 1841 as a reward for his efforts, despite his lack of military experience. Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself [...] "a party man in the politician's understanding of the term," [...] and had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{developing}} Vulcan {{ears and}} alien masks, Phillips {{and his assistant}} Charles Schram applied more routine makeup to the principal actors. Khambatta's head had to be freshly shaved each day, then given an application of makeup to reduce glare from the hot set lights. Khambatta had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> about shaving her head at first, but began worrying if her hair would grow back properly. Roddenberry proposed insuring Khambatta's hair after the actress voiced her concerns, believing the price of such insurance to be negligible. Roddenberry also saw other benefits to taking out a policy: ...|$|E

50|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was {{the first}} person to portray Professor Challenger, {{dressing}} and making up as the professor for a photograph he wanted included in The Lost Worlds initial serialized publication in the Strand Magazine. The editor refused, feeling that such hoaxes were potentially damaging. Hodder & Stoughton had <b>no</b> such <b>qualms</b> and featured the image in the first book edition.|$|R
50|$|Cliff-ghasts can fly, and are mortal. Lee Scoresby, {{who hates}} killing sentient creatures, has <b>no</b> {{apparent}} <b>qualms</b> about killing ghasts. They are scavengers and enjoy killing and taunting. In the play adaptation they are depicted as hooded and shrouded, {{though in the}} Northern Lights they are described as having flat heads, large, bulging eyes, and wide frog-like mouths. They give off a horrible stench.|$|R
