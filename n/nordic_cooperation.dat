40|$|This study {{explores the}} driving forces and motives behind {{contemporary}} <b>Nordic</b> security <b>cooperation.</b> It asks and investigates whether the security cooperation has a foundation {{based on a}} shared (peace) identity or is founded on rational and functionalistic calculations. Through applying a theoretical model based on the theory of Regional Security Complexes the study reveal how external and internal transformations affect the Nordic nations and forces them to respond. The study reveals how both these factors are important when explaining {{the responses of the}} Nordic states and the development of the <b>Nordic</b> security <b>cooperation.</b> While national strategies differ {{there is a need to}} look to the own region which has led the Nordic states to search for a security structure at home. The study concludes that all of the Nordic nations have had to respond to a changing external environment which has put pressure on their defense budgets which problematizes their national foreign policy and security strategies. A strong Nordic amity and tradition of cooperation has eased a stronger formal structure which increases cost-effectiveness and functionalism for the Nordic states security structures. This structure has replaced older identity based and influence searching structures. Conclusively, contemporary <b>Nordic</b> security <b>cooperation</b> can be said to increase the Nordic states‟ security while simultaneously letting them follow their national security strategies. Norden is thus regaining importance and <b>Nordic</b> security <b>cooperation</b> show that the region is both active and proactive in dealing with their regional issues...|$|R

40|$|During the Cold War the {{different}} alignment choices of the Nordic states meant that military cooperation {{among them was}} highly circumscribed, and security issues were taboo in the Nordic Council. Following the events of 1989 – 91 <b>Nordic</b> defence <b>cooperation</b> intensified, and new institutions were established to facilitate joint deployments, acquisitions, research and development. In the late 2000 s there was another surge in <b>Nordic</b> military <b>cooperation</b> which culminated in the organisation <b>Nordic</b> Defence <b>Cooperation</b> (NORDEFCO). The main driver was economic: the Nordic Armed Forces were facing static or shrinking budgets, rising costs, and a demand {{to take part in}} new post-Cold War international missions. Given similarities in terms of size, culture and geographical proximity, the Nordic countries are well placed to form a so-called cluster-group of NATO/EU countries. Collaboration on military matters could proceed more readily within such a group than would be possible with larger and more heterogeneous organisations. There is, however, no shared Nordic view on ‘hard security’ issues in the Nordic region itself, which suggests that a joint security and defence regime aiming at something close to a Nordic alliance may find it hard to succeed. What NORDEFCO offers is an opportunity to get better value from the Nordic defence budgets by doing more joint research, acquisitions, education, training and deployments. The Swedish, Norwegian and Danish Armed Forces are quite similar in structure, which should facilitate cooperation, but Denmark, for political reasons, has held back. The Finnish Armed Forces would be a somewhat more challenging partner, due to the much larger contingent of inactive reserve forces, while Iceland is mostly excluded due to its lack of proper armed forces. All the Nordic states will face challenges domestically if NORDEFCO advances to the stage at which people need to relocate, changes jobs and industrial contracts move out of the country. If the organisation does reach this stage, it will require deft distributive bargaining by the Nordic governments...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the political instrumentalization of culture. Specifically, it studies {{how this is}} done through cultural policy within Western democracies. The analysis takes, as an example, official <b>Nordic</b> cultural <b>cooperation</b> in the post-war period. During this time, cultural exchange among Nordic countries {{became the subject of}} political attention establishing itself as part of the <b>Nordic</b> inter-governmental <b>cooperation</b> framework. This work focuses on three key moments in the history of official Nordic cultural cooperation: (i) the failure of the NORDEK plan (a plan which envisaged extensive economic <b>cooperation</b> between the <b>Nordic</b> countries) and the establishment of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 1971; (ii) the collapse of the Soviet system {{at the end of the}} 1980 s - beginning of the 1990 s; and (iii) the movement towards promoting the Nordic region on the global market in the first decade of the 2000 s. The analysis traces the lack of convergence between the official arm’s length principle in cultural policy and how cultural cooperation actually worked. The results of the research both demonstrate the various ways culture was instrumentalized and also prove that the politically defined concept of culture can receive different interpretations in the official discourse depending on current political goals...|$|R
