40|$|Diesel engine {{performance}} and emissions are strongly coupled with fuel atomization and spray processes, {{which in turn}} are strongly influenced by injector flow dynamics. Modern engines employ micro-orifice with different orifice designs. It is critical to characterize the effects of various designs on {{engine performance}} and emissions. Spray characteristic of diesel fuel injection {{is one of the}} most important factors in diesel combustion and pollutant emissions where the interval between the onset of combustion and the evaporation of atomized fuel is relatively short. Therefore, this project is to study the spray simulation of diesel fuel using valve covered orifice (VCO) <b>nozzle</b> <b>injector</b> in the closed chamber.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{prediction of}} the processes in rocket combustion chambers is still challenging due {{to a variety of}} problems that are not completly investigated nor completly understood within computational fluid dynamics (CFD) : First to mention is the accurate prediction of the jet behavior for sub- and supercritical conditions of propellents (e. g. liquid oxygen LOx) that influences the whole combustion process as well as the flame structure. Another challenge for the numerical method are the dissimilar length scales and material properties for the liquid and gaseous parts in combination with the chemical reactions for the LOx-GH 2 combustion. In this study we use the TAU numerical flow solver for the simulation of single-injector experiments conducted at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Lampoldshausen. Based on experimental investigations in a windowed DLR subscale thrust chamber "C" (designated BKC) the numerical method in TAU for the simulation of sub- und supercritical LOx-GH 2 combustion and atomization model is validated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to review the previous research in the development of gaseous fuel injector for port injection CNG engine converted from diesel engine. Problem statement: The regular development of internal combustion engines change direction to answer the two most important problems determining the development trends of engines technology and in particular, their combustion systems. They were environmental protection against emission and noise, shortage of hydrocarbon fuels, specific fuel consumption and other technical and economic parameters. Approach: Several alternative fuels has been recognized as having a significant potential for producing lower overall pollutant emissions compared to diesel fuel. Natural gas, which composed predominately by identified as a leading candidate for transportation applications among these fuels for availability, environmental compatibility and natural gas is that it can be used in conventional diesel engines. Results: Some advantages of CNG as a fuel are octane number is very good for SI engine fuel, engines can be operate with a high compression ratio, less engine emissions and less aldehydes. In the diesel engines converted or designed to run on natural gas with the port injection (sequential) or trans-intake valve-injection system, a high-speed gas jet was pulsed from the intake port through the open intake valve into the combustion chamber, where it caused effects of turbulence and charge stratification particularly at engine parts load operations. The system was able to diminish the cyclic variations and to expand the limit of lean operation of the engine. The flexibility of gas pulse timing offers the potential advantage of lower emissions and fuel consumption. There are several advantages of port injection. The better possibility CNG engine is to equalize the air-fuel ratio of the cylinders, optimization of the gas injection timing and of the gas pressure for different operating conditions.

40|$|Fuel {{injectors}} {{for marine}} applications have traditionally utilized nozzles with symmetric equispaced orifice configuration. But {{in light of}} the new marine emission legislations the twin nozzle concept has arisen. The twin nozzle differs from the conventional configuration by utilizing two closely spaced orifices to substitute each orifice in the conventional <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Injector</b> manufacturers regard twin nozzle injectors as a promising approach to facilitate stable spray patterns independent of the fuel quantity delivered through the nozzle. If true, injector systems in dual fuel engines can be simplified by reducing the amount of nozzles needed. It is also believed that twin nozzles can improve mixture formation for the combustion process for all diesel applications. This thesis explores the possibility of using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software AVL FIRE to predict the behaviour of L'Orange's twin nozzle during fuel injection. The thesis does not seek to verify and validate the proposed numerical model, but rather perceive an understanding of the overall flow trend in a twin nozzle and how it may outperform a conventional nozzle. The nozzle is represented by a moving grid where the moving part replicates the needle movement. The needle profile is a ramp function. To take cavitation in account the numerical model is a multiphase model, containing three phases (diesel, vapour and air). The twin nozzle injects the fuel into a constant volume filled with air. The chosen turbulence model is the high Reynolds number k-ϵ model. The mass flow and the velocity is found to be greater for the upper injector hole. A vortex in the SAC volume i. e. {{the lower part of the}} nozzle seems to be the reason for this. Cavitation is found to have major effect on internal nozzle flow, especially during opening and closing of the needle. Vapour is formed at sharp injector hole inlets and it travels all the way to the outlets, reducing the effective cross sectional area which the fuel can flow through. In-cylinder pressure and rail pressure is found to have an effect on the nozzle behaviour. It is noted that the numerical model has a discrepancy causing too high air density. This only affects the results obtained downstream of the outlet and not the internal nozzle flow. The twin nozzle is compared to a conventional single orifice nozzle. The proposed numerical model lack certain features making it difficult to explicitly state if the twin nozzle outperforms the conventional nozzle. However, the outlets in the twin nozzle have a smaller vapour fraction than the outlet in the single orifice nozzle. This enhances the effective cross sectional area and might render twin nozzles more effective for injecting larger quantities even if its injector hole dimensions favour pilot injections...|$|E
40|$|Modern diesel {{passenger}} car technology continues to develop rapidly {{in response to}} demanding emissions, performance, refinement, cost and fuel efficiency requirements. This has included the implementation of high pressure common rail fuel systems employing high precision injectors with complex injection strategies, higher hydraulic efficiency <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{and in some cases}} < 100 µm nozzle hole diameters. With the trend towards lower diameter diesel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> holes and reduced cleaning through cavitation with higher hydraulic efficiency nozzles, it is increasingly important to focus on understanding the mechanism of diesel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> deposit formation and growth.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} {{experimental study of}} the structural and mixing characteristics of transverse jets, or jets in crossﬂow (JICF). Hot-wire anemometry, stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV), and acetone planar laser-induced ﬂuorescence (PLIF) measurements were utilized to illuminate and quantify the wind-ward (upstream) jet shear layer instability characteristics {{and their relationship to}} the velocity ﬁeld evolution, as well as the eﬀect of the overall velocity ﬁeld on the scalar ﬁeld distribution and resulting mixingcharacteristics. Transverse jets of various jet-to-crossﬂow momentum ﬂux ratios in the range 41 ≥ J ≥ 2, and jet-to-crossﬂow density ratios in the range 1. 00 ≥ S ≥ 0. 35, were generated using mixtures of helium and nitrogen in the jet ﬂuid. Jets were injected from one of three diﬀerent injectors explored: a convergent nozzle with circular geometry which was mounted ﬂush with the wind tunnel ﬂoor, another convergent nozzle with circular geometry whose exit plane lies above the crossﬂow boundary layer, and a ﬂush-mounted straight pipe injector with a circular oriﬁce. Jet Reynolds number was kept constant {{for the majority of the}} mixing and structural exploration experiments at Rej = 1900, except when the eﬀect of Reynolds number on cross-sectional jet structure was explored. Previous hot-wire based measurements at UCLA suggest that the upstream jet shear layer transitions from convective instability to absolute instability, giving rise to self-excited nonlinear states, as either the momentum ﬂux ratio is lowered below J ≈ 10, or the density ratio is lowered below S ≈ 0. 45 for the JICF injected from the ﬂush <b>nozzle</b> <b>injector.</b> A similar transition to absolute instability when lowering momentum ﬂux ratio was found in this work for the ﬂush-mounted pipe injector. Cross-sectional PLIF measurements in the present studies suggested clear correspondence between the formation of a symmetric counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) and the generation of strong upstream shear layer instability. In contrast, weak, convectively unstable upstream shear layers corresponded with asymmetries in the jet cross-sectional shape and/or lack of a CVP structure. While momentum ﬂux ratio J and density ratio S most signiﬁcantly determined the strength of the instabilities and CVP structures, an additional dependence on jet Reynolds number for CVP formation was found, with signiﬁcant increases in jet Reynolds number resulting in enhanced symmetry and CVP generation. The mixing characteristics of Rej = 1900 jets of various J, S, and injector type were explored in detail in the present studies using jet centerplane and cross-sectional PLIF measurements. Various mixing metrics such as the jet ﬂuid centerline concentration decay, Unmixedness, and Probability Density Function (PDF) were applied systematically using a novel method for comparing jets with diﬀerent mass ﬂux characteristics. It was found that when comparing mixing metrics along the jet trajectory, strengthening the upstream shear layer instability by reducing J, and achieving absolutely unstable conditions, enhanced overall mixing. Reducing density ratio S for larger J values, which under equidensity (S = 1. 00) conditions would create a convectively unstable shear layer, was also observed to enhance mixing. On the other hand, reducing S for low J conditions, which are known to produce absolutely unstable upstream shear layers even for equidensity cases, was actually observed to reduce mixing, a result attributed to a reduction in crossﬂow ﬂuid entrainment into shear layer vortex cores as jet density was reduced. Comparing injectors, the ﬂush-mounted pipe was generally the best mixer, whereas the worst mixer was the nozzle that was elevated above the crossﬂow boundary layer due to upstream shear layer co-ﬂow generated by the elevated nozzle contour; this co-ﬂow was observed here and in prior studies to stabilize the shear layer. The eﬀect of the evolution of the velocity and vorticity ﬁelds on the scalar concentrationﬁeld was studied in more detail using simultaneous PLIF/PIV measurements of the jet centerplane. General correspondence between regions of high vorticity/strain and high scalar dissipation rate was found. Moreover, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis of both scalar and velocity ﬁelds suggested that transition to absolute instability with J reduction dominated the scalar ﬁeld evolution near the jet exit, consistent with the mixing results. However, time-varying and/or three-dimensional eﬀects resulted in scalar diﬀusion layer-normal strain rates extracted from PIV measurements to be consistently higher than that calculated from PLIF-based extraction of scalar dissipation rate data for strained advection-diﬀusion layers in the scalar ﬁeld. Nevertheless, trends in PIV-based strain ﬁeld evolution and PLIF-based scalar dissipation rate evolution along the upstream shear layers were generally consistent with one another, and diﬀerences in the magnitudes of wind-ward and lee-side strain rates provided evidence for associated diﬀerences in jet wind-ward and lee-side ignition processes in the presence of a reaction...|$|E

Falcon was a $124 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project led by Lockheed Martin. Sacramento, Calif.-based Aerojet {{was awarded a}} $15 million subcontract to the project and passed along much of the engine research work to Pyrodyne. Pyrodyne designed the flow line of the engines, the geometrical shape of the engine's air inlet, combustors, fuel <b>nozzles</b> and <b>injectors.</b> Pyrodyne also built {{a model of the}} engine for testing.|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{engine fuel}} {{injector}} faults {{can lead to}} reduced power, increased fuel consumption and greater exhaust emission levels and if left unchecked, can eventually lead to premature engine failure. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the Diesel, or compression ignition combustion process, and of the two basic fuel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs used in Diesel engines, namely, the pintle-type and hole-type nozzles. Also described are some common faults associated with these two types of fuel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles</b> and the techniques previously used to experimentally simulate these faults. This paper also presents a recent experimental campaign undertaken using two different diesel engines whereby various fuel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> faults were induced into the engines. The first series of tests was undertaken using a turbo-charged 5. 9 litre; Cummins Diesel engine whist the second series of tests was undertaken using a naturally aspirated 4 cylinder, 2. 216 litre, Perkins Diesel engine. Data corresponding to different injector fault conditions was captured using in-cylinder pressure, and acoustic emission transducers along with both crank-angle encoder and top-dead centre reference signals. Using averaged in-cylinder pressure signals, it was possible to qualify the severity of the faults whilst averaged acoustic emission signals were in turn, used as the basis for wavelets decomposition. Initial observations from this signal decomposition are also presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of scramjet combustor performance enhancement by reducing the skin friction through boundary layer combustion. Experiments were conducted in the T 4 Stalker tube to investigate the influence of boundary layer thickness and entropy layers on the ignition of a hydrogen air mixture near {{the wall of a}} constant area duct. The hydrogen was injected tangentially from a slot of annular cross section after an “injector ” of constant area captured flow from a Mach 4 <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Injectors</b> of two different lengths and nose radii were employed to vary the thickness of the boundary layer at the injection lo-cation as well as the temperature of the gas near the walls and within the entropy layer created by the leading edge shocks of blunted leading edges. Results are presented of CFD simula-tions of the injector as well as experimentally measured pres-sure coefficient profiles along the combustor wall. It is shown that a thicker boundary layer will promote combustion but that heating the gas near the walls through a leading edge shock is more effective for ignition. However, the shocks generated by the leading edge may also influence the core flow of the constant area combustor and possibly cause some main stream mixing...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed to visualize the fuel distribution from an air-assisted GDI injector in a constant volume spray chamber. In the air-assisted injector, fuel droplet breakup occurs as the droplets are accelerated by the expanded air flow passing out through the <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>injector</b> design allows for two distinct modes of operation: stratified (low load) and homogenous (full load). Therefore, measurements were taken at back-pressure and temperature settings corresponding to both low and full loads, to investigate the influence of these variables on fuel distribution, droplet sizes and velocities in the two modes. Results from PDA measurements show {{that most of the}} droplet break-up occurs inside the nozzle. Downstream of the nozzle, rates of break-up and evaporation are low. The cause of the low breakup and evaporation rates downstream of the nozzle {{is believed to be the}} low relative velocity between the liquid fuel and the surrounding cold air jet. The fuel distribution has been visualized qualitatively by simultaneous MIE and LIF measurements with two intensified digital cameras in combination with a 266 nm YAG-laser...|$|R
