PLAMAR identified 209,419 ha's under cultivation that had drainage problems; however, regions under irrigation (169,302 ha) did not show evidence of drainage nor salinity problems.

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Cora Weiss, co-drafter of {{what became}} UN Security Council Resolution 1325, noted in 2011 {{that the purpose}} of {{eliminating}} conflict-related sexualised violence must not be to ‘make war safe for women’. UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and subsequent resolutions should not legitimise or normalise war, but rather the agenda should support the demilitarisation of society and facilitate the development of anti-militarist politics of peace. This article explores the translation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 into <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> in a number of countries actively involved in contemporary conflict to investigate how these <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> produce particular gendered logics of peace and security. This article finds, first, that ‘outward-facing’ <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans,</b> such as those produced by the USA, the UK and Australia, tend to focus on making ‘war safe for women’ rather than demilitarisation strategies; and, second, that this limited interpretation of Women Peace and Security principles is reinforced by the representation of war and insecurity ‘overseas’ rather than within the national context...|$|R
25|$|With {{the end of}} the hostilities, 11,664 LTTE members, {{including}} 595 {{child soldiers}} surrendered to the Sri Lankan military. Approximately 150 hardcore LTTE cadres and 1,000 mid-level cadres escaped to India. The government took action to rehabilitate the surrendered cadres under a <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> for the Re-integration of Ex-combatants while allegations of torture, rape, and murder were reported by international human rights bodies. They were divided into three categories; hardcore, non-combatants, and those who were forcibly recruited (including child soldiers). Twenty-four rehabilitation centres were set up in Jaffna, Batticaloa, and Vavuniya. Among the apprehended cadres, there had been about 700 hardcore members. Some of these cadres were integrated into State Intelligence Services to tackle the internal and external networks of LTTE. By August 2011, government had released more than 8,000 cadres, and 2,879 remained.|$|E

25|$|In May 2012, Brazil's ICMBio {{formulated}} {{and published}} a 5-year <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> (PAN) for conservation and reestablishment {{of the species}} in the wild. Highlights of the plan are to increase the captive population to 150 specimens (expected by 2020), build a breeding facility in Brazil within the Spix's native habitat, acquire and restore additional portions of its range, and prepare for its release into the wild between 2017 and 2021. Pursuant to the plan, in 2012, the Brazilian government established NEST, a private aviary near Avaré, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil as a breeding and staging center for eventual release of the Spix into the wild. Birds formerly housed at the Sao Paulo Zoo as well as Loro Parque Foundation and other conservation organizations were relocated to NEST. The Spix's at NEST are owned by the Brazilian government and managed by Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation.|$|E

As both the demand and supply of trafficked children are transboundary in scope, international cooperation {{may be necessary to}} mitigate cross-country externalities. We show that specialization is the main feature of international cooperation. We also show that the pattern of specialization depends only on the level of economic development of state-parties. In particular, specialization leads to asymmetric <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> when state-parties have different levels of economic development: the governments of poorer countries specialize on fighting the supply of trafficked children from their territories, while the governments of richer countries specialize on fighting the demand arising within their territories...|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} Resolution 1325 launched, the Security Council began {{encouraging}} {{the development of}} <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> (NAPs) as a tool that member states could use to detail steps that they will take to fulfill the resolution's objectives. As of September 2016, 63 countries have adopted such plans. NAPs address political, social, and human security policies and often require interagency coordination. Many donor country NAPs tend to be externally focused, outlining and documenting their commitments to promoting Resolution 1325's principles in focal countries; developing and conflict-affected countries generally use NAPs to support women's internal participation in politics and peace processes, as well as outline internal commitments on protection from sexual and gender-based violence. Currently, Europe (27) and Africa (19) are the regions with {{the highest number of}} <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plans.</b> While the number of NAP countries rapidly increased in the lead up to both the 10th (in 2010) and 15th (in 2015) anniversaries of Resolution 1325, only 32% of UN member states have implemented NAPs. A major gap is in troop contributing countries (TCC) and police contributing countries (PCC) to peacekeeping missions—the top four countries providing police, military experts, and troops do not yet have <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E

The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not even exist at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave Perry said that Canada's lack of a <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a <b>national</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out.
