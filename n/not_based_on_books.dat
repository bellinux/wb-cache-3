40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{translation}} from Persian into Italian and English {{of an ancient}} Persian epic called Shahname, or literally “The Book of Kings,” by Ferdosi, first published in the 11 th century CE. The translation proposed, however, is <b>not</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the original <b>book</b> by Ferdosi, which is written all in verse, but rather, an edited, shorter, and simplified version written in prose, by Mohamad Hosseini, first published in 2013. Nonetheless, in his version, Hosseini included some of the verses from the original poems {{in order to show}} the value and the beauty of Ferdosi’s writing. Many translations of Ferdosi’s book have been made into English, but only one translation has been made into Italian, by one Italo Pizzi, in 8 volumes, all in verse, in 1886. This thesis analyses and discusses the choices made for the two translations presented into English and Italian. My project is not only to propose translations of Hosseini’s version, but to also introduce the reader to the Persian culture, and {{to the life of the}} most famous Iranian epic writer, Ferdosi, and his masterpiece, Shahname...|$|R
