Norwegian citizens who plan activities in Queen Maud Land must therefore {{report to the}} Norwegian Polar Institute, which may prohibit any <b>non-compliant</b> activity. Those who visit Queen Maud Land must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|Due to his doping ban, he {{was barred}} from the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, {{and much of the}} European racing circuit, from 2006 to 2012. The Court of Arbitration for Sport {{overturned}} his lifetime Olympic ban, deeming it <b>non-compliant</b> with the World Anti-Doping Code, and he competed in the 2012 London Olympics. He produced a ghost-written autobiography with writer Ken Scott, Race Against Me, in 2009. He is of Afro-Caribbean- Jamaican descent and has two sons with his partner Leonie Daley.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, the Obama Administration {{announced}} a transitional relief {{program that would}} let states and carriers allow <b>non-compliant</b> individual and small group policies to renew {{at the end of}} 2013. In March 2014, HHS allowed renewals as late as October 1, 2016. In February 2016, these plans were allowed to renew up until October 1, 2017, but with a termination date no later than December 31, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner), Danielle's {{best friend}} in Walford, is also deeply {{affected}} by the incident, which triggers her bipolar disorder. She becomes <b>non-compliant</b> with her medication, has sex with Ryan, and is raped and attacked by Archie at the launderette. She believes both men are planning to kill her and is involuntarily committed to hospital, where she befriends Becca Swanson (Simone James). Upon her return to Walford along with Becca, Stacey restarts a relationship with Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) when he rejects his girlfriend Syd Chambers (Nina Toussaint-White) for her.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{received}} criticism {{after an}} incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro line following the 2012 WWDC. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors {{instead of the}} newer E5 series. The line also lacked then-current technologies like SATA III, USB 3, and Thunderbolt, the last {{of which had been}} added to every other Macintosh at that point. An email from Apple CEO Tim Cook promised a more significant update to the line in 2013. Apple stopped shipping the first-generation Mac Pro in Europe on March 1, 2013 after an amendment to a safety regulation left the professional Mac <b>non-compliant.</b> The last day to order was February 18, 2013. The first generation Mac Pro was removed from Apple's online store following unveiling of the redesigned second generation Mac Pro at a media event on October 22, 2013.|$|E
5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a <b>non-compliant</b> display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Brazil {{became the}} world's first country to ban all flavored tobacco, {{including}} menthols. It also banned {{the majority of}} the estimated 600 additives used, permitting only eight. This regulation applies to domestic and internationally imported cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers had 18 months to remove the <b>non-compliant</b> cigarettes, 24 months to remove the other forms of <b>non-compliant</b> tobacco.|$|E

25|$|In February 2007, Australia {{enacted a}} law that will, in effect, by legislating {{efficiency}} standards, disallow most sales of incandescent light bulbs by 2010. The Australian Federal Government announced minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for lighting products. The new minimum standard efficiency level is 15 lumens per watt (lm/W). From November 2008, no <b>non-compliant</b> lighting (including some incandescent globes) were imported into Australia, and from November 2009, the retail sale of <b>non-compliant</b> lighting was banned.|$|E

25|$|An initial {{request for}} {{proposal}} (RFP) to build the NBN was issued but not proceeded with. Those organisations lodging compliant proposals {{were not able to}} meet the requirements nor able to raise the necessary capital. A <b>non-compliant</b> proposal was received from Telstra and they were excluded from consideration.|$|E
25|$|Care in {{choice of}} {{medicine}} by the prescribing physician, along with {{and the provision}} of greater information to the patient can improve compliance. For example, patients taking typical antipsychotics tend to experience more severe side-effects, and also receive less information about their illness, medicines and side-effects. They were naturally more likely to be <b>non-compliant</b> than those receiving atypicals.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the NFL {{issued a}} new helmet rule stating that players {{will no longer}} be allowed to use {{alternate}} helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become <b>non-compliant.</b> The team instead decided to wear their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving, which has since become an annual tradition. For 2017, the team will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{countries}} have an informal sector representing {{an average of}} around 40%, perhaps up to 60% in some. Informal sectors feature many small informal traders {{who may not be}} efficient in bringing into the tax net, since the cost of collection is high and revenue potential limited (although there are broader governance benefits). There is also an issue of <b>non-compliant</b> companies who are 'hard to tax', evading taxes and should be brought into the tax net.|$|E
25|$|Barcode {{verification}} examines scanability and {{the quality}} of the barcode in comparison to industry standards and specifications. Barcode verifiers are primarily used by businesses that print and use barcodes. Any trading partner in the supply chain can test barcode quality. It is important to verify a barcode to ensure that any reader in the supply chain can successfully interpret a barcode with a low error rate. Retailers levy large penalties for <b>non-compliant</b> barcodes. These chargebacks can reduce a manufacturer's revenue by 2% to 10%.|$|E
25|$|When a halogen {{headlamp}} is retrofitted with an HID bulb, light distribution and output are altered. In the United States, vehicle lighting {{that does not}} conform to FMVSS 108 is not street legal. Glare will be produced and the headlamp's type approval or certification becomes invalid with the altered light distribution, so the headlamp is no longer street-legal in some locales. In the US, suppliers, importers and vendors that offer <b>non-compliant</b> kits are subject to civil fines. By October 2004, the NHTSA had investigated 24 suppliers and all resulted in termination of sale or recalls.|$|E
25|$|Candidates for the Maritime Helicopter Project {{consisted}} of Sikorsky's S-92 Superhawk, NHIndustries NH-90, and AgustaWestland's EH-101. The DND subsequently {{decided that the}} NH-90 was <b>non-compliant</b> with requirements and thus was eliminated from the contest, despite rumours that the NH-90 had all but won the contest months before. The NH-90's apparent reversal of favour {{may be seen as}} politically motivated, as Canada was keen on improving industrial relations with France. Other factors indicated that the DND had valid reasons to reject the NH-90, such as size, which had influenced the project from the outset.|$|E
25|$|Tin is {{corrosion}} resistant, but acidic food like {{fruits and}} vegetables can corrode the tin layer. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200mg/kg of tin. A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested cans contained below the UK regulatory limit of 200mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to {{the increased use of}} fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers. The two <b>non-compliant</b> products were voluntarily recalled.|$|E
25|$|Since {{enforcement}} of the act began in July 1992, it has quickly become {{a major component of}} employment law. The ADA allows private plaintiffs to receive only injunctive relief (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys' fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue <b>non-compliant</b> businesses. Unless a state law, such as the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs, persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ADA.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{air sacs}} {{found within the}} {{respiratory}} system {{are those of the}} post-thoracic region, while the others decrease in size respectively, the interclavicular (unpaired), abdominal, pre-thoracic, and lateral clavicular sacs. The adult common ostrich lung lacks connective tissue known as interparabronchial septa, which render strength to the <b>non-compliant</b> avian lung in other bird species. Due to this the lack of connective tissue surrounding the parabronchi and adjacent parabronchial lumen, they exchange blood capillaries or avascular epithelial plates. Like mammals, ostrich lungs contain an abundance of type II cells at gas exchange sites; an adaptation for preventing lung collapse during slight volume changes.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of her best friend Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), Stacey begins {{behaving}} erratically. She steals money from her family, sleeps with various men on the go and becomes a heavy drinker. She is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but is <b>non-compliant</b> with her medication and becomes paranoid, experiencing hallucinations. Stacey starts sleeping with Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) and is raped by Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). She believes that they are both planning to kill her. After attacking Archie with a broken glass and accusing her friends and family of planning to hurt her, Stacey is involuntarily committed to hospital, where she befriends Becca Swanson (Simone James).|$|E
25|$|This {{determination}} {{affects the}} entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the examination accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient tests and audit procedures (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, the auditor greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk auditees, to ensure their opinion is correct. For low-risk auditees, the auditor is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a low-risk recipient may still have compliance issues. Conversely, a high-risk determination doesn't mean the recipient is <b>non-compliant,</b> just that they're more likely to be.|$|E
25|$|Jeremy Sonnenfeld of Sioux Falls, S.D. made bowling {{history on}} February 2, 1997 {{when he became}} the first person ever to roll three {{certified}} perfect games in a three-game set, or a 900 series. Sonnenfeld was not the first person to shoot a 900 series, but his was the first recognized by ABC. Former PBA bowler Glenn Allison submitted the first-ever 900 series for award consideration, when he accomplished the feat on July 1, 1982. But the ABC refused to certify the score, citing <b>non-compliant</b> lane conditions. ABC/USBC has relaxed their criteria for certifying scores in the past few years, leading many bowling fans to believe that Allison's 900 would have easily been sanctioned under today's rules and procedures.|$|E
25|$|Brazil, {{which had}} been using mostly Europlugs, and NEMA 1–15 and NEMA 5–15 standards, adopted a (<b>non-compliant)</b> variant of IEC 60906-1 as the {{national}} standard in 1998 under specification NBR14136 (revised in 2002). These are used for both 220 volt and 127 volt regions of the country, despite the IEC 60906-2 recommendation that NEMA 5-15 be used for 120V connections. There {{are two types of}} sockets and plugs in NBR 14136: one for 10A, with a 4.0mm pin diameter, and another for 20A, with a 4.8mm pin diameter. This differs from IEC 60906-1 which specifies a pin diameter of 4.5mm and a rating of 16A. NBR 14136 was not enforced in that country until 2007, when its adoption was made optional for manufacturers. It became compulsory on January 1, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a <b>non-compliant</b> son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis was {{the leading}} cause of death in Europe and North America in the 19th century, {{accounting}} for about 40% of working-class deaths in cities, and by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by tuberculosis. European governments, and medical professionals in Canada, were well aware that tuberculosis and smallpox were highly contagious, and that deaths could be prevented by taking measures to quarantine patients and inhibit the spread of the disease. They failed to do this, however, and imposed laws that in fact ensured that these deadly diseases spread quickly among the indigenous population. Despite the high death rate among students from contagious disease, in 1920 the Canadian government made attendance at residential schools mandatory for native children, threatening <b>non-compliant</b> parents with fines and imprisonment. John S. Milloy argued that these policies regarding disease were not conventional genocide, but rather policies of neglect aimed at assimilating natives.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} Y2K-related {{problems}} occurring before 1 January 2000, {{even though the}} 2000 financial year commenced in 1999 in many jurisdictions, and {{a wide range of}} forward-looking calculations involved dates in 2000 and later years. Estimates undertaken in the leadup to 2000 suggested that around 25% of all problems should have occurred before 2000. Critics of large-scale remediation argued during 1999 that the absence of significant reported problems in <b>non-compliant</b> small firms was evidence that there had been, and would be, no serious problems needing to be fixed in any firm, and that the scale of the problem had therefore been severely overestimated. However, this can be countered with the observation that large companies had significant problems requiring action, that Y2K programmers were fully aware of the variable timescale, and that they were working to a series of earlier target dates, rather than a single fixed target of 31 December 1999.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{reason why}} people with {{diabetes}} develop high blood pressure is hardening of the arteries. Diabetes tends {{to speed up the}} process of atherosclerosis. The other fact about diabetes is that it affects both large and small blood vessels in the body. Over time, blood vessels become clogged with fatty depots, become <b>non-compliant</b> and lose their elasticity. The process of atherosclerosis is a lot faster in diabetic individuals whom do not have good control of their blood sugars. The high blood pressure eventually leads to heart failure, strokes, heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, loss of libido and poor circulation of blood in the legs. When the blood supply to the feet is compromised, the chances of infections and amputations also increases. All diabetics should know that even mild elevations in blood pressure can be detrimental to health. Studies have shown that diabetics with even a slight elevation in blood pressure have 2-3 times {{the risk of heart disease}} compared to individuals without diabetes.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, the European Court of Justice {{ruled against}} Ireland {{regarding}} septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. It deemed Ireland <b>non-compliant</b> with Articles 4 and 8 of the Waste Directive {{in relation to}} domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside. Ireland was fined €2million and the court imposed daily fines of €12,000 for each day of delay in achieving compliance. Central to ending the case against Ireland was establishing a national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems. In 2012, the government passed the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, which provided for a new inspection system and which would require owners of septic tanks and other on-site treatment systems to register their systems. A new registration and inspection regime was introduced in June 2012. By July 2013, almost 90% of owners of premises connected with such systems had registered their systems. The government also announced details of a grant scheme for remedial work on a septic system.|$|E
25|$|As per Regulation No 539/2001 (amended by Regulation No 1289/2013) {{reciprocity}} {{is required}} from all Annex II countries and territories. That means that these countries must offer visa-free access for 90 days to all EU citizens (except citizens of Ireland and the United Kingdom) {{and to the}} citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. When this is not the case, the affected EU or Schengen member state is expected to notify the European Commission. Starting six months after the notification, the Commission may adopt an implementing act to suspend the visa-free regime for certain categories of nationals of the third country concerned, for a period of up to six months, with a possible prolongation by further periods of up to six months. If the Commission decides not to adopt such an act, it has to present a report explaining the reasons why it did not propose the measure. If after two years from the notification the third country is still requiring visas from citizens of one or more Member States, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act to re-impose the visa obligation on all citizens of the third country, for a period of 12 months. Either the European Parliament or the Council could oppose the entry into force of the delegated acts. All of the states that implement the common visa rules – including Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania – may notify the European Commission about <b>non-compliant</b> third states.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface tension}} of a watery surface (the {{water-air}} interface) {{tends to make}} that surface shrink. When that surface is curved {{as it is in}} the alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse. This has three effects. Firstly the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or <b>non-compliant).</b> Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a greater tendency to collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of exhalation that at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation. This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.|$|E
