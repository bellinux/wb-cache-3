40|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, these {{scenarios are}} of two types: fixed form (manually developed) and parameter driven (expert system) For the fixed form scenarios, users need only select the scenario, and the transaction procedure is determined. For parameter driven scenarios, a user-dialog {{is needed to}} determine the situational characteristics. As with other aspects of contract negotiation, this will proceed from one party to another in an offer, counteroffer, acceptance sequence. Once this dialog is complete, the inference engine will assemble the trade scenario. Concluding Remarks A design and pilot implementation of a system, called InterProcs, supporting electronic contracting has been presented. A key concept in the design of this system is the notion of electronic trade scenarios (or procedures), which are generic may be downloaded by the trading parties for a particular transaction. These scenarios may be fixed in structure, with simple parameter substitution, or they may also be designed to be customizable, within a certain range of flexibility, {{depending on the type of}} transaction. This system, at present, has mainly been used for creating pilot models to demonstrate the usefulness and feasibility of electronic trade scenarios. These pilot applications models for an electronic <b>negotiable</b> <b>bill</b> of lading, the port community of Rotterdam, and international trade transaction models (in collaboration with the International Trade Procedures Working Group of the United Nations). Though electronic trade scenarios have not yet appeared in actual commercial practice, we have observed that as electronic commerce turns more towards the needs for business-to-business transactions, interest in these concepts is growing quickly. We look forward to further commercial experimentation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{electronic}} revolution, the tendency of full implementation {{of electronic}} communication {{in the field of}} shipping and transport sector (logistic sector), is a fact that not surprise us at all. Process of replacing hard copy communication with electronic shipping communication has undergone a great expansion. The use of EDI systems in all industrial branches, including transport and shipping industry, create great innovations, and are treated as a major benefit for the international mass and fast transfer of goods. Digitalization in the field of trade, transport and logistic operator’s contributes to reducing paper costs, reducing timeline for transport route, and simplification of analysis and storage of transport and trade documents. Despite these efficiencies and convenience, until recently, electronic documentation in the field of transport was not covered by an international convention. Today, this subject has been covered by many international regulations, but business practice still shows doubt regarding the reliability of electronic transfer of property of the goods. This is especially case {{when it comes to the}} <b>negotiable</b> <b>bill</b> of lading as a document of title in the sea transport. Based on the concept of transfer bill of lading, three systems are created and: SeaDocs Registry Limited (SeaDocs), Bolero - Bill of Lading Electronic Registry Organisation, Global trade system TM. The purpose of this article is to analyze and elaborate each of these systems individually, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Throught study of these systems, the author’s goal is to prove the justification of bill of lading as electronic transport document in which property rights on the goods are incorporate. More accurately, is there a place for full implementation of electronic bill of lading in the area of maritime transport (hereafter E/B/L). What is the degree of the risk from using E/B/L whit respect to ownership of the goods?! Finally, which of the existing systems of electronic transport can be trusted the most?!...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} limits on contractual freedom in corporate bonds issues pursuant to the recent corporate law reform. First part of the paper studies the procedure of corporate bonds issuing provided the traditional Italian double limit regarding companies allowed to the issuance and the measure of it. The legal choice to maintain a cap to the issuing of bonds is critically reviewed, {{especially with regard to}} the case whether this maximum amount may be exceeded thanks to selected institutional investors (under control of the authorities in charge), who undertake the issue and guarantee the punctual and due final cash settlement towards those retail investors who are not sophisticated. This peculiar obligation of institutional investors is compared as well with a similar rule provided for small corporations (i. e. s. r. l., art. 2473, civil code), in order to demonstrate that it is a specific kind of accountability for someone else debt, different from a liability for violation of intermediary duties but even different both from the warranty for debtor’s solvency guaranteed to the transferee by the transferor of a credit (art. 1265, civil code) and from the liability of the transferor of a <b>negotiable</b> <b>bill</b> by endorsement. Institutional investors liability pursuant to art. 2412, 2 par., civil code is due to their choice to give up a restrictive selling policy in favour of a retail offer: this determines who, to whom and to what extent institutional investors may be liable. The paper also points out in what way this case is diverse from the selling restrictions the issuer or the lead manager endow for the offer of bonds. Second part of the essay is involved in the various kind of corporate bonds, even with some comparison with French, German, UK and US law. The aim is to clarify how many different negotiable instruments similar to the bonds may be ruled pursuant to the new art. 2411 civil code and not pursuant to the new rules provided for so called “strumenti finanziari partecipativi” by art. 2346, 2351 civil code. The standard used is the one of “repayable funds under the legal and contractual conditions applicable” used to describe the business of taking repayable funds exceptionally allowed to persons different from credit institutions. This means {{a different point of view}} of the usual coincidence between bonds and sum to be repaid as provide for mortgage. Securities similar to bonds and ruled as bonds are identified trough the examination of those kinds expressly described by the law, with special regard to those whose final cash settlement is influenced by corporate losses or profits. Moreover the paper examines the chance to deem as bonds some peculiar securities repayable with reference to an index, or only in a winding up of the company, or with commodities other than money. The category of debentures in this way set forth is finally reconsidered in the prospective of securities and markets regulations, where the aim of the law may differ from corporate law and so lead to rearrange this category...|$|E

40|$|It is said among historians, {{that there}} are two {{remarkable}} innovations in modern finance: deposit banking in southern Europe and <b>negotiable</b> <b>bills</b> in northern Europe, especially Antwerp. Although <b>negotiable</b> <b>bills</b> are as important as deposit banking (because they became a foundation of modern commercial banking and stock markets), they are not often studied. Part I of the thesis studies indirect loan contracts which do not rely on either bank-specific technologies or legal protection. It focuses on the concept of negotiability and explains its characteristics, including the substitutability of deposit banking and <b>negotiable</b> <b>bills.</b> <b>Negotiable</b> <b>bills,</b> or resaleable bills, can be interpreted as an indirect loan contract. The buyer of the bill, i. e. the initial lender, can re-sell the bill to a third party to satisfy his liquidity needs. So the initial issuer of the bill borrows from a third party, through the initial lender (acting as an intermediary). Previous studies have focused on direct loan contracts: between banks and borrowers, depositors and banks, or suppliers and buyers. There are few papers studying the incentive problems faced by all three players. To fill this gap, in Chapter Two, we study indirect loan contracts that a lender and a borrower can make only through an intermediary agent, where the borrower and the lender cannot observe any transaction between the other two. Under this severe information asymmetry, the existence of loan contracts as a sequential equilibrium is proved, although they are less efficient compared with direct loan contracts. In Chapter Three, we consider role of collateral in improving efficiency. Chapter Four concludes, summarising the characteristics of these contracts: only less risky borrowers can issue <b>negotiable</b> <b>bills</b> and riskier borrowers need to seek a direct relationship with lenders (or, they are rationed). In the 1990 s, the Japanese economy experienced a prolonged recession, the so-called ’lost decade’. It is discussed that a cause of the problem was the ”zombie lending” problem: chronic loss-making firms (zombies) still obtained finance from their banks. Part II of the thesis aims to address the following issues with a microeconomic model. Firstly, why did banks not liquidate bankrupt borrowers? Secondly, how did it affect macroeconomic productivity? And thirdly, how did it affect the procyclicality of land prices as in Kiyotaki and Moore(1997) ’s credit cycle? A bank, in this model, has an incentive not to liquidate insolvent borrowers: the liquidation of collateral asset (land) will invite the collapse of land market and the bank has to bear a large loss. The loss may make the bank under-capitalised and force it to close its business. The bank, to avoid the forced closure, does not liquidate insolvent borrowers. This ”zombie borrowers” occupy their land unused, and the bank can squeeze land supply to push up land price: the bank’s own capital is then kept higher than it should be. In the final chapter, based on this model, optimal post-crisis policies are discussed by comparing two options; public capital injection and toxic asset purchasing scheme.

40|$|The basic {{thesis is}} that the modern 'financial revolution', usually dated to eighteenth century England, but far more {{properly}} to the sixteenth-century Netherlands, in terms of those institutions for both government finance (borrowing) and international finance (bills of exchange), owed its essential origins to the impediments of Church and State that reached their harmful fruition in the later thirteenth and early fourteenth century. The major obstacle {{that came from the}} Church was of course the usury doctrine, and more accurately the final evolution of this doctrine in Scholastic theology and canon law, along with the intensification of the campaign against usury in the thirteenth century. The major obstacles that the State provided, with the spreading stain of ever more disruptive international warfare from the 1290 s, was the development of nationalistic bullionist philosophies and of monetary-fiscal policies (to finance warfare) that hindered the international flow of specie in later medieval Europe. For public borrowing, one must begin with the contentious policies of Venice, Florence, and other Italian city states in basing their finances on forced loans, which did pay interest, and thus with the usury controversies that erupted, over not just the loans, but the sale of interest-bearing debt certificates in secondary markets. The alternative solution, found elsewhere - first in Flemish towns from the 1270 s [...] and one that would govern European public finance up to the nineteenth century, was to raise funds for urban governments through the sale of rentes, for one or more lifetimes (lijfrenten, erfelijkrenten). These were not loans, and hence they were not usurious, because the buyer of rentes had no expectation of repayment (unless the government chose to redeem them); instead they represented the purchase of a future stream of income, either lifetime or perpetual (heritable). Those rentiers who sought to regain some part of their invested capital had only one recourse: to seek out buyers in secondary markets. The true efficiency of modern public finance also rested upon the development of such markets and thus upon the development of full-fledged negotiablity; and public finance also depends upon satisfactory instruments to permit low risk, low cost international remittances. The solution to both problems lay {{in the development of the}} <b>negotiable</b> <b>bill</b> of exchange. Such bills, at first non-negotiable, emerged in the late thirteenth century as a response to circumvent not only the usury doctrine (to 'disguise' interest payments in the exchange rate) but also the almost universal bans on bullion exports. Yet another barrier that medieval English merchants faced was the virtual absence of deposit-banking because of the crown's strict monopoly on the coinage and money supply, so that the usual origin of such banking, in private money-changing, was unavailable. Although English merchants sought remedies by using transferable commercial bills, they were not truly negotiable, for they had no legal standing in Common Law courts. But from the late thirteenth century, the Crown was incorporating the then evolving international Law Merchant into statutory law, and it also established law merchant courts, which did give such financial instruments some legal standing. In 1437, a London law-merchant court was the first, in Europe, to establish the principle that the bearer of a bill of exchange, on its maturity, had full rights to sue the 'acceptor' or payer, on whom it was drawn, for full payment and to receive compensation for damages. From that precedent, and then from those provided by similar law-merchant court verdicts in Antwerp and Bruges (1507, 1527), the Estates General of the Habsburg Low Countries (1537 - 1541) produced Europe's first national legislation to ensure the full legal requirements of true negotiability - including the right to sue intervening assignees to whom bills had been transferred in payment. These Estates-General also legalized interest payments (up to 12 %), thus permitting open discounting, another obviously essential feature of modern finance, private and public. Antwerp itself, with the foundation of its Bourse in 1531, became the international financial capital of Europe, especially as a secondary market in national rentes - the very instrument that became the foundation of English public finance, in the form of annuities, from the 1690 s. ...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{thesis of}} this article is that the {{essential}} origins of the modern ‘financial revolution’ were the late-medieval responses, civic and mercantile, to financial impediments from both Church and State, concerning the usury doctrine, that reached their harmful fruition in the later thirteenth and early fourteenth century. That ‘financial revolution’, in terms of those national institutions for government borrowing and international finance, involving negotiable securities, in the form of annuities or rentes, and bills of exchange, is generally thought to have originated in eighteenth century England; but as James Tracy has earlier shown it first took place, on a fully national basis, in the sixteenth-century Habsburg Netherlands. The major obstacle from the Church was of course the usury doctrine, and more accurately the final evolution of this doctrine in Scholastic theology and canon law, along with the intensification of the campaign against usury from the early thirteenth century. The major obstacles that the State provided, with the spreading stain of ever more disruptive international warfare from the 1280 s, were the nationalistic bullionist philosophies and related monetary-fiscal policies (to finance warfare) that together hindered the international flow of specie in later medieval Europe.

The alternative solution, found elsewhere – first in northern French towns from the 1220 s [...] and one that would govern European public finance up to the nineteenth century, was to raise funds for urban governments through the sale of rentes, both life-rents (one or two lives) and hereditary or perpetual rents. These were not in fact loans but annuities, and hence they were not usurious, because the buyer of such rentes had no expectation of repayment (unless the government chose to redeem them); instead they represented the purchase of a continuous future stream of income (for at least one lifetime). Those rentiers who sought to regain some part of their invested capital had only one recourse: to seek out buyers in secondary markets.

50|$|In the {{carriage}} of goods by sea, air or land, goods may be lost, damaged or deteriorated. The bill of lading (transport document used almost exclusively for {{carriage of goods}} by sea) is a contract of carriage between the consignor, the carrier and consignee that acts as a receipt of transfer of goods and as a <b>negotiable</b> instrument. The <b>bill</b> of lading also determines rights and liabilities agreed between parties to an international sale contract. Also reservations as to {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods are marked on the bill when accepting goods so as to stifle any accusations from the consignee of damage in transit. The consignor retains ownership of the goods until the bill of lading is transferred to the consignee. Most bills of lading today are governed by international conventions such as the Hague Rules (International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading); Hague-Visby Rules, which is a revised version of the Hague Rules by a Brussels Protocol in 1968; and Hamburg Rules. These rules impose minimum responsibilities and liabilities that cannot be softened by contract. On the other hand, the United States and the United Kingdom adopted the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).|$|R
40|$|The {{carriage}} {{of goods}} by sea starts off with a contract of carriage, an essentially simple and straightforward contract between two parties, the shipper and the carrier. Very often, however, a bill of lading is issued and a third party appears on the scene: the holder {{of the bill of}} lading. The holder was not involved in the making of the contract of carriage, but does have rights, and possibly obligations, against the carrier at destination. The holder of the bill of lading is entitled to claim delivery and has title to sue the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods, but he can also be liable to pay freight or other costs. The question then is how the third party holder of the bill acquires those rights and obligations. The thesis analyzes the different theories that have been proposed to explain the position of the third party holder. In doing so, a distinction is made between contractual theories and non-contractual theories. The former try to explain the holder's position by building on the initial contract of carriage and applying contract law mechanisms. The latter, although obviously not denying the existence of the contract of carriage, construe the position of the third party holder independently. Within the group of contractual theories, there is a further distinction to be made between those theories that have the holder succeed to all of the shipper's rights and obligations and thus have the holder step into the shoes of the shipper, and the theories that see the holder's position as contractual but independent, and thus not necessarily identical to the position of the shipper. Within the first group (contractual, identical position) agency, assignment and novation are looked at. The second group (contractual, non-identical position) includes the third party beneficiary clause, multi-party contracts and accession, and direct contracts between the carrier and the holder. The third group (statutory) includes the bill of lading as a quasi-contract, statutes explicitly or implicitly dealing with the holder's position, the bill of lading as a <b>negotiable</b> instrument, the <b>bill</b> of lading as a voluntary engagement and the bill of lading as part of the Lex Maritima. Following the analysis and appraisal of the different theories, the case is made that the position of the third party holder of the bill of lading is not obvious or self-evident; the question what the holder's position is needs to be asked and answered. It is further argued that, al-though it is easy to understand why contractual approaches were initially chosen and are still preferred, they are nevertheless not the best possible solution. It is submitted that a statutory approach to the position of the holder of the bill of lading has advantages and would be preferable...|$|R
