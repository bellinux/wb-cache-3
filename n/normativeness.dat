40|$|The {{present study}} {{is the first to}} {{disentangle}} the genetic and environmental influences on personality profile stability. Spanning a period of 10 years, we analyzed the etiology of 3 aspects of profile stability (overall profile stability, distinctive profile stability, and profile <b>normativeness)</b> using self- and peer reports from 539 identical and 280 fraternal twins reared together. This 3 -wave multirater twin design allowed us to estimate the genetic and environmental effects on latent true scores of the 3 aspects of profile stability while controlling for method effects and random error. Consistent biometric results were only found for profile <b>normativeness,</b> whereas overall and distinctive profile stability scores turned out to be biased. Over time, we found personality profile <b>normativeness</b> to be relatively stable. This stability was due to both stable genetic and nonshared environmental effects, whereas innovative variance was completely explained by nonshared environmental effects. Our findings emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the different aspects of profile stability, since overall and distinctive stability scores are likely biased due to the <b>normativeness</b> problem. Yet indicating a person's similarity to the average person, the <b>normativeness</b> of a personality profile itself has a psychological meaning beyond socially desirable responding...|$|E

Multilevel regression analyses revealed that physical discipline was less strongly associated with adverse child outcomes in conditions of greater perceived <b>normativeness,</b> but physical discipline was also associated with more adverse outcomes regardless of its perceived <b>normativeness.</b> Countries with the lowest use of physical discipline showed the strongest association between mothers' use and children's behavior problems, but in all countries higher use of physical discipline was associated with more aggression and anxiety...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the unique contributions of masculinity and men's perceptions of the <b>normativeness</b> of men's and women's health behaviors in predicting men's self-reported health behaviors. One hundred and forty men aged 18 - 78 were recruited from 27 unmoderated and moderated Internet listservs of potential interest to men. They completed measures on-line assessing masculinity, their perceptions of normative health behaviors for men and women, and 8 health behaviors (i. e., alcohol abuse, seatbelt use, tobacco use, physical fighting, use of social support, exercise, dietary habits, and receipt of annual medical check-ups). Findings suggest that masculinity and the perceived <b>normativeness</b> of other men's health behaviors significantly predicted participants' own health behaviors beyond that accounted for by socio-demographic variables (e. g., education, income). Perceptions of the <b>normativeness</b> of women's health behaviors were unrelated to participants' health behaviors. The findings support previous research which has found that traditional masculine gender socialization and social norms models encourage men to put their health at risk, and suggest directions for health promotion efforts when working with men.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{examines}} the normative structure {{of the concept of}} health and tries to suggest an account of it in a phenomenological-hermeneutic framework. It is argued that the concept of health has a logical priority to illness, though the latter has an experiential priority. The fundamental feature of the concept of health as discussed in the literature is initially recognized in the notion of 'norm', in both the bio-statistical and normative-ideal sense. An analysis of this body of literature reveals some weaknesses in bio-statistical definitions of health as well as in those normative ones which endorse a value-relativity thesis. An approach based on the analogical structure of language is then advanced. In this framework, the notion of biological <b>normativeness</b> proposed by G. Canguilhem is connected with an analysis of the language of health through etymologies. It is argued that health can be characterized as an analogy of 'plenitude', which is the common ideal reference of the various health-concepts. The analogical structur-ing of language allows the recognition of different levels of meaning, and there-fore of different kinds of <b>normativeness</b> (biological, mental, social, moral).

40|$|A sociocultural motives {{perspective}} (SMP) on Big Five {{relationships is}} introduced. According to the SMP, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness elicit assimilation to sociocultural norms, Openness elicits contrast from these norms, and Extraversion and Neuroticism {{are independent of}} sociocultural assimilation and contrast. Due to sociocultural assimilation, then, relationships of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness with an outcome wax (become more positive or less negative) with that outcome’s increasing sociocultural <b>normativeness.</b> Due to sociocultural contrast, relationships of Openness with an outcome wane (become less positive or more negative) with that outcome’s increasing sociocultural <b>normativeness.</b> We tested the SMP using religiosity as our outcome. Study 1 included 4 cross-sectional self-report data sets across 66 countries (N = 1, 129, 334), 50 U. S. states (N = 1, 057, 342), 15 German federal states (N = 20, 885), and 121 British urban areas (N = 386, 315). Study 2 utilized informant-report data across 37 countries (N = 544, 512). Study 3 used longitudinal data across 15 German federal states (N = 14, 858). Results consistently supported the SMP. Relationships of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness with religiosity were more positive in religious sociocultural contexts than in secular contexts.

Mothers, fathers, and children (N = 1, 418 families, M age of children = 8. 29 years) were interviewed annually in three waves in 13 cultural groups in nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States). Multilevel models were estimated to examine predictors of (a) within-family differences across the three time points, (b) between-family within-culture differences, and (c) between-cultural group differences in mothers' and fathers' reports of corporal punishment and children's reports of their parents' neglect. These analyses addressed to what extent mothers' and fathers' use of corporal punishment and children's perceptions of their parents' neglect were predicted by parents' belief in the necessity of using corporal punishment, parents' perception of the <b>normativeness</b> of corporal punishment in their community, parents' progressive parenting attitudes, parents' endorsement of aggression, parents' education, children's externalizing problems, and children's internalizing problems at each of the three levels. Individual-level predictors (especially child externalizing behaviors) as well as cultural-level predictors (especially <b>normativeness</b> of corporal punishment in the community) predicted corporal punishment and neglect.

40|$|Background: Family process {{variables}} {{have been linked}} to child problem behavior, but recent research suggests that child ethnicity may moderate relations between family process and child outcomes. The current study examined how ethnicity moderates relations between parent conflict, parent-child relationship quality, and internalizing problems. Methods: A sample of 101 mother-child dyads was drawn from a larger longitudinal study of childhood-onset depression. Maternal reports of family process factors were used with child reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: The results indicated a moderating effect of ethnicity for multiple indicators of internalizing symptoms, such that childrearing disagreement and low levels of mother-child openness were associated with internalizing problems only for European American (not African American) children. Conclusions: Findings suggest that ethnicity moderates the effects of family process factors on child psychopathology. Ethnic differences may be accounted for by the <b>normativeness</b> of family processes and the meaning that children of different ethnic backgrounds assign to these processes.

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, mothers of {{children}} who have chronic illnesses or disabilities have been studied extensively. With some notable exceptions, most research has overlooked the socio-political context of disability and has interpreted maternal behaviours and feelings in negative or psychopathological terms. In this paper we report the results of using Pierre Bourdieu's central concepts to reanalyse three independent qualitative studies focused on mothers' accounts of raising children with severe disabling conditions. We illustrate the logic of mothers' practices and conclude that they represent strategic manipulations of accessible bodily, cultural and symbolic capital consistent with the 'rules of the game' across multiple fields.

30|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{relatively}} lower adoption among Italian mothers of punitive, dismissing and distressed responses to their children’s emotion expression demands cautious interpretation {{as well as}} further study. Notably, in other studies, Italian mothers displayed higher rates of punitiveness than Canadian and French mothers across all age groups of children (Kane 2005), as well a significant level of <b>normativeness</b> and physical discipline with their children compared to, among others, Chinese mothers (Lansford et al. 2005). Nevertheless, {{it is important to}} take into account the mean age of the children to whom the mothers are referring in their responses. Furthermore, the low usage of the dismissing approach among Italian mothers recorded in the current study may be an underestimate, because Italian parents may be reluctant to self-report punitive, dismissive and distressed responses, given that such practices are not seen as positively in Italy as they might be in China. In general, this broad category of socialization practices meets a particularly low level of cultural approval in Western society (Halpenny et al. 2010).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{theoretical}} assumption that individuals adhering to proscriptive masculine roles may be more likely to have negative perceptions of mental health problems, which may lower their likelihood of help seeking (M. E. Addis & J. R. Mahalik, 2003). Participants were 120 undergraduate students who completed measures assessing negative perceptions (nonnormativeness and self-stigma) of alcohol abuse and depression and adherence to proscriptive gender roles. Both men and women who endorsed experiences and beliefs associated with proscriptive masculine gender roles were more likely to perceive problems negatively. Alcohol abuse was seen as more self-stigmatizing than depression, but no mean differences emerged in percep-tions of <b>normativeness.</b> Findings have implications for the development of gender-sensitive interventions aimed at facilitating help seeking.

40|$|Research {{consistently}} {{shows that}} personality {{development is a}} lifelong phenomenon, with mean-level and rank-order changes occurring in all life phases. What happens during specific life phases that can explain these developmental patterns? In the present paper, we review literature linking personality development in different phases of adulthood to developmental tasks associated with these phases. Building on previous work, we describe several categories of developmental tasks that are present in all phases of adulthood. However, the specific tasks within these categories change across adulthood from establishing new social roles in early adulthood to maintaining them in middle adulthood and preventing losses in old age. This trajectory is reflected in mean-level changes in personality, which indicates development towards greater maturity (increases in social dominance, conscientiousness, and emotional stability) in early and middle adulthood, but less {{so at the end}} of life. Importantly, developmental tasks are not only associated with mean-level changes, but the way in which people deal with these tasks is also related to rank-order changes in personality. We provide an outlook for future research on how the influence of historical time on the <b>normativeness</b> of developmental tasks might be reflected in personality development...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{entities}} in artificial {{societies are}} only willing {{to cooperate with}} entities they trust. Reputation systems {{keep track of the}} entities ’ behavior and, thus, are a widely used means to support trust formation. In a P 2 P network, the reputation system needs to be distributed to the individual entities. In previous work, we have shown that some of the limitations of distributed reputation systems can be overcome by making use of hard evidence. In this paper, we take this idea one step further by deriving beliefs of others ’ trustworthiness from one’s own experiences and the available hard evidence. For this purpose, we justify why a self-interested autonomous entity may choose to behave according to the norms of the system designer. As a consequence, the proposed belief model does not only incorporate behavioral beliefs but also beliefs regarding the <b>normativeness</b> of an entity. We prescribe how beliefs are revised if new evidence becomes available. The introduced models for recommendations and belief formation enable us to prove that self-interested entities always issue truthful recommendations regarding transactional behavior. The simulative evaluation shows that a self-interested entity can be expected to be normative and, thus, to comply with our system design...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that if we compute self-other {{agreement}} on some personality traits then we possess no or very little information about the individuals who are the targets of this judgment. This idea is largely based on two separate ways of computing self-other agreement: trait agreement (rT) and profile agreement (rP), which are typically associated with two different trait-centered and person-centered approaches in personality research. Personality traits of 4, 115 targets from Czech, Belgian, Estonian, and German samples were rated by themselves and knowledgeable informants. We demonstrate that trait agreement can be partialled into individual contributions {{so that it is}} possible to show how much each individual pair of judges contributes to agreement on a particular trait. Similarly, it is possible to decompose agreement between two personality profiles into the individual contributions of traits from which these profiles are assembled. If <b>normativeness</b> is separated from distinctiveness of personality scores and individual profiles are ipsatized, then mean profile agreement r ̅_P becomes identical to mean trait agreement r ̅_T. The views that trait-by-trait analysis does not provide information regarding accuracy level of a particular pair of judges and profile analysis does not permit assessment of the relative contributions of traits to overall accuracy are not supported...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three studies}} which explore {{the effects of}} individualized human resource management (HRM) practices from recipients’ and non-recipients’ perspectives. The first two studies, focusing {{on the concept of}} idiosyncratic deals (i-deals), investigate the role of managers’ emotions and employees’ behaviours in translating negotiated i-deals into attainment (Study 1), and how obtained i-deals influence recipients’ work performance positively in the long term (Study 2). In delineating how individualized HRM practices unfold for their recipients, the concept of i-deals is challenged. The third study explores the effects of non-entitlement to flexitime on employees’ overall perceptions of fairness, which in turn shape their affective commitment toward the organization. This study also introduces a contextual condition – the <b>normativeness</b> of flexitime – to understand under what conditions the association between non-entitlement to flexitime and overall fairness perceptions is stronger or weaker. A quantitative methodology is adopted across the three studies. The first two studies draw on two-wave, multi-source data collected in Istanbul, Turkey. The third study is based on the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS, 2011). This thesis makes important theoretical contributions to research on i-deals, flexitime and, more broadly, to individualized HRM.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the text "Tserkov Odna (The Church is One)," written by A. S. Khomiakov. Khomiakov is known as an early Slavophile, who, though a layman, wrote many {{religious}} texts, especially on the Orthodox Church in mid- 19 th century Moscow. We consider the subject under the following two points. First, we elucidate what kind of community Khomiakov took as Tserkov (church) in this text. Second, we explore Khomikov's intention in writing text. The following five points seem to be helpful in grasping the image of community in this text : (1) qualification of membership, (2) spatial and temporal representation of Tserkov (Church), (3) the organic model of Tserkov, (4) indifference to church politics, and (5) emphasis on the Holy Spirit. From the above consideration, we can see that an open, idealistic, anti-structural character is the outline of community used in this text. The question now arises: why does this text purport to be one on the Church? Does faith, in Khomiakov's thought, not necessarily need a community, such as the Church? In conclusion, we may say that Khomiakov wanted to appeal to the public with this text as some authoritative text, and Tserkov, the community in this text, has the two characteristics of openness and <b>normativeness,</b> and that these two do not conflict with each other...|$|E

The category of mind is defined as the backbone element of the paradigm of rationalism of the New time along with its basic features. It is being argued that in ontological sense the concept of mind is identical to necessary, substantial laws under the surface of sensory available phenomena; in epistemological sense the mind correlates with analytical and synthetic method of cognition, and in the worldview sense it is equal to the organizing principle of World-order. Main features of the embodiment of the New time rationalism in political theories are outlined, including the interpretation of the concepts of natural condition of mankind and social contract as the necessary implications of the application of epistemological mind to sociopolitical reality. The specificity of the rationalistic anthropology is disclosed, along with the understanding of an individual as part of social system. The main principles of the aesthetics of rationalism are defined and the classicist style as aesthetical correlate of rationalism is characterized. Main features of the classicist aesthetics are postulated: <b>normativeness,</b> geometrism, consistency, etc. On this basis the principles of dialogical interaction between politics and art in the worldview paradigm of rationalism are established, including: 1. the equality of these spheres in their relationship to mind; 2. their rationalistic formal and substantial normativity; 3. correlation in the context of rationalistic anthropology...|$|E

40|$|This {{volume is}} the firstborn of the Annals of Cultural Psychology [...] a yearly edited book {{series in the}} field of Cultural Psychology. It came into being as {{there is a need for}} {{reflection}} on “where and what” the discipline needs to further develop, in such a way, the current frontiers and to foster the elaboration of new fruitful ideas. The topic chosen for the first volume is perhaps the most fundamental of all- motherhood. We are all here because at some unspecifiable time in the past, different women labored hard to bring each of us into this World. These women were not thinking of culture, but were just giving birth. Yet by their reproductive success—and years of worry about our growing up—we are now, thankfully to them, in a position to discuss the general notion of motherhood from the angle of cultural psychology. Each person who is born needs a mother—first the real one, and then possibly a myriad of symbolic ones—from “my mother” to “mother superior” to “my motherland”. Thus, it is not by coincidence if the first volume of the series is about motherhood. We the editors feel it is the topic that links our existence with one of the universals of human survival as a species. In very general terms what this book aims to do is to question the ontology of Motherhood in favor of an ontogenetic approach to Life’s Course, where having a child represents a big transition in a woman’s trajectory and where becoming (or not becoming) mother is heuristically more interesting than being a mother. We here present a reticulated work that digs into a cultural phenomenon giving to the readers the clear idea of making motherhood (and not taking for granted motherhood). By looking at absences, shadows and ruptures rather than the <b>normativeness</b> of motherhood, cultural psychology can provide a theoretical model in explaining the cultural multifaceted nature of human activit...|$|E
40|$|Military {{service has}} long been {{identified}} {{as one of the}} prime signifiers of membership in the Israeli collective, and as such plays a central role in practices of civil inclusion and exclusion. Against the background of perceived changes in the Israel Defense Forces 2 ̆ 7 status in Israeli society in recent years, this study examines the ways in which Israeli citizens from all sectors of society negotiate the meanings of military and national-civil service in Israel discursively and dialogically. The study is based upon a critical discourse analysis of 20 focus group discussions conducted in 2009 - 2010, {{as well as on the}} analysis of additional strategically selected texts that have achieved wide public circulation. The meanings of military service are examined as related to four interimplicated themes that emerged in discourse: perceptions of military service as an indicator of social <b>normativeness,</b> constructions of the relationship between service and psychological normalcy, ideas linking service to contribution to the collective community, and the ways in which service is associated with the civil, political, and social rights of citizenship. The role of discourse is discussed as simultaneously revealing dominant social meanings and the ways in which they are produced, sustained, and contested; constructing social identities and frameworks of cultural knowledge; and concealing underlying mythical structures that remain largely unaddressed as people focus more on the everyday experiences associated with the military 2 ̆ 7 s construction as a civilianized institution than on the military 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the exercise of violence and the role that this violence plays in solidifying society. Despite much public discussion regarding the decline of the military 2 ̆ 7 s status in society, service continues to function as the archetypical symbol of civic participation and as the temporal, spatial, and institutional template for individuals 2 ̆ 7 and groups 2 ̆ 7 willing sacrifice. Military service is associated with the right to represent the community and its dominant values, and as such becomes imprinted on one 2 ̆ 7 s body and bestows social and cultural credibility. In this way, service both structures and stifles the civil imagination, often leading to conceptual idleness with regard to the possibilities of democratic engagement. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposition}} that psi is operative {{not as an}} anomaly but as a normative component of information processing was investigated, focusing on the normative operation of precognition. Distinct to prior paradigms of precognition research that measure exact identification of stimuli, it was considered most informative, for the proposition of psi’s <b>normativeness,</b> to investigate its operation as a context effect, and, specifically, as priming and sequential effects. Evidence for psi’s operation as a priming effect was firstly examined, and a priming paradigm involving continuous lexical decision was deemed, {{on the basis of}} prior research, to be potentially informative. As to what information could be precognitively primed, the question of retrieval, under a precognition condition, of imaginal and ideational information was addressed, in Experiment 1, in the form of post-response orthographic and semantic priming. Together with observations of classical past-to-present priming, precognitive semantic priming was observed, as was precognitive orthographic priming involving nonwords, in the speed and, partially, the accuracy of lexical decisions. Discussion related the results to theories of visual word recognition as well as precognition. Precognition as a sequential effect was then examined. Using data from a prior experiment in lexical decision that sensitised accuracy over speed as the relevant measure, a precognitive alternation effect was observed {{in the presence of a}} classical repetition effect; specifically, responses to words were more accurate when the prior stimulus was a word, and when the subsequent (“precognitive”) stimulus was a nonword, while responses to nonwords showed no reliable sequential effects. The possible role of sequential artefacts in randomly allocating targets and conditions was examined but found not to disconfirm the precognition hypothesis, while meriting further study. A third experiment sought to replicate this ostensibly precognitive alternation effect in lexical decision latency, while also manipulating nonword lexicality so as to identify a psychological basis for the effect that would conceptually, rather than statistically, preclude the operation of randomisation artefacts. The precognitive alternation effect was again observed – but (again) only in error-rate, and only on word trials. No nonword lexicality effect, and no artefacts of randomisation, appeared to modulate this effect. In the classical direction of sequences, word and nonword repetition effects were observed, modulated by nonword lexicality. These findings again merited discussion in relation to theories of both visual word recognition and precognition. General discussion further concerned the possible role of precognition in visual word recognition, and the informativeness of context effects paradigms of psi research in addressing such possibilities...|$|E
30|$|Asselt et al. (2010), define three {{different}} categories of futures studies {{and how they}} handle uncertainty, although, different labels are used to categorise futures studies in (Armstrong and Fildes 2006; IPTS-JRC, 2008). Following Asselt et al. (2010), the three proposed categories of future studies include: forecasting, foresight and normative future studies. Forecasting, shows one relatively certain image of the future. The future {{can be seen as}} the logical result of the past (Veenman 2013). In fact, Forecasting is a short-, medium- or long-term estimation of future in a specific research area by means of scientific methodology (Cuhls 2003). For this approach, past-based scientific knowledge and models based on these assumptions are considered a reliable basis for making statements about the future (Veenman 2013). In the other words, Forecasting extends past and present patterns and trends into the future, implying a smooth transition between the past, present and the future (Nowotny 2008). Foresight is the second of Asselt’s categories for futures studies that more strongly emphasizes cognitive uncertainty is foresight which deals with multiple possible and plausible future (Veenman 2013). Foresight draws conclusions for the present and is therefore a broad range policy instrument that can serve various objectives (Cuhls 2000). In fact, Foresight is presented in a scenario study as a rich detailed portrait of a plausible future world, or as future states of a system (Berrogi 1997). A scenario is not a forecast but a plausible description of what might occur (Enserink et al. 2010). In foresight studies, future images are given with two or more scenarios (Schwartz 1991; Goodwin and Wright 2010). It is uncertain which trends develop, continue or stop, and which unexpected events might happen, since multiple, alternative futures are possible in foresight analysis (Veenman 2013). Normative, is the third category of future studies of Asselt et al. (2010). In contrast to forecasting and foresight studies, normative futures studies favor <b>normativeness</b> instead of trying to be ‘neutral’ (Veenman 2013). The normative studies include two branches: backcasting and critical futures studies. Backcasting is concerned with how desirable futures can be created, rather than what futures are likely to occur. In backcasting, one envisions a desired future endpoint, and then works backward to determine what policy measures would be required to achieve such a future. Critical future studies emphasizes that images of possible futures are not neutral but represent particular desires, values, cultural assumptions and world views (Asselt et al. 2010). Such future studies sketch a future that is considered ideal, for example, a situation of peace and tolerance, or a situation where the environmental burden is minimised. These types of future studies do not attempt to imagine one or more possible images of the future or one or more possible images of development without a statement being made about the desirability of it. According to Asselt’s category, this paper implemented the first category, forecasting.|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa tematiza o conceito saúde na perspectiva dos modelos médicos vitalistas, situando-se no eixo da dimensão doutrina médica das Racionalidades Médicas, e tem como objeto de estudo os vitalismos de Hahnemann e Nietzsche. A partir do levantamento e análise bibliográfica de textos e da abordagem disciplinar histórica e filosófica, teve como objetivos analisar os conceitos de vida, saúde, doença e cura presentes nos pensamentos desses autores, traçar correspondências e explicitar as diferenças dos pensamentos envolvidos. Como apoios teóricos os trabalhos de Canguilhem, Luz e Foucault. Partindo da ênfase na atitude vital do sujeito em seu processo de saúde-doença-convalescença-cura, que ambos pensadores destacam, buscou-se avaliar as hipóteses de o vitalismo hahnemanniano se assemelhar ao nietzscheano e se seria possível afirmar que a busca da grande saúde equivaleria à meta do tratamento homeopático ao contemplar a liberdade do espírito na conquista da ampliação da normatividade vital. Concluiu-se que os vitalismos de Hahnemann e Nietzsche são semelhantes na medida em que as bases de seus pensamentos ressaltam a vida enquanto um jogo de forças e luta, onde enfatizam a irredutibilidade dos fenômenos dos vivos às propriedades físico-químicas; a concepção dos seres humanos como totalidades únicas e singulares nas quais há um jogo de forças atuantes, promovendo diferentes saúdes no mesmo indivíduo, de acordo com as variadas fases da vida; e as hierarquias existentes entre as forças, resultando em análises diagnósticas, possibilidades de intervenção terapêutica e acompanhamento do processo saúde-doença. Correspondem a formas de olhar a vida humana de modo dinâmico, valorizando todos os aspectos físicos, mentais, emocionais e as interações/relações com o meio em que vive. A grande saúde para um espírito que se torna o que é amplia o ideal de cura homeopático ao contribuir para a ressignificação do conceito de saúde como expansão da normatividade vital e da vida como criação de valor, promovendo deslocamentos de perspectivas {{individual}} e coletiva, a fim da conquista de uma saúde mais alegre e vital e afirmadora do espírito livre. Ambos os pensamentos podem promover importantes reavaliações do conceito de vida e saúde na sociedade e na medicina contemporâneas, centradas nos valores estatisticamente determinados, generalizantes e normalizadores do paradigma normal/patológicoThis research {{discusses the}} health concept {{from the perspective}} of vitalistic medical models, ranging in the axis of Medical Rationale medical doctrine, having as study object the vitalist studies by Hahnemann and Nietzsche. From the survey and literature review of texts and the historical and philosophical disciplinary approach, it aimed at analyzing the concepts of life, health, disease and cure in the thoughts of these authors, drawing connections and explaining the differences of thoughts involved. The theoretical support were the works of Canguilhem, Luz and Foucault. Starting from the emphasis on the vital attitude of the subject in the health-disease-convalescence-healing process, that both thinkers emphasize, we sought to assess the idea that Hahnemanns vitalism resembles Nietzsches, and whether it is possible to say that the pursuit of big health would the goal of homeopathic treatment to address the freedom of spirit in achieving the expansion of the vital <b>normativeness.</b> It was concluded that Hahnemanns and Nietzsches vitalisms are similar in that the foundations of their thoughts emphasize life as a game of power and control, which emphasize the irreducibility of the phenomena of living beings to physical and chemical properties; the design of human beings as unique and singular wholes {{in which there is a}} set of interacting forces, promoting different types of health in the same individual, according to the varied stages of life and the hierarchies between the forces resulting in diagnostic tests, opportunities for therapeutic intervention and monitoring of the health-disease process. They correspond to ways of looking at life in a dynamic manner, valuing all physical, mental, emotional aspects and interactions/relations with the environment in which they live. The great health to a spirit that becomes what it is it expands the ideal of homeopathic cure by helping reframe the concept of health as expanding the normativity of life and life as value creation, promoting shifts in individual and collective perspectives, to conquer a living and happier life and affirming the free spirit. Both thoughts can promote significant revaluation of the concept of life and health in contemporary society and medicine, focusing on values statistically determined, generalizing and standardization of individuals of the paradigm normal/pathologi...|$|E
