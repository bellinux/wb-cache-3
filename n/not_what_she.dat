25|$|It {{is quickly}} {{revealed}} that Ella is definitely <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> seems. She is 445 {{years old and}} the daughter of John Dee. Ella is also a witch and has been hunting Azazeal for centuries. So far, she has been very successful in preventing Azazeal from begetting a son by a mortal witch. This time, however, Ella was too late. Her mission: kill Malachi.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Hodge was {{transferred}} to Minister of State in the Department for Work and Pensions with primary responsibility for Work. On 17 June 2005 she was criticised for saying that the former workers of MG Rover {{would be able to}} obtain jobs at Tesco, a local supermarket. Later, she claimed that this was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant, rather that she had empathy for those losing their jobs, and was pointing to a new Tesco supermarket as an example of new jobs being created {{in the face of the}} redundancies at the car manufacturing plant.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the Wizard of Oz references, Underwood {{commented that}} [...] "it {{was all about}} having subtle references," [...] such as the plaid shirt and red shoes she wore on the video. When asked if her aim was to {{generate}} controversy with the storyline, the singer {{said that it was}} <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> were aiming for at all, adding: [...] "I try to stay away from controversy in any form or fashion. It was just such a great story and such a mini-movie, listening to the song, and we really wanted to do it justice in the video." ...|$|E

500|$|Libby is {{a mysterious}} {{character}}, {{seated at the}} tail-section of the plane. Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not know she is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that person you want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade." ...|$|E
500|$|... "White Horse" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was written by Swift and Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman, with Swift's aid. The song was released on December 7, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). Swift and Rose composed the song about one of Swift's ex-boyfriends, when Swift discovered he was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had perceived of him. It focused on the moment where Swift accepted that the relationship was over. [...] "White Horse" [...] is, musically, a country song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals. Lyrically, the track speaks of disillusionment and pain in a relationship, drawing references to fairytales.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Plath {{attended}} Smith College and excelled academically. She {{wrote to}} her mother, [...] "The world is splitting open at my feet like a ripe, juicy watermelon". She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, [...] "more than life itself." [...] She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, {{but he was already}} on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough [...] "courage" [...] to commit suicide. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.|$|E

500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1993, despite not seeing or {{speaking}} to Jackson {{for a number of}} years, La Toya Jackson claimed that her brother was a pedophile and that she had proof, which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they realized that her revelations were <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had claimed them to be. Then in Israel, she stated, [...] "I cannot and will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against young children... Forget about the superstar, forget about the icon. If he was any other 35-year-old man who was sleeping with little boys, you wouldn't like this guy". She also claimed that checks had been made out to several boys and that Jackson's own physical abuse as a child had turned him into an abuser. She would later claim that Jackson had tried to kidnap and kill her. The rest of the family disowned her, and in subsequent years she would insist that she was forced to make the allegations by her then husband for financial gain. Just prior to making the allegations, her husband was arrested for striking her in the face, arms and legs with a chair. By the turn of the millennium Jackson had forgiven his sister.|$|E
500|$|When Gretta sees Dave {{accepting}} {{an award}} on television, she criticizes him for selling {{out to the}} music industry and she expresses her grievances {{with him in a}} song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, who is back in New York to promote his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums. Gretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of [...] "Lost Stars," [...] a love ballad she had once written and composed for him as a Christmas present, believing that the true meaning of the song has been lost. Dave tells her that the audiences love when he plays it in the new way, and that their energy fills the room. [...] He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the Gramercy Theatre that weekend so that she can see the impact it has had on his fans. She arrives at the venue just in time to watch him play her original arrangement of the song. After tearfully watching him play and seeing the reaction of the crowd to their song, Gretta decides to leave the concert and cycles through the city with a smile slowly dawning on her face.|$|E
2500|$|Winter {{traces the}} origin of the [...] "surrender or distress" [...] theory to a single {{newspaper}} article written just after the battle by a reporter with no access to the prisoners or naval intelligence. Olson doubts that a surrender flag was used to lure Sydney in, as this would have informed Burnett that Straat Malakka was <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> seemed. He considers that the Germans may have used false signals or pretended to scuttle, but only hypothetically.|$|E

2500|$|River, {{alongside}} Smith's Eleventh Doctor, {{is one of}} {{two main}} playable characters in the PlayStation 3 Doctor Who console game [...] Kingston provided voice acting and motion capture physical acting for the character. In regard to River's role in the narrative of the game, the game's producer Simon Harris explains that she [...] "realises that what’s in her diary is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wrote and that actually the Eternity Clock is playing with her history, as well as the Earth’s history." ...|$|E

[...] She had relocated to LA in 1991 where she took more singing lessons and started song writing. Upon return to Australia, in 1993, she performed in the local musical theatre production, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, as the Narrator.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1993 Gordon hastily {{arranged}} {{a press conference}} in Tel Aviv, where he had Jackson read a statement claiming to believe the sensational sex abuse allegation against her younger brother Michael might be true. This was an abrupt reversal of her previous defense of Michael against the charges. Gordon claimed La Toya had proof which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they realized that her revelations were <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had claimed them to be. [...] According to La Toya, Gordon threatened to have siblings Michael and Janet killed if she didn't follow his orders.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of 'Beleaguered Cities' (1929) in various mid-twentieth century anthologies of English verse made it probably Lucas's best-known poem. Others that have gained currency through anthologies include 'The Destined Hour' (1953), a re-telling in verse {{of the old}} 'appointment in Samarra' fable, and 'Spain 1809', {{the story of a}} village woman's courage during the French occupation in the Peninsular War. His most ambitious poem was Ariadne (1932), an epic re-working of the Labyrinth myth, extracts from which were read on the BBC Home Service in 1934. Simon Tidworth in The Quest for Theseus summarises: [...] "Lucas invents another sweetheart for Theseus, Aegle, one of the sacrificial maidens who accompany him to Crete. [...] The real stroke of originality is to make the Minotaur Minos himself in a bull-mask. [...] On Naxos Ariadne learns of Theseus's earlier love for Aegle, and decides to leave him while the image of her own love is still fresh. An ordinary love-affair is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants; she has to seek the Ideal [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Julia Fish (born 1950) is an American {{artist whose}} {{paintings}} have a deceptive simplicity. She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size. By means of close observation of everyday subjectsleaves {{of a tree}} seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture she makes, as one critic says, [...] "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities." [...] She is a studio artist who paints <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, {{is not so much}} temporal as durational. [...] Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as she sees it, [...] "a parallel system to a lived experience." [...] The paintings lack spacial orientation and, as a critic says, can [...] "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term." [...] In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said [...] "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character." ...|$|E
