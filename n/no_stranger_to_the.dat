The {{political}} repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azeri were changed three times — from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic — a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process and may well {{have been one of the}} factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{demand for}} small {{denomination}} coin flourished, {{and with it}} the popularity of copper tokens that approximated the size of the halfpenny grew rapidly. [...] One of the most prolific producers of these private tokens (struck on behalf of merchants) was Matthew Boulton. [...] In fact, during his lifetime Boulton would strike millions of these merchant pieces. [...] Boulton was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of small metal items, having grown up with and managed his family business for many years, which specialized in buckles. [...] In the mid-1780s Boulton had turned his attention to coinage; in his eyes coins and tokens were just another small metal product like those he had manufactured for years. [...] He also had shares in several Cornish copper mines, and had a large personal stock of copper, purchased when the mines were unable to dispose of it elsewhere. [...] However, when orders for counterfeit money were sent to him, he refused them: [...] "I will do anything, short of being a common informer against particular persons, to stop the malpractices of the Birmingham coiners." [...] In 1788 he established the Soho Mint as part of his industrial plant. [...] The mint included eight steam-driven presses, each striking between 70 and 84 coins per minute.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{material}} and cultural influences which engender an era’s formal works of political theory are <b>no</b> <b>strangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opera house. In this essay, I analyze Beethoven’s opera Fidelio {{as a political}} text influenced by the republican ideas of the later Enlightenment and the French Revolution. The republicanism of Fidelio lies {{not so much in}} its depiction of political institutions. It lies rather in the opera’s emphasis on republican virtue. This virtue consists of gendered sets of patriotic habits, attitudes, and practices. Even Beethoven’s music-bourgeois music at its very height-echoed the turmoil and the ideal of the heroic years of the middle class in merely the same way that a morning dream echoes the noise of the beginning day. It is not actual sensory listening but only the conceptually mediated perception of the elements and their configuration which assures the social substance of great music. -Theodor W. Adorno, Philosophy of Modern Musi...|$|R
