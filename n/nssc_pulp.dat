40|$|The spent liquors of {{thermomechanical}} (TMP) {{and neutral}} sulfite semichemical (<b>NSSC)</b> <b>pulping</b> processes contain some lignocelluloses that are recently {{treated in the}} waste water of the processes, and thus wasted. In this dissertation, the adsorption concept was considered to separate lignocelluloses from the spent liquors (SL) s of TMP and NSSC processes. Various adsorbents such as activated carbon, fly ash, bentonite, kaolin, kaolinite, calcium carbonate, talc and aluminium silicate were used in order to adsorb lignocelluloses. The operating conditions of adsorption were optimized by adjusting pH, temperature and time of treatment. Moreover, various alternatives, such as pH adjustment, polymer addition and multi-stage adsorption processes were considered to improve the overall extraction of lignocelluloses from SLs. The properties of adsorbents, e. g. charge density and surface area, {{were related to the}} adsorption performance and the properties, e. g. turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD), of SLs after adsorption. The high removals in turbidity and COD showed that the suggested processes were not only effective in extracting lignocelluloses but also efficient in decreasing the load of wastewater treatment of the plant.

In spite of the relative simplicity of implementation of this process, it does not remain free from grievance about it: low yield, an excessive consumption of bleaching agents (5, 4 % of total chlorine) for a whiteness not exceeding 80 points, a signifi-cant time of pulping (3, 5 h), the pulp’s quality is low, difficulties of regenerating the chemical agents, which generates the pollu-tion of the environment, due to the rejections of the effluents in nature. The study that we present constitutes a contribution in the search of the pulping process likely to replace that current. To this end, we chose the process with the neutral sulphite (<b>NSSC</b> <b>pulping)</b> for its simplicity of application, the yield {{and the quality of the}} pulp obtained in the treatment of wood.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Bigleaf maple chips were pulped by the kraft, Magnetite, neutral sulfite semichemical, and refiner {{groundwood}} processes. Pulp {{from each}} process was refined in a Valley Beater and the handsheet {{properties of the}} refined pulp were compared to similar pulps made from other wood species. For the kraft process a different concentration of active alkali was used in five separate cooks while the other cooking parameters were kept constant As the level of active alkali was lowered the unscreened yield increased from 47 2 % to 55. 6 %. The average brightness of the kraft pulp was 41 % (% reflectance at 457 nm as measured by an Elrepho Colorimeter) The pulp strengths were generally improved with higher yields. Samples of the kraft pulp were bleached using a five stage bleaching sequence and the handsheet properties of the bleached pulp were evaluated. The Magnetite cooking schedule gave an unscreened yield in the 50 - 55 % range and a 62. 2 % brightness Samples of the Magnetite pulp were bleached using a three stage bleaching sequence and the handsheet properties of the bleached pulp were evaluated There were four neutral sulfite semichemical cooks made with yields ranging {{from a high of}} 90 5 % to a low of 76. 1 %. The corrugating medium test remained nearly constant as the yield varied, but the other strength values increased with decreasing yields The refiner groundwood was manufactured in three passes through a Bauer double disc refiner. The resultant pulp was beaten to 100 Canadian standard freeness and bleached to 58 1 % brightness using 1 % (w/w) zinc hydrosulfrte. In general, bigleaf maple can be converted into pulp possessing hands heet properties similar to pulp made from other hardwood species. The kraft and Magnetite pulps were bleached using standard bleaching techniques and the pulp lost very little strength in the process.

After fiber slushing and preparation of pulp suspension with 0. 5 % consistency and conductivity formation of about 437 µS/cm, adding water solution of 1 mM NaCl, the experiments of fibers treatment were conducted to build the polymeric layers (up to 5 consecutive layers). Afterward, water retention value (WRV) of fibers was calculated in samples to evaluate the influence of this method on fibers hydrophilicity. The fibers were then used to prepare standard handsheets (60 ± 3 g/m 2) and the physical and strength properties of sheets were evaluated {{as a function of}} the number of layers deposited on the fibers.

The considered sulfite processes are neutral-sulfite (NS), neutral sulfite-anthraquinone (NS-AQ), neutral sulfite semichemical (NSSC) and neutral sulfite semichemical anthraquinone (NSSC-AQ). In preliminary studies, an experimental design was tested and optimum kinetic conditions were found so that penetration and diffusion {{would not be}} the rate-controlling steps and the amount of anthraquinone would not be reaction limiting. Delignification and carbohydrate degradation rate expressions for both NS and NS-AQ pulping were developed. Research was extended to develop delignification rate expressions for <b>NSSC</b> and NSSC-AQ <b>pulping.</b> The degree of delignification was measured by determining the lignin content of the pulp. Carbohydrate content in the pulp was estimated from the difference between the pulp yield and the residual lignin in the pulp. Reaction temperature and pulping chemical concentrations were held essentially constant in all kinetic experiments. Isothermal experiments were conducted in the temperature range between 165 and 180 $ sp circ$C. A concentration of 150 g/l sodium sulfite with a liquor-to-wood ratio of 62 was used. The effect of sulfite concentration on the delignification rate expressions for NS and NS-AQ pulping was also investigated.

The main objective was to investigate the treatability performance of the reactors at varying OLR and HRT in terms of TOC and lignin removal. The reactor R-I was used by conventional procedure, whereas, for the reactor R-II methanol and activated carbon was added to supplement its efficiency. Corresponding to an optimum OLR of 4. 5 kg/m 3 -day and HRT of 18 hrs, the reactor R-II gives 69 % TOC and 60 % lignin removal. But, in the reactor R-I at same operating conditions, only 56 % TOC and 51 % lignin removal was noticed. However, the biogas yield in the reactor R-I was noticed relatively more than in the R-II. The biogas yield observed was 0. 28 m 3 /kg-CODrem and 0. 18 m 3 /kg-CODrem in the reactor R-I and R-II, respectively, with 56 - 58 % methane content in both the reactors.
