5000|$|As with Coca-Cola, {{the formula}} for Dr Pepper is a trade secret, and {{allegedly}} the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate Dallas banks. [...] A persistent rumor since the 1930s is that the drink <b>contains</b> <b>prune</b> juice, but the official Dr Pepper FAQ refutes this with [...] "Dr Pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors; it does <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>prune</b> juice." [...] The origin of the rumor is unknown; some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juice's laxative effects, but it may simply be because many people feel that Dr Pepper's unique flavor tastes similar to prune juice.|$|R
5000|$|Prunes {{are used}} in {{preparing}} both sweet and savory dishes. Stewed prunes, a compote, are a common dessert. Prunes are an ingredient in North African tagines or tzimmes, a traditional Jewish dish (in which the principal ingredient is diced or sliced carrots), in the Nordic prune kisel, eaten with rice pudding, and in the traditional Norwegian dessert fruit soup. Prunes have also been included in other holiday dishes, such as stuffing and cake. Prune-filled Danish pastries, yogurt or ice cream <b>containing</b> <b>prunes</b> or prune juice are found in some countries. Chocolate-covered prunes are a traditional confectionery in Eastern Europe. Prunes are also used to make juice and kompot (uzvar), a traditional drink in Europe. In the Cotswolds, prunes were fermented to form a cider-like drink called jerkum which, due to the high sugar content of prunes, was considered particularly potent in alcohol content compared to contemporary ciders and beers.|$|R
