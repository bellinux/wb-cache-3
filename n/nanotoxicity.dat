5000|$|Many {{nanoparticles}} agglomerate or aggregate {{when they}} are placed in environmental or biological fluids. [...] The terms agglomeration and aggregation have distinct definitions according to the standards organizations ISO and ASTM, where agglomeration signifies more loosely bound particles and aggregation signifies very tightly bound or fused particles (typically occurring during synthesis or drying). Nanoparticles frequently agglomerate due to the high ionic strength of environmental and biological fluids, which shields the repulsion due to charges on the nanoparticles. Unfortunately, agglomeration has frequently been ignored in <b>nanotoxicity</b> studies, even though agglomeration {{would be expected to}} affect <b>nanotoxicity</b> since it changes the size, surface area, and sedimentation properties of the nanoparticles. In addition, many nanoparticles will agglomerate to some extent in the environment or in the body before they reach their target, so it is desirable to study how toxicity is affected by agglomeration.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{delivery}} systems, lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles, can {{be designed}} to improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug. However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients. When designed to avoid the body's defence mechanisms, nanoparticles have beneficial properties {{that can be used}} to improve drug delivery. Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed, including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm. Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently. Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal. For example, a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist, improving the solubility. Drug delivery systems may also be able to prevent tissue damage through regulated drug release; reduce drug clearance rates; or lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue. However, the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host's reactions to nano- and microsized materials and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body. Nevertheless, a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems. While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles, the dangers of <b>nanotoxicity</b> become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses.|$|E
40|$|The toxic {{paradigms}} of chemotherapeutic {{drugs and}} nanoparticles are tightly linked. Whereas uncontrolled exposure of living systems to therapeutics/nanomaterials leads to toxicity, selective induction of cytotoxicity in cancer cells helps {{in the fight}} against cancer. The increasing understanding of <b>nanotoxicity</b> paradigms has recently resulted in important benchmarks for the safe design of nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems aiming to fight cancer. In this context, this review aims to compile and present recent advances, outcomes and interconnections between nanomaterial-based drug delivery and <b>nanotoxicity</b> disciplines in order to provide a comprehensive guidance for future research. First, the basic concepts and mechanisms of nanomaterial-based drug delivery and <b>nanotoxicity</b> are introduced. Second, we present a detailed classification of drug delivery strategies and <b>nanotoxicity</b> paradigms, supported by the most recent research studies with a special focus on the interconnections between <b>nanotoxicity</b> and drug delivery research, which are highlighted in order to explore future opportunities for developing advanced therapeutic approaches.

30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} {{confirms}} {{the importance of}} length of polymer-coated MWCNTs in cell damage and biocompatibility. It also demonstrates that the <b>nanotoxicity</b> of MWCNTs is cell specific and that epithelial cancer cells are more resistant to cell damage than immune cells. The amount of MWCNTs phagocytised by immune cells as well as pro-inflammatory responses induced by MWCNTs may {{play an important role}} in determining the degree of cytotoxicity. Due to possible complex interactions between CNTs and cellular components and between CNTs and standard cell viability assay systems, CNT <b>nanotoxicity</b> data should be carefully interpreted. Finally, there is a need for methodological research aimed at development of ‘reagent free’ tests of <b>nanotoxicity</b> of living cells exposed to nanomaterials.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{hypothesized}} that the amino acid-coated MNPs might display some <b>nanotoxicity</b> in human important cells, including vascular endothelial cells and macrophages, and rat BMSCs. We made {{a study on the}} <b>nanotoxicity</b> in the three kinds of cells: human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVECs), BMSCs, and THP- 1 -derived macrophages. The goal {{of this study was to}} detect the possible safe concentration of MNPs (average diameter[*]=[*] 10 nm) on the cells. We examined the <b>nanotoxicity</b> of the two kinds of MNPs by assessing their effects on cell morphological changes, viability, and apoptosis. These data suggest that the amino acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles exert relatively high cytotoxicity; by contrast, lysine-coated magnetic nanoparticles are more secure than glycine-coated magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E
30|$|One {{important}} {{implication of}} our findings {{is that the}} same core nanoparticles coated with different materials may display different <b>nanotoxicity.</b> Biomaterial (e.g., amino acid or peptide)-modified nanoparticles do not necessarily improve the biocompatibility of nanoparticles; these modified nanoparticles, on the contrary, may more easily interact with cell membrane, which contributes to the uptake of nanoparticles and results in greater cytotoxicity. Also, we provide new evidence about the cell type-specific <b>nanotoxicity</b> of amino acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nanotoxicity</b> {{refers to}} the {{physiological}} and metabolic interruptions caused by engineered nano-particles thatmay differ at various trophic levels of ecological pyramids. This review focuses on the <b>nanotoxicity</b> events that arereported in literature in {{a wide array of}} living organisms such as algae, microbes, plants, fishes, rodents andhumans. Literature survey reveals that even adaptive organisms such as algae which have proved to tolerateadverse and fluctuating environmental conditions are prone to <b>nanotoxicity</b> as a result of defective photosyntheticsystem. The microbes such as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and other beneficial soil microorganismshave been reported to be inhibited in its functionalities by nanoparticles but their relative toxicities are quiteinconclusive and warrant further investigations. Despite plants have evolved tolerance mechanisms to deterxenobiotics, they expressed their sensitivity to some of the nano-particles as a consequence of physical andchemical routes of action. In animal models (rodents), the data have vividly shown that the nanoparticles havecaused significant inflammatory effects while in aquatic system (fish) nanoparticles are found to accumulate invarious organs besides causing morphological dysfunctions. In the case of humans, nano-particles enter primarilythrough inhalation which causes inflammation and ultimately cancer. Overall, the <b>nanotoxicity</b> in biologicalsystems is mainly caused by the excessive production of reactive oxygen species that damages the living cells. Despite this mechanism has been unequivocally demonstrated in some case studies, scientists are still workingharder to establish a clear relationship between nanoparticles and its toxicity impacts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{have many}} advantages, {{it has been}} proved {{that they may be}} absorbed by and have toxic effects on the human body. Recent research has tried to evaluate and compare the <b>nanotoxicity</b> of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) produced by two types of microorganisms in vitro by two different methods. AuNPs were produced by Bacillus cereus and Fusarium oxysporum, and their production was confirmed by visible spectral, transmission electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The human fibroblast cell line CIRC-HLF was treated with AuNPs, and the induced <b>nanotoxicity</b> was measured using direct microscopic and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Results: The results showed that the produced AuNPs had a maximum absorbance peak around 510 – 530  nanometer (nm), with spherical, hexagonal, and octagonal shapes and average sizes around 20 – 50  nm. The XRD results confirmed the presence of GNPs in the microbial culture supernatants. An MTT assay showed that GNPs had dose-dependent toxic effects, and microscopic analysis showed that GNPs induced cell abnormalities in doses lower than the determined half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s). Conclusions: In conclusion, the biologically produced AuNPs had toxic effects in the cell culture, and direct techniques such as microscopic evaluation instead of indirect methods such as MTT assay were more useful for assessing the <b>nanotoxicity</b> of the biologically produced AuNPs. Thus, the use of only MTT assay for <b>nanotoxicity</b> evaluation of AuNPs is not desirable...|$|E

This technique overcomes many of the inherent difficulties of assaying <b>nanotoxicity</b> and demonstrates exceptional sensitivity in identifying the effects of CBNs in cells at environmentally-relevant concentrations. We identify key mechanisms of <b>nanotoxicity</b> as the alteration of Amide and lipid biomolecules, but propose more specific bioactivity of CBNs occurs as a result of specific interactions between CBN structural conformation and cellular characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Nanoparticles are {{increasingly}} used for biomedical purposes. Many different diagnostic and therapeutic applications are envisioned for nanoparticles, {{but there are}} often also serious concerns regarding their safety. Given the fact that numerous new nanomaterials are being developed every day, and that not much {{is known about the}} long-term toxicological impact of exposure to nanoparticles, there is an urgent need to establish efficient methods for <b>nanotoxicity</b> testing. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo assay has recently emerged as an interesting ‘intermediate’ method for in vivo <b>nanotoxicity</b> screening, enabling (semi-) high-throughput analyses in a system significantly more complex than cultured cells, {{but at the same time}} also less ‘invasive’ and less expensive than large-scale biocompatibility studies in mice or rats. The zebrafish embryo assay is relatively well-established in the environmental sciences, but has not yet gained wide notice in the nanomedicine field.

The LD 50 for the nano-, micro-copper particles and cupric ions exposed to mice via oral gavage are 413,> 5000 and 110 mg/kg body weight, respectively.
