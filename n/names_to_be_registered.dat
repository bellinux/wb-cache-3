5000|$|The {{registered}} name often refers {{directly or}} indirectly to the breeder of the animal. Traditionally, the breeder's kennel prefix form {{the first part of}} the dog's registered name. For example, all dogs bred at the Gold Mine Kennels would have names that begin with the words Gold Mine. Horse breeders are usually not required to do this, but often find it to be a good form of commercial promotion to include a stable name or farm initials in the horse's name. For example, Gold Mine Stables may name give all horses names with the prefix [...] "Gold Mine," [...] "GM," [...] or [...] "GMS." [...] The Jockey Club, which registers Thoroughbreds, requires stable <b>names</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>registered,</b> but does not require their use in animal names.|$|E
