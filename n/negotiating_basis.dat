40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} health care system and the {{supporting}} health insurance framework in Australia. The importance of the health insurance mechanism is stressed in relation to the maintenance and growth of private fee-for-service medicine. The Medical Benefits Schedule, which is the <b>negotiated</b> <b>basis</b> for medical fees under insurance, is examined for the logic implicit in the fee structure. The high rewards for procedural medicine relative to consulting are suggested as part of the basis of the rapid growth in hospital admissions. It is also argued that the refund schedule has helped to determine the nature of the medical specialist manpower pool. Other problems associated with the complex nature of the refund schedule, such as fraud and wasteful over-servicing, are identified and discussed. It is asserted that the health insurance system and refund schedule are partly determining the nature of medical service provision and inducing inequities in the financing and delivery of medical care in Australia. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1853, Miller was {{appointed}} to the church committee which was to investigate and potentially <b>negotiate</b> the <b>basis</b> for union with the various Presbyterian denominations in Victoria. A union basis between the Free Presbyterian Church of Victoria and the Church of Scotland Synod of Victoria was drafted, but by 1856 Miller opposed further negotiations due to disputation over the doctrinal standards, legislative basis and ministerial supply. The John Knox congregation supported this stand by resolution at a congregational meeting in August 1856. Of his own denomination, “he hoped they would have grace and courage to maintain their own integrity and consistency by refusing all further negotiations until this point (i.e. the legislative basis) should be conceded.” ...|$|R

Border negotiations were eventually resumed in 1987 at Mikhail Gorbachev's initiation. An agreement was reached on the eastern portion of the border on May 16, 1991, several months before the final dissolution of the USSR.

50|$|From the 1950s onward, the United States {{doled out}} loans {{and other forms}} of {{financial}} assistance to Third World nations (now commonly referred to as least developed countries, or LDCs). Free-market economics were encouraged in the Third World, not only as a measure of countering the spread of socialist ideology during the Cold War, but also as a means of fostering foreign direct investment (FDI) and promoting the access of foreign companies within the OECD nations to certain sectors of target economies. In particular, Western companies sought {{to gain access to the}} extraction of raw commodities, especially minerals and agricultural products. Where loans were <b>negotiated</b> on the <b>basis</b> of implementing large infrastructural projects such as roads and electrical dams, Western countries stood to gain by employing their domestic businesses and by broadening the means by which Western companies could more easily extract these resources.|$|R
40|$|Prices on some Department of Defense (DoD) {{procurement}} contracts {{are determined by}} competitive bids, while on others prices are <b>negotiated</b> on the <b>basis</b> of so-called "DoD profit policy," whereby price is equated to expected cost plus a percentage markup. This article focuses on the interaction between these two contractual arrangements. Specifically, {{it is assumed that}} an initial contract is let competitively, with common knowledge that the winner will later become a monopolist regulated according to profit policy. Under these conditions, it is shown that expected contractor profit and government expenditure can often be reduced by raising the profit policy markup. The intuition is not only that firms "buy in" to the initial contracts, but also that the differential subsidization induced by profit policy (higher-cost producers receive larger absolute markups) encourages more aggressive competition. Mathematically, this seemingly restrictive regulatory setup is shown to generalize the McAfee and McMillan (1986) procurement bidding model. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} how theory and praxis may be integrated within a postcolonial, or more specifically, anticolonial frame. It argues for {{the necessity of}} telling, listening and responding to personal narratives {{as a catalyst for}} understanding the construction of identities and their relationship to place. This is achieved through a theorisation of narrative and a critique of postcolonialism. Three 'sites' of contestation are visited to provide this critique: the Patterns of Life: The Story of the Aboriginal People of Western Australia exhibition at the Perth Museum; a comparison of Western Australian legislation that governed the lives of Aboriginal people from 1848 to the present and, the life story of Alice Nannup; and, an analysis of the Australian Institute Judicial Association's Aboriginal Culture: Law and Change seminar for magistrates.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{decision}} of 33 {{men and women to}} be sick-listed from work for neck pain or low-back pain. Qualitative interviews with the subjects, who lived in a city or a sparsely populated area of Sweden, were tape-recorded, transcribed and analysed in the interpretive tradition by the three authors. New, intense and threatening pain quickly made persons report sick. For other pain, sickness absence, its timing and duration, were <b>negotiated</b> on the <b>basis</b> of the subjects' self-image, work-duty norms, organisational and extra-organisational work factors. Thirty-one people aimed to return to work, but spine-related pain was a hindrance. Five strategies to avoid, delay or shorten sickness absence were identified. Concepts of the illness flexibility model well described how the workers balanced the factors driving them from work and those forcing them or attracting them to remain. The conclusion is that reporting sick is neither undertaken lightly nor for short-term reasons only. Instead, personal history and anticipated future, spine-related pain, workplace and labour market factors are also important considerations.
