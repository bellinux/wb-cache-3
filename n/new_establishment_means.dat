40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies in regional science and urban economics show that agglomeration economies {{may be one}} source of the uneven distribution of economic activities and economic growth across cities and regions. At the same time, {{the body of research}} into the importance of agglomeration economies for the performance of firms is still growing. Such development is necessary, as the theories that underlie agglomeration economies are microeconomic in nature, but still insufficiently understood. In this study, we focus on the determinants of survival among <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> in the advanced producer services sector in the Netherlands. Employing a mixed hierarchical and cross-classified probit regression, we introduce a model of establishment survival that is specific to characteristics of the internal and external environment of the establishment. Controlling for firm and sector characteristics, we conclude that location accounts for about 4 % {{of the variance in the}} probability of survival of <b>new</b> <b>establishments.</b> We also find that localization and urbanization economies have a positive effect on the survival of <b>new</b> <b>establishments.</b> However, <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> with large start-up sizes appear to profit more from agglomeration economies than <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> with small start-up sizes. multi-level analysis;micro-macro link;agglomeration economies;new establishments...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine the {{survival}} of <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> and to identify factors affecting their survival probability and their employment growth. This study uses a unique data set on all <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> that were created in Sweden 1987 and 1988, {{with the exception of the}} construction industry. The results show among others that:(i) <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> face a high risk of closing down, (ii) the probability of establishment survival increases with the age and size of the establishment,(iii) variables that are assumed to measure access to resources (being a part of a multi-unit firm,and being new due to merger or dispersal) have a positive effect on survival, (iv) the number of employees at the start- up year has a negative effect on the employment growth, and (v) demographic and educational factors are important in explaining survival and growth.

Relying on unique data that cover all establishments, firms and individuals in the Danish private sector, {{we are able to}} distil a number of different subsets from the total set of <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> – subsets which allow us to more precisely capture the "truly new" or "entrepreneurial" establishments than in previous studies. Using these data, we find that while <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> in general account for one third of the gross job creation in the economy, entrepreneurial establishments are responsible for around 25 % of this, and thus only account for about 8 % of total gross job creation in the economy. However, entrepreneurial establishments seem to generate more additional jobs than other <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> in the years following entry. Finally, the jobs generated by entrepreneurial establishments are to a large extent low-wage jobs, as they are not found to contribute to the growth in average wages. job creation; entrepreneurial establishments; wage growth...|$|R
