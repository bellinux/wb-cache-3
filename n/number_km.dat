40|$|Background: Analysis {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} {{is important for}} the authentication of a species. Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a subtropical evergreen tree. Recently, L. chinensis has been characterized by an improved random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers from the improved RAPD fragments for the genetic analysis of L. chinensis. Results: The improved RAPD fragments from L. chinensis were cloned, sequenced and converted into stable SCAR markers. Sequencing of three cloned RAPD fragments revealed that the clone L 7 - 16 consisted of 222 nucleotides (GenBank accession <b>number</b> <b>KM</b> 235222), clone L 9 - 6 consisted of 648 nucleotides (GenBank accession <b>number</b> <b>KM</b> 235223), and clone L 11 - 26 consisted of 369 nucleotides (GenBank accession <b>number</b> <b>KM</b> 235224). Then, specific primers for SCAR markers L 7 - 16, L 9 - 6, and L 11 - 26 were designed and synthesized. PCR amplification was performed using DNA templates from 24 different samples, including 6 samples of L. chinensis and other plants. The SCAR marker L 9 - 6 was specific for all of the L. chinensis samples, the SCAR marker L 11 - 26 specific for five L. chinensis samples, and the SCAR marker L 7 - 16 only specific for the samples from Luzhou. Conclusions: This study developed stable SCAR markers for the identification of L. chinensis by the cloning of the improved RAPD fragments. Combining RAPD and SCAR markers provides a simple and reliable tool for the genetic characterization of plant species...|$|E

Four of the five isozymes were characterized with regard to their physical, chemical and catalytic properties in order to establish their possible physiological significance and to ascertain their molecular basis. The isozymes exhibited identical native (118 Kd) and subunit (59 Kd) molecular weights but had different apparent pi values of 7. 2, 7. 0, 6. 8 and 6. 6. Structural analyses showed that the amino terminus was blocked and the carboxyl terminal sequence was -Glu-Ala-Ser-Gly for all four isozymes. The most basic isozyme was more stable than the more acidic isozymes (lower pi values) at pH extremes, at high ionic strength, in the presence of denaturants or upon exposure to proteases. Kinetic constants, such as turnover <b>number,</b> <b>Km</b> and Ki values, were identical for all isozymes. Identical amino acid composition and peptide mapping by chemical cleavage at methionine and cysteine residues of the isozymes suggest a postsynthetic modification rather then a genetic origin for the in vivo isozymes. When the most basic isozyme was incubated in vitro under mild alkaline conditions, there was a spontaneous generation of the more acidic isozymes with electrophoretic properties identical to those found in vivo.
