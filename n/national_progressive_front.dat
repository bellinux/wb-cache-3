25|$|In {{the same}} month, a {{national}} referendum {{was held to}} confirm Assad as President for a 7-year term. In March 1972, to broaden {{the base of his}} government, Assad formed the <b>National</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Front,</b> a coalition of parties led by the Ba'ath Party, and elections were held to establish local councils in each of Syria's 14 governorates. In March 1973, a new Syrian constitution went into effect followed shortly thereafter by parliamentary elections for the People's Council, the first such elections since 1962. The 1973 Constitution defined Syria as a secular socialist state with Islam recognised as the majority religion.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Jamal al-Atassi {{supported}} Hafez al-Assad {{after the}} a coup that ousted his cousin Nour al-Deen as president. He hoped Assad {{would take a}} harder line on reunification with Egypt. In March 1972, Assad formed the <b>National</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Front,</b> a Baath-led coalition of socialist parties. He invited Atassi, who by this time {{was one of the}} most venerated nationalists in the country, to join a 13-member committee delegated with administering the NPF's political affairs. Realizing that Assad opposed restoring the UAR or the NPF, he left within a year and formed a new organization, the Democratic Arab Socialist Union. Assad promptly outlawed it and sought to isolate Atassi, who was therefore never allowed to enter parliament.|$|E

25|$|While Assad did {{not rule}} alone, he {{increasingly}} had the last word; those with whom he worked eventually became lieutenants, rather than colleagues. None of the political elite would question a decision of his, {{and those who did}} were dismissed. General Naji Jamil is an example, being dismissed after he disagreed with Assad's handling of the Islamic uprising. The two highest decision-making bodies were the Regional Command and the National Command, both part of the Ba'ath Party. Joint sessions of these bodies resembled politburos in socialist states which espoused communism. Assad headed the National Command and the Regional Command as Secretary General and Regional Secretary, respectively. The Regional Command was the highest decision-making body in Syria, appointing the president and (through him) the cabinet. As presidential authority strengthened, the power of the Regional Command and its members evaporated. The Regional and National Commands were nominally responsible to the Regional Congress and the National Congress—with the National Congress the de jure superior body—but the Regional Congress had de facto authority. The National Congress, which included delegates from Ba'athist Regional Branches in other countries, has been compared to the Comintern. It functioned as a session of the Regional Congress focusing on Syria's foreign policy and party ideology. The Regional Congress had limited accountability until the 1985 Eighth Regional Congress, the last under Assad. In 1985, responsibility for leadership accountability was transferred from the Regional Congress to the weaker <b>National</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Front.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The party slogan [...] "Unity, Freedom, Socialism" [...] is {{enshrined}} in {{the constitution of the}} Syrian Arab Republic. The eighth article of the constitution stipulated that [...] "he leading party in the society and the state is the ... Ba'ath Party. It leads the <b>National</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Front</b> seeking to unify the resources of the masses of the people and place them at the service of the goals of the Arab nation." [...] The constitution was adopted in 1973. As per the constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic, it is the Regional Command of the party that nominates the candidate for president of the Republic. The constitution does not explicitly say that the president has to be the leader of the party, but the <b>National</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Front</b> charter states that president of the Syrian Arab Republic and the secretary of the party is also the president of the NPF.|$|E
2500|$|Maher Abd Al-Hafiz Hajjar, {{formerly}} {{from the}} People's Will Party, a 43-year-old MP from Aleppo. This party {{is led by}} veteran opposition leader Qadri Jamil who supported the initial protests in 2011 but then described calls for {{the overthrow of the}} government as [...] "unrealistic and useless". Jamil {{was a member of the}} committee that drafted the new Constitution of Syria in 2011. However, People's Will won just two of 250 MPs in the 2012 parliamentary election with their allies from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party won a further four. Jamil was nominated Deputy Prime Minister by President Assad in June 2012 but was removed in October 2013. The small number of MPs from the party indicates that most of his nominations must have come from either independents or MPs from the ruling <b>National</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Front.</b> A statement from the People's Will Party on 27 April distanced the party from Hajjar, claiming that Hajjar was no longer a member of either the People's Will Party, or the Popular Front for Liberation and Change. Instead the statement claimed that Hajjar represented only himself.|$|E
