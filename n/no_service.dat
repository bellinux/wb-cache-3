5|$|The track layout is {{such that}} each line has its own pair of tracks {{and a pair of}} double {{switches}} between these tracks, and each service has its own island platform serving these tracks. In regular operation, <b>no</b> <b>service</b> needs to cross over the tracks of another service. The tracks are numbered sequentially from east to west, with the N train at tracks 1 and 2; the Q at tracks 3 and 4; the F at tracks 5 and 6; and the D at tracks 7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, a {{week before}} the line's opening, the MTA hosted open houses at 96th Street and 86th Street. The {{entrance}} to the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station at Third Avenue, which was completed as part of Phase 1, opened on December 30. The ceremonial first train, with several prominent officials in attendance, ran on New Year's Eve, and trains began serving the line in regular passenger service at noon the next day. About 48,200 passengers entered the new stations on January 1, excluding passengers who toured the line by entering at a station {{in the rest of the}} system. During the opening week of operation, trains were running every six minutes during peak hours, and there was <b>no</b> <b>service</b> between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The overnight shutdown allowed finishing touches to be placed to avoid leaks and other major issues like those found in the new 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, which had opened a year prior. Overnight service began on January 9, 2017.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} the quake, the Metro stopped {{service and}} {{completely}} shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people {{to get out of the}} tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to get where they were going. At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was <b>no</b> <b>service</b> in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was <b>no</b> <b>service</b> between stations Bellas Artes and Taxqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.|$|E

25|$|The ferry {{service was}} intermittent. It was {{discontinued}} in 1895 due to dwindling returns and then reinstated some years later; {{when there was}} <b>no</b> <b>service</b> to Port Victoria, trains terminated at Sharnal Street. The initial returns for the line as a whole were below expectations: without a direct ferry connection to the continent {{there was little to}} attract customers to this remote region. Nevertheless, the farming community on Hoo took well to the new railway and Sharnal Street station saw good business.|$|E

25|$|No. 76 {{appeared}} late in {{this year}} with a totally enclosed top deck, there being no bulkheads. This car had <b>no</b> <b>service</b> number holders and the number “3” was painted {{at each end of}} the upper deck. These enclosed ends were not popular with the conductors for, when leaning out of the rather narrow end sliding windows to see that all passengers had boarded or alighted, their hats were knocked off unless they had taken the precaution to remove them first.|$|E
25|$|Trains run {{every day}} from the {{beginning}} of April to the end of October and on weekends and selected holidays during the winter (with <b>no</b> <b>service</b> from 24–27 December). Trains are mostly steam-hauled; however in some cases heritage diesel is used. At the height of the running timetable, trains depart hourly from each station. As well as the normal passenger running, there are dining services on some evenings and weekends. The extension of steam operated services to the seaside town of Whitby has proved extremely popular.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} was renewed until in 1889 the N tried to negotiate better terms, {{at which the}} Midland Railway abruptly discontinued the through trains on 1 July 1889. For several days there was <b>no</b> <b>service</b> whatever on the worked section of line. On 6 July 1889 the N started working a skeleton train service itself, with borrowed rolling stock from the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway; Sir Edward Watkin was Chairman of both companies. Following arbitration the Midland Railway resumed working the trains from 22 July 1889.|$|E
