Because microalgal biomass consists of individual cells with rigid cell walls, extraction of useful components from the biomass is often problematic. Extraction and processing with supercritical fluids (SCF) is increasingly gaining importance in the food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries and can be a solution for these specific problems. Carbon dioxide {{is the most common}} supercritical fluid due to its moderate critical temperature (31. 3 oC) and pressure (72. 9 atm) and hence particularly desirable for the extraction of thermally labile natural products. Since the extraction conditions are relatively mild, the residual algal biomass can still be maximally valorized. Because CO 2 is gaseous at room temperature, it yields a solvent free extract. Moreover, carbon dioxide is a <b>non</b> toxic, <b>non</b> <b>flammable,</b> odorless, tasteless and inexpensive gas. The goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to obtain the lipids and other valuable products from microalgae.
