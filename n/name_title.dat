[...] A badge {{may be defined}} as [...] "An armorial device, {{not part of the}} coat of arms, but ... available to an armigerous person or corporation for the purpose of identification." [...] Badges may consist of no more than a charge from the shield of arms, but others were emblems adopted for their hidden meaning or in allusion to a <b>name,</b> <b>title</b> or office. In England, the granting of badges to armigers by the College of Arms has become [...] "commonplace" [...] in recent years.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, the {{particule}} de is omitted when {{citing the}} name of a person without a preceding given <b>name,</b> <b>title</b> (baron, duc etc.), job description (général, colonel, etc.) or polite address (monsieur, madame, mademoiselle). Thus, one would say Monsieur de La Vieuville, but if calling him familiarly by his last name only, La Vieuville (note the initial capital letter); the same applies for Gérard de La Martinière, who would be called La Martinière. Similarly, Philippe de Villiers talks about the votes he receives as le vote Villiers. However, this usage is now losing ground to a more egalitarian treatment of surnames; it is, for instance, commonplace to hear people talking of de Villiers.|$|E

A blue plaque records his long residence at 20 Cavendish Square and a memorial tablet was subsequently erected in Westminster Abbey. Viscount Grey, with Haldane Asquith's oldest political friends, wrote; [...] "I have felt (his) death very much: it is true that his work was done but we were very close together for so many years.

2500|$|In late January 1938, Göring {{wanted to}} dispose of von Fritsch as {{he did not want}} Fritsch to become the {{successor}} to Blomberg and thus his superior. Heydrich resurrected the old file on Fritsch. Meisinger saw it as an opportunity for advancement, since he knew that Himmler and the SS regarded homosexuals as a danger to the regime. However, Meisinger's police work was judged to be sloppy and Heydrich and Müller were dissatisfied. At one point, Meisinger and Huber interrogated Otto Schmidt, a notorious criminal whose Berlin gang specialized in the blackmail of homosexuals. Schmidt identified von Fritsch as a man whom he had witnessed engaging in homosexual acts in 1933. When Meisinger provided a photograph of Fritsch on which was clearly printed Fritsch's <b>name,</b> <b>title</b> and military rank, Schmidt {{jumped at the chance to}} advance himself by slandering the general. Heydrich resubmitted the updated von Fritsch file to Hitler. Werner Best, in describing this incident, called Meisinger [...] "a primitive man with clumsy methods". It was eventually determined that von Fritsch had been confused with Rittmeister Achim von Frisch. The accusations against Fritsch broke down in court and members of the German officer corps were appalled at Fritsch's treatment. Meisinger’s career in the Gestapo was almost terminated.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the first book, fear of another Breaking of the World and the dangers posed by saidin's {{corruption}} are so great that—while increasingly rare—male channelers are now a source of nightmares and terror to most people. The original symbol of the Aes Sedai—a circle separated into black and white halves by a sinuous line symbolizing both halves of the One Power—has been replaced by the Flame of Tar Valon, consisting only of the white half of the original symbol. The male half of the symbol, known as the dragon's fang, is used as a symbol of evil and a curse—often carved onto the doors of those accused of conspiring with the Dark Lord (known as Darkfriends). The term Aes Sedai – used as a <b>name,</b> <b>title</b> and honorific – refers almost exclusively to female channelers, most often specifically referring to members of an exclusive society headquartered in the White Tower in Tar Valon. Divided into several factions identified by color, known as Ajahs, the Aes Sedai present a unified face to the world but often experience great internal conflict. They refer to each other as [...] "sisters" [...] but maintain a rigid hierarchy of authority determined by custom and strength in the One Power.|$|E
2500|$|The Medical Act 1858 made {{it illegal}} for anyone not {{qualified}} in medicine {{to use a}} title that implied they were. This led to prosecutions of people making unauthorised use of the title"Dr". However, it also called into question {{the use of the}} title by licentiates of the Colleges of Physicians – all of whom were, under the new act, allowed to practice throughout the UK. In 1859, the London College reversed its earlier decision, resolving [...] "That the title of Doctor shall not be given in any official document issued from this College to any person who is not possessed of the Degree of Doctor of Medicine". This was followed up in 1860 by new bylaws that stated [...] "No Fellow, Member, or Licentiate of the College shall assume the title of Doctor of Medicine, or use any other <b>name,</b> <b>title,</b> designation or distinction implying that he is a Graduate in Medicine of an University, unless he be a Graduate in Medicine of an University". In Ireland, {{the question of whether the}} license of the [...] Royal College of Physicians of Ireland granted the title of Doctor of Medicine led to a court case in 1861, with the conclusion that it did not. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) observed, however, that anyone wanting the right to the title of [...] "Doctor" [...] could gain it [...] "with a five-shilling degree of Doctor of Philosophy" [...] from abroad, or could simply assume the title, as only [...] "Doctor of Medicine" [...] was actually protected. Debate continued as to the use of [...] "Doctor" [...] as a courtesy title by those who did not use it by right as holders of doctoral degrees, with the BMJ noting in 1876 that [...] "We have again a sort of flood of letters for and against the use of the title of Doctor by physicians" [...] and in 1882 that [...] "There is not any other subject which appears to excite so wide spread an interest as this". In February 1876, a report recommended that the Royal College of Physicians should use the courtesy title of Doctor for all fellows and members, but this was rejected. Then in April of the same year, the College amended its bylaws to forbid any fellow, member, extra-licentiate or licentiate from using the title of Doctor unless they had a doctorate in medicine from a recognised university – closing the loophole the BMJ had identified. It was not until the early 20th century that this was reversed. In 1905 the Royal College of Surgeons passed a motion instructing their council [...] "to take the necessary steps in conjunction with the Royal College of Physicians to ensure that all persons who pass the Conjoint examination shall be legally entitled to call themselves Doctors". The council of the surgeons' College felt it to be impractical to secure the legal right to the title as this would mean gaining the right to award M.D.s, but noted that the title had been used by the public to refer to medics for generations and was used without any legal right by Bachelors of Medicine – the only obstacle to licentiates of both colleges doing the same was the prohibition in the physicians' bylaws. On this occasion the College of Physicians refused to act, but they did finally relent in 1912, removing the clause forbidding the assumption of the title of Doctor. This was described in the American press as [...] "the British apostles of red-tape have been forced to bow to the popular will".|$|E
