40|$|Abstract — The {{present study}} aimed to propose the {{strength}} and stiffness classes of Brazilian timbers in the new Brazilian Code for Design of Timbers Structures (draft <b>code</b> <b>NBR</b> 7190 : 2012). For this purpose {{the strength and}} stiffness properties of forty species of tropical and forestation Brazilian timbers were determined and a rigorous statistical analysis was made. In {{order to determine the}} strength and stiffness classes, approximately 9, 000 individual tests were analyzed, at 12 % moisture content. To analyze the data the multivariate analysis and cluster techniques were used. The statistical results defined two sets of classes: one of softwood species with three classes and the other hardwood species with five classes. The adoption of two sets is due to the significant difference in stiffness properties values between the softwood and hardwood species.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} tests to verify {{the safety of a}} structure already concluded is a load test. When doubts exist about the stability of a structure, due to factors, among other, as quality of the construction materials, use or inadequate maintenance or even a new use of the construction, different from that initially foreseen in the project, a load test is recommended. This work seeks to present the most important criteria that should be considered in a load test. It evaluates procedures of the Brazilian <b>Code</b> (<b>NBR</b> 9607 - 1986), American Code (ACI 318 - 2002), Australian Code (AS 3600 - 2001), Spanish Recommendations (EHE- 1998) and European Recommendations (Rilem TBS- 2 - 1984).

The inclusion of infill walls in the proposed model allows for a quantitative evaluation of structural stresses in these walls and an assessment of cracking in these elements (sliding shear diagonal tension and diagonal compression cracking). This paper presents the results of simulations of single-story one-bay infilled R/C frames. The main objective is to show how to check the serviceability limit states under lateral loads when the infill walls are included in the modeling. The results of numerical simulations allowed for an evaluation of stresses and the probable cracking pattern in infill walls.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{systems with}} waffle flat slabs {{are the most}} used in Brazil when the main requirement is flexible “layouts ” and long spans with reason-able economy. However, {{few studies have been}} developed in Brazil regarding the behavior of these slabs when the flexural resistance is satisfac-tory and the shear in the ribs and punching resistances become competitive. This work shows the experimental analysis of 8 two-way reinforced concrete waffle flat slabs under centered load. The dimensions of the slabs were the same and equal to 1800 mm x 1800 mm x 140 mm. The ribs were 80 mm (height) by 50 mm (width) and the compressive concrete strength was approximately 40 MPa. The experimental results were compared to those estimated by the Brazilian <b>code</b> <b>NBR</b> 6118 : 2003. It was verified that the resistance of the ribs is not satisfactorily estimated by the code, which excessively underestimates the results for ribs with and without shear reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|New {{live load}} models for highway bridge design in Brazil are under {{development}} by assembling real traffic database, traffic simulations, analytical-numerical modeling {{of the dynamic}} interaction between vehicle and structure and statistical extrapolations. This paper presents and discusses the results obtained in the first stages of this work which includes the comparison between the static effects due to the actual traffic of heavy vehicles and those generated by the live load model given in the current national <b>code</b> <b>NBR</b> 7188. It is demonstrated that this live load model is not appropriate to represent the actual traffic effects and may be, in some cases, non-conservative. The present work deals with short span bridges for two lanes single carriageway under free flow traffic scenarios. The representative static effects in these bridges due to the actual traffic of heavy vehicles are obtained by extrapolating its probability density functions to a certain return period. To this purpose, a traffic database was constructed by gathering data from several weighing stations in Brazilian highways which was then applied to perform traffic simulations through a specially developed computational tool...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{analysis of the}} confinement effects in steel-concrete composite columns regarding two parameters: concrete compressive strength and column slenderness. Sixteen concrete-filled steel tubular columns with circular cross section were tested under axial loading. The tested columns were filled by concrete with compressive strengths of 30, 60. 80, and 100 MPa, and had length/diameter ratios of 3, 5, 7, and 10. The experimental values of the columns` ultimate load were compared to the predictions of 4 code provisions: the Brazilian <b>Code</b> <b>NBR</b> 8800 : 2008, Eurocode 4 (EN 1994 - 1 - 1 : 2004), AINSI/AISC 360 : 2005, and CAN/CSA S 16 - 01 : 2001. According to the results, the load capacity of the composite columns increased with increasing concrete strength and decreased with increasing length/diameter ratio. In general, the code provisions were highly accurate in the prediction of column capacity. Among them, the Brazilian Code was the most conservative, while Eurocode 4 presented the values closest to the experimental results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The traditional calculation methods, obtained in the NBR 6118, are presented along with the modifications which had to be implemented in order to allow for incremental loss calculations. Usage examples and results are presented, validating the adopted methodology. At the end of the software's calculation, the user receives two outputs: the prestress' equivalent loads in the Robot model and an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet contains the resultant stresses in the beam and warns whether these are greater than the permissible stresses in the SLS stress check. The loads may then be used in other calculations, such as shear reinforcement...|$|R

The Brazilian <b>Code</b> <b>NBR</b> 7190 – Design of Wooden Structures, foresees the strength correction to the normal stress, whenever α > 6 o, and it recommends to apply Hankinson’s expression to design values. However, this referred code is omitted about this correction to the tangential stress.

The objectives of this work were: to search in the bibliography other used expressions; to verify the validity of these expressions, to represent the variation of the shear strength, with the α angle; and, to verify the validity of application of these expressions in characteristic values. For this, a sample formed by twelve boards was used. From each board, specimens to shear tests were retired, with different fibers inclinations, which were tested in agreement with current NBR 7190, supplying the shear strength, for different α values.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the reliability-based calibration of partial safety factors for Brazilian design <b>codes</b> <b>NBR</b> 8681 : 2003 (Actions and Safety of Structures) and NBR 8800 : 2008 (Design of Steel and Steel-Concrete Composite Structures). To the author’s knowledge, these codes {{have never been}} subject to reliability-based calibration of partial and load combination factors. This paper represents a first effort in reaching this goal. The present calibration effort is based on actual data for wind loads in south east of Brazil, but uses mainly international data for other problem parameters. So far, the investigation is limited to structural steel members. The investigation leads {{to a set of}} optimized partial safety factors, which are compared to partial factors currently used in Brazilian design codes. Results show that the optimized set of partial factors leads to more uniform reliability for different design situations and load combinations. The investigation includes an analysis of the economical impact of replacing the current set of partial factors by the calibrated factors found in this paper. It is shown that, with an optimized set of partial safety factors, it is possible to maintain the current level of reliability and still produce a 5 % average reduction in expenditure with structural materials, nationwide. The paper also points to general similarities between Brazilian design codes, the new generation of EUROCODES and American ANSI/AISC codes. These codes are compared in terms of their ability to produce uniform reliability for different design situations...|$|R
30|$|Concrete-filled {{steel tube}} columns (CFTC) are steel-reinforced {{concrete}} structures. The proposed methods for {{the calculation of}} a CFTC’s bearing capacity stipulated in regulatory instruments {{in a range of}} countries, e.g., Australia (Standard Australia AS 5100.6 - 2004), Brazil (Brazilian <b>Code</b> <b>NBR</b> 8800 : 2008), Canada (CAN/CSA S 16 - 01 : 2001), People’s Republic of China (China Standard GB 50010 - 2010), Russia (CR 266.1325800. 2016), and the USA (AINSI/AISC 360 : 2005), as well as the general European regulations (Eurocode EN 1994 - 1 - 1 : 2004), are essentially based upon empirical formulas. They have significant limitations in practical application, since they were obtained either from the results of specific laboratory sample tests (Furlong 1967; Tang et al. 1982; Saatcioglu and Razvi 1992; Shams and Saadeghvaziri 1997; Tsuda et al. 2000; Nishiyama et al. 2002; Johanson 2002; Fujimoto et al. 2004; Han 2007; Tao et al. 2008; Fattah 2012) or by the statistical processing of relevant data (Mander et al. 1988). First, these formulas are valid only for heavy concrete. For instance, {{in the case of the}} fine-grain concrete columns, they provide excessively high estimates. In compliance with the published results (Karpenko 1996), one can observe a significantly smaller gain in strength for fine-grain concrete under volumetric compression. When self-stressing concrete is used, such methods are not acceptable, as they do not take into account the pre-stress of the concrete core. Furthermore, empirical formulas are generally obtained by the results of research on small-scale samples, and their use often results in significant errors in the calculation of a bearing capacity for CFTCs with large cross-sections (500  mm and more). This is confirmed by the results of experiments on CFTCs having section diameters of 630 – 1020  mm (Fonov et al. 1989). In addition, these methods generally do not allow making consistent calculations of eccentrically compressed CFTCs when they have any differences from a “classical” design. Examples include the presence of a high-strength rod and (or) spiral reinforcement in a concrete core, which can be rather efficiently used in CFTCs. To calculate the stresses in such a reinforcement, if possible, it is necessary to obtain sample the axial and circumferential deformations. The known calculation methods for the strength of compressed CFTCs do not provide such an opportunity (Krishan et al. 2016).|$|R

Estas verificações e análises se fazem necessárias porque a NBR 8798 (1985) ainda especifica a colocação de argamassa em todas as paredes dos blocos (argamassa plena), embora o que mais se tem observado nas nossas construções é a colocação de argamassa apenas nas paredinhas longitudinais. Além disso, essas verificações se tornam mais necessárias quando se sabe que esse tipo de assentamento é o mais usado nos países mais ricos e desenvolvidos do mundo. Para a determinação do valor dessa redução, bem como para melhor compreender a ruptura das paredes com esses dois tipos de assentamento, foram ensaiados corpos-de-prova de blocos, prismas eparedes de 1, 00 m de altura, na idade de 14 dias, com argamassa plena e longitudinal. Todos os ensaios foram feitos com blocos de concreto e com blocos cerâmicos. Finalizando, após evidenciar as deficiências dos atuais modelos de prismas, principalmente dos prismas com argamassa longitudinal, este trabalho tem como um último objetivo propor novos modelos de prismas para ensaios, em conformidade com os tipos de assentamentoAbstract: The {{two main}} aims {{of this work}} are to verify and analyze the {{reduction}} of the compressive strength of structural masonry walls, when the blocks are laid with mortar only in the outside faces of the block (face shell bedding).

Besides, these verifications are important because we notice that the face shell bedding is used in the richest countries. In order to find the magnitude of this reduction and to understand the collapse of the two types of bedding, 14 days old specimens of blocks, prisms and wallettes of one meter height were tested, with face shell and full mortar bedding.

Devido ao baixo peso e a inexistência de terremotos significativos no Brasil, a força de vento é o fator determinante do projeto destas estruturas. Com o objetivo de determinar estas forças e seus efeitos em torres treliçadas foram {{realizadas}} investigações numéricas e experimentais. Uma torre de 100 metros foi dimensionada com base nos padrões existentes no Brasil. Examinou-se a resposta dinâmica da estrutura ao longo do vento. Investigaram-se a resposta ressonante, não ressonante e o fator resposta de rajada. Concluiu-se que a resposta ressonante não é significativa para este tipo de estrutura. Compararam-se os modelos de DAVENPORT (1993), da norma Brasileira NBR 6123 / 88 e o processo do vento sintético de FRANCO (1993). Uma investigação experimental foi realizada para analisar os coeficientes de força em uma seção da torre estudada. Os experimentos foram realizados no Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL) da University of Western Ontario (UWO), Canadá. Foram analisados o ângulo de incidência do vento; o índice de área exposta; o efeito de proteção; o fator de interferência no coeficiente de arrasto de antenas de microondas, devido à proximidade da torre e a influência da turbulência do vento. Os resultados mostraram boa concordância com os valores obtidos em diferentes normas existentes. With todays expanding communication systems, a {{large number}} of lattice towers to support cellular and microwave antennas are being constructed in Brazil. Due to the lightweight of these structures, wind forces are the primary concern in the design. With the objective of determining these forces and their effects upon latticed towers, a numerical and experimental investigation is accomplished. A 100 -meter tower is designed based on existing patterns of latticed towers in Brazil. The along wind dynamic response is analysed. The resonant, background response and gust factor are examined. It is concluded that the resonant response is not significant for this type of structure.
