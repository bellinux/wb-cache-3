5|$|The {{federal tax}} credit for new plug-in {{electric}} vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 5 kWh, and {{the portion of the}} credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the total amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Several states have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEV, and other <b>non-monetary</b> incentives.|$|E
5|$|The {{lectures and}} book had been {{originally}} scheduled for 2009, but were {{moved up to}} 2008 to avoid conflicting with Atwood's forthcoming novel after the latter book was delayed by its publisher. The content examines borrowing and lending from financial, psychological, theological, literary, and ecological points of view. Its release coincided with extensive {{media coverage of the}} recent financial crisis which led numerous critics to comment on the book's timeliness. In the Canadian market, the book peaked at #1 on The Globe and Mail bestseller list on October 25 and out-sold all previous Massey Lecture books. Critics found the book well-researched, thought-provoking, and humorous. Various reviewers found the discussions on the <b>non-monetary</b> aspects of debt to be the better parts of the book, while some critics identified the sections on ecological debt as the worse parts of the book.|$|E
5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of <b>non-monetary</b> objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
25|$|Other forms include venture {{resources}} {{that seek to}} provide <b>non-monetary</b> support to launch a new venture.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the California Fair Political Practices Commission fined the LDS {{church for}} failing to follow {{campaign}} disclosure policies {{during the last two}} weeks leading up to the election, which amounted to $37,000 in <b>non-monetary</b> contributions. They were fined $5,538.|$|E
25|$|For {{historical}} reasons, Swiss {{federal law}} only covers {{the enforcement of}} monetary debts payable in Swiss francs, while <b>non-monetary</b> obligations are enforced according to cantonal rules of procedure. These cantonal rules of procedure will in 2011 be replaced by Switzerland's first national Code of Civil Procedure (Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung, ZPO).|$|E
25|$|The use of barter-like methods may {{date back}} to at least 100,000 years ago, {{though there is no}} {{evidence}} of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter. Instead, <b>non-monetary</b> societies operated largely along the principles of gift economy and debt. When barter did in fact occur, it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies.|$|E
25|$|Claimants with <b>non-monetary</b> {{claims against}} the company {{may be able to}} enforce their rights {{against the company}}. For example, a party who had a valid {{contract}} for the purchase of land against the company may be able to obtain an order for specific performance, and compel the liquidator to transfer title to the land to them, upon tender of the purchase price.|$|E
25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other <b>non-monetary</b> value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and <b>non-monetary</b> gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
25|$|Under its National Plattform for Electric Mobility, Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2010 set {{the goal}} of putting one million {{electric}} vehicles on German roads by 2020. Initially, {{the government did not}} provide subsidies in favor of research. The Bundestag passed the Electric Mobility Act in March 2015 that authorized local government to grant <b>non-monetary</b> incentives. The measures privilege battery-powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some PHEVs, by granting local governments the authority to offer additional incentives.|$|E
25|$|Also, since Russia's {{economy was}} {{operating}} {{to such a}} large extent on barter and other <b>non-monetary</b> instruments of exchange, the financial collapse had far less of an impact on many producers than it would had the economy been dependent on a banking system. Finally, the economy had been helped by an infusion of cash. As enterprises were able to pay off debts in back wages and taxes, in turn consumer demand {{for goods and services}} produced by the Russian industry began to rise.|$|E
25|$|The IACHR began {{processing}} the complaint, received a partial {{recognition of the}} state's institutional responsibility from democratically elected president Alfonso Portillo {{in the first year}} of his term, and finally referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for judgement and settlement. In 2004, the Inter-American Court issued two judgements, in which it established Guatemala's liability in the case and ordered an extensive package of monetary, <b>non-monetary</b> and symbolic forms of compensation for the survivors and the next-of-kin of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, , a {{documentary}} alleging {{the involvement of}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the passage of Proposition 8. Written by Reed Cowan and narrated by Dustin Lance Black, the film divided critics over a perceived heavy-handed approach to the church's involvement; it won the 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary. Attention to the Mormon involvement was justified given that, among other <b>non-monetary</b> efforts, Mormons and the Mormon Church spent over $20 million to support the passage of Proposition 8.|$|E
25|$|The {{monetary}} explanation has two weaknesses. First it is {{not able}} to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31. Second {{it is not}} able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the Money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add <b>non-monetary</b> explanations.|$|E
25|$|Economists and {{economic}} historians are almost evenly split {{as to whether}} the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression. Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add <b>non-monetary</b> explanations.|$|E
25|$|The {{solvency}} constraint of {{the standard}} central bank only requires that the present discounted value of its net <b>non-monetary</b> liabilities (separate from its monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities only in name, as they are irredeemable: the holder of base money cannot insist at any time on the redemption of a given amount of base money into anything else other than {{the same amount of}} itself (base money)—unless, of course, the holder of said base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan.|$|E
25|$|As {{a medium}} of exchange, money {{facilitates}} trade. It {{is essentially a}} measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (<b>non-monetary</b> exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants {{as to what is}} exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.|$|E
25|$|The IPCC TAR WGII report (Impacts, Adaptation Vulnerability) {{notes that}} {{current and future}} climate change would be {{expected}} to have a number of impacts, particularly on coastal systems. Such impacts may include increased coastal erosion, higher storm-surge flooding, inhibition of primary production processes, more extensive coastal inundation, changes in surface water quality and groundwater characteristics, increased loss of property and coastal habitats, increased flood risk and potential loss of life, loss of <b>non-monetary</b> cultural resources and values, impacts on agriculture and aquaculture through decline in soil and water quality, and loss of tourism, recreation, and transportation functions.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2017, Revis was {{involved}} in a street brawl in Pittsburgh around 2:40a.m. Revis was suspected to have attacked two men, knocking them unconscious. One follower attempted to record Revis on a cell phone, prompting Revis to snatch the phone and throw it out at the street. That night, Revis was charged for aggravated assault, robbery, terroristic threats and conspiracy stemming. Revis turned himself into police the following day and was released on <b>non-monetary</b> bond. All charges were dismissed March 15 after a friend of Revis testified that he was responsible for knocking the two men out.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Tanana Athabaskans {{is a mixed}} cash-subsistence system, like other modern {{foraging}} economies in Alaska. The subsistence economy is main <b>non-monetary</b> economy system. Cash is often a rare commodity in foraging economies, {{because of lack of}} employment opportunities or perceived conflicts in the demands of wage employment and subsistence harvesting activities. The primary use of wild resources is domestic. Wild resource use in many Athabaskan villages is overwhelmingly for domestic consumption, since commercial fishing in Alaska is absent. Commercial fishing and trapping patterns are controlled primarily by external factors. The state's limited entry system, operational by 1974 (after ANCSA), limits the number of available fishing permits for commercial salmon (esp. the Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus species for salmon cannery) fishing. In Nenana, about one-third of households have a permit. Most (70%) sample households with a permit used. Those with a permit that did not fish commercially, did fish for subsistence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} is the unavailability {{of a jury}} in equity: the judge is the trier of fact. In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment in Suits at common law, cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The {{question of whether a}} case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other <b>non-monetary</b> relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.|$|E
25|$|Democrats {{support a}} more {{progressive}} tax structure {{to provide more}} services and reduce economic inequality by {{making sure that the}} wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes. Democrats support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military. They oppose the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and various other welfare programs, believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice. Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and <b>non-monetary</b> terms, are a more productive labor force and cultured population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing positive freedom, i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) budget rule {{at the start of the}} 110th Congress.|$|E
25|$|Puntland has {{the lowest}} rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, {{compared}} to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts believe {{this is because of}} higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty {{does not appear to be}} driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on <b>non-monetary</b> indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.|$|E
25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} discussion document {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before {{the overthrow of the}} capitalist class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging the growth of the <b>non-monetary,</b> voluntary sector of the economy and should be instrumental in developing support networks for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the non-market socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the small World In Common group.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{found the}} book well-researched and thought-provoking. Reviewers enjoyed Atwood's humour and {{conversational}} writing. The style {{was described as}} [...] "eclectic", a [...] "literary walkabout", and [...] "anecdotally rich". Novelist David Liss wrote that the book was [...] "delightfully engaging, smart, funny, [...] clever". Canadian writer Charles Foran called the book [...] "serious adult fun" [...] that [...] "displays some of the energy of a lively dinner party, one replete with anecdotes and opinions, witticisms and barbs". The book's most entertaining parts are discussions on <b>non-monetary</b> debts and debts portrayed in literature. Regarding the speeches, the reviewer for The Montreal Gazette wrote: [...] "Her delivery, as usual, was smooth, relentlessly paced, but with precise pauses for the frequent, much-appreciated laugh lines." [...] John N. Gray, in The New York Review of Books, wrote that [...] "Atwood has combined rigorous analysis, wide-ranging erudition, and a beguilingly playful imagination". The Library Journal recommended the book for all libraries.|$|E
