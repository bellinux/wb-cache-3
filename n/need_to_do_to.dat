25|$|Atwater: As to {{the whole}} Southern {{strategy}} that Harry S. Dent, Sr. and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act {{would have been a}} central part of keeping the South. Now you don't have to do that. All that you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues that he's campaigned on since 1964, and that's fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.|$|E
25|$|On {{hearing this}} Duryodhana closed all the fingers and rested. Duryodhana {{concluded}} that these 3 factors should have surely brought him victory. Had {{he built a}} fort around Hastinapur, he could have totally avoided {{the war in the}} first place. If Vidura had fought on his side, he would have had the best strategist, even better than Krishna. At last, Duryodhana {{came to the conclusion that}} Krishna was in fact the avatar of Lord Vishnu. If Duryodhana had named Ashwatthama the commander of the army after the death of Drona, victory would have surely be his as Ashwatthama was the avatar of Lord Shiva. No one can handle a 'furious' Ashwatthama, the part incarnate of Lord Shiva. All Duryodhana <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> win the war was to make Ashwatthama furious. The remorse about under-utilizing Ashwatthama prompted Duryodhana to rethink and make Ashwatthama the commander of his army after the war, after his defeat. These events led to the complete destruction of the Pandavas' army. After the night raid of Ashwatthama on the Pandava camp, Duryodhana felt like he had won the war, as the Pandavas lost everything and everyone they cared about.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E

2500|$|The Capistrano {{decision}} also {{rejected the}} argument that higher water tier prices that exceed the cost of service may be justified as “penalties” not within the purview of Proposition 218 restrictions. [...] In holding that this argument is inconsistent with Proposition 218, the court stated that “t would open up a loophole in article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (b)(3) [...] so large it would virtually repeal it. All an agency supplying any service would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> circumvent article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (b)(3), would be to establish a low legal base use for that service, pass an ordinance {{to the effect that}} any usage above the base amount is illegal, and then decree that the penalty for such illegal usage equals the incrementally increased rate for that service. Such a methodology could easily yield rates that have no relation at all to the actual cost of providing the service at the penalty levels. And it would make a mockery of the Constitution.” ...|$|E
