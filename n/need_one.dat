5|$|And Yet It Moves {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The PC version gained aggregate {{scores of}} 71.50% and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85.30% and 83. Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, but felt the game was too short. Some critics noted {{the absence of any}} narrative or backstory, but felt that the game ultimately didn't <b>need</b> <b>one,</b> though GameSpot noted it as one of the game's weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and {{the signing}} of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a {{requirement}} for Germany {{to reduce the size of}} its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this <b>need,</b> <b>one</b> of the Marinefliegers Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids <b>need</b> <b>one</b> last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would <b>need</b> <b>one.</b> As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not <b>need</b> <b>one.</b> Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that they}} <b>need</b> <b>one</b> big show {{to raise the}} {{necessary}} money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive the Chicago area promoting the concert—and alerting the police, the Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract—more than enough {{to pay off the}} orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU—and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-fiancée. After her volley of M16 rifle bullets leaves them miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she accepts, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.|$|E
