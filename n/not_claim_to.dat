5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E

As such {{he argues that the}} theory of a universe without a God is preferable to the theory of a universe with a God.|$|E

25|$|Post-modernism was {{introduced}} to Urdu literature by Gopi Chand Narang. Many other critics in Urdu literature are also attached to this approach to criticism. Post-modernism does <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be a movement and does not demand any writer to adopt a particular style of writing. It generally concentrates on a method of understanding contemporary literature {{in the light of}} its content—mostly examining features like feminism, dalit, regional and other types of literature as opposed to seeking uniformity in the global literature on the basis of internationally established trends.|$|E
25|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court {{struck down}} a Texas statute prohibiting {{homosexual}} sodomy on substantive due process grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual sodomy, and not heterosexual sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne, and also relied in part on Romer. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> apply {{a higher level of}} scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, MIT Writing Director Pavan Sreekireddy plotted essay length versus essay {{score on}} the new SAT from {{released}} essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying over 50 graded essays, he found that longer essays consistently produced higher scores. In fact, he argues that by simply gauging the length of an essay without reading it, the given score of an essay could likely be determined correctly over 90% of the time. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors; the College Board does <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> grade for factual accuracy.|$|E

25|$|The Christian gospels do <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> {{provide an}} {{exhaustive}} {{list of the}} events in the life of Jesus. They were written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity rather than historical chronicles, and their authors showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. One indication that the gospels are theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one-third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, also known as the Passion of Christ.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{teaches the}} oral traditions by example, {{presenting}} actual cases {{being brought to}} judgment, usually along with {{the debate on the}} matter and the judgment that was given by a notable rabbi based on halakha, mitzvot, and spirit of the teaching ("Torah") that guided his decision. In this way, it brings to everyday reality the practice of the mitzvot as presented in the Torah, and aims to cover all aspects of human living, serve as an example for future judgments, and, most important, demonstrate pragmatic exercise of the Biblical laws, which was much needed since the time when the Second Temple was destroyed (70 CE). The Mishnah does <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be the development of new laws, but rather the collection of existing traditions.|$|E
25|$|A few congregations of Strangites, however, {{remained}} {{loyal to}} their prophet's memory. Wingfield W.

Strang's disciples today are divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding High Priest, who does <b>not</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> have the authority or office possessed by Smith or Strang. The other claims that this first assemblage is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961 and allegedly organizing a new order of the priesthood to rule them and a new man-made set of laws to govern them, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang's organization. This second group claims {{that it is the}} sole true remnant of Strang's church.|$|E
