40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) at the nanoscale is a major challenge, as conventional systems require relatively large ensembles of spins and limit resolution to mesoscopic scales. New approaches based on quantum spin probes, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, have recently achieved nano-NMR under ambient conditions. However, the measurement protocols require application of complex microwave pulse sequences of high precision and relatively high power, placing limitations on the design and scalability of these techniques. Here we demonstrate a microwave-free method for <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> using the NV centre, which is a far less invasive, and vastly simpler measurement protocol. By utilising a carefully tuned magnetic cross-relaxation interaction between a subsurface NV spin and an external, organic environment of proton spins, we demonstrate NMR spectroscopy of ^ 1 H within a ≈(10 nm) ^ 3 sensing volume. We also theoretically and experimentally show that the sensitivity of our approach matches that of existing microwave control-based techniques using the NV centre. Removing the requirement for coherent manipulation of either the NV or the environmental spin quantum states represents a significant step towards the development of robust, non-invasive <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> probes.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) and {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) are well-established techniques that provide valuable information in a diverse set of disciplines but are currently limited to macroscopic sample volumes. Here we demonstrate <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> spectroscopy and imaging under ambient conditions of samples containing multiple nuclear species, using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centres in diamond as sensors. With single, shallow NV centres in a diamond chip and samples placed on the diamond surface, we perform NMR spectroscopy and one-dimensional MRI on few-nanometre-sized samples containing ^ 1 H and ^ 19 F nuclei. Alternatively, we employ a high-density NV layer near {{the surface of a}} diamond chip to demonstrate wide-field optical NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale samples containing ^ 1 H, ^ 19 F, and ^ 31 P nuclei, as well as multi-species two-dimensional optical MRI with sub-micron resolution. For all diamond samples exposed to air, we identify a ubiquitous ^ 1 H NMR signal, consistent with a ∼ 1 nm layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons or water on the diamond surface and below any sample placed on the diamond. This work lays the foundation for <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> and MRI applications such as studies of single proteins and functional biological imaging with subcellular resolution, as well as characterization of thin films with sub-nanometre resolution...|$|E

NV centers were created by shallow ion implantation followed by a slow, nanometer-by-nanometer removal of diamond material using oxidative etching in air.

Analysis reveals a double-Lorentzian noise spectra consistent with a surface electronic spin bath, with slower dynamics due to spin-spin interactions and faster dynamics related to phononic coupling. These results shed new light on the mechanisms responsible for surface noise affecting shallow spins at semiconductor interfaces, and suggests possible directions for further studies.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} theoretically that {{by placing}} a ferromagnetic particle between a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer and a target spin, the magnetometer sensitivity is increased dramatically. Specifically, using materials and techniques already experimentally available, we find that {{by taking advantage of}} the ferromagnetic resonance the minimum magnetic moment that can be measured is smaller by four orders of magnitude in comparison to current state-of-the-art magnetometers. As such, our proposed setup is sensitive enough to detect a single nuclear spin at a distance of $ 30 $~nm from the surface within less than one second of data acquisition at room temperature. Our proposal opens the door for <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> on biological material under ambient conditions. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) has enormous applications. Two-dimensional NMR {{is an essential}} technique to characterize correlations between nuclei and, hence, molecule structures. Towards {{the ultimate goal of}} single-molecule NMR, dynamical-decoupling- (DD) enhanced diamond quantum sensing enables the detection of single nuclear spins and <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR.</b> However, there is still the lack of a standard method in DD-based quantum sensing to characterize correlations between nuclear spins in single molecules. Here we present a scheme of two-dimensional DD-based quantum sensing, as a universal method for correlation spectroscopy of single molecules. We design two-dimensional DD sequences composed of two sets of periodic DD sequences with different periods, which can be independently set to match two different transition frequencies for resonant DD. We find that under the resonant DD condition the sensor coherence patterns, as functions of the two independent pulse numbers of DD subsequences, can fully determine different types of correlations between nuclear spin transitions. This work offers a systematic approach to correlation spectroscopy for single-molecule NMR. Comment: 23 pages, 3 figures + 8 page supplemen...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new framework of dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) schemes for transferring polarisation from electron to nuclear spins by Hamiltonian engineering. Contrary to current pulsed DNP sequences for which the polarisation transfer occurs during a long pulse (e. g. spin-locking), the polarisation transfer in the new framework occurs through the accumulated dynamics between very fast pulses. In contrast to current schemes, where the pulse amplitude is limited by matching a Hartmann-Hahn resonance, in the new framework the resonance with the nuclear spins is achieved by the spacing between the pulses, thus affording much greater flexibility and robustness to the sequence. We show that for a sequence built according to the framework, termed PulsePol, robustness of detuning or electron spectral width and pulse errors can be greatly enhanced at negligible efficiency cost. As a key application for the method, we demonstrate the efficiency and remarkable robustness of PulsePol in transferring polarisation from an optically polarised Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre in diamond to the surrounding $^{ 13 }$C nuclear spin bath over a range of ~ 60 MHz detuning. This promises to overcome challenges due to disorder in near surface NV ensembles in hyperpolarisation of external molecules, e. g. for high sensitivity <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) {{center in}} diamond is a {{promising}} quantum metrology tool finding applications across disciplines. The spin sensor measures magnetic fields, electric fields and temperature with nano-scale precision and is fully operable under ambient conditions. Moreover, it achieves precision scaling inversely with total measurement time sigma(B) proportional to 1 /T (Heisenberg scaling) {{rather than as}} the inverse of the square root of T, with sigma(B) = 1 /root T the Shot-Noise limit. This scaling {{can be achieved by}} means of phase estimation algorithms (PEAs), in combination with single-shot read-out. Despite their accuracy, the range of applicability of PEAs is limited to sensing single frequencies with negligible temporal fluctuations. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals from molecules often contain multifrequency components and sensing them using PEA is ruled out. Here we propose an alternative method for precision magnetometry in frequency multiplexed signals via compressive sensing (CS) techniques focusing on <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR.</b> We show that CS can provide for precision scaling approximately as sigma(B) approximate to 1 /T, as well as for a 5 -fold increase in sensitivity over dynamic-range gain, in addition to reducing the total number of resources required. We illustrate our method by taking model solid-state spectra of Glycine acquired under Magic Angle Spinning conditions...|$|E
40|$|The nuclear spins in nanostructured {{semiconductors}} play {{a central}} role in quantum applications(1 - 4). The nuclear spins represent a useful resource for generating local magnetic(5) fields but nuclear spin noise represents a major source of dephasing for spin qubits(2, 3). Controlling the nuclear spins enhances the resource while suppressing the noise. NMR techniques are challenging: the group III and V isotopes have large spins with widely different gyromagnetic ratios; in strained material there are large atom-dependent quadrupole shifts(6); and <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> is hard to detect(7, 8). We report NMR on 100, 000 nuclear spins of a quantum dot using chirped radiofrequency pulses. Following polarization, we demonstrate a reversal of the nuclear spin. We can flip the nuclear spin back and forth a hundred times. We demonstrate that chirped NMR is a powerful way of determining the chemical composition, the initial nuclear spin temperatures and quadrupole frequency distributions for all the main isotopes. The key observation is a plateau in the NMR signal as a function of sweep rate: we achieve inversion at the first quantum transition for all isotopes simultaneously. These experiments represent a generic technique for manipulating nanoscale inhomogeneous nuclear spin ensembles and open the way to probe the coherence of such mesoscopic systems...|$|E
40|$|Single-molecule {{sensitivity}} of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) and angstrom resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the highest challenges in magnetic microscopy. Recent development in dynamical-decoupling- (DD) enhanced diamond quantum sensing has enabled single-nucleus NMR and <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR.</b> Similar to conventional NMR and MRI, current DD-based quantum sensing utilizes the frequency fingerprints of target nuclear spins. The frequency fingerprints by their nature cannot resolve different nuclear spins that have the same noise frequency or differentiate different types of correlations in nuclear-spin clusters, which limit the resolution of single-molecule MRI. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by using wave-function fingerprints of target nuclear spins, {{which is much more}} sensitive than the frequency fingerprints to the weak hyperfine interaction between the targets and a sensor under resonant DD control. We demonstrate a scheme of angstrom-resolution MRI that is capable of counting and individually localizing single nuclear spins of the same frequency and characterizing the correlations in nuclear-spin clusters. A nitrogen-vacancy-center spin sensor near a diamond surface, provided that the coherence time is improved by surface engineering in the near future, may be employed to determine with angstrom resolution the positions and conformation of single molecules that are isotope labeled. The scheme in this work offers an approach to breaking the resolution limit set by the frequency gradients in conventional MRI and to reaching the angstrom-scale resolution.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method of}} mechanically detecting magnetic resonance. The detector consists of a ferromagnet harmonically bound to a mechanical resonator and measures a magnetic force of interaction with a nearby sample via dipole-dipole coupling. Flexural modes of vibration of the resonator are induced by inversion of the sample magnetization at the mechanical resonance frequency of the device. In this method, a nominally homogeneous field at the sample allows coherent spectroscopy over the entire sample volume. Sensitivity analyses suggest that encoding an NMR signal into mechanical oscillations favors inductive detection at the micron scale and below with Brownian motion of the detection being the predominant source of noise and azimuthal eddy currents being the predominant source of damping. As such, the design issues of a MEMS-based spectrometer optimized for 50 micron samples have been investigated. Finite element methods were used and the results for magnetic softening effects, mechanical stresses, field homogeneity, magnet design, radiofrequency excitation, and the utility of capacitive transduction to provide tuning of the oscillator’s mechanical resonance frequency and active shimming are discussed. A piezeoelectrically actuated microvalve is proposed {{as part of a}} microfluidic device to allow shuttling of liquid samples. We present a new means of fiber-optic interferometry for geometrically confined regions in which the light exits transverse to core axis. The use of a composite magnetic array of packed nanoparticles may reduce the damping by 10 4. The portability of the spectrometer will allow in situ spectroscopy and towards that end 14 N overtone experiments were simulated. Force-detection of this transition is superior not only at reduced size scales, but over a broad range of magnetic field strengths. The line narrowing observed by detecting the overtone transition should allow detailed spectroscopic analysis not possible by observing the quadrupolar broadened first-order spectrum. Simulations for a representative class of tholins suggest that the overtone linewidths is of order tens of kHz. We conclude by discussing the feasibility of <b>nanoscale</b> <b>NMR</b> using torque detection of spin-locked, transverse magnetization, include a derivation of the signal-to-noise and detector optimization, and comment on the fundamental limitations of quantum statistical noise. </p...|$|E
