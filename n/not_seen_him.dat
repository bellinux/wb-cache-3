5|$|Upon {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Yankees, Wensloff spent the 1943 season on the Yankees' major league roster. During spring training, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy had heard impressive things about Wensloff, though he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> pitch often. Wensloff made his major league debut for the Yankees on May 2, 1943 against the Washington Senators. In his debut, the second game of a doubleheader, he allowed four earned runs and seven hits in eight innings as the Yankees lost, 41. He won his first game in his next pitching appearance on May 7, 1943 against the Philadelphia Athletics, allowing no walks and six hits in a 62 victory. By the end of June, he had six complete games in his first six starts. However, he was not receiving the publicity other rookies were, such as pitcher Jesse Flores, and had four wins and four losses despite how well he had been pitching.|$|E

25|$|Cicero {{was one of}} {{the most}} viciously and doggedly hunted among the proscribed. He was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was caught December7, 43BC leaving his villa in Formiae in a litter going to the seaside where he hoped to embark on a ship destined for Macedonia. When his killers – Herennius (a centurion) and Popilius (a tribune) – arrived, Cicero's own slaves said they had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> but he was given away by Philologus, a freed slave of his brother Quintus Cicero.|$|E

At their first gig King heard Tilders from backstage but had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> King assumed that he was black and expressed surprise when the two were introduced. For Tilders' next album, Working Man, he used a backing band of Jim Conway on harmonica (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band); Ray Arnott on drums, John Dubois on bass guitar, and Kerryn Tolhurst on mandolin and dobro (all from The Dingoes); and Jeff King on dobro (The Foreday Riders).|$|E

When he comes to, he argues with Carol and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) asks who he is. At that point, Alfie enters and recognises Eddie. Kat does not want Eddie to stay as {{she does not want}} him to know that Michael is Tommy's birth father. Michael sees Eddie in the pub but leaves immediately as {{he does not want to}} speak to him. Alfie later tells Eddie that Tommy is his grandson.|$|E

25|$|Police interviewed Edith Grimes, who {{stated the}} man her sister knew as Frederick Hudson was {{actually}} named Frederick Nodder, who had adopted the surname Hudson as an alias, since becoming {{the subject of}} an affiliation order. Grimes described Nodder as being a brutish and squalid drunkard with poor personal hygiene and few friends, who worked primarily as a motor mechanic and lorry driver in Retford. Nodder had, Grimes stated, deserted his wife many years before he had lodged with them. However, she claimed and to be unaware of his current address, and to have <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> for several months (this was contradicted by a neighbour of the Grimes family, who recalled seeing a lorry driver fitting Nodder's description at their home shortly after Christmas 1936). Enquiries in public houses and garages in Retford quickly led officers to the Retford haulage firm with which Nodder was employed; this firm was able to provide police with Nodder's current address on Smeath Road in the Nottinghamshire village of Hayton.|$|E

As Luigi further explores the mansion, he discovers that it was built by King Boo to shelter the now-freed portrait ghosts, ghosts whom E. Gadd had previously captured and contained in paintings with a device dubbed the [...] "Ghost Potrificationizer". They sent Luigi the supplied photo and map to lure him into a trap. Gadd also tells Luigi that he saw someone wearing a red cap went into the mansion some time ago, but has <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> since. Upon learning that the red capped man (Mario) was Luigi's brother, E.

500|$|A personable man, Seamer was {{a popular}} captain of Somerset. He had some quirks to his personality, and Roebuck goes as far as {{describing}} him as an eccentric. During his childhood he would often cycle {{from his home in}} Shapwick to Taunton, a distance of over 15 miles, to watch Somerset play cricket. When he began playing for the county, prior to starting at Oxford University, a number of his childhood heroes were still in the side. In one match, Seamer had been dismissed, and passed one of these heroes, Jack White coming to the wicket. White asked what kind of bowler Jim Cornford was, as he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> play before. Seamer, unsure, bluffed and stated that he bowled outswingers. Shortly afterwards, White returned to the dressing room, irate, and declared [...] "the fellow bowls bloody inswingers." [...] Bespectacled, Seamer dressed smartly and was proud of his Somerset heritage, often putting on a broad accent when he was in London.|$|E
500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>Him</b> in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{a medical}} {{convention}} in New Orleans, after graduating medical school, Wilson accidentally broke an antique mirror {{and started a}} bar fight when another customer repeatedly played [...] "Leave A Tender Moment Alone" [...] by Billy Joel to the frustration of Wilson, who {{was going through a}} divorce with his first wife at the time. House met him in jail and, motivated by a desire for companionship and by sheer boredom, bailed him out and hired an attorney to clear his name, thus starting their professional and personal relationship. In the Season 1 episode [...] "Histories", it is revealed that one of his brothers is homeless and that Wilson is unaware if he is still alive as he has <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in nine years. Wilson has a history of failed marriages: he is married to his third wife during Season 1 and, with the discovery of his wife's infidelity, separates from her during Season 2. After the failure of his third marriage, Wilson lives in various temporary accommodations (including a stint at House's own apartment) until he meets Amber Volakis, who is a female substitute for House. He is described as [...] "nearly 40" [...] in [...] "Don't Ever Change", in Season 4, {{and by the end of}} Season 8, House describes him during a semi-mock DDx as a [...] "46-year-old oncologist". Wilson and House's relationship has been sorely tested on many occasions.|$|E

500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E

Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeni Chernonog, a war veteran, watched The Fall of Berlin while intoxicated. He commented: [...] "And where did this angel come from?

It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel, as Hastings tells Cynthia that he has <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> for [...] "some years". Particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium, are given in Curtain: Poirot's Last Case, Chapter 1.

Following his six-month stint with Lancashire, du Plessis signed a new three-year deal with the club.
