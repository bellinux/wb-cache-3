40|$|As an {{alternative}} to well-established nano-lithographic methods, mechanical manufacturing methods which are widely applied in macro and micro-scales, have also been adapted to nano-scale. Recently, tip-based mechanical nanomanufacturing have been realized {{through the use of}} Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) where the ultra-sharp AFM probe is used to induce sufficiently high contact stresses to remove material from variety of surfaces. Even though the basic applicability of the AFM-based mechanical nanomanufacturing have been demonstrated, its application as a viable controlled nanomanufacturing method is hindered by a number of issues including high dimensional uncertainty, limited shape capability, rapid tip wear, and inefficient material removal. In this Ph. D. research, to address the issues with the current application of AFM-based methods, a new tip-based mechanical nanomanufacturing process, referred to as nanomilling, is proposed. The overarching objective of this Ph. D. research is to develop, implement and analyze a novel nanomanufacturing process, nanomilling, and the associated equipment. The nanomilling process imposes high-frequency rotational motions to the ultra-sharp probe tip (<b>nanotool)</b> using a piezoelectric actuator, achieving a configuration {{similar to that of the}} conventional milling process. By imposing controlled highfrequency motions and implementing a high-stiffness <b>nanotool</b> configuration, nanomilling has the potential to exhibit high-dimensional accuracy and repeatability, achieve high material removal rates and effectively reduce tip wear and forces. Development, implementation and analysis of the nanomilling process constitute the foundation for realization of high-volume, controlled tip-based mechanical nanomanufacturing. To achieve the overarching research objective, first, the nanomilling method and the associated system is developed. Two fundamental nanomilling configurations are identified: in-plane and out-of-plane configurations where the <b>nanotool</b> is rotated within a plane parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface, respectively. The nanomilling system mainly includes a three-axis piezo-stack actuator hosting the <b>nanotool</b> and imposing the highfrequency rotations, a high-stiffness <b>nanotool</b> assembly and a high-precision nanopositioning stage that controls the feeding motions to create desired feature shapes during nanomilling. Successful implementation of the nanomilling process requires precision characterization and control of the high-frequency <b>nanotool</b> rotations and feeding motions. To characterize the motions of the piezo-stack actuator and the nanopositioning stage, a three-dimensional motion measurement setup is constructed. To generate accurate <b>nanotool</b> rotations, a comprehensive method is developed for characterization and mathematical representation of non-linear dynamics of piezo-stack actuators. The obtained dynamic representations are then utilized to devise a frequency-domain open-loop method to control the piezo-stack actuator motions. The capability of this method to generate desired <b>nanotool</b> rotations with high accuracy is demonstrated. Having developed the nanomilling method, the associated system and established the methodology for precision control of nanomilling motions, the dimensional accuracy of the process is evaluated. It was shown that the removal depth and width can be controlled with 5 nm accuracy using the nanomilling process. The preliminary observations on material removal mechanism showed that nanomilling process is able to remove material in the form of long and curled chips. Finally, the preliminary studies are conducted on the <b>nanotool</b> wear characteristics of the process. A method for experimentation and quantitative analysis of <b>nanotool</b> wear is devised. Specific contributions of this thesis research include: (1) A novel rotating-tip-based mechanical nanomanufacturing method and associated system that is capable of creating nanoscale features with 5 nm dimensional accuracy, (2) A new method for accurate characterization and representation of three-dimensional dynamic motions of piezo-stack actuators, including those used in the nanomilling system, (3) An experimental understanding on the characteristics of the non-linear dynamic motions of piezo-stack actuators, (4) A frequency-domain-based open-loop method for controlling the non-linear, three-dimensional motions of multi-axis piezo-stack actuators, (5) An approach for quantitative analysis of wear in nanometrically-sharp probe-tips...|$|E

Importantly, chromobodies {{can be used}} in live cell imaging for highly specific spatio-temporal visualization of cellular processes. To date, functional application of chromobodies requires lengthy genetic manipulation of the target cell. Here, we developed multifunctional large-pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as nanocarriers to directly transport chromobodies into living cells for antigen-visualization in real time. The multifunctional large-pore MSNs feature high loading capacity for chromobodies, and are efficiently taken up by cells. By functionalizing the internal MSN surface with nitrilotriacetic acid-metal ion complexes, we could control the release of His 6 -tagged chromobodies from MSNs in acidified endosomes. When chromobodies escape from the endosomes through the proton sponge effect generated by their built-in His 6 -tags, co-localization of signals from fluorescent endogenous antigen and organic dye-labeled chromobodies can be detected.

The novel nanosystem (ZnPR-IONP) has been thoroughly characterized by a variety of techniques such as UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoloectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In order to probe the capability of the photosensitizer for PDT, the singlet oxygen production of both ZnPR-IONP and the free ligand ZnPR-COOH have been quantified by measuring the decay in absorption of the anthracene derivative 9, 10 -anthracenedipropionic acid (ADPA), showing an important increase on singlet oxygen production when the porphyrin is incorporated onto the IONP (ZnPR-IONP). On the other hand, the porphyrin derivative PR-TRIS 3 OH, incorporating several polar groups (TRIS), was synthesized and immobilized with the intention of obtaining water soluble nanosystems (PR-TRIS-IONP). When the singlet oxygen production ability was evaluated, the values obtained were similar to ZnPR-COOH/ZnPR-IONP, again much higher {{in the case of the}} nanoparticles PR-TRIS-IONP, with more than a twofold increase. The efficient singlet oxygen production of PR-TRIS-IONP together with their water solubility, points to the great promise that these new <b>nanotools</b> represent for PDT...|$|R

40|$|Boron nitride {{nanotubes}} (BNNTs) are {{a structural}} analogue of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with alternating B and N atoms which entirely substitute for C atoms in a graphitic-like sheet {{with almost no}} change in atomic spacing. BNNTs have generated considerable interest within the scientific community {{by virtue of their}} unique properties. Very recently, biomedical applications of BNNTs have also been proposed. In the present in vitro study, we demonstrate that BNNTs can be used as <b>nanotools</b> to enable cell electropermeabilization with very low electric fields (40 - 60 V cm(- 1)). An explanation of this behaviour based on the dielectric response of BNNTs to static electric fields is propose...|$|R
