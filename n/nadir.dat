5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom <b>Nadir</b> and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises <b>Nadir,</b> but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving <b>Nadir</b> alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. <b>Nadir</b> wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells <b>Nadir</b> she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|The Banu <b>Nadir</b> began rousing the nomads of Najd. The <b>Nadir</b> {{enlisted the}} Banu Ghatafan by paying them {{half of their}} harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a {{strength}} of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the <b>Nadir</b> secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.|$|E

He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and <b>Nadir.</b> He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and <b>Nadir</b> to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return ("!").|$|E
5|$|Abu Sufyan {{directed}} his effort towards another attack on Medina. He gained {{support from the}} nomadic tribes {{to the north and}} east of Medina; using propaganda about Muhammad's weakness, promises of booty, memories of Quraysh prestige and through bribery. Muhammad's new policy was to prevent alliances against him. Whenever alliances against Medina were formed, he sent out expeditions to break them up. Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, and reacted in a severe manner. One example is the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a chieftain of the Jewish tribe of Banu <b>Nadir.</b> Al-Ashraf went to Mecca and wrote poems that roused the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the Battle of Badr. Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Banu <b>Nadir</b> from Medina forcing their emigration to Syria; he allowed them to take some possessions, as he was unable to subdue the Banu <b>Nadir</b> in their strongholds. The rest of their property was claimed by Muhammad in the name of God as it was not gained with bloodshed. Muhammad surprised various Arab tribes, individually, with overwhelming force, causing his enemies to unite to annihilate him. Muhammad's attempts to prevent a confederation against him were unsuccessful, though he was able to increase his own forces and stopped many potential tribes from joining his enemies.|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine: 1) if fecal hormone metabolite concentrations correlated with serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations, follicular activity and reproductive behavior in the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and 2) if threshold values of respective fecal metabolite concentrations correlated with pregnancy. Blood and fecal samples were collected, in conjunction with transrectal ultrasound and behavior observations, for an 18 -month period from one black rhinoceros female. Subsequently, serial fecal samples were collected from 13 females in 10 zoos. Quantitative analysis of serum progesterone (P 4) and estradiol (E 2) was performed by radioimmunoassay (RIA); analysis of fecal estrogen metabolites (E) and fecal progesterone metabolites (P) were performed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Serum P 4 concentrations identified two luteal phase patterns and two <b>nadirs</b> which corresponded with behavioral estrus.

5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts {{her to be}} brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and <b>Nadir</b> would meet together secretly (""). <b>Nadir</b> then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both <b>Nadir</b> and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glycemic {{variability}} {{is currently}} under scrutiny {{as a possible}} predictor of the complications of diabetes. The manual process for estimating a now classical measure of glycemic variability, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), is both tedious and prone to error, {{and there is a}} special need for an automated method to calculate the MAGE from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. METHODS: An automated algorithm for identifying the peaks and <b>nadirs</b> corresponding to the glycemic excursions required for the MAGE calculation has been developed. The algorithm takes a column of timed glucose measurements and generates a plot joining the peaks and <b>nadirs</b> required for estimating the MAGE. It returns estimates of the MAGE for both upward and downward excursions, together with several other indices of glycemic variability. RESULTS: Details of the application of the algorithm to CGM data collected over a 48 -h period are provided, together with graphical illustrations of the intermediate stages in identifying the peaks and <b>nadirs</b> required for the MAGE. Application of the algorithm to 104 CGM datasets (92 from children with diabetes and 12 from controls) generated plots that, on visual inspection, were all found to have identified the peaks, <b>nadirs,</b> and excursions correctly. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm eliminates the tedium and/or errors of manually identifying and measuring countable excursions in CGM data in order to estimate the MAGE. It {{can also be used to}} calculate the MAGE from "sparse" blood glucose measurements, such as those collected in home blood glucose monitoring. Peter A. Baghurs...|$|R

5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu <b>Nadir</b> who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah.|$|E

5|$|In {{a return}} match on 19 January, Yorkshire fielded a {{stronger}} side {{than in the}} first match and inflicted one of the Natives' heaviest losses, a 16–4 defeat. The team then went undefeated until 16 February, when they faced England. Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union (RFU) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders, regarding them as unsportsmanlike, and tensions reached a <b>nadir</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the England international, during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill, refereeing the game, awarded a number of controversial tries to England, prompting three of the Natives to temporarily leave the field in protest; England eventually won 7–0. The Natives apologised afterwards for their behaviour, but the damage was not repaired. The New Zealanders left England without an official send-off, and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' <b>nadir,</b> he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|Many Muslims {{considered}} this unexpected victory a proof {{that they had}} been favored by God and believed they were assured such victories in the future. A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu <b>Nadir</b> and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.|$|E
