5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Though GM cited cost as a {{deterrent}} to continuing with the EV1, the film interviewed critics contending that the cost of batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced significantly if mass production began, due to economies of scale. There is also discussion about electric cars threatening dealer profits since they have so few service requirements—no tuneups, <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> changes, and less brake jobs because of regenerative braking.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s Júlio Prestes, the {{governor}} of São Paulo, began exploration of the oil prospecting area in São Pedro. His efforts failed to find petroleum, and the equipment was abandoned, but still gushing out mineral water. Subsequently, other {{attempts were made to}} find oil at greater depths, and again <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> was found. One oil rig structure still remains; it is called the Torre de Petróleo Engenheiro Ângelo Balloni (Engineer Ângelo Balloni Oil Tower).|$|E

25|$|Four-stroke {{reciprocating}} {{engines are}} not very suitable for use with hydrogen fuel. The hydrogen can misfire on hot parts like the exhaust valve and spark plugs. Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines. In a Wankel engine, this problem is circumvented by using a ceramic apex seal against a ceramic surface, {{so that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> film to suffer hydrogenate attack. The piston shell must be lubricated and cooled with oil. This substantially increases the lubricating oil consumption in a four-stroke hydrogen engine.|$|E

Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine and chili cheese fries. French fries {{can be made from}} sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant of the French fry ("oven chips") uses less or even <b>no</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pre-procedure, {{every patient}} used {{external}} vacuum {{expansion of the}} recipient-site tissues to create a breast-tissue matrix to be injected with autologous fat grafts of adipocyte tissue, refined via low G-force centrifugation. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volumes were measured; the patients underwent pre-procedure and 6-month post-procedure MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations. At 6-months post-procedure, each woman had {{a significant increase in}} breast volume, ranging 60–200 per cent, per the MRI (n=12) examinations. The size, form, and feel of the breasts was natural; post-procedure MRI examinations revealed <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> cysts or abnormality (neoplasm) in the fat-augmented breasts. Moreover, given the sensitive, biologic nature of breast tissue, periodic MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations are required to monitor the breast-tissue viability and the maintenance of the large volume (+300cc) fat grafts.|$|E

5000|$|The chief {{drawback}} to {{residual fuel oil}} is its high initial viscosity, {{particularly in the case}} of <b>No.</b> 6 <b>oil,</b> which requires a correctly engineered system for storage, pumping, and burning. Though it is still usually lighter than water (with a specific gravity usually ranging from 0.95 to 1.03) it is much heavier and more viscous than <b>No.</b> 2 <b>oil,</b> kerosene, or gasoline. <b>No.</b> 6 <b>oil</b> must, in fact, be stored at around [...] heated to [...] before it can be easily pumped, and in cooler temperatures it can congeal into a tarry semisolid.

25|$|For 1991 Perkins {{entered a}} deal that saw Peter Brock close his Mobil 1 Racing team and bring {{sponsorship}} to Perkins Engineering to race two VN Commodores. Early results were slim, and despite some mechanical issues, Perkins and Brock generally became the fastest of the Holden's on track during the 1991 Australian Touring Car Championship and into the late season endurance races. While Brock would finish the championship in 6th place, Perkins could only manage 11th, the team's biggest problem {{was the lack of}} quality Bridgestone rubber early in the season. The 1991 Bathurst 1000 saw little joy for the team, though both cars easily qualified in the top 10. After a race plagued by electrical issues, the Brock/Andrew Miedecke car finished 7th while the Perkins/Mezera car retired after 65 laps with <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> pressure. Perkins would later attribute his personal lack of success in 1991 to the contract with Brock's team and sponsor Mobil, claiming that the contract actually prevented him from finishing in front of Brock on the race track.|$|E
500|$|In 1865, a {{well was}} drilled at the Dodson mill site, after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in {{what became the}} park. Hadley, who had hoped that investors would think {{petroleum}} was present, got the Wheeler & Wilson sewing machine company to invest $40,000 ($ in [...] ) in his scheme. In {{the next two years}} they drilled two wells, one [...] deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other [...] deep near the Ricketts mansion. <b>No</b> <b>oil</b> was ever found, and Hadley eventually fled to Canada.|$|E
500|$|Energy was a {{critical}} factor for the British war effort. [...] Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply. [...] Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use. [...] There were <b>no</b> <b>oil</b> wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico. [...] The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys {{and the construction of}} new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.|$|E
