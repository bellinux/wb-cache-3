40|$|A new gel-forming {{colloidal}} {{system based on}} a binary mixture of fd-viruses and gold nanoparticles functionalized with complementary DNA single strands has been recently introduced. Upon quenching below the DNA melt temperature, such a system results in a highly porous gel state, that may be developed in a <b>new</b> <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> of tunable porosity. In order {{to shed light on}} the gelation mechanism, we introduce a model closely mimicking the experimental one and we explore via Monte Carlo simulations its equilibrium phase diagram. Specifically, we model the system as a binary mixture of hard rods and hard spheres mutually interacting via a short-range square-well attractive potential. In the experimental conditions, we find evidence of a phase separation occurring either via nucleation-and-growth or via spinodal decomposition. The spinodal decomposition leads to the formation of small clusters of bonded rods and spheres whose further diffusion and aggregation leads to the formation of a percolating network in the system. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mixture of DNA-coated fd-viruses and gold nanoparticles undergoes a non-equilibrium gelation via an arrested spinodal decomposition mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Powder {{injection}} molding (MicroPIM) has a considerable {{potential for the}} production of high-value metal and ceramic micro components. This does not only apply to technical aspects but, due to the deployability of mass production, also to economic ones. The current status can be summed up by the following key data: latest trials revealed smallest struc-tural details in the 10 µm range or lower. Theoretical densities of up to 99 % were achieved depend-ing on the particular powder applied. Typical materials processed are metals (Fe, Cu, 316 L, 17 - 4 PH, W and W-alloys etc.) or ceramics (aluminum/zirconium oxide etc.).
