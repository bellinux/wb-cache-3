Broilers subjected to continuous light with alternate intervals {{of high and}} low-intensity had significantly lower 49 -day body weights when compared with broilers subjected to continuous low-intensity or intermittent light regimes. Feed conversion comparisons followed a similar pattern. Intermittent light regimes improved neither body weight nor feed conversion when compared to continuous low-intensity illumination. Broilers fed diets containing 3080 kcal of metabolizable energy per kg of starter diet (24. 0 % protein) and 3135 kcal per kg of finisher diet (22. 0 % protein) had significantly poorer body weights and feed conversions than did broilers fed diets containing metabolizable energy levels of 3160 (24. 8 % protein), 3300 (25. 6 % protein), and 3410 (26. 4 % protein) kcal per kg of starter diet and 3245 (22. 8 % protein), 33 55 (23. 6 % protein), and 3465 (24. 4 % protein) kcal per kg of finisher diet.

DesignEvaluate snacking behavior using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009 – 2012. ParticipantsChildren aged 4 – 8 and 9 – 13  years (n =  3, 647). Variables MeasuredSelf-reported foods and beverages reported as snacks were aggregated into morning (0 : 00 – 12 : 00  hours), afternoon (12 : 00 – 18 : 00  hours), and evening (18 : 00 – 24 : 00  hour) snacking periods. AnalysisIntakes and amounts consumed during different snacking periods were analyzed from per capita weighted averages using SAS 9. 2 and SUDAAN software. Statistical differences were detected using Student t test for means and chi-square test for prevalence data. ResultsSnacking contributed 25 % of daily energy in both age groups, with the morning snacking period contributing the least energy. The most frequently consumed food groups across all snacking periods were water, snacks and sweets, nonalcoholic beverages, milk and dairy, and fruit. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> varied among different snacking periods; the morning snack period for 4 - to 8 -year-olds was the most nutrient dense.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{nutritional}} {{impact of}} snacking on the diets of female, freshman college students {{between the ages}} of 17 and 20 years was assessed. Sixty-five women living in freshman residence halls at Oregon State University recorded their dietary intakes and eating habits for four days. Questionnaires concerning eating and activity patterns were also completed. Dietary intakes were analyzed for energy (kcal), protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid. The nutrient contents of snacks, meals, and nutrient supplements consumed by the subjects were calculated. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> (nutrient/ 1000 kcal) of meals and snacks were also calculated for the above nutrients. All subjects received a Dietary Adequacy Score, which was computed from their mean daily intake over the four-day period, by assigning one point for each nutrient consumed at or above two-thirds of the RDA. All but one subject snacked during the four-day recording period. The subjects consumed a mean of 1. 54 snacks daily, with means of 0. 19 morning, 0. 47 afternoon, and 0. 88 evening snacks. With the exception of ascorbic acid, the mean nutrient desities of snacks were significantly (p< 0. 01) lower than that of meals. The mean <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> of snacks were well below the RDA/ 1000 kcal for all of the calculated nutrients, again, with the exception of ascorbic acid. Snacks contributed about 20 percent of the mean total energy intake; the proportions supplied by snacks to the mean nutrient intakes were considerably lower (8 to 13 percent). Meal frequency was negatively correlated with snack frequency (r= -. 24, p< 0. 05) and snack energy intake (r= -. 40, p< 0. 01). Lunch was the meal most negatively correlated with snacking frequency (r =. 33, p< 0. 01) and snack energy intake (r= -. 37, p< 0. 01). By examining when snacking and when missed meals occurred, it appears that snacks were often consumed as a result of missed meals rather than the cause of them. Breakfast was missed most often and dinner least often with snacking occurring most often in the evening and afternoon. Snacks consumed at these times would not have interfered with either lunch or breakfast. Despite the relatively poor nutritional value of snack foods eaten by the subjects (as evidenced by the low <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities),</b> snacks actually improved the Dietary Adequacy Scores of 28 subjects. However, 16 subjects exceeded the RDA for energy with the addition of snacks, eight of whom {{were not included in the}} above group of 28 with the improved Dietary Adequacy Scores. But in all, 20 subjects (31 percent) had their Dietary Adequacy Scores improved by snacks, without exceeding the 2100 kcal RDA for energy.

40|$|Measurement {{errors in}} dietary {{assessment}} using duplicate portions as reference method Laura Trijsburg Background: As Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) {{are subject to}} measurement error, associations between self-reported intake by FFQ and outcome measures should be corrected for measurement error with data from a reference method. Whether the correction is adequate depends {{on the characteristics of}} the reference method used in the validation study. The duplicate portion method (DP), compared to the often used 24 h recall (24 hR), seems a promising reference method as correlated errors between FFQ and DP, such as memory bias, errors in portion size estimations and food composition databases, are not expected. Aim: This thesis aimed to determine the validity of the DP compared to the 24 hR as a reference method for FFQ validation. The second aim was to explore the validity of <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> for DP, 24 hR and FFQ. The third aim was to determine the factors associated with misreporting of energy, protein and potassium as estimated by DP, 24 hR and FFQ. Methods: Within the DuPLO-study, a Dutch validation study {{which is part of the}} NQplus study, two DPs, two FFQs, two blood and urinary biomarkers and one to fifteen 24 hRs (web-based and/or telephone-based) were collected in 198 subjects, within 1. 5 years. Also, one or two doubly labelled water measurements were available for 69 participants. Multivariate measurement error models were used to assess proportional scaling bias, error correlations with the FFQ, validity coefficients and attenuation factors. Furthermore linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between misreporting and various factors. Results: The DP was less influenced by proportional scaling bias, had lower correlated errors with the FFQ and showed higher attenuation factors than the 24 hR for potassium, sodium and protein. Also, the DP seemed a better reference method than the 24 hR for the assessment of validity coefficients for the FFQ for various fatty acids. The attenuation factors for the FFQ, using either the DP or 24 hR as reference method, agreed reasonably well. Furthermore, the DP showed, when using plasma fatty acids as reference, slightly better ranking of participants according to their intake of n- 3 fatty acids (0. 33) and the n‑ 3 /LA ratio (0. 34) than the 24 hR (0. 22 and 0. 24, respectively). Less group level bias was observed for protein and sodium densities compared to their absolute intakes for FFQ, 24 hR and DP, but not for potassium. Overall the validity coefficients and attenuation factors for DP, 24 hR and FFQ did not improve for <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> compared to absolute intakes, except for the attenuation factor for sodium density. Lastly, BMI proved to be the most consistent determinant associated with misreporting (group level bias) of energy, protein and potassium for DP, 24 hR and FFQ. Men tended to underreport protein by the DP, FFQ and 24 hR and persons of older age underreported potassium but only by the 24 hR and FFQ. Other explorative determinants did not show a consistent association with misreporting of energy or nutrients by the different dietary assessment methods.    Conclusion: With respect to error correlations and attenuation factors the DP performed slightly better than the 24 hR as a reference method for validating FFQs in epidemiological research. Furthermore, the use of <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> does not necessarily improve the validity of the dietary intake estimates from DP, 24 hR and FFQ. Moreover, it was shown that BMI is an important determinant of misreporting of energy, protein and potassium for these three assessment methods.  ...|$|R

40|$|Restricted {{feeding of}} broiler breeders is {{required}} to obtain good reproductive performance. Current practical feed restriction levels can result in hunger feeling and chronic stress, particularly during the rearing period. On the basis of literature data, low-density diets might improve bird welfare. Recent findings also indicate that low-density broiler breeder diets can reduce offspring mortality. In this thesis, effects of low-density breeder diets on bird welfare and breeder and offspring performance were evaluated. Breeder treatments involved: 1) normal density diets (ND), 2) diets with 12 and 11 % reduced <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> during rearing and laying (LD 12 and LD 11), 3) diets with 23 and 21 % reduced <b>nutrient</b> <b>densities</b> during rearing and laying (LD 23 and LD 21), 4) as 2), but with oats and sugar beet pulp instead of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, wheat gluten feed and sunflower seed meal in the diets (LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP), and 5) LD 11 diets during rearing followed by ND diets during laying. Feeding LD 23 diets reduced stereotypic pecking behaviour and increased time spent on sitting {{during the first half}} of the rearing period. LD 23 and LD 12 OP diets reduced feed intake motivation during rearing. It was concluded that LD 23 can improve bird welfare {{during the first half of}} the rearing period. However, LD 21 impaired bird welfare during laying. LD 12 OP and LD 11 OP diets gave significantly lower live weights during rearing and laying. Low-density diets delayed reproductive tract development at 24 weeks of age, which was followed by an increased development between week 24 and 26. Changes in bird development were related to changes in nutrient digestibility and utilization of digested nutrients. Egg weights and amount of egg white increased and embryonic development was improved on low-density diets. Laying percentage was significantly higher on LD 11 diets. LD 11 diets increased live weight of offspring of 29 -week-old breeders significantly in comparison with ND diets. Low-density breeder diets resulted in a significant reduction in offspring mortality when breeders were 60 weeks of age. Antibody titres in offspring indicated that nutrients in eggs with a relatively low weight were used for growth rather than for immune system development.
