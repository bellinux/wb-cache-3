5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of letters for use in package labels. In {{an extension of the}} studies, subjects were asked to rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E
25|$|The carving {{seems to}} have been {{completed}} by December 1658, for Symon White (who is evidently a superior workman, receiving 22d. a day, the highest wage paid to anyone, and who was the master carver) is no longer employed. No other carvers are mentioned, and as there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of ornament, he may have done all the work himself, with the aid perhaps of his apprentices. Very probably he designed it also, and was, no doubt, trained in the new school of classic design, after the manner of Nicholas Stone, {{or any of the other}} carvers of that date, whose work could then be seen on St. Mary's Church porch, or elsewhere. Whether for temperance' sake or for other reasons bevers are now abated, and after this date John Jackson is not paid as overseer.|$|E

500|$|There is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> {{of native}} Italian Christmas music. The most popular Italian Christmas carol is [...] "Tu scendi dalle stelle", the modern Italian words to which {{were written by}} Pope Pius IX in 1870. The melody is a major-key version of an older, minor-key Neapolitan carol [...] "Quanno Nascette Ninno". Other than that, Italians largely sing {{translations}} of carols that come from the German and English tradition ("Silent Night", for example). There is no native Italian secular Christmas music, which accounts for the popularity of Italian-language versions of [...] "Jingle Bells" [...] and [...] "White Christmas".|$|E
500|$|<b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> {{is known}} of Malcolm's {{activities}} beyond the wars and killings.

He was also probably not {{the founder of the}} Bishopric of Mortlach-Aberdeen.

500|$|Suspicion was fuelled to {{some degree}} by her {{entertainment}} of questionable characters at courtâ€”for example, the reputed seer Nostradamus, who was rumoured to have created a talisman for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in necromancy and the black arts. Cosimo Ruggeri, in particular, {{was believed to be}} Catherine's own [...] "trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts", although there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear. Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the Borg were {{reminiscent}} of Lord Dread from the television series Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future and the designs of H. R. Giger. The first designs for the new race were created by costume designer Dorinda Wood after she received the script to [...] "Q Who". While her design showed a suit with tubes running {{in and out of}} it, she left the head design up to make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. The headpieces and the main costumes were made at the same time by the two different departments, with Wood and Westmore working together at times to ensure that they matched. The base of the head pieces was made from foam, and while Westmore initially made casts of model kits using polyurethane for the electronic parts, he found it more effective to use actual electronics from damaged equipment. He designed a latex attachment to allow for tubes to be attached to skin so that there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of bare skin left on the actors' bodies. That skin was covered in a white base make-up in order to achieve a zombie-like appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Lin and Shu {{proposed}} in 1964 that the arms were not material in nature, but instead {{made up of}} areas of greater density, similar to a traffic jam on a highway. [...] The cars move through the traffic jam: the density of cars increases {{in the middle of}} it. [...] The traffic jam itself, however, does not move (or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal,</b> in comparison to the cars). [...] In the galaxy, stars, gas, dust, and other components move through the density waves, are compressed, and then move out of them.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{buoyancy}} compensator of a scuba diver is inflated at {{the surface}} to provide positive buoyancy, {{the positions of the}} centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity of the diver are generally different. The vertical and horizontal separation of these centroids will determine the static trim of the diver {{at the surface}}. The diver can usually overcome the trimming moment of buoyancy, but this requires constant directed effort, albeit usually <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of effort. This allows a conscious [...] diver to adjust trim to suit the circumstances such as the choice between swimming face down or face up, or remaining vertical for best field of view or visibility. The position of the diver's centre of gravity is determined by the distribution of weight, and buoyancy is determined by the equipment in use, particularly the buoyancy compensator, which can significantly influence centre of buoyancy shifts as it is inflated and deflated. Stable trim implies that the centre of buoyancy is directly above the centre of gravity. Any horizontal offset will generate a moment which will rotate the diver until the equilibrium condition is restored.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{unconventional}} {{release of the}} game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves has not been widely reviewed as a standalone product. Greg Miller from IGN scored the game 6.5/10, describing it {{as more of a}} tech demo of the PlayStation Move's functionality, rather than a fully-fledged game. He also criticised the game's lack of lasting appeal as there are no prizes or costumes to collect. Miller did however say [...] "If you have a bud who is as into LittleBigPlanet as you are, you're going to have fun" [...] and that the game could act as a good demonstration piece for the PlayStation Move. Eurogamer scored the game 7/10 and said that [...] "there's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of substance" [...] and criticised the use of the LittleBigPlanet engine instead of LittleBigPlanet 2s enhanced features, but tempered it by saying [...] "when you've got a game that already looks as lovely as this one does, I'm sure you'll be able to live with that." [...] GamesRadar also criticised the game's length; [...] "Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a very capable game; there's just not that much [...] "game" [...] to go around", the reviewer was also puzzled about the use of the original LittleBigPlanet engine in a game released next to the enhanced LittleBigPlanet 2 and summed up by saying [...] "Overall, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a strange beast. It's too good to be a demo, too short to be a game, too outdated to be a preview and imbued with too much care and character to be passed off as a PS Move advergame", and scored the game as 7/10.|$|E
2500|$|IGN {{reviewed}} {{all four}} {{versions of the}} game. David Smith scored the PlayStation 2 version 9.4 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Award" [...] and calling the Dark Alliance engine [...] "{{one of the best}} 3D engines yet devised." [...] He dismissed criticisms of the game as a [...] "Diablo clone," [...] arguing the gameplay is much deeper than such a comparison suggests. His only criticisms were some anti-climatic boss fights and repetitive music. He concluded [...] "There is honestly <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> to complain about here [...] Snowblind has put together one of the best engines on PS2 {{and one of the best}} hacks in the business, certainly the best a console has ever seen." [...] Kaiser Hwang scored the Xbox version 8.5 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but wrote [...] "What hurts this game's score is the fact that it is almost exactly the same game that was released last year, not that that's a bad thing. The game is a fine example of exceptional game-making. But an extra level or character, or really any added extras would've been great." [...] Fran Mirabella III scored the GameCube version 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a downgrade from the PS2 version." [...] He criticized the [...] "bafflingly destroyed frame rate," [...] and commented [...] "When it was released on the PS2 a year ago, few could believe what Snowblind had pulled off on Sony's stubborn console. A year later, and quite magically, High Voltage couldn't get the engine running smoothly on GameCube." [...] Craig Harris scored the Game Boy Advance version 8 out of 10, arguing that [...] "Even though it's missing a few key elements from the original design it's based upon, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance works out very well in portable form." ...|$|E
