500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

5000|$|Anthropologist Robin Dunbar at Oxford University argues against Crabtree's {{position}} that brain size {{was driven by}} tool use. Instead, Dunbar argues that the social environment drives intelligence. [...] "In reality what has driven human and primate brain evolution is the complexity of our social world", says Dunbar. [...] "That complex world is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Doing things like deciding who to have as a mate or how best to rear your children {{will be with us}} forever." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{long time}} ago {{there was only a}} single empire that existed on the continent. The country {{experienced}} tranquility and peace and did not know the conflating deadly diseases that spread around the world. Innocent people suffered as those who were slain by these beasts or choked to death by disease later rose again as undead. The undead caused chaos and destruction in their wake in seemingly endless numbers. Their tireless existence appeared as if this problem was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Eventually, the single empire collapsed and became three separate kingdoms, all fighting for their own survival.|$|E

[...] Despite the release of Obama's notarized birth certificate abstract, Farah demanded that Obama release his [...] "long-form" [...] birth certificate, which was subsequently posted on the White House's web site on April 27, 2011. Farah had previously pledged $15,000 to the hospital where Obama was born upon the release of said document. When Obama finally released the long-form birth certificate, he called it [...] "fraudulent," [...] and disowned the pledge.|$|E
50|$|With the {{continued}} delays on the OCR project, {{it became clear}} that punched cards were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> any time soon, and CDC had to address this as quickly as possible. Although the 405 remained in production, it was an expensive machine to build. So another purchase was made, Bridge Engineering, which offered a line of lower-cost as well as higher-speed card punches. All card-handling products were moved to what became the Valley Forge Division after Bridge moved to a new factory, with the tape transports to follow. Later on, the Valley Forge and Rochester divisions were spun off to form a new joint company with National Cash Register (later NCR Corporation), Computer Peripherals Inc (CPI), in order to share development and production costs across the two companies. ICL later joined the effort. Eventually the Rochester Division was sold to Centronics in 1982.|$|E

30|$|The {{message is}} that cruelty within dairy is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> through {{increased}} welfare standards – {{it is part of}} the industry, built into its infrastructure. SAFE and Farmwatch are not seeking to improve welfare conditions for animals per se. Higher animal welfare standards and practices are, of course, always preferable to an animal experiencing increased levels of suffering due to non-compliance. However, improving animal welfare standards will never be enough. Instead, they take an animal rights position, whereby the animal is not regarded as human property but rather as a sentient being with the right to live life on his/her own terms. An animal rights position extends the notion of rights to animals who are considered to have inherent value and interests of their own (Francione, 1995).|$|E

40|$|Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} frequently due to {{mutations in}} FAS (TNFRSF 6) gene. Unlike most of the self limiting autoimmune cytopenias sporadically seen in childhood, multi lineage cytopenias due to ALPS are often refractory as their inherited genetic defect is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Historically more ALPS patients have died due to overwhelming sepsis following splenectomy to manage their chronic cytopenias than due to any other cause, including malignancies. Hence current recommendations underscore the importance of avoiding splenectomy in ALPS, by long-term use of corticosteroid sparing immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus. Paradigms learnt from managing ALPS patients {{in recent years is}} highlighted here and can be extrapolated to manage refractory cytopenias in patients with as yet undetermined genetic bases for their ailments. It is also desirable to develop international registries for children with rare and complex immune problems associated with chronic multilineage cytopenias in order to elucidate their natural history and long-term comorbidities due to their disease and its treatments...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{apparently}} backed {{off from a}} proposal to tax imported goods produced by methods that generate excessive greenhouse gas emissions. So {{the issue of whether}} such a tax would be legal under the WTO has become slightly less urgent than it recently appeared. But Pascal Lamy the Director-General of the WTO still thought the possibility of some countries imposing emission-based trade restrictions was worth mentioning prominently in his speech to the Trade Ministers Conference in conjunction with the Bali Conference on climate change after Kyoto. And at that same conference, an official of the European Commission may have indicated that such restrictions are not off the table entirely. Clearly, the impetus for such a tax to be levied by some nation or other is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> until we have a universally accepted international regime for emissions control - which is to say, not any time soon...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} also {{available}} from Consumer Futures [URL] responses to consumer vulnerability is a priority for Consumer Futures. This report, based on research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, is about how people on low incomes pay more for essential goods and services {{and what can be}} done about it. It is widely believed that consumers will best be served by encouraging competition on the basis that this drives efficiency and delivers innovation. However, competition does not always work this way and it is consumers on low income that often lose out, but so do others who are vulnerable for reasons other than low income. The fact that ‘the poor pay more’ is not news. This report updates the picture and shows that paying higher prices for utilities and credit can raise the cost of a minimum household budget by around 10 per cent – a ‘poverty premium’. The cost of many essentials such as energy and water are likely to rise and while we hope for a tide of economic growth which will lift all, poverty and vulnerability is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and indeed many people who are not seen as ‘poor’ will struggle to meet household bills...|$|E

40|$|A long-insular {{nation and}} society is {{expanding}} {{the definition of}} what constitutes foreign relations. Twenty years after it began to deregulate its economy, India is a more externally engaged country than ever. Much of this change is driven by three new sources of pressure on India’s diplomatic establishment: an ambitious business community, a vocal diaspora and a rambunctious and aggressive news media. The support of Indian capital and Indian nationals abroad is now a legitimate expectation on New Delhi’s diplomacy. Indian politicians are regularly lobbied by voters whose relatives face very local challenges abroad. ‘Tabloid television’ stirs public emotion and constricts the space for India’s diplomats. These are realities of the new India that are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Anyone who seeks to influence Indian strategic and foreign policy will have to understand and work within this framework. The Indian policy establishment will need to adapt – for instance, through better coordinating or even merging its external affairs and commerce ministries. If cleverly handled, the media, the diaspora and especially the convening power of Indian business peak bodies offer avenues for New Delhi to exert indirect influence on some increasingly important relationships, such as with the United States, Japan, Singapore and potentially Australia. Astute foreign partners can use these avenues to influence India’s worldview as well...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the origins}} of universltles, the {{interface}} of creativity and academic industry has long been problematic. Separating the creative and academic in this way produces a spurious dichotomy, but one that has nevertheless dominated the academic environment, where employment, government funding, promotion, enrolments and a great many other factors have all danced around the notions of research value and quality and, particularly, how this is evaluated in a metrics-dominated system. The {{question of how to}} measure and rank academic and creative output has immediate consequences for the arts, creative arts and humanities, and Australia is not alone in undertaking government-initiated, researchmeasurement exercises. Australia trialled the Excellence in Research Australia (ERA) scheme in 2009, with a full roll-out across all university clusters/disciplines occurring in 20101 (Australian Research Council, 2011). Comparable nation-based measurement exercises include New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF), which assesses individuals, and the United Kingdom 2 ̆ 7 s Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), which assesses departments. The RAE has recently been replaced by the Research Excellence Framework (REF). Whatever the assessment acronym (or nation), these national research evaluations are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Moreover, it is unrealistic to think that such major government-initiated policy changes will not dictate the way national and international institutions think about research, recruitment and promotion...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} offers an {{invitation}} {{to think about the}} first decade of the 21 st century. Acknowledging that millennia boundaries are always arbitrary such that any development is likely to have started earlier and to still be ongoing, I decided to write about the advent of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as one of the linguistic areas that are topical and prominent in today's world. In recent overview articles on 'electronic discourse' (Locher 2014; Locher and Mondada 2014) and on challenges in research methodology for scholars working on computer-mediated discourse (Bolander and Locher 2014), a number of observations were made that I want to revisit in light of the aim of this special issue. Given the fact that communication through computer-mediated means is a fairly recent phenomenon and that the vast majority of research on this use of language have been published since the turn of the millennium, we can indeed state that this topic is relevant. In line with Crystal, "[t]he Internet is the largest area of language development we have seen in our lifetimes. Only two things are certain: it is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away,</b> and it is going to get larger" (2011, 149). In this chapter, I will briefly sketch the object of study, show some of the research questions and developments that have occurred and discuss some of the ways linguists have responded to language online...|$|E
