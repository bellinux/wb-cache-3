500|$|In interviews, Frobisher {{elicited}} the students' reasoning. One fifth-year {{decided that}} 0 was even {{because it was}} found on the 2 times table. A couple of fourth-years realized that zero can be split into equal parts. Another fourth-year reasoned [...] "1 is odd and if I go down it's even." [...] The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind incorrect responses. A second-year was [...] "quite convinced" [...] that zero was odd, on the basis that [...] "it is the first <b>number</b> <b>you</b> count". A fourth-year referred to 0 as [...] "none" [...] and thought that it was neither odd nor even, since [...] "it's not a number". In another study, Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even-odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups.|$|E
500|$|Book III {{covers the}} mediaeval Quadrivium, the four {{subjects}} which supplemented the Trivium being mathematics, geometry, music and astronomy. He argues {{that there are}} infinitely many numbers, as you can always add one (or any other number) to whatever <b>number</b> <b>you</b> think is the limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, {{the sky and the}} celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and the names of the stars. He derives the curved (curvus) vault of the heavens from the Latin word for [...] "upside-down" [...] (conversus). He explains eclipses of the sun as the moon coming between the earth and the sun, and eclipses of the moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.|$|E
500|$|At the World Science Fiction Convention in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several {{well-known}} {{writers to}} appear in an [...] "all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of 'sacrifice. The issue in question {{was the first one}} under the new title of Impulse, in March 1966; it included fiction by James Blish, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, and Keith Roberts, who contributed [...] "The Signaller", the first story in his Pavane sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another Pavane story and a short story by John Brunner from his [...] "Traveller in Black" [...] series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley's opinion, the twelve issues of Impulse contained [...] "some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines". Christopher Priest's first story, [...] "The Run", appeared in the May 1966 issue, and Chris Boyce's second story, [...] "George", was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in Impulse, both well-received: Harry Harrison's Make Room! Make Room! (later made into the movie Soylent Green), and Moorcock's The Ice Schooner. Other notable stories listed by Ashley include Thomas Disch's [...] "The Roaches" [...] and [...] "The <b>Number</b> <b>You</b> Have Just Reached", and Aldiss's [...] "The Eyes of the Blind King". Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.|$|E
