40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to prove that cows {{suffering}} from hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia displayed an increase in diseases and a decrease in capacity in subsequent lactation. Blood samples were taken from 2094 Holstein Frisian dairy cows on days 0, 1, 3 and 5 p. p [...] Ca and P levels of all blood samples were quantified. Diseases within a period of 100 days after calving as well as parameters concerning fertility and milk yield were monitored. The intention was to demonstrate the negative effects of postpartal serum Ca and P concentrations on health, fertility and milk yield. Observations were made on the herd as a whole as well as on heifers and pluriparous cows individually. This study confirmed that mainly pluriparous cows suffered from periparturient paresis. These cows showed consequently significant decreased Ca-levels up to 0, 4 mmol/l below the levels of heatlhy cows. They also manifested low P-levels in early puerperium. If this is just a <b>nutritional</b> <b>consequence</b> of hypocalcaemic paresis or an unrelated phenomenon within the complex of periparturient paresis requires further investigation. The partly significant correlation between postpartal hypocalcaemia on days 3 and 5 p. p. and increased occurences of retentio and metritis can be explained by inappetence due to deficient calcium levels. A consequence of this was a lack of calcium nourishment. Thus, neither retentio, metritis nor endometritis could be affirmed as a result of hypocalcaemia. Likewise, dislocatio abomasi seems to result in deficient calcium levels, according to the findings at hand. Research on ketosis yielded similar results. Cows suffering from mastitis showed clearly decreased serum calcium levels on days 0 and 1 p. p. This leads to the assumption, that peripartal hypocalcaemia has an influence on the development of mastitis. Further statistical calculation verified this assumption. With regard to lactation numbers calcium deficiency has little aetiological meaning concerning mastitis. Accordingly, a cow's predisposition for mastitis increases with greater age. Because older cows mostly show lower calcium levels than heifers and young cows, it is not in contrast to the statement that a lack of calcium is a predisposing factor in aetiology of mastitis. Cows that had developed mastitis increasingly showed immediate postpartal hypophosphataemia, thus illustrating the synchronicity of hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia. If the lack of P is an isolated occurence or due to a <b>nutritional</b> <b>consequence</b> of hypocalcaemia, could not be determined without further investigation. That is why information on a possible mastitis-promoting effect of periparturient hypophosphataemia can not be given. The direct influence of Ca and P on milk yield could not be demonstrated. Older cows with physiologically decreased serum levels on average showed higher milk yield within first 100 days after calving. Longer resting times of the heifers rather seemed to be caused by increased calving assistance and resulting diseases of fertility and thus do not correlate with serum calcium levels. Here too, results for P correspond with those for Ca. The results of this investigation show the close relation between periparturient concentrations of Ca and P. However, further information about the exact correlation could not be provided. The influence of periparturient hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia seems to be limited to periparturient paresis and mastitis. To determine whether this is caused by increased immunosuppression due to parturient paresis (GOFF and HORST 1997), decreased myotonus of the teat sphincter (GOFF 1999) or increased exposure to contaminated surface (OETZEL 1988, STAUFENBIEL 1999), requires further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Choice feeding {{is often}} used to {{investigate}} an animal’s nutritional requirements and dietary preferences. A problem with this approach is that animals with long gut transit times, such as the horse, may find it difficult to associate a chosen food with its <b>nutritional</b> <b>consequence</b> when alternative foods are presented simultaneously. One solution is to present foods singly {{for a period of time}} before a simultaneous choice session to allow the development of learned associations. This method was used to determine if horse’s voluntary intake and feeding behavior was influenced by the macronutrient composition of the diet. Seven stabled horses, maintained on a low intensity exercise regimen, were allowed, on an ad libitum basis, haylage and 3 isocaloric forage based diets that were rich in 1 of 3 macronutrients (protein, lipid, and hydrolyzable carbohydrate). Initially, diets were presented as a 3 -way choice for 5 d (self-selection a [SSa]), then singly (monadic phase) with exposure to each diet for 2 separate periods of 3 d each, and finally again as a choice for 5 d (self-selection b [SSb]). The total amount of trial diet offered differed with trial phase, with 2 to 2. 5 % of BW during SSa and the monadic phase, increasing to ad libitum access during SSb. To control differences in the total amount of trial diet offered, 2 measurements of voluntary intake were taken at 4 and 22 h postpresentation. Daily macronutrient and energy intakes were estimated from proximate analysis of the trial diets and batches of haylage fed. Feeding behavior was observed over a single 4 -h period during both self-selection phases. Horses showed no initial preference after 4 h for any 1 diet during SSa. Following the monadic phase, horses demonstrated a preference for the protein and hydrolyzable carbohydrate rich diets over the lipid rich diet (P < 0. 001). Dietary experience modified foraging behavior as the total number of visits to the diets decreased during SSb (P < 0. 005). Analysis of 24 -h macronutrient consumption showed that protein and hydrolyzable carbohydrate intake increased during SSb, whereas lipid intake remained constant over both self-selection phases (P < 0. 001). These data indicate for perhaps the first time that horses can respond to dietary macronutrient content and that single presentations during choice studies facilitates expression of dietary preferences...|$|R

Locusts placed in a thermal gradient selected temperatures near 38 °C, maximizing rates of weight gain; however, this enhanced growth rate came at the cost of poor protein and carbohydrate utilization. Protein and carbohydrate were equally digested across temperature treatments, but once digested both macronutrients were converted to growth most efficiently at the intermediate temperature (32 °C).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although great {{focus has}} been placed on <b>nutritional</b> and other <b>consequences</b> of changes in food-related {{policies}} within schools, few reports exist describing the impact of such changes on school revenue. This review provides an overview of the few revenue-related studies published recently, as well as information from a sampling of state reports on the subject. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Four peer-reviewed papers and 3 state-based reports were identified that assessed the impact on revenues of either targeted policy changes or overarching, district-wide changes in food-related policies. RESULTS: Thus far, few data exist to substantiate the concern that changes in nutrition standards in schools lead to a loss in total revenue. An interesting phenomenon of increased participation in the National School Lunch Program was noted in a number of reports and might play a role in buffering financial losses. CONCLUSIONS: A renewed focus on school policies related to health provides the opportunity for researchers to investigate how nutrition-related policy change can affect, if at all, food service and overall school revenues...|$|R

Assuming that alloparenting evolved as an adaptive response {{to the demands of}} the environment, I was interested in exploring how alloparenting behaviour changes with drastic changes in the local ecology of a population. I describe infant care-taking practices in a rural, traditionally living Toba population and in a peri-urban Toba population that is changing from a traditional foraging to a market economy lifestyle. The mother is the primary caretaker in both cases. However, the mothers engage other individuals in childcare more often in the rural population than in the peri-urban one. In the rural population, grandmothers and sisters are actively involved in allomothering. The infant was observed in allomother contact about 60 % of the observation time. In contrast, peri-urban Toba babies spend almost 80 % of their time in direct contact with their mothers. Here, husbands are the primary alternative caretakers, followed by sisters and grandmothers.

Diets and diseases are sensitive indicators of the ecological and cultural costs that former hunter-gatherers currently pay to achieve their share of modernity. This paper exposes the <b>nutritional</b> and epidemiological <b>consequences</b> of the maladaptation of former hunter-gatherers in relation to their recent sedentarization. It is primarily based on case studies carried out among the Baka and Kola Pygmies of Cameroon, and the Tubu Punan of Borneo...|$|R
