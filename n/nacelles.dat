5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the <b>nacelles</b> vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the <b>nacelles</b> rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the <b>nacelles</b> tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E
5|$|Comet 2E: Two Comet 2 airliners were {{fitted with}} Avon 504s {{in the inner}} <b>nacelles</b> and Avon 524s in the outer ones. These {{aircraft}} were used by BOAC for proving flights during 1957–1958.|$|E
40|$|A <b>nacelle</b> for {{use with}} a gas turbine engine is presented. An {{integral}} webbed structure resembling a spoked wheel for rigidly interconnecting the <b>nacelle</b> and engine, provides lightweight support. The inner surface of the <b>nacelle</b> defines the outer limits of the engine motive fluid flow annulus while the outer surface of the <b>nacelle</b> defines a streamlined envelope for the engine...|$|R
40|$|Airloads on the 727 /JT 8 D refan side engine <b>nacelle</b> are presented. These {{consist of}} surface static {{pressure}} distributions from two low speed wind tunnel tests. External <b>nacelle</b> surface pressures are from testing of a flow-through, body mounted <b>nacelle</b> model, and internal inlet surface pressures are from performance testing of a forced air inlet model. The method for obtaining critical airloads on <b>nacelle</b> components and a representative example are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} {{intake and}} the engine <b>nacelles</b> were paired with a {{splitter}} plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} Boeing TEA- 230 Subsonic Flow Analysis method as {{a primary}} design tool in the {{development}} of cruise overwing <b>nacelle</b> configurations is presented. Surface pressure characteristics at 0. 7 Mach number were determined by the TEA- 230 method for a selected overwing flow-through <b>nacelle</b> configuration. Results of this analysis show excellent overall agreement with corresponding wind tunnel data. Effects of the presence of the <b>nacelle</b> on the wing pressure field were predicted accurately by the theoretical method. Evidence is provided that differences between theoretical and experimental pressure distributions in the present study would not result in significant discrepancies in the <b>nacelle</b> lines or <b>nacelle</b> drag estimates...|$|R
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} aerodynamics of the radiators and <b>nacelles.</b> To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner <b>nacelles</b> and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined <b>nacelles</b> under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 radar set, the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set. A second seat was added for the radar operator.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp <b>nacelles</b> – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} <b>nacelles,</b> and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
40|$|The quantitive {{relationship}} of cruise drag and <b>nacelle</b> shape was investigated for a representative advanced supersonic transport configuration. <b>Nacelle</b> shape parameters were systematically varied, {{and the effects}} of these variations on wave and friction drag were determined. The effects of changes in vehicle drag, propulsion weight, and specific fuel consumption on vehicle takeoff gross weight were computed. Generally, it was found that <b>nacelle</b> shapes such that the maximum cross-sectional area occurred at or near the nozzle exit resulted in the lowest wave drag. In fact, <b>nacelle</b> shapes were found that produce favorable interference effects (drag reduction) of such magnitude as to nearly offset the friction drag of the <b>nacelle...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} boiler plate <b>nacelle</b> and core exhaust nozzle for the QCSEE under the wing engine is presented. The <b>nacelle,</b> which features interchangeable hard-wall and acoustic panels, is to be utilized in the initial engine testing to establish acoustic requirements for the subsequent composite <b>nacelle</b> {{as well as in}} the QCSEE over the wing engine configuration...|$|R
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-30 was a Soviet turbojet-powered {{tactical}} bomber {{designed as}} a higher-performance, swept wing version of the Ilyushin Il-28, in the late 1940s. Its thin wing and engine <b>nacelles</b> necessitated the use of tandem landing gear, the first Soviet aircraft to do so. It was apparently canceled before the prototype made its first flight, although sources disagree with this.|$|E
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the <b>nacelles.</b> The <b>nacelles</b> themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E
5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine <b>nacelles.</b> A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{propulsion}} system parameters {{on the characteristics}} of a supersonic transport were investigated. The effects of arbitrarily scaling engine size on wave drag, friction drag, drag-due-to-lift, wing sizing, airplane balance, and airplane weight were studied. These evaluations were made for two families of <b>nacelle</b> shapes, resulting from typical turbojet and turbofan installations. Also examined were effects of <b>nacelle</b> location, and the wing camber plane deformations required to cancel the <b>nacelle</b> interference pressure field at cruise Mach number (2. 7 M) were determined. The most drag-sensitive parameter is found to be <b>nacelle</b> shape. Similarly, wing deformation requirements are found to be primarily affected by <b>nacelle</b> shape. Effects of engine size variations are noted primarily in airplane gross weight...|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests of}} a {{simplified}} <b>nacelle</b> on a semispan wing having approximately 35 degrees of sweepback {{were made at}} low speeds to evaluate {{the effects of the}} <b>nacelle</b> on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. Force, moment, and pressure-distribution measurements are presented for the <b>nacelle</b> underslung and centrally mounted on the wing and mounted on a strut below the wing...|$|R
50|$|When the {{windmills}} of the 18th century {{included the}} feature of rotor orientation via {{the rotation of}} the <b>nacelle,</b> an actuation mechanism able to provide that turning moment was necessary. Initially the windmills used ropes or chains extending from the <b>nacelle</b> to the ground in order to allow {{the rotation of the}} <b>nacelle</b> by means of human or animal power.|$|R
5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine <b>nacelles</b> which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine <b>nacelles</b> were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine <b>nacelles,</b> due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of a turboprop-nacelle installation on the pressure distributions over a swept, supercritical wing. The tests were conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 20 to 0. 80, at angles of attack from 0 to 5 degrees, <b>nacelle</b> nozzle pressure ratios from 1. 0 to 1. 6, and at propeller tip speeds from 700 to 800 ft/sec. The results of this study indicate that the turboprop <b>nacelle</b> interference, with and without power, on a swept wing is greater on the inboard wing panel than on the outboard wing panel. The over-the-wing <b>nacelle</b> installation with the propeller upwash on the inboard panel had flow separation problems at a Mach number of 0. 80. No severe flow separation problems appear to exist for either propeller rotation direction for the under-the-wing <b>nacelle</b> installation. The local flow disturbances caused by the under-the-wing <b>nacelle</b> installation were in general less severe than for the over-the-wing <b>nacelle</b> installation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWind {{turbines}} {{installed in}} Saharan climate operate often under severe weather conditions. Particularly, the electric/electronic equipments {{located within the}} <b>nacelle</b> may be subjected to extremely high temperature. To maintain acceptable temperature levels inside the <b>nacelle</b> and control efficiently the thermal effect, cooling systems should be used properly. This paper presents a numerical method to investigate the <b>nacelle</b> thermal behaviour of wind turbines operating under extremely hot weather conditions. The air flow in and around <b>nacelle</b> is described through the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The energy equation {{has been used to}} account for heat transfer effects. A Control-Volume Finite Element Method has been used to solve the resulting governing equations. The simulations have been performed through a typical commercial wind turbine. Results including temperature fields in and around the <b>nacelle</b> have been obtained and showed quite reasonable behaviour. Mainly, the impact of an appropriate cooling system that can be designed and applied in <b>nacelle</b> thermal control is presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>nacelle</b> is {{housing the}} gearbox and {{generator}} connecting {{the tower and}} rotor. Sensors detect the wind speed and direction, and motors turn the <b>nacelle</b> into the wind to maximize output.|$|R
5|$|The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 {{radial engine}} was {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets {{in the rear of}} the engine <b>nacelles</b> and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The <b>nacelles</b> were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their <b>nacelles</b> when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
50|$|Other {{established}} {{production sites}} included <b>nacelle</b> manufacture at Hutchinson, Kansas (USA, 1.6 GW) and hub production at Ølgod (Denmark). As of 2016 a new <b>nacelle</b> plant is under development at Cuxhaven (Germany).|$|R
40|$|Conceptual <b>nacelle</b> {{designs for}} wide-bodied and for advanced-technology {{transports}} were studied {{with the objective}} of achieving significant reductions in community noise with minimum penalties in airplane weight, cost, and in operating expense by the application of advanced composite materials to <b>nacelle</b> structure and sound suppression elements. <b>Nacelle</b> concepts using advanced liners, annular splitters, radial splitters, translating centerbody inlets, and mixed-flow nozzles were evaluated and a preferred concept selected. A preliminary design study of the selected concept, a mixed flow <b>nacelle</b> with extended inlet and no splitters, was conducted and the effects on noise, direct operating cost, and return on investment determined...|$|R
40|$|An {{aircraft}} wing has an inboard section and an outboard section. The inboard section is attached (i) {{on one side}} thereof to the aircraft's fuselage, and (ii) on an opposing side thereof to an inboard side of a turbofan engine <b>nacelle</b> in an over-the-wing mounting position. The outboard section's leading edge has a sweep of at least 20 degrees. The inboard section's leading edge has a sweep between - 15 and + 15 degrees, and extends from the fuselage to an attachment position on the <b>nacelle</b> that is forward of an index position defined as an imaginary intersection between the sweep of the outboard section's leading edge and the inboard side of the <b>nacelle.</b> In an alternate embodiment, the turbofan engine <b>nacelle</b> is replaced with an open rotor engine <b>nacelle...</b>|$|R
