50|$|On 3 June 1534, the {{municipality}} of Calheta {{was separated from}} that of the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>administration</b> of Velas, and the village of Calheta was elevated to the status of town by King John III of Portugal.Construction began on 8 January 1639 after the original 16th century building was destroyed by fire. The chronicler Friar Agostinho de Monte Alverne wrote of the incident, noting that all was destroyed except the main body and the sacramental bread. To mark the occasion, the municipal council of Calheta decided to commemorate the event with a procession, ritual mass and sermon in 1664. These commemorative rituals were later provided for in the testaments of Captain-Major Bartolomeu Pereira and his grandson, Father José Soares de Sousa.|$|E

50|$|The {{municipality}} of Macedo de Cavaleiros {{is situated in}} the northeast region of the Trás-os-Montes, within the district of Bragança, limited by the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>administrations</b> of Bragança, Vinhais, Mirandela, Alfândega da Fé, Mogadouro and Vimioso. It occupies {{the central part of}} the district, in a transitional zone between the distinctly different Terra Fria (Cold Lands) and Terra Quente (Hot Lands). The median altitude in the municipality is between 600 and 700 metres, marked in the north by the Serra de Nogueira, in the centre by the Serra de Ala and Serra do Cubo, and in the south by the Serra de Bornes and the Monte de Morais.|$|R
30|$|Pastoralists have to {{make the}} {{difficult}} choice of destocking in order to buy crop residues and bring water for their herds, using tankers {{in order for them to}} continue their pastoral system of livelihood. Those who avoid such a choice may, over time, risk losing their herds. However, even this choice is becoming partly difficult to achieve, since some of the mechanized scheme owners have started to invest in raising herds and using their crop scheme residues to feed their own livestock. One more choice that pastoralists make is to cross the borders into Ethiopia where there are available grazing sources. To do so, they need to make arrangements with the local leadership on the Ethiopian side. This could be resolved if a soft border is agreed upon between Gadarif state and the <b>neighbouring</b> Ethiopian <b>administration.</b>|$|R
40|$|Summer cells' of the {{adrenal gland}} in Rana catesbeiana were {{investigated}} by means of fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Orthophthaldialdehyde treatment of freeze-dried tissues revealed that the summer cells possess histamine in the cytoplasmic granules. Based on the 'Faglu' technique, the summer cells {{were found to be}} free of monoamines. Ultrastructural examination showed that each summer cell was invariably surrounded by lipid cells and was segregated from other tissue components including <b>neighbouring</b> summer cells. <b>Administration</b> of compound 48 / 80 (a histamine liberator) evoked a rapid release of cytoplasmic granules. The envelope of the lipid cells became detached from the summer cells in the course of degranulation. Relationship between the summer cells and the mast cell family is discussed...|$|R
500|$|The one {{exception}} to this process were the Tahirids, who remained in place as autonomous governors of their Khurasani super-province, encompassing most of the eastern Caliphate. In addition, the Tahirids provided the governor of Baghdad, and helped to keep the city, a focus of opposition to the Caliph under al-Ma'mun, quiescent. The post was held throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab, who, according to the Orientalist C. E. Bosworth, was [...] "always one of al-Mu'tasim's closest advisers and confidants". Apart from the Turkish military and the Tahirids, al-Mu'tasim's administration depended on the central fiscal bureaucracy. As {{the main source of}} revenue were the rich lands of southern Iraq (the Sawad) and <b>neighbouring</b> areas, the <b>administration</b> was staffed mostly with men drawn from these regions. The new caliphal bureaucratic class that emerged under al-Mu'tasim were thus mostly Persian or Aramean in origin, with a large proportion of newly converted Muslims and even a few Nestorian Christians, who came from landowner or merchant families. On his accession, al-Mu'tasim appointed as his chief minister or vizier his old personal secretary, al-Fadl ibn Marwan. A man trained in the traditions of the Abbasid bureaucracy, he was distinguished for his caution and frugality, and tried to shore up the finances of the state. These traits eventually caused his downfall, when he refused to authorize the Caliph's gifts to his courtiers on grounds that the treasury could not afford it. He was dismissed in 836, but was lucky enough not to suffer further punishment other than being sent into exile to the village of al-Sinn. His replacement, Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat, was of a completely different character: a rich merchant, he is described by Kennedy as [...] "a competent financial expert but a callous and brutal man who made many enemies", even among his fellow members of the administration. Nevertheless, and even though his political authority never exceeded the fiscal domain, he managed to maintain his office throughout the reign, and under al-Mu'tasim's successor al-Wathiq (...) as well.|$|R
