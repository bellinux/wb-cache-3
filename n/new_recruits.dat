5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 <b>new</b> <b>recruits</b> for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the {{recruitment}} quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the <b>new</b> <b>recruits</b> as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} phase of Operation Osterei, I/28 was {{withdrawn}} from the fighting and transferred to Pristina in Kosovo to form part of the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian) being raised by Himmler's order. A new I/28 was raised from other divisional units and <b>new</b> <b>recruits.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first {{contingent}} of police enlisted for a three-year term of service, but later recruits enlisted for five year periods, {{with the possibility}} of their purchasing an early discharge. Early in the force's history, the training of recruits was carried out on an ad hoc basis at the police's headquarters; in response, a depot for training <b>new</b> <b>recruits</b> created in Regina in 1885, based on the Royal Irish Constabulary Depot in Dublin, which took a much more structured approach. The use of the depot declined in line with the reduced number of <b>new</b> <b>recruits</b> joining the force after 1895, and was ultimately replaced by the new School of Instruction in 1899. Efforts were taken throughout the 1880s and 1890s {{to improve the quality of}} recruits being accepted by the force, and to tackle the related problems of early discharge and desertion, which was making staff retention a serious problem.|$|E

5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to <b>new</b> <b>recruits,</b> but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of <b>new</b> <b>recruits,</b> who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{soldiers}} {{serving in}} the Dąbrowski Legion were granted Lombardian citizenship and were paid the same wage as other troops. They were allowed {{to use their own}} unique Polish-style uniforms, with some French and Lombardian symbols, and were commanded by other Polish speakers. By early February 1797 the Legion was 1,200 strong, having been bolstered by the arrival of many <b>new</b> <b>recruits</b> who had deserted from the Austrian army.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach {{acquired}} two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, {{and defensive}} center Bill Russell.

The Celtics reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan.

5|$|Despite the {{negative}} associations with service there, Nolan had deliberately {{transferred to a}} regiment operating in India. He initially travelled to Maidstone, where the 15th maintained a troop to train <b>new</b> <b>recruits,</b> {{under the command of}} Captain George Key. He then caught a troopship to Bombay, the Malabar, which arrived on 9 November. Soon after arrival he fell ill and was granted two years of sick leave, starting from 26 March 1840, and returned to Britain. He returned to active service in June 1841, again to the Maidstone depot, and became a Lieutenant on the 19th. He went on leave again in August to take the riding master's course and exam, and returned on 8 March 1842, newly qualified.|$|E
