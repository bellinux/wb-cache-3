The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US, she had been exposed to different types of music that she had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before,</b> including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before.</b> Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, {{unreleased}} tracks {{from the}} album's recording sessions were {{leaked to the}} internet.

The leak included three songs <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before</b> including [...] "Goldmine," [...] "Fall Water" [...] and [...] "Rock & Roll" [...] along with the original version of [...] "Fortune Faded." [...] Many of the songs are featured under their working titles (which prior to release were also mentioned in various interviews): Soul Train ("By the Way"), Coltraine ("The Zephyr Song"), I Would Die ("I Could Die For You"), Drone ("This is the Place"), Throw Away ("Throw Away Your Television"), Epic ("Venice Queen") and New Wave ("Rivers of Avalon)" [...] To date, [...] "Strumming on [...] D and J", a song assumed to be an instrumental jam and that Frusciante mentioned during pre-album release interviews, has never been released.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, at the Grammis ceremony, Roxette {{received}} a Music Export Prize from the Swedish Government. After that came {{a set of}} compilations, The Ballad Hits in late 2002 and The Pop Hits in early 2003. Each set contained a separate CD with material previously available and <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before</b> tracks. [...] "A Thing About You" [...] was released as the lead single from The Ballad Hits. The album was released in the UK on 14 February 2003 to coincide with Valentine's Day and entered the charts there at No.23 before climbing to its peak position of No.11 a week later. It also peaked in the top 10 in Germany and The Netherlands. The single [...] "Opportunity Nox" [...] was released from The Pop Hits in 2003. The Ballad Hits which sold over a million copies within a year, helped the duo win a World Music Award as the Best selling Scandinavian artist in October 2003.

500|$|The song {{became so}} {{identified}} with Emmett and the Virginia Minstrels {{that it became}} part of their foundation myth. Billy Whitlock and George B. Wooldridge both claimed that the troupe members played [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] in their first impromptu performance together:[...] [...] as if by accident, each one picked up his tools and joined in a chorus of [...] "Old Dan Tucker," [...] while Emmett was playing and singing. It went well, and they repeated it without saying a word. Each did his best, and such a rattling of the principal and original instruments in a minstrel band was <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before.</b> Emmett repeated this story in the May 19, 1877, New York Clipper, although other details changed. The press began to refer to Emmett as [...] "Ole Dan Tucker", and Emmett eventually adopted the nickname. The Virginia Minstrels sometimes went by [...] "Ole Dan Tucker and Co." [...] They were called [...] "Old Dan Tucker & Co.," [...] either by themselves or by the press, as early as February 16, 1843.|$|E
500|$|While McDonald {{observed}} a predominant R element, Russell felt the xx's music evoked the early hip hop records {{he listened to}} when he was young, as they were often limited to vocals, samples, and beats. Music journalists, however, inferred from xx that their influences were alternative rock acts such as Portishead, Young Marble Giants, and Cocteau Twins, the last of which Croft said she had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before</b> the album was released. The Scotsman described xx as a minimalist, melancholic indie pop record that draws on elements from electronica and R, as well as The Cure and other alternative groups. According to Sarah Boden of The Observer, the album's unadorned, dream pop love songs are reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star, because they feature low tempos, moody melodies, and rhythms influenced by R and dubstep. Their arrangements have what Neil McCormick called [...] "a very British, industrial aspect", somewhat similar to the dub-inflected post-punk sound of English producer Martin Hannett and his work with the band Joy Division. Both Croft and Sim said their combination of seemingly disparate influences could {{have been attributed to}} the variety in each band member's music collection.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{youngest}} of 14 siblings, Jean was one of ten girls who slept in one room of the farming family's farm house.

2500|$|With {{their first}} album, the self-titled Soda Stereo (1984), they reached {{national}} success with joyful and ironic lyrics, and {{a sound that}} combined pop, reggae, ska, and new wave, but were accused of being superficial and frivolous. The second album, Nada Personal, strengthened {{the popularity of the}} band, with instant classics such as [...] "Nada Personal" [...] and [...] "Cuando Pase el Temblor" [...] opening the doors of the Latin American market; 1986's [...] "Signos" [...] would heavily increase their popularity and in 1988 they came up with what could arguably be called their masterpiece, their album [...] "Doble Vida". The musical arrangements and the lyrics reached a subtlety <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before</b> from the band's production, the most notable example being the album's lead single [...] "En La Ciudad De La Furia", a cryptically metaphorical ode to the band's hometown of Buenos Aires and the city's inhabitants.

2500|$|In the Middle Ages, {{music was}} an {{important}} part of the ceremony in Paris churches and at the royal court. The Emperor Charlemagne had founded a school at the first cathedral of Notre Dame in 781, whose students chanted during the mass; and the court also had a school, the schola palatina, which traveled wherever the imperial court went, and whose students took part in the religious services at the Royal Chapel. Large monasteries were founded on the Left Bank at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, which taught the art of religious chanting, adding more elaborate rhythms and rimes. When the new Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris was constructed, the Notre Dame school became famous for its innovations in vocal counterpoint, or polyphony. The Archdeacon Albert of the Notre Dame school became famous for composing the first known work for three voices, each chanting a different part at the same time. Another famous teacher at the Notre Dame school, Pérotin, composed for four different voices, with highly complex rhythms, blending all the voices together in ways <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before.</b> In the 13th century, the monks of the Notre Dame school developed an even more complex form, the motet, or [...] "little word"; short pieces for two or three voices, each chanting different words, and sometimes in different languages. The motet became so popular that it was used in non-religious music, in the court and even by musicians and singers on the streets.|$|E

2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>before.</b> [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
