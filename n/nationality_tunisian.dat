40|$|In this research, {{we examine}} the effect of extroversion and the {{perceived}} similarity on customer to customer interaction (CCI), and the effect of this interaction on the tourists’ reactions. We examine also the moderating role of the nationality in CCI and tourists behavior. The study is based on a sample of 519 tourists from different <b>nationalities</b> (<b>Tunisian,</b> French, German, British and Italian tourists) residing in hotels in Tunisia. The results show that extroversion and the perceived similarity {{contribute to the development of}} the interactions between customers, and that this type of interaction influences the tourists’ behavioral responses (desire of stay, satisfaction and loyalty).

Or all films shot in Tunisia? These criteria, which are national' at least in the sense of juridical and financial nationality', are generally appropriate in respect of the 60 or so films which can be considered as constituting a corpus of contemporary (that is, post-¬independence) Tunisian cinematography. The considerations which I shall develop here revolve around a central question, that of understanding what is signified by 'Tunisian', or tunisianité, and are intended as an attempt to read, through the diverse marquetry of cultural production represented by these films, the various meanings which they give to the 'nationality' they apparently share...|$|R
