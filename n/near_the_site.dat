5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E

5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1500, the Arikara (or Ree) {{had settled}} {{in much of the}} Missouri River valley. European contact with the area began in 1743, when the LaVérendrye {{brothers}} explored the region. The LaVérendrye group buried a plate <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of modern-day Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of greater Louisiana. in 1762 the entire region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802. By the early 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} known buildings in Switzerland were prehistoric stilt houses which were built by the Pfyn, Horgen, Cortaillod and La Tène cultures between 4000 and 500 BC. A number of these early buildings have been rebuilt <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where <b>the</b> ruins were discovered.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{reduction}} in traffic caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and the closure of many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, {{a decision was made}} to concentrate all passenger traffic into a single station. Although Cromer High had far better facilities, it was inconveniently situated {{on the edge of the}} town. Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed. Following growth of the town as a commuter town to Norwich, a new station called Roughton Road opened in 1985, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of the former Cromer High.|$|E
5|$|George and Anne {{were married}} on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, London, by Henry Compton, Bishop of London. The guests {{included}} King Charles II, Queen Catherine, and the Duke and Duchess of York. Anne was voted a parliamentary allowance of £20,000 a year, while George received £10,000 {{a year from}} his Danish estates, although payments from Denmark were often late or incomplete. King Charles gave them a set of buildings in the Palace of Whitehall known as the Cockpit (<b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{of what is now}} Downing Street in Westminster) as their London residence.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the new Labour {{administration}} of the London County Council renamed White Cross Street, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> of the Red Cross Hall and {{the scene of the}} Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today. The Chandlers' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands, and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present-day headquarters of the London Fire Brigade.|$|E
