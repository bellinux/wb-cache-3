Despite that Mvomero District has been doing its own best to facilitate teachers’ professional efficiency by enhancing motivation, there have been shortcomings that many teachers have been inadequately motivated. The general objective {{of the study was}} to assess the motivational factors affecting teachers’ professional efficiency in public secondary schools in Mvomero district. Case study research design was utilized in the methodology. A sample of 120 respondents was used. Data were collected using interview, questionnaires and analysed descriptively by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. The findings from the study indicated that, salaries have influenced teachers negatively as they seem to be unworthy of services rendered (80 %), do not meet their monthly expenses and remain with nothing to save (90 %). Promotion opportunities were available but lack or misplacement of documents due to negligence of officers led to promotion among teachers taking a long time (92 %). Lazy or non performing teachers were warned and sometimes demoted as a sign for <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> (80 %). However, there have been few or no houses for teaching and non-teaching staff, inadequate classrooms, desks, tables, playgrounds etc. were available, and do not match the requirements of a fully furnished school (82 %). Delays of payment de-motivated teachers while decent and equitable salary need to be paid. It is recommended that salaries, promotion practices, rewarding system and teaching-learning environment need to be enhanced for both teachers and students in Mvomero District...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Most {{models of}} {{intellectual}} capital measurment equal intellectual capital with intellectual assets. Nevertheless, companies sometimes must incur liabilities to make intellectual assets truly actionable. This fact suggests {{the existence of}} intangible liabilities. The aim {{of this paper is}} to refine the methods of assessment of intellectual capital by refining and extending the concept of intangible liabilities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper consists of a literature review of prior conceptualisations of intangible liabilities, and an empirical exploration of the employer-employee relationships that can originate intangible liabilities. Findings – The results of the empirical research show that a <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>obligations</b> by the company might cause organisational members to refrain from deploying their organisational knowledge in organisational processes. Thus, these obligations can be conceptualised as intangible liabilities. Research limitations/implications – The research has only explored intangible liabilities related to organisational members. Future research should explore the intangible liabilities that an organisation can incur with other constituencies, e. g. suppliers and clients. Practical implications – Managers can improve their models of intellectual capital measurement taking into account not only the intangible assets, but also the intangible liabilities. Taking into account intangible liabilities should bring awareness of the conditions that might hinder the deployment of organisational knowledge. Originality/value – The study brings a more refined, theoretically- and empirically-based conceptualisation of intangible liabilities than those provided so far, aiding to develop a more robust theory of intellectual capital measurement.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{examines}} {{the question whether}} legislative reform is the ‘silver bullet’ for the problems generated {{by the failure of}} a company which is exposed to claims arising from the <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> its environmental <b>obligations.</b> The limited capacity of the United Kingdom insolvency regime to facilitate the fulfilment of a debtor company's environmental obligations is often illustrated with reference to some significant judicial decisions. However, no real picture has emerged of the frequency with which these issues arise, based on which firm proposals for reform could be advanced. This paper argues that greater regard should be paid to existing mechanisms which provide a means of enabling insolvency risks to be managed or minimised, as these point towards the scope for these issues to be resolved through the environmental protection framework rather than through reliance on company and/or insolvency law. Design/methodology/approach: Research was conducted into the statutory and non-statutory regulations (such as statutory guidance), and case law principles, which underpin the treatment of the claims against an insolvent (or potentially insolvent) company resulting from its environmental activities. This included research into policies which have a bearing on this area, developed through governmental and civic consultations and studies. Findings: The paper concludes that the likelihood of a case for legislative reform being made out is weak, and the focus should accordingly shift to strengthening the effectiveness of existing law, policy and practice. Originality/value: This paper is the first (in the United Kingdom context) to challenge the perceived need for reform in this area, engaging with recent examples of such corporate failures and the impact of recent legislative and policy developments...|$|R

40|$|The {{right to}} {{compensation}} for damage due to breach of contract exists in both situations <b>of</b> <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> sales contracts, or in situations of lateness, and in situations of improper con- tract fulfilment. When the contract was terminated due to non-fulfilment, according to the general rules on liability for <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> contract, both parties are exempted from the obligations with the exception <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> compensation for potential damage (Article 121 (1) LO). This is also according to general rules on lateness, i. e. the general rules on non-fulfilment, Namely, when the debtor fails to fulfil an obligation or is overdue in its fulfilment, the creditor {{has the right to}} request compensation for the damage incurred as a consequence thereof (Article 251 (2) LO). For damages due to lateness in fulfilling the contract and a debtor that the creditor has provided with an adequate additional time for fulfilment (Article 251 (3) LO). Bearing in mind these provisions, the {{right to compensation}} for damage exists in the case of contract termination, also when the contract has been fulfilled but belatedly.

40|$|Reconsideration of T-duality of {{the open}} string allows us to {{introduce}} some geometric features in non-geometric theories. Starting with the observation that general coordinate transformations are T-dual to the gauge transformations, we introduce new, up to now missing term, with additional gauge field A^D_i (D denotes components with Dirichlet boundary conditions). It compensate <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> the invariance under general coordinate transformation on the end-points of open string, as well as standard gauge field A^N_a (N denotes components with Neumann boundary conditions) compensate <b>non-fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> the gauge invariance. Using generalized procedure we will perform T-duality of vector fields linear in coordinates. We show that gauge fields A^N_a and A^D_i are T-dual to ^ A_D^a and ^ A_N^i respectively. We introduce the field strength of T-dual non-geometric theories as derivative of T-dual gauge fields along both T-dual variable y_μ and its double ỹ_μ. This definition allows us to obtain gauge transformation of non-geometric theories which leaves T-dual field strength invariant. Therefore, we introduce some new features of non-geometric theories where field strength has both antisymmetric and symmetric parts.
