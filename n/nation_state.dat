Focusing on the new degree system in higher education in Europe, partly from Foucault’s governmentality perspective, the paper suggests that <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> retain power while operating in international settings. The study’s conclusions argue that the nation states’ power might be a chance for further participation of affected people...|$|R

5|$|With the {{repatriation}} of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union and the 1947 Operation Vistula dispersing the remaining Ukrainian minority, and {{with most of}} the former Jewish minority exterminated by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust and many of the survivors emigrating to the West and to newly created Israel, Poland for the first time became an ethnically homogeneous <b>nation</b> <b>state.</b> The government-imposed and spontaneous movements of people amounted to one of the greatest demographic upheavals in European history.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Germany {{became a}} <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> {{when most of}} the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the {{revolution}} of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E

30|$|In {{spite of}} the {{different}} roles, the general image is that <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> in the Third World are reluctant to promote environmental and social changes while such private governance models directly impact domestic economic development (Giessen et al. 2016; Abbott 2012; Mol 2010). However, <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> cannot simply ignore these private governance arrangements, as private actors have become one among equals with the <b>state,</b> and <b>nation</b> <b>states</b> are increasingly dependent on trade in achieving their development objectives (Cutler 1999; Milker 2011; Jessop 1997; Cashore 2002; Menocal 2004; Evans 1997).|$|R

5|$|The {{unification}} of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated <b>nation</b> <b>state</b> officially occurred on 18 January 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in France. Princes of the German states, excluding Austria, gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, {{the de facto}} transition {{of most of the}} German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulers—but in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal <b>nation</b> <b>state,</b> he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E
