5|$|Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz {{and his men}} {{probably}} {{forced the}} Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At that moment Paskevich was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces {{to look for the}} Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: [...] "I write songs, and my voice is {{just a way to}} get those lyrics across." [...] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is [...] "not the best technical singer", but described her as the [...] "best communicator that we've got". Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has [...] "put a lot of work" [...] into improving it. It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons. She has said that she only feels nervous performing [...] "if I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> audience thinks of me, like at award shows".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ben Richards. The general plot of India and Pakistan {{on the verge of}} nuclear war is based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. The beginning was not originally in the script; Richards wanted to feature a submarine crisis, but the producers were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> crisis would be. They eventually decided to have an Indian submarine [...] "taken hostage" [...] by the Pakistanis. They wanted to add a personal stake towards Tariq, by revealing that members of his family live in Pakistan. The intent was to include and develop a potential relationship between Ros and Lawrence {{to the point where they}} bond during their final scenes before the hotel explosion. They also wanted to touch up on the Harry/Ruth relationship, which was not in the original script; so Ben Richards added the scenes as additional dialogue.|$|E

5000|$|Lehman Brothers Investment Management Director George Herbert Walker IV {{dismissed}} the proposal, {{going so far}} as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea of bonus reduction having been suggested. He wrote, [...] "Sorry team. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what's</b> in <b>the</b> water at Neuberger Berman. I'm embarrassed and I apologize." ...|$|R
500|$|James Hunt for Den of Geek {{said that}} the episode was {{not as bad as}} [...] "", but that it {{contained}} [...] "almost every terrible cliché seen in TNG first season in one episode". He summed it up, saying [...] "We've seen all of this before, and it was barely interesting the first time around. The second time, it's just tedious. A horrible episode on so many levels." [...] Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club and said that he [...] "expected more from TNG", saying that he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> reversal of gender roles in the episode was meant to achieve. He described the virus subplot as [...] "absurd" [...] and gave the episode an F grade. The episode was included in a couple of worst episode lists, including in one compiled by Scott Thrill for Wired magazine, and it was ranked the fourth worst episode by Jay Garmon at the website TechRepublic.|$|E
500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} intended for Kakashi to {{debut in the}} second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to {{the other members of}} Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite [...] "de gozaru" [...] in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.|$|E

2500|$|Ancestry {{data was}} {{included}} in the 1986 census. [...] It was found when the data was evaluated that people who filled in the census were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> question meant and there were inconsistent results, particularly for those people whose families had been in Australia for many generations. There were no ancestry related questions in 1991 or 1996. [...] For 2001 it was decided that development of Government policies did need information about people who were either born overseas, or whose parents were born overseas. [...] The questions were to mark the ancestries most closely identified with and to consider ancestry back as far as three generations. Respondents had the option of reporting more than one ancestry but only the first two ancestries they reported were coded for the census.|$|E
2500|$|Buffy earned {{international}} attention for its unflinching {{focus on the}} relationship between Willow and Tara Maclay. Whedon and the writing staff had been considering developing a story arc in which a character explores his or her sexuality as the Scoobies left high school, but no particular effort was made to assign this arc to Willow. In 1999, {{at the end of the}} third season, the Boston Herald called Buffy [...] "the most gay show on network TV this year" [...] despite having no overtly gay characters among the core cast. It simply presented storylines that resembled coming out stories. In the fourth season episode [...] "Hush", Willow meets Tara, and to avoid being killed by a group of ghouls, they join hands to move a large vending machine telekinetically to barricade a door. The scene was, upon completion, noticeably sensual to Whedon, the producers, and network executives, who encouraged Whedon to develop a romantic storyline between Willow and Tara, but at the same time placed barriers on how far it could go and what could be shown. Two episodes later, Hannigan and Amber Benson were informed that their characters would become romantically involved. The actors were not told the end result of the Willow–Oz–Tara storyline, <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> eventual trajectory of the relationship would be, until Hannigan said, [...] "Then finally it was, 'Great! It's official. We're in luurrvvve.'" ...|$|E

She was too well hidden for that; but she was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> effect of her voice would be, for she had never tried it in that way before. However, she was full of courage. She resembled me in that--bold as a lion! She began to sing. Low and soft at the beginning, like a dream of song.|$|E
40|$|Vitamins - those tricky little uncertainties- have managed, {{during the}} last ten years, to upset more weighty {{theories}} and distract more conscientious housewives {{than any of us}} care to remember. Therefore, it seems only fair that vitamins should be made to line up their ever-increasing dietetic alphabet and fully explain themselves {{to those of us who}} are <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> big to-do concerning tomato juice and vegetable cooking water is really all about...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} 1932 {{agreement with}} the syndicate called for any films made within ten years and any elements {{of them to be}} destroyed in 1942. This would have destroyed all of the Fleischer Popeye shorts. King was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> effect <b>the</b> cartoons would have on the strip; if the effect was very negative, King was very eager to erase any memory of the cartoons by destroying them. Paramount knew that the Popeye cartoons were among their best-selling and most popular, and they held them separately for future distribution, seeing television as a rising outlet.|$|R
60|$|She was {{probably}} not {{the daughter of a}} hundred earls, but there must have been some such far-descended fair among the ladies who showed themselves {{from time to time in}} the royal paddock across a little space from our Grand Stand. The enclosure has no doubt a more technical name, which I would call it by if I knew it, for I do not wish to be irreverent; but paddock is very sporty, and it must serve my occasion. The King never showed himself there at all, though much craned round for and eagerly expected. But ladies and gentlemen moved about in the close, and stood and talked together; very tall people, very easily straight and well set up, very handsome, and very amiable-looking; they may have been really kind and good, or they may have looked so to please the King and keep his spirits up. I did not then, but I do now, realize that these were courtiers, such as one has always read of, and were of very historical quality in their attendance on the monarch. I trust it will not take from the dignity of the fact if I note that several of the courtiers wore derby hats, and one was in a sack coat and a topper. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fairer reader will think if I tell that one of the ladies had on a dress with a white body and crimson skirt and sleeves, and a vast black picture-hat, and wore it with a charming air of authority.|$|E
50|$|Intuitively, we can {{eliminate}} a PBE {{if there is}} a type of player who wants to deviate even though he is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> beliefs of other players are.

5000|$|Collins {{wrote the}} song amid the grief he felt after divorcing {{his first wife}} Andrea Bertorelli in 1980. In a 2016 interview, Collins said of the song's lyrics: [...] "I wrote the lyrics spontaneously.

[...] In a 1997 BBC Radio 2 documentary, the singer {{revealed}} that the divorce contributed to his 1979 hiatus from Genesis until the band regrouped in October of that year to record the album Duke.|$|R

50|$|Also, {{volatility}} in {{the price}} of natural resources, and thus the real exchange rate, limits investment by private firms, because firms will not invest if they are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future economic conditions will be. Commodity exports such as raw materials, drive up the value of the currency. This is what leads to the lack of competition in the other sectors of the economy. The extraction of natural resources is also extremely capital intensive, resulting in few new jobs being created.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009/10 season, Tahir {{moved from}} the Titans to the Dolphins. This was {{due to a lack of}} {{first-class}} cricket with the club, who preferred to play 23-year-old leg-spinner Shaun von Berg. When Tahir was called into South Africa's squad for the final Test against England, national coach Mickey Arthur said [...] "I'm <b>not</b> entirely <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> issues are between him and the Titans, but the Titans obviously aren't going to pick him because they'd rather pick the young leggie they have".

He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted.
