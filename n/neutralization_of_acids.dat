30|$|From the proton {{spectrum}} of B. cepacia fermentation broth using Paulownia elongate WEH {{as a substrate}} (Figure  3), right shifting of resonance peaks of 3 -HB is observed. For example, the CH resonance peak located at 1.20  ppm for the regent 3 -HB, but it shifted slightly right to 1.12  ppm for the 3 -HB produced in the fermentation broth. This resonance peak shifting is most probably resulted from <b>neutralization</b> <b>of</b> <b>acids</b> by sodium hydroxide.

Current methods for the stabilization and mass treatment of paper are based on the <b>neutralization</b> <b>of</b> <b>acids</b> and deposition of a mineral buffer in the fibrous network, called alkaline reserve, which helps the paper fighting future acidity arising during the natural aging process. The CoMPresSil project aims at developing a new innovative treatment methodology based on the incorporation of aminoalkylalkoxysilane polymers (AAAS) (ex. polyAMDES) and copolymer networks (ex. polyAPTES/polyAMDES) in the paper fibers. The treatment not only provides alkalinity (amine function), but also physical reinforcement of the cellulosic fibers (in-situ polymerization), thereby inducing a significant improvement of the mechanical properties of paper. The methodology mainly targets very degraded documents such as newsprint collections, which are prone to rapid acidification due to their chemical composition...|$|E

Current methods for the stabilization and mass treatment of paper are based on the <b>neutralization</b> <b>of</b> <b>acids</b> and deposition of a mineral buffer, called alkaline reserve, in the fibrous network. This treatment helps the paper fighting future acidity arising during the natural aging process. The aim of our research is to develop a stabilization methodology allowing simultaneous deacidification and fiber strengthening. This novel preservation strategy for acidic and fragile paper especially targets documents that are currently banned from public access because of their poor physical condition. In previous publications, a multifunctional solvent phase process based on various polysiloxanes with amine functionality (aminoalkylalkoxysilanes) was studied as an alternative for libraries and archives. Deacidification is ensured by the amine function and reinforcement is effected by in-situ polymerization in the paper of the polysiloxane in ambient conditions. In this work we propose the use of a di-alkoxysilane (AMDES, aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane) and a tri-alkoxy aminosilane (APTES, aminopropyltriethoxysilane), both bearing an amine function, as well as their copolymer (polyAPTES/polyAMDES) as fibers strengthening agents in a model paper made of pure cellulose...|$|E

30|$|Because {{alkaline}} areas {{cover the}} entire periphery of young internodal cells in C. globularis, calcification is induced and develops there, including the cell wall and the cortex.

Such unclear acidification {{might be due to}} the <b>neutralization</b> <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> by CaCO 3 precipitates, whereas weak alkalization areas can be observed easily. Thus, the entire area of internodal cells was alkalized in C. globularis when the internodal cells were calcified.

40|$|The uptake of {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) virions to the nucleus, {{the site of}} viral replication, {{proceeds}} via engulfment at the cytoplasmic membrane and transport in monopinocytotic vesicles through the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane.

The infectivity of mammalian viruses requires the uptake and transport across the cytoplasmic membrane of the virus by the cell from the external milieu to an intracellular compartment.

The enthalpy per hydrolysed repeat unit was - 57. 3 kJ mol(- 1) for PVAc. For poly(lactic acid), PLA, fibres the enthalpy of hydrolysis was determined by integrating the heat produced during complete hydrolysis.
