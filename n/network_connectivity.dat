40|$|Modern {{non-invasive}} brain imaging technologies, such as diffusion weighted {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (DWI), enable the mapping of neural fiber tracts in the white matter, providing a basis to reconstruct a detailed map of brain structural <b>connectivity</b> <b>networks.</b> Brain <b>connectivity</b> <b>networks</b> differ from random networks in their topology, which can be measured using small worldness, modularity, and high-degree nodes (hubs).

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous <b>network</b> <b>connectivity)</b> and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E

In typical connectivitynetworks-based classification approaches, local measures of <b>connectivity</b> <b>networks</b> are first extracted from each region-of-interest as network features, which are then concatenated into a vector for subsequent feature selection and classification. However, some useful structural information of network, especially global topological information, may be lost in this type of approaches.
