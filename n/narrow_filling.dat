50|$|Founded in {{the early}} 19th century {{as a result of}} the land-grant Illinois Central Railroad's {{expansion}} southward, Tolono was initially home to many railroad employees. Many streets bear the names of the IC's administrative staff. The original homes in the community were small and <b>narrow</b> <b>filling</b> half lots adjacent to the railroad tracks. With the intersection of an east-west railway, Tolono became a featured stop for early rail passengers. The peak of the railroad's passenger influence in Tolono occurred when Tolono became the last stop in Illinois for Abraham Lincoln as he bid farewell to his home state in a speech given from the back of his coach.|$|E
40|$|The low-lying neutral {{excitation}} {{spectrum of the}} incompressible quantum Hall fluid at ν= 5 / 2 is investigated by inelastic light scattering. Gapped modes are observable only in a very <b>narrow</b> <b>filling</b> factor range centered at 5 / 2 at energies that overlap estimates from transport activation gaps. The modes are interpreted as critical points in the wave-vector dispersion of excitations that preserve spin orientation. For very small changes |δν|≲ 0. 01 the gapped modes disappear and a continuum of low-lying excitations takes over indicating the transition from an incompressible fluid at 5 / 2 to a compressible state. Observations of spin wave modes indicate spin polarization of the 5 / 2 and 2 + 1 / 3 quantum Hall fluids. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

G. suevicus had a distinctively long, <b>narrow</b> snout <b>filled</b> with small, pointed teeth very different from skulls belonging to the type species.

40|$|The {{capsules}} used in ignition {{experiments on}} the National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser {{will have a}} layer of frozen DT inside a low-Z shell. Liquid DT will be injected through a <b>narrow</b> <b>fill</b> tube that penetrates the shell and frozen in place. The fill tube is a perturbation {{on the surface of}} the capsule and hydrodynamic instabilities will cause this perturbation to grow during an implosion. Experiments to investigate the growth of perturbations due to fill tubes have been carried out on the Omega laser. The goal of these experiments was to validate simulations at Omega energy scales and thus increase confidence in the use of simulations in planning for NIF experiments. Simulations show that the fill tube leads to a jet of shell material that penetrates into the DT fuel. Simulations will be used to pick experimental conditions in which the jet is small enough that it does not significantly reduce the yield of a NIF implosion. This paper compares experiments in which bumps and stalks were used as fill tube surrogates to 2 D simulations of x-ray emission from Omega capsule implosions. Experiments and simulations are in reasonable agreement on the size of a bump or stalk required to produce a jet that is visible above the emission from a (nominally) smooth capsule...|$|R
