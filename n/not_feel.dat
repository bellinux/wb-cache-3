5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing {{could have been done}} to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> guilty.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E

5|$|Back in the warehouse, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) unsuccessfully {{tries to}} {{strike up a}} {{relationship}} with a new warehouse worker, Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), observing Gabe's pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val does <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the same way, but to no avail. When Gabe does ask Val out, she politely declines and says she does not date co-workers. Darryl hears all of this and decides he will not pursue Val either.|$|E
5|$|Brandon later {{returned}} to active service, commanding his regiment through the Battle of Gettysburg. General William Barksdale {{was killed in}} the battle; Colonel Humphreys became brigadier general to replace him, and Brandon was in turn promoted to colonel. He went on to see action in the Chickamauga Campaign. In September 1863, after the Battle of Chickamauga, Brandon resigned from active duty. Because of his artificial leg, age and the recurrence of an ailment from 1862, he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> fit for military service at the time.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the game}} were leaked in February 2007, shortly before Rare {{announced}} development later that month. During development process Rare attempted {{to ensure that the}} game did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> too similar to the original Jetpac, whilst keeping the core mechanics. The game received mostly favourable reviews upon release. Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay, however they criticised the overall repetitiveness {{of the game}} and its multiplayer mode. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|His {{comeback}} to the County Championship {{continued with}} a 44-ball half-century against Middlesex on 19 April 2007, while in May {{he hit a}} career-best 284 against Northamptonshire, although Trescothick stated then that he did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> ready for an international Test match position. Trescothick followed this double century with a knock of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Capello {{returned}} to Milan, subsequently stating Baggio {{was not a}} part of his plans with the club. Baggio chose to move to Parma, but the manager at the time, Carlo Ancelotti, impeded the transfer, as he also did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> Baggio would fit into his tactical plans. Ancelotti would later state he regretted this decision, stating that in his naïveté, he believed that the 4–4–2 formation was the ideal formation for success, and he felt that at the time, creative players such as Gianfranco Zola and Baggio were not compatible with this system.|$|E
5000|$|McGillivray {{was soon}} {{involved}} in the British sex film industry, writing scripts for I'm <b>Not</b> <b>Feeling</b> Myself Tonight (1975) and The Hot Girls (1974), two films produced by pornographer John Jesnor Lindsay. As {{would be the case}} with many of his films, McGillivray makes cameo appearances in both: in I’m <b>Not</b> <b>Feeling</b> Myself Tonight he is “Man at Party” who pulls Monika Ringwald’s dress off while in The Hot Girls he was given the job of doing an onscreen interview with Danish actress Helli Louise, who according to the synopsis in Cinema X magazine, talks to him about [...] "working on a movie, and telling a few facts of life about screen nudity and enacting lesbian love scenes." ...|$|R

He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

5|$|Late in rehearsals for the {{original}} production, Jessie Bond {{assumed the role of}} Hebe, replacing Mrs Howard Paul. Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue. Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.|$|E

Love does <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Nash did not rush {{to enlist}} in the Australian armed forces on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. While there was no public statement from Nash, {{it is thought that}} with a family to support and an Irish Catholic anti-pathy to the British, Nash did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> an urgency to fight. However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E

Her father wanted her {{to have a good}} education so, despite the family's Protestant religion, sent her to various Catholic convent schools around the county. One was St Maur's Convent School in Weybridge, which she attended with Liza Tarbuck. Ripley did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> academically challenged there, and later declared the school mediocre.|$|E
5|$|Some {{suggested}} that the non-Malays did <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> loyal to Malaya {{because they did not}} consider themselves to be of Malayan nationality and adhere strictly to their own ethnic cultural backgrounds. To counter this, in 1952 citizenship was granted to nearly all local-born non-Malays, and dual citizenship prohibited, forcing non-Malays to choose between their ancestral homeland and Malaya. In contrast to the Malay's hypothesis, a majority of the non-Malays remained, thus proving their allegiance to Malaya. They are the ancestor of modern-day non-Malay Malaysian.|$|E
