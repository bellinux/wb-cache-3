2500|$|The salvage of Squalus was {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Cyrus W. Cole, Commander of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, who supervised salvage officer Lieutenant Floyd A. Tusler from the Construction Corps. Tusler's {{plan was to}} lift the submarine in three stages {{to prevent it from}} rising too quickly, out of control, with one end up, in which case there would be a high likelihood of it sinking again. For 50 days, divers worked to pass cables underneath the submarine and attach pontoons for buoyancy. On 13 July 1939, the stern was raised successfully, but when the men attempted to free the bow from the hard blue clay, the vessel began to rise far too quickly, slipping its cables. Ascending vertically, the submarine broke the surface, and [...] of the bow reached into the air for not more than ten seconds before she sank once again {{all the way to the}} bottom. Momsen said of the mishap, [...] "pontoons were smashed, hoses cut and I might add, hearts were broken." [...] After 20 more days of preparation, with a radically redesigned pontoon and cable arrangement, the <b>next</b> <b>lift</b> was successful, as were two further operations. Squalus was towed into Portsmouth on 13 September, and decommissioned on 15 November. A total of 628 dives had been made in rescue and salvage operations.|$|E

We shall <b>next</b> <b>lift,</b> as far as possible, the veil which has concealed for {{a century and a}} half adventures in themselves unimportant enough. In spite of disappointments and dark hours of desertion, Charles, who was much of a boy, probably enjoyed the mystery which he now successfully created. If he could not startle Europe by a brilliant appearance on any stage, he could keep it talking and guessing by a disappearance. He obviously relished secrecy, pass-words, disguises, the 'properties' of the conspirator, in the spirit of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He came of an evasive race. His grandfather, as Duke of York, had fled from England disguised as a girl. His father had worn many disguises in many adventures. HE had been 'Betty Burke.' ...|$|E

60|$|As {{the captain}} spoke, the {{schooner}} seemed {{to recover from}} the shock and again rushed forward on her foaming course; but before the men had time to breathe, she struck again--this time less violently, as had been predicted--and the <b>next</b> wave, <b>lifting</b> her over the shoal, launched her into deep water.|$|R
50|$|The bale hoist {{was used}} to load bales of wool onto {{transports}} and {{is located on the}} rear eastern side of the woolshed, adjacent to the powerhouse. The hoist is made from steel and consists of a vertical upright with a horizontal arm at the top. The arm is supported by decorative steel bracing. Part of the hydraulic power network, the hoist had a single cable that operated through a series of sheaves; the lower sheave is now missing. Historical evidence suggests a ball weight was mounted above the hoist hook, which was sufficient enough to pull the cable to the ground and force the piston into position for the <b>next</b> <b>lift.</b> The vertical upright of the hoist is supported by two angled steel braces.|$|E
50|$|The {{resort is}} among the newest within the Massif Central, with skiing {{appearing}} {{in the area around}} the beginning of the 20th century, although the area became forgotten during World War II. Afterwards interest in the sport in the area resurfaced, possibly owing to the influence of the British. The first lift to be constructed at the resort was the Téléski Débrayable de Massebœuf, a single place detachable button lift built by one of the residents in 1947. This lift continued to operate until 1984 when it was replaced by a three place fixed chair lift. The <b>next</b> <b>lift</b> to be built was the Téléski Débrayable de la Gare, built in 1965, to provide a link between the railway station in the valley bottom and Prairie de Sagnes further up the mountain, it is still running today.|$|E

A very strong Ottoman counter-attack north of this wadi became critical until units in the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie (DFPS) appeared on Scurry Hill and opened fire on the Ottoman attackers who were forced to surrender. By 14:00 it was found that Ottoman defences to the north had been captured and a move towards Mesha, Bidya and Kh. Sirisia began. This fighting continued on into the night and by 03:00 20 September Mesha had been occupied and Bidya entered.|$|E

50|$|Pilots {{sometimes}} fly at the aircraft's best L/D by precisely controlling airspeed and smoothly {{operating the}} controls to reduce drag. However {{the strength of}} the likely <b>next</b> <b>lift,</b> minimising the time spent in strongly sinking air and {{the strength of the}} wind also affects the optimal speed to fly. Pilots fly faster to get quickly through sinking air, and when heading into wind to optimise the glide angle relative to the ground. To achieve higher speed across country, gliders (sailplanes) are often loaded with water ballast to increase the airspeed and so reach the next area of lift sooner. This has little effect on the glide angle since the increases in the rate of sink and in the airspeed remain in proportion and thus the heavier aircraft achieves optimal L/D at a higher airspeed. If the areas of lift are strong on the day, the benefits of ballast outweigh the slower rate of climb.|$|E
50|$|Some gravity railroads were {{designed}} to allow {{the weight of the}} descending loaded cars to lift the empty cars back up to the top, using a cable looped around a pulley at the top for a portion of the line. A later revision designed by John B. Jervis, used two separate tracks known as the loaded or heavy track which carried cars loaded with coal to the destination, and the light track, used to return empty cars to the mines. This method allowed cars to travel in a loop, without the need for passing sidings. A stationary steam engine and a looping cable, chain or iron bands were used to raise the empty cars up the lift planes. The cars then coasted down a slight grade to the <b>next</b> <b>lift</b> plane. When cars reversed direction at the ends of the line on a switch or turnout instead of a loop, the railroad was known as a switchback gravity railroad.|$|E
50|$|Before Ajax arrived divers {{had already}} dug a tunnel under O-5's bow for Ajax's lifting cables. Ajax arrived around midnight. Drives {{completed}} the cable install under the sub by early morning. Sheppard J. Shreaves was the {{supervisor of the}} salvage crew. Sheppard was a qualified diver, had been working himself all throughout the night helping to dig the tunnel under the submarine. Ajax was hooked to the cables run under the sub and worked to hoist the sub up. But the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew installed another cable under the bow. Shreaves and his men had been in their diving suits nearly 24 hours working on the rescue. The <b>next</b> <b>lift</b> the cable broke again. Near midnight on the 29th Ajax did its third lift, this lift worked as the divers has pumped air into the sub's flooded Engine Room. The bow of the O-5 broke the surface. The salvage team opened the torpedo room hatch, and two trapped sailors, Henry Breault and Lawrence T. Brown emerged.|$|E

50|$|At 03:00 on 3 February {{the troops}} of the first lift entered their {{transport}} planes, and at 07:00 the first transports left Mindoro. Protected by an escort of P-61 Black Widow night fighters, on arriving over Luzon they followed Highway 17 to Tagaytay Ridge. The ridge itself was an open space some two thousand yards (1,829 m) long and four thousand yards (3,657 m) wide, plowed in places, and had been largely cleared of Japanese troops by local Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas. At 08:15 the first echelon of the first lift, approximately 345 men, successfully parachuted into the drop zone. The second echelon, consisting of approximately 570 men, were dropped prematurely and landed about eight thousand yards (7,315 m) to the east. The <b>next</b> <b>lift</b> also encountered problems, with 425 men dropping correctly but another 1,325 dropping early due to pilot error and poor jump discipline. However, the entire regiment was assembled within five hours of the first landings. After overcoming minor Japanese resistance, by 15:00 the 511th had made contact with the 188th and 187th, and the entire division was once again assembled as a single formation. The ridge having been cleared of its remaining defenders, the division began to advance towards Manila, reaching the Paranaque River by 21:00. The city was protected by the Genko Line, a major Japanese defensive belt that stretched along Manila's southern edge. The line consisted of approximately 1,200 two- to three-story deep blockhouses, many of which emplaced naval guns or large-caliber mortars. Entrenched heavy anti-aircraft weapons, machine-gun nests and booby-traps made of naval bombs completed the defenses, which were manned by around 6,000 Japanese soldiers.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} which biomechanical and physiological variables {{were associated with the}} decision to change the weight of lift during the determination of the maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWL) in a psychophysical study. Fifteen male college students lifted a box of unknown weight at 4. 3 lifts/min, and adjusted the weight until their MAWL was reached. Variables such as heart rate, trunk positions, velocities and accelerations were measured during the lifting, as well as estimated spinal loading in terms of moments and spinal forces in three dimensions using an EMG-assisted biomechanical model. Multiple logistic regression techniques identi ® ed variables associated with the decision to change the weights up and down prior to a subsequent lift. Results indicated that heart rate, predicted sagittal lift moment and low back disorder (LBD) risk index were associated with decreases in the weight prior to the <b>next</b> <b>lift.</b> Thus, historical measures of LBD risk (e. g. compression, shear force) were not associated with decreases in weight prior to the <b>next</b> <b>lift.</b> Additionally, the magnitudes of the predicted spinal forces and LBD risk were all very high at the MAWL when compared with literature sources of tolerance as well as observational studies on LBD risk. Our ® ndings indicate that the psychophysical methodology may be useful for the decision to lower the weight of loads that may present extreme levels of risk of LBD; however, the psychophysical methodology does not seem to help in the decision to stop changing the weight at a safe load weight. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} wing with NACA 6409 section from WIG Catamaran vehicles with {{the influence of}} twin hull and ground effect was numerically studied. The simulation of WIG Catamaran was performed by Three Dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD). The k-? SST turbulent model was used for turbulent flow in CFD mode.

40|$|Minimizing {{the thermal}} cracks in mass {{concrete}} {{at an early}} age can be achieved by removing the hydration heat as quickly as possible within initial cooling period before the <b>next</b> <b>lift</b> is placed. Recognizing the time needed to remove hydration heat within initial cooling period helps to take an effective and efficient decision on temperature control plan in advance. Thermal properties of concrete, water cooling parameters and construction parameter are the most influencing factors involved in the process and the relationship between these parameters are non-linear in a pattern, complicated and not understood well. Some attempts had been made to understand and formulate the relationship taking account of thermal properties of concrete and cooling water parameters. Thus, in this study, an effort have been made to formulate the relationship for the same taking account of thermal properties of concrete, water cooling parameters and construction parameter, with the help of two soft computing techniques namely: Genetic programming (GP) software “Eureqa” and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Relationships were developed from the data available from recently constructed high concrete double curvature arch dam. The value of R for the relationship between the predicted and real cooling time from GP and ANN model is 0. 8822 and 0. 9146 respectively. Relative impact on target parameter due to input parameters was evaluated through sensitivity analysis and the results reveal that, construction parameter influence the target parameter significantly. Furthermore, during the testing phase of proposed models with an independent set of data, the absolute and relative errors were significantly low, which indicates the prediction power of the employed soft computing techniques deemed satisfactory as compared to the measured data...|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptive}} airfoil {{is a type}} of zero mass {{flux flow}} control device. An adaptive wing was constructed with a base profile of a NACA 4415 airfoil to house an array of unimorph piezoelectric actuators, wrapped with a layer of smooth rubber latex. This flow control method has been investigated across a range of steady and actuation frequencies of order f+ = O(1), angle of attack between α = 0 ◦ and α = 24 ◦, and at Re of 2. 5 · 104, 5. 0 · 104, 7. 5 · 104, and 1. 0 · 105. Several experimental and computational techniques have been used for investigation. First, a laser displacement sensor system is used to characterize the oscillation of the upper surface. There is a phase lag between the input signal and the surface response of 15 ◦ to 90 ◦ for the frequencies that are investigated. Then, flow field data is obtained using PIV. <b>Next,</b> <b>lift</b> and drag are measured using a force balance. Lastly, numerical simulation is performed. Phase-locked PIV reveals that a cross-stream vortex is formed by the upward motion of the surface, and the vortex advects downstream. Lift and drag curves together with smoke wire flow visualization suggest that for f+>. 1, the flow control effectiveness is at a maximum. It is evident that frequency is the key factor in the adaptive wing flow control mechanism.
