50|$|The (redesigned) CMOS version, 80C186, {{introduced}} DRAM refresh, a power-save mode, and {{a direct}} interface to the 8087 or 80187 floating point <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessor.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{expansion}} box, an 80287 <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessor</b> could be ordered as an option, and the memory could be expanded by 2 MB with another option to 3 MB. In North America, an internal modem was also available.|$|E
50|$|The MIPS {{architecture}} supports {{up to four}} coprocessors. In {{addition to}} the CPU core, the R3000 microprocessor includes a Control Processor (CP), which contains a Translation Lookaside Buffer and a Memory Management Unit. The CP works as a coprocessor. Besides the CP, the R3000 can also support an external R3010 <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessor</b> and two other external coprocessors.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{floating}} point types, including [...] (the 4-byte 754 representation) [...] (the 8-byte IEEE 754 representation), [...] (a 10-byte IEEE 754 representation used mostly internally by <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessors)</b> and [...] (a 6-byte representation).|$|R
50|$|To {{improve its}} {{commercial}} viability, TMC launched the CM-2 in 1987, adding Weitek 3132 floating point <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessors</b> and more RAM to the system. Thirty-two {{of the original}} one-bit processors shared each numeric processor. The CM-2 can be configured with up to 512 MB of RAM, and a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) hard disk system, called a DataVault, of up to 25 GB. Two later variants of the CM-2 were also produced, the smaller CM-2a with either 4096 or 8192 single-bit processors, and the faster CM-200.|$|R
50|$|The 486DLC can be {{described}} as a 386DX with the 486 instruction set and 1 KB of on-board L1 cache added. Because it used the 386DX bus (unlike its 16-bit cousin, the 486SLC) it was a fully 32-bit chip. Like the 386 and 486SX, it had no on-board math coprocessor, but unlike the 486SX, it could make use of an Intel 387DX or compatible <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessor.</b> A few 486SX motherboards also provided i387 sockets, but this feature was a very much a rarity. Due to the smaller L1 cache, the 486DLC could not compete on a clock-for-clock basis with the 486SX, but a 33 MHz 486DLC could keep pace with a 25 MHz 486SX, cost less, and offered the ability to upgrade further with the addition of an inexpensive math coprocessor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} introductive and {{user documentation}} [...] including extended summary, theoretical manual, short user manual and description of illustrative examples [...] for {{a version of}} decision analysis and support systems of DIDAS family that is designed for multicriteria analysis of nonlinear models on professional microcomputers. This version has been developed in the years 1986 - 1990 in the Institute of Automatic Control, Warsaw University of Technology, under a joint research program with the Systems and Decision Sciences Program of IIASA. It can be run on professional microcomputers compatible with IBM-PC-XT or AT (with Hercules Graphics Card, Color Graphics Adapter or Enhanced Graphics Adapter and, preferably, with a <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessor</b> and a hard disk) and supports graphical representation of results of interactive multicriteria analysis. Moreover, this version called IAC-DIDAS-N is provided with a new nonlinear model generator and editor that support, in an easy standard of a spreadsheet, the definition, edition and symbolic differentiation of nonlinear substantive models for multiobjective decision analysis. A specially introduced standard of defining nonlinear programming models for multiobjective optimization helps to connect the model generator with {{other parts of the}} system. Optimization runs involved in interactive, multiobjective decision analysis are performed by a solver, that is, a version of nonlinear programming algorithm specially adapted for multiobjective problems. This algorithm is based on shifted penalty functions and projected conjugate directions techniques similarly as in former nonlinear versions of DIDAS, but it was further developed and several improvements were added. The system is permanently updated and developed. Currently (starting from October 1990) the version 4. 0 of the system is released. Most of enhancements added in this version are not directly visible to the user. They influence the efficiency of the system...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{programming}} is a widely-used engineering and management tool. Scheduling, resource allocation, and production planning are all well-known applications of linear programs (LP's). Most LP's are {{too large to}} be solved by hand, so over the decades many computer codes for solving LP's have been developed. ALPS, A Linear Program Solver, is a full-featured LP analysis program. ALPS can solve plain linear {{programs as well as}} more complicated mixed integer and pure integer programs. ALPS also contains an efficient solution technique for pure binary (0 - 1 integer) programs. One of the many weaknesses of LP solvers is the lack of interaction with the user. ALPS is a menu-driven program with no special commands or keywords to learn. In addition, ALPS contains a full-screen editor to enter and maintain the LP formulation. These formulations can be written to and read from plain ASCII files for portability. For those less experienced in LP formulation, ALPS contains a problem "parser" which checks the formulation for errors. ALPS creates fully formatted, readable reports that can be sent to a printer or output file. ALPS is written entirely in IBM's APL 2 /PC product, Version 1. 01. The APL 2 workspace containing all the ALPS code can be run on any APL 2 /PC system (AT or 386). On a 32 -bit system, this configuration can take advantage of all extended memory. The user can also examine and modify the ALPS code. The APL 2 workspace has also been "packed" to be run on any DOS system (without APL 2) as a stand-alone "EXE" file, but has limited memory capacity on a 640 K system. A <b>numeric</b> <b>coprocessor</b> (80 X 87) is optional but recommended. The standard distribution medium for ALPS is a 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskette.
