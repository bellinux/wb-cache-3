5|$|The {{number of}} Persian troops present at Thermopylae is {{therefore}} as uncertain as the <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> total invasion force.

5|$|After {{moving to}} Wellington, Ellison joined the Poneke Football Club in 1885. The Poneke team played junior club rugby at the time, but were {{promoted}} to the senior competition after winning all their matches that year. Following their promotion the side won the Wellington club championship each year from 1886 to 1889. Ellison was selected {{to play for the}} Wellington provincial team in 1885, and continued to be selected for Wellington until 1892. He eventually earned 23 caps—a large <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time. Initially Ellison played as a forward or on the wing, but later played half-back.|$|E

5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|Another passive marking form is {{the word}} {{ambulance}} (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse {{on the front of}} the vehicle. This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching ambulance in their rear view mirrors. Ambulances may display the name of their owner or operator, and an emergency telephone <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ambulance service.|$|E
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E

Sixty-three countries submitted films to the Academy and sixty-one of those films were accepted for review by the Academy, a record <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time.

5|$|In 2008, Aristo wrote a film {{adaptation}} of Andrea Hirata's 2005 novel Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Troops) after being {{asked by the}} film's producer, Mira Lesmana. The film, directed by Riri Riza, was a critical and commercial success. He soon wrote another screenplay, for Garuda di Dadaku (Garuda on my Chest; 2009) upon request of producer Shanty Harmayn. The film, directed by Ifa Isfansyah, reportedly sold 1.2 million tickets, a large <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian film industry.|$|E
5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E

5|$|Manager, Neil Warnock {{revealed}} on 3 May that he {{was hoping}} that Kisnorbo may return from injury {{in time for the}} start of the 2012–13 pre-season. With Kisnorbo missing several pre-season games he wasn't allocated a <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2012–13 season, losing his number 3 squad number to Adam Drury. Kisnorbo returned to the Leeds squad on 4 August in the pre-season friendly against Preston North End. Kisnorbo was allocated the squad number 6 for the upcoming season and was named on the bench for the first game of the season against Shrewsbury Town on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|Meksi did {{not live}} to see the 1827 {{publication}} of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.|$|E
5|$|Soon after World War II, amateur radio, {{also called}} ham radio, made its {{appearance}} in Gibraltar.

50|$|Quick-Pick: Players {{can fill}} out a bubble sheet with <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game they want to play. Another option is called Quick-Pick, which allows the lottery {{terminal}} to select <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chosen game. In either case, players can opt for 52 consecutive draws (Advance Play) for Florida Lotto, 30 consecutive draws for Lucky Money or Fantasy 5, and 14 consecutive draws for Picks 2, 3, 4 or 5. When the Florida Lottery's number games were established, however, quick-picks were not available, nor were Advance Play tickets—all purchasers had to select their own <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next drawing only.|$|R
5|$|Stansfield {{continues}} to be remembered by fans of his former teams. On 9 August 2014, as Exeter started the new season against Portsmouth, a giant flag resembling his club shirt was displayed by the crowd. Hereford F.C., the phoenix club of Hereford United, gave a minute's applause to Stansfield in the 9th minute – his <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bulls – in the 2016 FA Vase Final. Exeter and Yeovil agreed that on their meeting at St James Park on 8 August 2015, {{there would be a}} minute's applause in the seventh minute and ninth, for the numbers he wore at each club. Earlier the same day, there was also a match between the two clubs' supporters in Topsham, Devon, to raise funds for his foundation.|$|E

5|$|The city of Providence is {{geographically}} very compact, {{characteristic of}} eastern seaboard cities that developed prior {{to use of}} the automobile.
