Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, {{he was forced to}} return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his elder brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

5|$|During their {{approach}} to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force passed through a large and intense rain squall which, along with a complex formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan's deployment put none {{of them in the}} forward part of the column, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> choose one for his flagship. Callaghan did not issue a battle plan to his ship commanders.|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E
5|$|In {{every other}} {{transaction}} of life no man's wits {{could be more}} regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> seem more likely to fall {{into a state of}} distraction than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record breaking of the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. <b>Nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E
5|$|Mikawa's {{run down}} the Slot was not {{detected}} by Allied forces. Turner had requested that U.S. Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., commander of Allied air forces for the South Pacific area, conduct extra reconnaissance missions over the Slot in the afternoon of August 8. But, for unexplained reasons, McCain did not order the missions, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> tell Turner {{that they were not}} carried out. Thus, Turner mistakenly believed that the Slot was under Allied observation throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|By April 1834 {{the opera}} had {{received}} over 100 performances in Paris. Nourrit sang {{the role of}} Robert until 1837, when he was replaced as premier tenor at the Opéra by Gilbert Duprez, whom, however, Meyerbeer did not like in the role; <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> approve of an alternative, Lafont. However, he {{was impressed by the}} newcomer Mario (Cavaliere Giovanni Matteo di Candia), and wrote for him a new aria for Robert which was performed at his debut in the revival of the opera on 30 November 1838. Mario's debut was the launch of his very successful career. Others singing in the 1838 revival included Julie Dorus-Gras (Alice), Prosper Dérivis (Bertram) and François Wartel (Raimbaut). By Meyerbeer's death in 1864 the opera had been performed over 470 times in Paris alone.|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E

5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E

5|$|On August 25, he {{was present}} at the liberation of Paris although, {{contrary}} to the Hemingway legend, he was not the first into the city, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> liberate the Ritz.

Later that year, he {{was present at}} heavy fighting in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. On December 17, 1944, a feverish and ill Hemingway had himself driven to Luxembourg to cover what was later called The Battle of the Bulge. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; by the time that he recovered a week later, most of the fighting in this battle was over.|$|E

5|$|The Argentine Fencing Committee {{had great}} {{difficulty}} in organizing {{a team to}} attend the 1924 Summer Olympics.

5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, <b>nor</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E
