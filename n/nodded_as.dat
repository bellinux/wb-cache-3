2500|$|In the WomensWallStreet articles, Jacobsen {{detailed}} the activity {{she took to}} be suspicious. She claimed that before boarding, the men did not interact or seem {{to be part of}} a group. [...] Further, she claimed that during boarding, each man made eye contact with each of the others and <b>nodded</b> <b>as</b> if in agreement. One man, who wore an orthopedic shoe, complained loudly, just before takeoff, that he needed to switch seats. Once in flight, one of the men took a large McDonald's bag to a lavatory, exiting with the bag nearly empty, and giving the thumbs up sign as he passed two other suspicious men. Some of the other men also took objects with them to the lavatory, such as a mass of cloth, a camera, and a cell phone. Throughout the flight, the men would get up in unison, walk to the lavatories, and congregate in the aisles in groups of two and three. One of the men, wearing a suit and sunglasses, stood a foot or so away from the cockpit door. When the captain announced clearance for landing, seven of the men stood in unison and went to the lavatory, each taking about four minutes. The last man to exit the lavatory supposedly dragged his forefinger across his neck as he passed one of the other men, mouthing the word [...] "No." ...|$|E
