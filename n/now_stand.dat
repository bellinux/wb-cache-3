5|$|The {{panorama}} on the Library punchbowl {{begins with}} a view of the eastern shore of Sydney Cove. In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves <b>now</b> <b>stand.</b> Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E

25|$|Overview Many {{urban water}} and {{wastewater}} utilities in China experience financial stress, because user fees are set well below cost recovery levels and government subsidies are insufficient to cover the resulting gap. In 2004, 60% of urban water utilities reported negative net incomes. The financial situation of wastewater utilities {{is expected to be}} even more precarious. Tariffs have increased by 50% since 1998 and <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> at 1.5 RMB/m3 or US$0.20/m3. These rates are insufficient to cover costs.|$|E
25|$|Active {{support by}} the museum for {{excavations}} in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including Asyut (1907), Mostagedda and Matmar (1920s), Ashmunein (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as Soba, Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> at over 110,000 objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{suburb of}} Georges Hall {{is named after}} the {{farmhouse}} {{of the same name}} on land grants Johnston received near the junction of the Georges River and Prospect Creek. This building still exists and is now one of Australia's oldest houses. Johnston and Esther Abrahams farmed and lived on Annandale with their children until the 1870s when it was sold and sub-divided for residential development.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery. Although the works as they <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> are credited to him, {{it is certain that}} their roots reach far back before his time (see Homeric Question). The Iliad is a narrative of a single episode spanning {{over the course of a}} ten-day-period from near the end of the ten years of the Trojan War. It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal.|$|E
25|$|Despite his successes, Hatton {{died with}} large debts, {{only a few}} years after his house at Holdenby was finally {{completed}}. Holdenby was completed in 1583 and Hatton claimed to refuse to sleep in the mansion until Queen Elizabeth I had stayed there. All that remains of the original Holdenby House are old drawings and plans, one room which was later incorporated into a new restoration in the 1870s, part of the pillared doorway and 2 arches with the date 1583 inscribed upon them, which <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> alone in the gardens. His other residence Kirby Hall began construction in 1570 which was based on designs of French architecture and expanded in Classical Style {{over the course of the}} decades.|$|E
25|$|Bishop's {{contributions}} to photography were also lasting. When he {{first arrived in}} China in 1915, {{he set out to}} record sites of interest in Peking, and succeeded in photographing most of them. His photographs of imperial sites <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> as almost unique parts of the documentary record. Bishop also used his spare time to photograph street life and social customs, architecture (especially historic buildings), and scenery. These photographs, which Bishop classified with his own system and annotated with extensive notes, were not put on display, but mounted in twelve notebooks, though the negatives were kept in storage at the Smithsonian. Some 4,000 of these images are included in the Carl Whiting Bishop Papers Brill Publishers microform edition.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps unusually for Scotland, {{part of the}} Green {{was given}} over to cricket. The present Club was {{constituted}} in 1895 and the current pitch, {{a gift from the}} Duke of Buccleuch used since the 1920s. About the same time the Curling Club was also formed. Using water from the Laret Burn, a pond was constructed just beyond the Green just about where the tennis courts <b>now</b> <b>stand.</b> Perhaps the winters really were more severe in days gone past because ice did form and games went ahead. Trees were planted at strategic points to prevent the sun's rays melting the ice. The pond was closed in 1964 and the club moved to Kelso indoor rink.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{additional}} mainline stations serving {{the city at}} one stage. One, St Enoch station, was sited at St Enoch Square not far from Central Station and parallel to the existing underground station of the same name, whilst the second, Buchanan Street station was located at {{the northern end of}} Buchanan Street, approximately just north of where the Royal Concert Hall currently stands near to Queen Street Station. These two stations were removed in the 1960s {{as a result of the}} Beeching Axe. The St Enoch Shopping Centre was built on the site of St Enoch Station in the 1980s and Buchanan House (formerly ScotRail House) and part of the Glasgow Caledonian University campus <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> on the site of Buchanan Street Station.|$|E
25|$|At that time, New College Lane {{was known}} as Hammer Hall Lane (named after a hall to the east, as New College had not then been founded), and its {{northern}} side was the old town wall. The corner of Hammer Hall Lane and Catte Street (which had a postern in the wall called Smithgate) was taken by Black Hall, which was the place of John Wycliffe's imprisonment by the Vice-Chancellor around 1378. On {{the other side of}} Hart Hall along the lane was Shield Hall. On Catte Street itself was the entrance to Arthur Hall, which lay down a narrow passage behind Hart Hall, and Cat Hall (Aula Murilegorum), which stood further south, roughly where the Principal's Lodgings <b>now</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E

25|$|At the 1921 Imperial Conference British Prime Minister Lloyd George said: In {{recognition}} of their service and achievements during the war, the British Dominions have now been accepted fully into the comity of {{the nations of the}} whole world. They are signatories to the Treaty of Versailles and all other treaties of peace. They are members of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and their representatives have already attended meetings of the League. In other words, they have achieved full national status and they <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and responsibilities of the British Commonwealth. If there are any means by which that status can be rendered even more clear to their own communities and to the world at large, we shall be glad to have them put forward.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{historical}} {{scholarship has}} shed {{new light on}} the topic of Second World War casualties. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet WW2 fatalities. According to Russian government figures, USSR losses within postwar borders <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> at 26.6 million. including 8.5 million due to war related famine and disease In August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated Poland's dead at between 5.6 and 5.8 million. Historian Rüdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) published a study in 2000 that estimated the German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe. The People's Republic of China puts its war dead at 20 million, while the Japanese government puts its casualties due to the war at 3.1 million.|$|E
25|$|One of her co-workers, Yutaka Uchikoshi, {{cares for}} Minami and visits her shanty when she misses work {{because her mother}} is sick. He later gives her a pair of sandals made by his mother and a handkerchief, but {{when he tries to}} kiss her, she has a {{flashback}} where she sees the victims of the bombing where they <b>now</b> <b>stand</b> and pushes him away. She runs off, still reliving the horrors of the attack, including finding her little sister's blackened body and watching her older sister die of radiation poisoning two months later. The next day at the office, she apologizes to Uchikoshi, saying she wants to somehow put the past behind her. She spends the day exhausted, however, and the next day becomes bedridden from the long-term effects of radiation poisoning. As Minami's condition worsens, she is visited by Uchikoshi and other co-workers, and dies just as her brother and aunt arrive.|$|E
