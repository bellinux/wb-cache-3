5000|$|Jazz {{from the}} 1930s onward, jazz fusion from the 1970s and onward and funk all use {{extended}} chords {{as a key}} part of their sound. In these genres, chords often include added <b>ninths,</b> elevenths and thirteenths and altered variants, such as flat <b>ninths,</b> sharp <b>ninths,</b> sharp elevenths and flat thirteenths. In jazz and jazz fusion, compositions consist of complex chord progressions in which many of the chords are extended chords and in which many of the dominant seventh chords are altered extended chords (e.g., A7add911 or D7911). Funk also uses altered extended chords, but in this genre, pieces are usually based on a vamp on a single chord, because rhythm and [...] "groove are the key elements of the style. When extended chords are voiced in jazz or jazz fusion, the root and fifth are often omitted from the chord voicing, because the root is played by the bass player.|$|R

5000|$|As 20 is {{divisible}} by two {{and five}} and is adjacent to 21, {{the product of}} three and seven, thus covering the first four prime numbers, many vigesimal fractions have simple representations, whether terminating or recurring (although thirds are more complicated than in decimal, repeating two digits instead of one). In decimal, dividing by three twice (<b>ninths)</b> only gives one digit periods ( [...] = 0.1111.... for instance) because 9 is the number below ten. 21, however, the number adjacent to 20 that is divisible by 3, is not divisible by 9. <b>Ninths</b> in vigesimal have six-digit periods. As 20 has the same prime factors as 10 (two and five), any fraction that terminates in decimal will terminate in vigesimal, and any fraction that does not terminate in decimal will not terminate in vigesimal either: the converses of these statements are also true.|$|R
