5|$|One {{of the few}} men to {{make the}} short list for the Attorney General selection, Washington lawyer Charles Ruff, was ruled out of {{consideration}} by the White House on February 6, because he had <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> Social Security taxes for years {{for a woman who}} cleaned his house.|$|E
5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's penal system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, {{with much of}} the blame placed on the comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders still were not separated from older ones, that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> for the work they did.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{had arisen}} before the Giro {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that many of 's sponsors in Kazakhstan had <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> their full obligations to the team, and that the riders had therefore not been paid their full salaries to that point in the season. In protest, the team wore new jerseys beginning with this stage, that had the names of those underpaying sponsors faded out {{to the point of being}} unreadable.|$|E

Idabdelhay left Wydad after <b>not</b> being <b>paid</b> for three months.|$|R

5|$|Farmer asked U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack for {{declarations}} of agricultural disasters {{in the wake}} of an ice storm in January 2009 that endangered the state's livestock and flooding that affected Kentucky Lake in 2010, damaging large portions of the state's corn, soybean, and wheat crops.

Mary decides to leave school to find her sister, who owns La Sagesse, a cosmetics company in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{administration}} {{skirted the}} Ineligibility Clause {{during its first}} year, when Nixon named Representative Donald Rumsfeld as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been increased to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress, Rumsfeld was <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as Assistant to the President at the same $42,500 salary, a position presumably {{outside the scope of}} the Clause.|$|E

5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators could {{not engage in}} banking or any form of public contract. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce, and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were <b>not</b> <b>paid,</b> individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue's {{fortunes}} {{improved in}} the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, {{in anticipation of}} their sale to the local Catholic diocese, as the congregation had <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> the mortgage in many years. The congregation succeeded in convincing the bank to re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led a drive to pay it off completely.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} because the Ritz has <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> any corporation tax since being {{taken over by}} the Barclay twins.

5|$|As {{an amateur}} rugby union player John was <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> to play rugby at club or {{international}} level. To receive money for playing {{would have been}} recognised {{as an act of}} professionalism and would have resulted in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given 'boot money' by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players' boots. In his 2011 book Addy, Meirion Appleton claimed that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. Appleton claims that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from sportswear manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged with taking illegal payments during his career.|$|E
5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E

5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS {{bought the}} West Stand, {{including}} the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK12.5 million, {{on the condition}} that if it was <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's ownership in the stadium. This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS {{and at the same time}} terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{beginning}} of the Giro d'Italia, it was reported that many of the team's sponsors in Kazakhstan had <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> their full obligations to the team, and that most of the riders had been underpaid to that point in the season as a result. One sponsor, the Kazkhstani state carrier Air Astana, dropped its sponsorship entirely. There was concern that the team itself may fold, as UCI ProTour teams must meet certain financial parameters to stay active, or risk losing their UCI license.|$|E

5|$|The Undertaker {{had been}} feuding with DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation since {{his return to}} the WWF from an injury in August 1994. During the match between The Undertaker and Yokozuna at Survivor Series 1994, Irwin R. Schyster, one of DiBiase's wrestlers, {{interfered}} in the match by attacking The Undertaker. The feud between The Undertaker and Schyster escalated when Schyster performed a series of vignettes in which he repossessed such items as tombstones and burial plots from people he claimed had <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> their taxes before dying. During the feud, Schyster was escorted to the ring for his matches by a group of hooded druids.|$|E
5|$|The {{contents}} of a storage unit are put up for auction if the rental fees are <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> for sixty days. Although the TV show Storage Wars created increased interest in the auctions, most units do not contain anything of substantial economic value. Sometimes auctioning the renter's property can result in disputes between Public Storage and the renter. In 2007, a customer's belongings were auctioned for non-payment while he was serving the US military in Iraq. After receiving negative publicity, Public Storage apologized and gave him $8,000 as compensation for his sold belongings.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had <b>not</b> <b>paid</b> taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.|$|E
