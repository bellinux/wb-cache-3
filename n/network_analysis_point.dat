30|$|The first overall {{observation}} {{from the}} obtained motifs is that board interlocks and ownership links truly {{go hand in}} hand. The majority of the multiplex motifs show how well-connected firms in terms of interlocking directorates are also more involved in ownership links. This may happen in two ways: well-connected firms attract more investments, and together these firms invest more in other firms. Although we {{are not able to}} assess causality given {{that we do not have}} timestamps on the links, the observation in itself is interesting from a <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>point</b> of view. It is particularly interesting because the only thing fixed in the null model are the node degrees of each link type; yet at the interfirm level the co-occurrence is once again significantly present, demonstrating a higher order pattern of interlayer dependency. In a corporate network, this explicitly signals the concentration of ownership through multiple types of connections.|$|E
40|$|Information spread plays {{crucial role}} in risk {{management}} in case of environmental danger. The structure of local society may be well described by social network analysis. We have investigated the role of hubs within that concept. In case of danger, {{there are two different}} strategies of information management: 1) information spread that leads to awareness of the whole society 2) keeping the whole information in secret under control that leads to a partial social awareness, available to a small number of people only. In our model, the probability of information spread between two nodes is inverse proportional to connectivity of the next node because people who have a lot of connections are more immune. We have applied agent-based modelling on Barabasi Albert networks to explore various scenarios of information spread. We have considered recent arsenic environmental danger in Głogów and Legnica (Copper Basin) according to the official available data (2015 - 2016) from social <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>point</b> of view. We have considered various levels of environmental danger. Despite blocking of information by hubs, the successful information spread is possible when levels of danger are high enough.

40|$|We {{analysed}} the supportive {{social networks}} {{associated with the}} conservation of six threatened Australian bird taxa, {{in one of the}} first network analyses of threatened species conservation programmes. Each example showed contrasting vulnerabilities. The Alligator Rivers yellow chat Epthianura crocea tunneyi had the smallest social network and no real action was supported. For the Capricorn yellow chat Epthianura crocea macgregori the network was centred on one knowledgeable and committed actor. The orange-bellied parrot Neophema chrysogaster had a strongly connected recovery team but gaps in the overall network could limit communication. The recovery teams for the swift parrot Lathamus discolor and Baudin 2 ̆ 7 s black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus baudinii had strong links among most stakeholders but had weak ties to the timber industry and orchardists, respectively, limiting their capacity to manage threatening processes. Carnaby 2 ̆ 7 s black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus latirostris seemed to have the most effective social network of any of the taxa studied but may be vulnerable to skill shortages. In each case the <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>pointed</b> to gaps that could be filled to enhance the conservation effort, and highlighted the importance of recovery teams. The research suggests that formal <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> could assist in the design of more effective support mechanisms for the conservation of threatened species...|$|R

40|$|Methane seep systems along {{continental}} margins host {{diverse and}} dynamic microbial assemblages, sustained {{in large part}} through the microbially mediated process of sulfate-coupled Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM). This methanotrophic metabolism {{has been linked to}} consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). These two groups are the focus of numerous studies; however, less is known about the wide diversity of other seep associated microorganisms. We selected a hierarchical set of FISH probes targeting a range of Deltaproteobacteria diversity. Using the Magneto-FISH enrichment technique, we then magnetically captured CARD-FISH hybridized cells and their physically associated microorganisms from a methane seep sediment incubation. DNA from nested Magneto-FISH experiments was analyzed using Illumina tag 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (iTag). Enrichment success and potential bias with iTag was evaluated in the context of full-length 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries, CARD-FISH, functional gene clone libraries, and iTag mock communities. We determined commonly used Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) iTAG primers introduced bias in some common methane seep microbial taxa that reduced the ability to directly compare OTU relative abundances within a sample, but comparison of relative abundances between samples (in nearly all cases) and whole community-based analyses were robust. The iTag dataset was subjected to statistical co-occurrence measures of the most abundant OTUs to determine which taxa in this dataset were most correlated across all samples. Many non-canonical microbial partnerships were statistically significant in our co-occurrence <b>network</b> <b>analysis,</b> most of which were not recovered with conventional clone library sequencing, demonstrating the utility of combining Magneto-FISH and iTag sequencing methods for hypothesis generation of associations within complex microbial communities. <b>Network</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>pointed</b> to many co-occurrences containing putatively heterotrophic, candidate phyla such as OD 1, Atribacteria, MBG-B, and Hyd 24 - 12 and the potential for complex sulfur cycling involving Epsilon-, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria in methane seep ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The {{horse is}} an optimal model {{organism}} {{for studying the}} genomic response to exercise-induced stress, due to its natural aptitude for athletic performance and the relative homogeneity of its genetic and environmental backgrounds. Here, we applied RNA-sequencing analysis {{through the use of}} SOLiD technology in an experimental framework centered on exercise- induced stress during endurance races in equine athletes. We monitored the transcriptional landscape by comparing gene expression levels between animals at rest and after competition. Overall, we observed a shift from coding to non-coding regions, suggesting that the stress response involves the differential expression of not annotated regions. Notably, we observed significant post-race increases of reads that correspond to repeats, especially the intergenic and intronic L 1 and L 2 transposable elements. We also observed increased expression of the antisense strands compared to the sense strands in intronic and regulatory regions (1 kb up- and downstream) of the genes, suggesting that antisense transcription {{could be one of the}} main mechanisms for transposon regulation in the horse under stress conditions. We identified a large number of transcripts corresponding to intergenic and intronic regions putatively associated with new transcriptional elements. Gene expression and pathway analysis allowed us to identify several biological processes and molecular functions that may be involved with exercise-induced stress. Ontology clustering reflected mechanisms that are already known to be stress activated (e. g., chemokine-type cytokines, Toll-like receptors, and kinases), as well as ‘‘nucleic acid binding’’ and ‘‘signal transduction activity’’ functions. There was also a general and transient decrease in the global rates of protein synthesis, which would be expected after strenuous global stress. In sum, our <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>points</b> toward the involvement of specific gene clusters in equine exercise-induced stress, including those involved in inflammation, cell signaling, and immune interactions...|$|R

40|$|Regime {{complexes}} are {{arrays of}} institutions with partially overlapping mandates and memberships. As tensions frequently arise among these institutions, {{there is a}} growing interest geared to finding strategies to reduce them. Insights from regime theory, science and technology studies, and social <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> support the claim that "boundary organizations"—a type of organization until now overlooked in International Relations—can reduce tensions within regime complexes by generating credible, legitimate, and salient knowledge, provided that their internal networks balance multiple knowledge dimensions. Building on this argument, this article offers an ex ante assessment of the recently created International Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Results from our <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> of IPBES <b>point</b> to clear improvements compared with similar organizations, although major deficiencies remain. The contribution of this article is threefold. Methodologically, it introduces new conceptual and technical tools to assess the '"social representativeness" of international organizations. Theoretically, it supports the claim that international organizations are penetrated by transnational networks and, consequently, that the proliferation of institutions tends to reproduce structural imbalances. Normatively, it argues that a revision of nomination processes could improve the ability of boundary organizations to generate salient, credible, and legitimate knowledge. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The United States Forest Service is {{required}} to analyze road systems {{on each of the}} national forests for potential environmental impacts. We have developed a novel and inexpensive way to do this using the Ecosystem Management Decision Support program (EMDS). We used EMDS to integrate a user-developed fuzzy logic knowledge base with a grid-based geographic information system to evaluate the degree of truth for assertions about a road’s environmental impact. Using spatial data for natural and human processes in the Tahoc National Forest (TNF, California, USA), we evaluated the assertion "the road has a high potential for impacting the environment. " We found a high level of agreement between the products of this evaluation and ground observations of a TNF transportation engineer, as well as occurrences of road failures. We used the modeled potential environmental impact to negatively weight roads for a least-cost path <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> to 1573 <b>points</b> of interest in the forest. The <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that out of 8233 km of road analyzed in the forest, 3483 km (42 %) must be kept in a modified road network to ensure access to these points. We found that the modified network had improved patch characteristics, such as significantly fewer "cherry stem" roads intruding into patches, an improved area-weighted mean shape index, and larger mean patch sizes, as compared to the original <b>network.</b> This <b>analysis</b> system could be used by any public agency to analyze infrastructure for environmental or other risk and included in other mandated analyses such as risks to watersheds...|$|R

The aim of the South West Mental Health Mapping project was to identify the level, accessibility and effectiveness {{of mental health services}} for high prevalence psychological disorders amongst the adult population in the South West region of Victoria. This study includes data from a number of sources: regional records of the number and location of health professionals; a telephone survey of 1297 people in five Local Government Areas in the region; and a social <b>network</b> <b>analysis</b> of contact <b>points.</b> Additional qualitative interviews and surveys were conducted with 25 service recipients and 37 health professionals to identify issues from different perspective.

The social network map shows the centrality of the General Practitioner and the wide range of agencies that become involved in supporting people with mental health issues. The discussion identifies primary contact points for people seeking help and places of referral. The main barrier acknowledged by people requiring assistance was lack of knowledge about where to go for help. Enablers included Medicare Better Access funded schemes. The findings show that there is a reasonable range of mental health professionals across the region, although there are challenges with recruitment and retention of staff.
