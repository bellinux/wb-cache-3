25|$|A <b>neutral</b> <b>mutation</b> has no harmful or {{beneficial}} {{effect on the}} organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming {{the basis for the}} molecular clock. In the neutral theory of molecular evolution, neutral mutations provide genetic drift as the basis for most variation at the molecular level.|$|E
25|$|A <b>neutral</b> <b>{{mutation}}</b> is a mutation {{that occurs}} in an amino acid codon that results {{in the use of}} a different, but chemically similar, amino acid. The similarity between the two is enough that little or no change is often rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode arginine, a chemically similar molecule to the intended lysine.|$|E
50|$|Tomoko Ohta {{emphasized}} the importance of nearly <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations,</b> in particularly slightly deleterious mutations. The population dynamics of nearly <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> is essentially {{the same as that of}} <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> unless the absolute magnitude of the selection coefficient is greater than 1/N, where N is the effective population size with respect to selection. The value of N may therefore affect how many mutations can be treated as neutral and how many as deleterious.|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} clock of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations,</b> which represents linear mutation fixation over generations, is theoretically explained by genetic drift in fitness-steady evolution or hitchhiking in adaptive evolution. The {{present study is}} the first experimental demonstration for the {{molecular clock}} of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> in a fitness-increasing evolutionary process. The dynamics of genome mutation fixation in the thermal adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli were evaluated in a prolonged evolution experiment in duplicated lineages. The cells from the continuously fitness-increasing evolutionary process were subjected to genome sequencing and analyzed at both the population and single-colony levels. Although the dynamics of genome mutation fixation were complicated by {{the combination of the}} stochastic appearance of adaptive mutations and clonal interference, the mutation fixation in the population was simply linear over generations. Each genome in the population accumulated 1. 6 synonymous and 3. 1 non-synonymous <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations,</b> on average, by the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate, while only a single genome in the population occasionally acquired an adaptive <b>mutation.</b> The <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> that preexisted on the single genome hitchhiked on the domination of the adaptive mutation. The successive fixation processes of the 128 mutations demonstrated that hitchhiking and not genetic drift were responsible for the coincidence of the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate in the genome with the fixation rate of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> in the population. The molecular clock of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> to the fitness-increasing evolution suggests that the numerous <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> observed in molecular phylogenetic trees may not always have been fixed in fitness-steady evolution but in adaptive evolution...|$|R

25|$|Further {{confusion}} {{arose in}} 1980–1981, {{when there was}} a long debate in the pages of Nature about the scientific status of the theory of evolution. Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the unit of selection in the genome, with one side positing natural selection, and the other, <b>neutral</b> <b>mutation.</b> Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as Phillip E. Johnson took {{this as an opportunity to}} declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.|$|E

5000|$|The {{observation}} of a clock-like rate of molecular change was originally purely phenomenological. Later, {{the work of}} Motoo Kimura developed the neutral theory of molecular evolution, which predicted a molecular clock. Let there be N individuals, and to keep this calculation simple, let the individuals be haploid (i.e. have one copy of each gene). Let the rate of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> (i.e. mutations with no effect on fitness) in a new individual be [...] The probability that this new mutation will become fixed in the population is then 1/N, since each copy of the gene {{is as good as}} any other. Every generation, each individual can have new mutations, so there are N new <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> in the population as a whole. That means that each generation, [...] new <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> will become fixed. If most changes seen during molecular evolution are neutral, then fixations in a population will accumulate at a clock-rate that is equal to the rate of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> in an individual.|$|R
40|$|Neutralism and selectionism are {{extremes}} of an explanatory spectrum for understanding patterns of molecular evolution {{and the emergence}} of evolutionary innovation. Although recent genome-scale data from protein-coding genes argue against neutralism, molecular engineering and protein evolution data argue that <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> and mutational robustness are important for evolutionary innovation. Here I propose a reconciliation in which <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> prepare the ground for later evolutionary adaptation. Key to this perspective is an explicit understanding of molecular phenotypes that has only become accessible in recent years...|$|R
50|$|Neutral drift is {{the idea}} that a <b>neutral</b> <b>mutation</b> can spread {{throughout}} a population, so that eventually the original allele is lost. A <b>neutral</b> <b>mutation</b> does not bring any fitness advantage or disadvantage to its bearer. The simple case of the Moran process can describe this phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} neutral {{evolution of}} proteins imposing conservation of the thermodynamic {{stability of the}} native state {{in the framework of}} an effective model of folding thermodynamics. This procedure generates evolutionary trajectories in sequence space which share two universal features for all of the examined proteins. First, the number of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> fluctuates broadly from one sequence to another, leading to a non- Poissonian substitution process. Second, the number of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> displays strong correlations along the trajectory, thus causing the breakdown of self-averaging of the resulting evolutionary substitution process...|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{evolution}} is not homogenous across the genome. This can be assayed using Ka/Ks ratio studies (also known as dN/dS). The ratio {{is used to}} estimate the balance between <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations,</b> purifying mutations and beneficial mutations.|$|R
50|$|While some scientists, such as Freese (1962) and Freese and Yoshida (1965), had {{suggested}} that <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> were probably widespread, a coherent theory of neutral evolution was proposed by Motoo Kimura in 1968, and by King and Jukes independently in 1969.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effects of single node {{mutations}} on trees evolved via genetic programming. The results show that <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> are less likely for nodes nearer the root and that as evolution proceeds <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> of nodes near the root are progressively less likely. Studies of crossover in tree based GP have shown that when smaller and/or deeper branches are selected for crossover the resulting change in fitness is smaller and the probability of fitness neutral crossover is larger [3, 1, 4, 2]. In this paper we continue this research for mutations by studying the relationship between the depth of single node mutations and the probability of fitness <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations.</b> Our GP is steady-state, population size 100, 0. 7 crossover rate, 90 / 10 crossover, 4 member tournament selection. Results are the average of 100 trials. The initial population is generated with full tree with depth of 4. The test prob-lem is symbolic regression; the target function is f(x) = x 3 + 2 x 2 − 5 x+ 3 in the range [0, 2 π] or [−π, π]. Fitness is the square root of the sum of the squared er...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} neutral {{evolutionary}} networks being {{a significant factor}} in evolutionary dynamics was first proposed by Huynen et al. about 7 years ago. In one sense, the principle is easy to state — because most mutations to an organism are deleterious, one would expect that <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> that don’t affect the phenotype will have disproportionately greater representation amongst successor organisms than one would expect if each mutation was equally likely. So it was with great surprise that I noted <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> being very rare in a visualisation of phylogenetic trees generated in Tierra, since I already knew that there was a significant amount of neutrality in the Tierra genotype-phenotype map. It turns out that competition for resources between host and parasite inhibits neutral evolution...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a convenient method for distinguishing functional from nonfunctional or deleterious mutations in homologous genes. High fidelity in vitro gene recombination ("DNA shuffling") coupled with sequence {{analysis of a}} small sampling of the shuffled library exhibiting the evolved behavior allows identification of those mutations responsible for the behavior in a background of <b>neutral</b> and deleterious <b>mutations.</b> Functional mutations are expected to occur in 100 % of the sequenced screened sample; <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> are found in 50 % on average, and deleterious mutations do not appear at all. When used to analyze 10 mutations in a laboratory-evolved gene encoding a thermostable subtilisin E, this method rapidly identified the two responsible for the observed protease thermostability; the remaining eight were neutral with respect to thermostability, within the precision of the screening assay. A similar approach, coupled with selection for growth and survival of the host organism, {{could be used to}} distinguish adaptive from <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>mutation</b> {{has become}} a part of the neutral theory of {{molecular}} evolution, proposed in the 1960s. This theory suggests that neutral mutations are responsible for a large portion of DNA sequence changes in a species. For example, bovine and human insulin, while differing in amino acid sequence are still able to perform the same function. The amino acid substitutions between species were seen therefore to be neutral or not impactful to the function of the protein. <b>Neutral</b> <b>mutation</b> and the neutral theory of molecular evolution are not separate from natural selection but add to Darwin's original thoughts. Mutations can give an advantage, create a disadvantage, or make no measurable difference to an organism's survival.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>neutral</b> <b>mutation</b> has no harmful or {{beneficial}} {{effect on the}} organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming {{the basis for the}} molecular clock. In the neutral theory of molecular evolution, neutral mutations provide genetic drift as the basis for most variation at the molecular level.|$|E
50|$|For many {{molecular}} biology approaches, {{as opposed to}} mathematical genetics, <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> are generally assumed to be those mutations which cause no appreciable effect on gene function. This simplification eliminates the effect of minor allelic differences in fitness and avoids problems when selection has only a minor effect.|$|R
40|$|We review recent {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the mutation-selection balance of asexual replicators. For over 30 years, population geneticists thought that an expression derived by Kimura and Maruyama in 1966 fully solved this problem. However, Kimura and Maruyama’s result is only correct in the absence of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations.</b> The inclusion of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> leads to a wealth of interesting new effects, and, in particular, to a selective pressure to evolve robustness against mutations. We cover recent literature on the population dynamics of asexual replicators on networks of neutral genotypes, on the outcompetition of fast replicators by slower ones with better mutational support, and on the probability of fixation at high mutation rates. We discuss empirical evidence for the evolution of mutational robustness, and speculate on its relevance for higher organisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution {{states that the}} accumulation of <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> in the genome is fundamental for evolution to occur. The genetic representation of gene expression programming, an artificial genotype/phenotype system, not only allows the existence of non-coding regions in the genome where <b>neutral</b> <b>mutations</b> can accumulate but also allows the controlled manipulation of both the number {{and the extent of}} these non-coding regions. Therefore, gene expression programming is an ideal artificial system where the neutral theory of evolution can be tested in order to gain some insights into the workings of artificial evolutionary systems. The results presented in this work show beyond any doubt that the existence of neutral regions in the genome is fundamental for evolution to occur efficiently.
