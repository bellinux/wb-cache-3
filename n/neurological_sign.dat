40|$|Both <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> and {{attention}} impairments are {{often found in}} schizophrenia. This study addresses {{the extent to which}} <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> are related to sustained attention impairment. We assessed subgroups of <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> using the standardised Cambridge Neurological Inventory (CNI). Sustained attention was measured using a monotone counting paradigm. After taking into consideration potential confounds such as age, education level and duration of illness, we explored the correlation between sustained attention and groups of <b>neurological</b> <b>signs,</b> as well as with individual signs. We found that "motor coordination" and "disinhibition" signs were significantly related to sustained attention. The correlation with "sensory integration" just failed to reach significance after correction for multiple comparison. "Dyskinesia", "catatonia", "pyramidal" and "extrapyramidal" subgroups were unrelated to sustained attention. The results support the notion of heterogeneity and diversity in <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> (even among soft <b>neurological</b> <b>signs)</b> and argue against the use of a single global measure to embrace all soft <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> in schizophrenia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Although {{increased}} {{prevalence of}} <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> in schizophrenia {{may reflect the}} presence of subtle brain dysfunctions, {{it is not clear}} whether there is progressive deterioration in such neurological function as the illness advances. This study compared <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> in patients with different durations of illness, controlling for age and education level. No deterioration in <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> as a function of illness duration was observed. Although there was an increase in <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> with age, there was a parallel increase in a control group. In addition, no change in the profile of subgroups of <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> was detected. These data provide further evidence for the stability of neurological dysfunction in schizophrenia.

5000|$|Ataxia is a <b>neurological</b> <b>sign</b> {{consisting}} {{of lack of}} voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality. Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of {{the parts of the}} nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum. Ataxia can be limited {{to one side of the}} body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom. The word is from Greek α- negative prefix + -τάξις order = [...] "lack of order".|$|E
5000|$|The {{first episode}} after DeAngelis's death, {{the crew of}} the SGU shared {{memories}} of their friend and colleague. Steven Novella felt that if people had the facts of DeAngelis's death it would help the grieving process. Novella stated that [...] "Perry always told me that I could basically tell everybody anything that they wanted to know about his medical condition." [...] He also had access to his medical records. DeAngelis did have type 2 diabetes, and he was diagnosed with scleroderma in 1997. In the end he was having problems with his fingers as they would curl, also shortness of breath and trouble with any exertion. He had had many heart attacks {{over the last few years}} and was hospitalized many times. Novella and his family had gone in to visit him; he had just finished dinner and his mother was with him. Novella left his wife and kids in the hallway to see if he was okay for visitors. DeAngelis had just finished dinner and was having trouble breathing. [...] "And then Perryhis eyes looked up to the left which I recognize as a <b>neurological</b> <b>sign</b> and then the heart monitor went flat and the team converged".

40|$|Aim To {{study the}} {{correlations}} between <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> and developmental performance, and to analyze the value of <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> in identification of developmental disabilities. Methods A group of 26 preterm infants (gestational age from 23 weeks to 36 weeks) was studied. The neurological assessment described by Amiel-Tison and Gosselin was performed at term age and repeated every 3 months up {{to the age of}} 2, when the sum of all adverse findings was categorized. According to the nature and associations of <b>neurological</b> and cranial <b>signs,</b> patients were divided into 5 categories: 1) cerebral palsy; 2) minimal cerebral palsy; 3) Amiel-Tison triad; 4) intermediate; and 5) normal. Developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, second edition, was performed between the age of 2 and 3, and the Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Index was determined. Results The developmental performance was highest in the group of children without <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> and lowest in the group with cerebral palsy. There was a strong correlation between <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> and mental developmental performance (Spearman ρ = 0. 71), while the correlation between <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> and psychomotor developmental performance was weaker (Spearman ρ = 0. 54). Conclusion Categorization of neurological assessment and identification of 3 minor <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> may be a valuable tool for early detection of children with developmental disabilities...|$|R

40|$|Various {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed for the pathogenesis of the <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> associated with bovine enteric coccidiosis. We undertook a prospective study of cases of bovine enteric coccidiosis with and without nervous signs to test the validity of these hypotheses and explore other possible pathophysiological mechanisms. Clinical, pathological and toxicological data from 12 calves with, and 15 calves without, <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> were compared. Calves with <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> had a lower liver Cu concentration (p less than 0. 01) and a higher plasma glucose concentration (p less than 0. 05) than did calves without <b>neurological</b> <b>signs.</b> Hyperglycemia and Cu deficiency may increase the susceptibility to central nervous system damage, but {{are not likely to}} account for the onset of <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> in calves with enteric coccidiosis. The results of the study suggest that the following are not involved in the pathogenesis of "nervous coccidiosis": disturbance of serum Na, K, Ca, P, or Mg concentration, vitamin A deficiency, thiamine deficiency, anemia, lead intoxication, uremia, Haemophilus somnus meningoencephalitis, severity of coccidial infection, gross alterations in intestinal bacterial flora and hepatopathy...|$|R

40|$|The {{outcome and}} final diagnoses of {{patients}} with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of polyneuropathy, but with normal electrophysiological studies, were investigated. All patients who presented at the outpatient clinic between 1993 and 1998 with signs and symptoms suggestive of polyneuropathy, but in whom electrophysiological studies were normal, were included. We retrospectively collected data from the medical records and then interviewed the patients and used the Sickness Impact Profile scale to investigate functional status at least 2 years after presentation. We included 74 patients, of whom 39 had <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> at <b>neurological</b> examination at the first visit. A final diagnosis was made in 24 of the 39 patients with <b>neurological</b> <b>signs,</b> and {{in three of the}} 35 patients without <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> but with symptoms. One (3 %) of the 35 patients without <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> at the first visit had a poor outcome versus 15 (39 %) of the 39 patients with <b>neurological</b> <b>signs.</b> In 11 (41 %) of the 27 patients in the group with a final diagnosis the outcome was poor versus 5 (11 %) of 47 patients without a final diagnosis. In 11 patients we concluded that they probably had small fibre neuropathy. Patients presenting with symptoms of polyneuropathy but who have neither <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> of polyneuropathy nor electrophysiological studies confirming a polyneuropathy have a good outcome at least 2 years after presentation.

40|$|Background and Purpose: A mean {{percentage}} of 5 % was reported for neurological involvement in researches related to Behcets disease. The neurological involvement may {{be characterized by}} headache, neuropsychiatric symptoms, brain stem involvement, cerebral venous thrombosis or peripheral nervous system involvement. Sometimes neurological involvement may be seen without any <b>neurological</b> <b>sign</b> or symptom. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the cognitive, psychiatric and neurophysiological responses in Behcets disease without <b>neurological</b> <b>sign</b> and symptom. Methods: The study was performed on patients with Behcets disease without neurological signs and symptoms and healthy volunteers {{that would make the}} control group. The patients were assessed with Mini Mental State Examination, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, nerve conduction study and visually evoked potential. Results: A total of 27 male patients (age: 24. 88 +/- 5. 45 years) were enrolled in the study. Neurological examinations of all the patients were normal. Mean Mini Mental State Examination score of the patients was 29. 62 +/- 0. 79 (2 patients had loss of focus, 2 patients had disturbance in the copying function) and 2 patients had mild depression in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. In the nerve conduction study, 2 patients had right sensory-motor carpal tunnel syndrome, 1 patient had right sensory-motor carpal tunnel syndrome - bilateral ulnar nerve entrapment. In the visually evoked potential examination, 8 patients had prolonged P 100 latency, decreased amplitude and disturbance of wave morphology. Conclusion: Visually evoked potential examination may be used as a conductive method to detect the subclinical neurological pathologies in Behcets disease. The possible silent neurological involvement should be evaluated with further neuro-screening methods. [Dis Mol Med 2015; 3 (3. 000) : 29 - 34...|$|E

40|$|Mouse {{inoculation}} {{was used}} to test for the presence of a toxin in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and intestinal contents collected from cases of bovine enteric coccidiosis, with and without <b>neurological</b> <b>signs,</b> and from control calves. Intravenous inoculation of mice with 10 mL/kg of serum from calves showing nervous signs caused effects significantly different from those caused by the inoculation of serum from calves not showing nervous signs and from control calves. The effect was particularly evident in female mice. At this dosage severe <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> such as loss of righting reflex, seizures and death occurred only with serum from calves with "nervous coccidiosis". The results suggest that serum from the calves with <b>neurological</b> <b>signs</b> contains a neurotoxin. This toxin appears to be highly labile.

About 2 hours later the patient developed ipsilateral asterixis in the upper left limb; 3 days later the asterixis disappeared. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain disclosed cerebellar infarctions at the left superior cerebellar artery.
