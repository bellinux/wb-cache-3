In {{order to}} solve the problem that the big loss of no-load and the fast rise of {{temperature}} when employ the conventional silicon steel metal transformer (SSMT) in the electric heating system, we choose the amorphous metal transformer (AMMT). In this paper, firstly, we give a brief introduction of the amorphous alloy material properties and compare the <b>no-load</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the AMMT with the SSMT. Secondly, the structure of intermediate frequency heating system working principle and control strategy are introduced. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted to validate the ideas. The experiments show that the AMMT not only improve the efficiency of transformer, solve the heating problem of transformer, but also improve the stability, security and other technical performance of the system, so it is worth recommending and promoting. HOEHS (Heavy Oil Electric Heating System) is widely used in the mining process of crude oil, and the transformer is indispensable important component in this system. The transformer works in the context of 300 ~ 2000 Hz, its function is voltage converting, power transmission and electrical isolation.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the operation characteristics of a Synchronous Generator (SG) using static experimental tests (current and voltage decay tests). Using these tests the magnetization characteristic, the machine parameters (synchronous magnetization inductances and differential magnetization inductances), the <b>no-load</b> <b>characteristic</b> and the external characteristic were determined. The magnetization characteristic, the parameters and the operational characteristics provide important information about the performance of synchronous generator, machine which is currently used in most power plants. Compared to classical experimental methods with moving rotor and numerical methods of field computation that require the knowledge of geometric dimensions and material properties, static experimental methods are distinguished by several advantages: simple implementation for any type of SG, quick results, low power consumption and no effect on the drive system where the machine is integrated. The mathematical model of SG uses dedicated Matlab-Simulink programs and the results obtained by static methods are compared with those obtained by classical methods. Also to better approach the phenomenon of magnetic saturation and a more accurate estimate of the parameters, the magnetization characteristic, synchronous magnetization inductances and differential magnetization inductances are determined versus the total magnetizing current...|$|E
40|$|High Power Laboratory in Ludvika has {{facilities}} for short-circuit testing of high voltage equipment like circuit breakers, disconnectors, surge arresters, transformers, switchgear cubicles, etc.; simulating the test conditions as in real power transmission network. In {{order to provide}} such an extremely high short-circuit current up to 100 kA, two specially designed turbo-generators are being used with a total capacity of 4000 MVA. Each of generators during the short-circuit test is excited by a separate driven exciter to provide the excitation current. Flying excitation method {{which is used to}} provide the right value of test current and voltage is described more in detail in Chapter 2. The excitation system has to be properly set in order to satisfy requirements of short-circuit testing. Therefore correct value of excitation time and an exciter voltage has to be chosen in advance to fulfil the criteria of short-circuit testing. The <b>no-load</b> <b>characteristics</b> of generators have been measured and an analysis of obtained data was made to get the needed excitation time characteristics. The study of collected data from previous single-phase short-circuit tests showed that it is best to use the same excitation times for the operating sequences open (O), open-close-open (O-CO) and close-open (CO) in order to provide the correct short-circuit current at interruption for a given connection of generator winding, and frequency. For operating sequence close (C) is also recommended to use the same excitation time determined in the study for whole range of short-circuit current at the generator side within the same generator winding connection, frequency and use of the generators. The final program for calculation of excitation parameters has been developed to visualise the particular excitation time characteristics obtained from the no-load measurements as well as easily and accurately determine the right values of parameters for excitation of the generator, such as exciter voltage and generator output rms voltage, for a certain short-circuit test. Recommended excitation times can be also easily found in the program by various combinations of the input parameters like generator, frequency, winding connection and operating sequence...|$|R

40|$|V članku smo najprej predstavili osnovne lastnosti, zgradbo in delovanje sinhronskega reluktančnega motorja, nato pa v okviru dvoosne teorije zapisali vezni model obravnavanega električnega stroja. Reluktančni navor omogoča vrtenje rotorja v sinhronizmu z glavnim vrtilnim poljem. Pri takšnem načinu delovanja (sinhronsko vrtenje) je v rotorju gostota magnetnega pretoka vedno enosmerna, kar narekuje brezizguben rotor. Vendar imamo zaradi statorskih utorov spremembo magnetne upornosti zračne reže, kar pri vrtenju povzroči utorske pulzacije magnetnega polja in s tem površinske izgube na rotorju. Na podlagi temeljnih elektromagnetnih zakonitosti smo izpeljali enačbo in z njo ovrednotili površinske izgube na rotorju motorja. Z obremenilnim preizkusom in preskusom prostega teka smo analizirali obratovalne karakteristike in izgube motorja. Kot posledico izgub smo nastalo temperaturno polje v motorju in na njem prikazali v obliki temperaturne slike. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present power losses in {{synchronous}} reluctance motors (SRM). Generally speaking, this type of motors is an unexcited synchronous machine with stator windings and a stator similar to any regular induction machine. The rotor is cross-laminated and contains flux barriers placed equidistantly around the air gap (Fig. 1). They serve to diminish the quadrature (q-axis) flux flowing between poles and at the same time they permit the direct axis flux to flow largely unimpeded through the poles. On the basis of the Parkćs theory, an impedance model of SRM for stationary operating modes is presented in a matrix form (Eq. 1). Further, the paper devotes special attention to surface power losses. The main flux of synchronous reluctance motors rotates at the same speed as the rotor. The presence of the stator openings gives rise to permeance variations causing a ripple in the main flux (Fig. 2) through which the rotor is driven and resulting in induced losses on the rotor surface. The same is going on on the stator surface due to the permeance variations in the rotor slot opening range. At normal tooth ripple frequencies, only eddy current components of these losses are of any significance and histeresis losses may be ignored. Eqs. (2 - 5) describe the magnetic flux density distribution and penetration into the rotor. Fundamental electromagnetic equtions (6 - 8) are used to calculate the eddy current distribution (Eq. 9) on a thin surface layer of a laminated rotor. Surface losses are calculated with Eq. 10 and presented in Figs. (3 - 4). The measured torque and current characteristics of SRM for asynchronous run are shown in Fig. 5. and for synchronous run in Fig. 7. The principle of the rotor load angle measurement is given in Fig. 6. <b>No-load</b> <b>characteristics</b> of SRM and power losses separation are presented in Fig. 8. Power losses at no-load operation of the measured prototype are separated and given in Table 1. To establish the surface losses impact on rotor temperature variations the temperature measurements (Fig. 9) were made. They are presentedin Table 2. Temperature variations for the SRM stator winding at a nominal load are given in Fig. 11...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to determine the steady-state performance of a self-excited induction generator (SEIG). The method gives an intuitive understanding {{of the effects of}} loading on the steady-state performance of the SEIG, without requiring any major mathematical effort. The steady-state no-load voltage of the SEIG is determined as the intersection between the generator no-load curve and the capacitor characteristics. The proposed method extends this approach to a loaded generator by replacing the <b>no-load</b> <b>characteristic</b> by a new generator-load curve. The method is initially applied in a lab environment, but a suitable algorithm to be used instead is also introduced. The algorithm has been validated through laboratory measurement showing an excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results. Furthermore, an experimental investigation of the demagnetisation process of the SEIG is performed, showing how remanent flux depends on applied fault or load resistance. This analysis reveals some issues not previously reported in the literature. The relationship between remanent flux and speed at which self-excitation occurs is shown to contain a discontinuity, above which a fixed minimum speed is required for re-excitation given a certain capacitance. Below the discontinuity the minimum re-excitation speed is dependent on how the generator was demagnetised...|$|E
40|$|The Clark and Washoe Remote Sensing Study (CAWRSS) field season {{took place}} in September 1994. The study was {{designed}} to characterize the exhaust emissions of the on-road vehicle fleet in the two major urban centers of the State of Nevada. The air quality in Las Vegas (Clark County) and Reno (Washoe County) is significantly worse than the surrounding rural areas and vehicle emissions have been identified as one of the primary sources of the pollution. Inspection and maintenance programs, mandated by the federal government, have been implemented in both urban areas. The study compared the State-approved test, a no-load, two-speed idle test, to two other measurement techniques: remote sensing devices (RSDs) and the IM 240 test, a loaded-mode test run on a dynamometer. Results were viewed from two different perspectives. Fleet-wide characteristics showed that concentrations of CO (%,) measured with RSDs were higher than those obtained with the <b>no-load</b> idle tests. <b>Characteristics</b> of pollution distributions derived from the two techniques were similar in range and shape. Observations for individual vehicles were then compared. CAWRSS is in agreement with earlier studies in that high emitters in the idle test are also high emitters on-road...|$|R

The motor uses a composite stator, consisting of a metallic flextensional mode converter, or "cymbal," bonded to a 2 -mm-square piezoelectric plate. The cymbal converts contour-mode vibrations of the plate into oscillations in the cymbal, perpendicular to the stator plane. These are further converted into rotational movement in a rotor pressed against the cymbal by means of an elastic-fin friction drive to produce the required rotary actuation. The motor operates on a single-phase electrical supply, and direct control of the output speed and torque can be achieved by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of the supply voltage. Noncontact optical techniques were used to assess the performance of the developed micro-motor. The operational characteristics were developed from the acceleration and deceleration <b>characteristics.</b> <b>No-load</b> output speed (11 rev s- 1) and stall torque (27 nNm) were derived using high-speed imaging and image analysis.

40|$|Axial flux {{permanent}} magnet generator is well known on application of wind turbine electricity generation. The elimination of some iron core usage in the axial flux {{permanent magnet}} generator had significantly improve the generator’s efficiency compare to the conventional generator. However, the presence of cog cause by the ferrite material within the generator is seen somehow restricting {{the application of the}} generator where low rotational torque is required. Cogging creates an attraction force between magnets and ferrite material in a generator. More power is required to overcome cogging before the generator can be spun continuously. With the increase of power output, the problem of cogging is also increased. Therefore, more power is required to overcome the increased torque. The research sought to fundamentally study the possibility of removing ferrite material in an electric generator. The generator was designed, fabricated and experimentally validated to qualify its <b>no-load</b> and loaded <b>characteristics.</b> The research began with fundamental studies on electric generator and eventually followed by the design concept. The concept was later analyzed in simulation mode by using finite element software to study its characteristics in order to determine its optimum arrangements. Based on the optimum design obtained in the finite element simulations, the generator was then developed and tested in experimental mode to qualify and quantify its qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Since the generator was made coreless and ironless, the cogging torque was therefore reduce to minimum. Results in both simulation and experimental modes showed good agreement between the two. The generator managed to generate a few hundred watts of power and the efficiency was rated to be approximately 78 %. Based on the quantitative experiments, pure sinusoidal 3 -phase voltage wave was captured on a scope. Cog-free motion was found to have demonstrated low starting torque spin. Hence, it can be concluded that it would be suitable for use in low torque application. Many applications can benefit from this generator such as in electric generation itself, wind turbine as well as applications in the automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the work. The {{research}} {{of a new}} highly effective approach for determining power transformer parameters in no-load and short circuit modes, based on the scheme-field modeling of electromagnetic processes which allowing to consider design features, influence of conductor nonlinear properties and ferromagnetic materials, possesses high accuracy and simplicity of numerical realization was developed. Research methods. Mathematical modeling of electromagnetic fields of three-phase transformers with flat magnetic systems in no-load and short-circuit modes by methods of theory electromagnetic fields, finite elements, the theory of electrical circuits; generalization of modeling data by linear and polynomial regression methods. The obtained results. Scheme-field model of electromagnetic processes in power transformer for no-load and short circuit mode are developed, which allowing to consider the influence of design features in the active part, also nonlinearity of conductor properties and magnetic materials. It’s established that in no-load mode magnetic flux is localized in the rods of the magnetic system, and in short-circuit mode it is displaced in the windings region and main dispersion channels. The design features of flat three-phase magnetic system causes uneven distribution of magnetic fluxes lengthways rods and yokes by symmetry of the phase magnetization currents. Therefore, the largest values ofmagnetic flux density in <b>no-load</b> mode are <b>characteristic</b> for B phase rod, and their effective values are higher by 15 – 18 % than the analogous values in the rods A and C phases. In experimental short circuit mode, magnetic flux density values are two orders lower in comparison with no-load mode, and its distribution is symmetric for all phases of transformer active part. A highly effective method for determining power transformer parameters in no-load and short circuit modes, {{which is based on}} the scheme-field modeling of electromagnetic processes, is researched. Approbation of a new technique for transformers second and third dimensions showed the simplicity of numerical implementation and high accuracy, due to design features and influence of conductor nonlinear properties and ferromagnetic materials. Thanks to this approach is provided the decreasing an error during parameters determination for no-load mode by 12 – 16 % and short circuit mode by 5 – 8 % in comparison with well-known method. The method of parameters correction for various stages of the load control device is researched. This method uses linear and parabolic regression equations, which generalize the standardized no-load and short circuit characteristics for various transformers series. This significantly reduces the time spent at the stages of production design preparation, and significantly increases calculation accuracy of no-load and short circuit parameters. The relative error of the correction parameters method for no-load mode does not exceed 2. 82 %, and for the short-circuit mode it’s 0. 7 %. Scientific novelty. A new effective approach for determining power transformer parameters in no-load and short circuit modes is researched and implemented. The approach is based on the scheme-field modeling of electromagnetic processes in the power transformer and subsequent correction by the linear and polynomial regression methods of the standardized no-load and short circuit characteristics with taking into account the set positions of the load control device.

Practical significance. Application of the proposed approach for determining transformer parameters based on the methods of scheme-field sumulation and standardization makes it possible to reduce the error of calculating of no-load and short-circuit parameters by 12 – 16 % and 5 – 8 %, respectively in comparison with wellknown engineering methods...|$|R
