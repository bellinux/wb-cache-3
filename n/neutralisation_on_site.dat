40|$|In the [Fe(etz) 6](BF 4) 2 spincrossover {{system the}} iron(II) {{complexes}} occupy two nonequivalent lattice sites, sites A and B. Complexes <b>on</b> <b>site</b> A show a thermal high-spin (HS) low-spin (LS) transition at 105 K, whereas complexes <b>on</b> <b>site</b> B {{remain in the}} HS state down to 10 K. Complexes <b>on</b> both <b>sites</b> exhibit light-induced spin state conversions (LIESST) at 20 K: LS HS <b>on</b> <b>site</b> A with = 514. 5 nm, and HS LS <b>on</b> <b>site</b> B with = 820 nm. The relaxation processes subsequent to the HS LS conversion <b>on</b> <b>site</b> B reveal a light-induced HSLS bistability for the complexes <b>on</b> <b>site</b> B at 70 K. The bistability {{as well as the}} absence of a thermal spin transition <b>on</b> <b>site</b> B are attributed to a thermal hysteresis for the B-site complexes with a critical temperature Tc 77 K on heating. This hysteresis can be interpreted in terms of strong cooperative effects of elastic origin, which, in addition, cause characteristic deviations of the relaxation <b>on</b> <b>site</b> B from first-order kinetics (self-acceleration). In contrast, the HS LS relaxation at 60 K <b>on</b> <b>site</b> A after irradiation with = 514. 5 nm shows an unusual self-retardation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{discrepancy}} between attitude and behavioural intention in ethical consumption, focusing {{on the role of}} techniques of <b>neutralisation.</b> Drawing <b>on</b> findings of 251 respondents in the UK, results suggest despite positive attitude towards ethical consumption, consumers are also susceptible to the techniques of neutralisation. Hierarchical and moderated regression analyses reveal that inclusion of the neutralisation construct moderates the influences of attitudes on behavioural intention, and advances the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictive capacity. In spite of suggested positive attitude towards ethical consumption, real existing behaviour is frequently filtered through the techniques of neutralisation. The sample is restricted to in size and location, however the study clearly establishes techniques of neutralisation as a construct in the decision-making process, further warranting examination of each of the techniques. The study confirms validity of the addition of the neutralisation construct into the modified TPB model noted by Chatzidakis et al. (2007). It suggests improvement in predicting behavioural intention and shows the moderating effects the techniques of <b>neutralisation</b> have <b>on</b> constructs in the modified TPB model. The neutralisation construct is itself found to {{have a significant impact on}} moderating purchasing intention in ethical consumption...|$|R

40|$|Effect of pre- and post-pubertal {{castration}} on muscle {{weight and}} measurements {{has been studied}} in 3 groups of Piemontese male cattle (EC - early castrated, LC - late castrated, IM - intact) reared in the same environmental conditions and slaughtered at about 18 month of age, at about 550 kg of l. w., {{and at the same}} commercial fattening degree. At side commercial dissection all separated muscles or meat cuts were weighted, and on the most regular ones (regular roll, shoulder clod – “copertina”, blade filet, strip loin, tenderloin, and eye round) linear measures were recorded and then some conformation ratios (weight/length, length/width, and length/circumference) were calculated. Data were analysed by GLM ANCOVA procedure, correcting data on side weight to avoid bias due to differences in carcass weight. Differences were found in meat weight, heavier in IM than in LC and EC (P< 0. 05), and fat weight, heavier in LC and EC than IM (P< 0. 01). Only the blade filet weight/length and length/circumference ratios were higher in EC than LC and IM (P< 0. 05) and in IM than EC (P< 0. 05) respectively, showing the poor effect of sexual <b>neutralisation</b> <b>on</b> weight and size of the considered muscles...|$|R

40|$|Space {{designers}} usually {{look for}} information <b>on</b> <b>site</b> before proceeding design. They image any possibilities of design, {{while they are}} <b>on</b> <b>site.</b> Restricted to traditional design media, {{if they want to}} develop their ideas further, they {{have to go back to}} desks. This kind of design process can capture only part of information of the site. Why not do some developments directly when designers are <b>on</b> the <b>site?</b> That is the starting point of this paper. The whole situation of site is very complicated, so it is very difficult discussing all the possibilities. In order to understand how to design <b>on</b> <b>site,</b> reducing the variations is needed. Tsai and Chang (2005) proposed a prototype about design <b>on</b> <b>site,</b> which focuses <b>on</b> land forming. So I chose interior as the site to reduce the variation and have more controllable factors. Still there are many factors effecting design <b>on</b> <b>site,</b> scale is very unique and very important factor of them. Beginners are difficult to really feel how long it is on the plan drawing, and even most advanced VR equipment still canit fully present the rich information <b>on</b> the <b>site.</b> To experience the site though body, the main idea is how to propose a portable device that can support space designer to do design <b>on</b> <b>site</b> directly, with intuitional body movement and precise scale, and get feedback immediately...|$|R
