50|$|The United States Army Air Forces first leased the Siskiyou County Airport on 18 November 1942. The {{airport was}} {{constructed}} with {{funds from the}} Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). The Army upgraded and extended the original 6,500 foot runways to 7,300 feet to handle bombardment aircraft. The Army also added taxiways, a <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system,</b> a power control building and enclosed the field with a barbed wire fence. By fall of 1943, the airfield was a sub-base of Hamilton Field. With administration provided by Hamilton Field and without housing facilities, Siskiyou County Airport did not become a key installation.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} mined in 1939, but despite a firing of {{explosive}} material on September 4, {{it did not}} collapse. During {{the night of the}} January 22, 1945, area residents (mainly rail workers) defused several bombs placed on the bridge and connected to a detonator. This action made the Queen Jadwiga bridge the only Bydgoszcz crossing in the city center that survived unscathed through World War II period, notwithstanding some missile impacts on its structure.In 2001, Bydgoszcz bridge works company Promost has carried out a major overhaul of the construction, restoring its former glory. It comprised pavement, sidewalks and re-placement on the bridgehead of original Art Nouveau, back to their original location. In addition, a <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> of the bridge was set up in 2005.|$|E
50|$|On 15 July 1944, while {{returning}} in {{a severely}} damaged airplane (B-17G, 840th BS, 483rd BG,15th AF, Sterparone, Italy) {{on a mission}} to an important enemy oil refinery in Ploesti, Captain Leo C. Brooks Point, June 1943 was forced to bail out over Yugoslavia Serbia. Immediately on landing he was approached by members of the Chetnik army who offered him assistance. At Captain Brooks' request to see their commanding officer (Kapetan Larko Muzikravic), he was led through the mountains for several days until on 26 July 1944 he reached a British landing strip (Pranjani, Serbia) that had been prepared for the evacuation of escapees. In the villages surrounding this field there were already some 150 American airmen who were awaiting an expected evacuation and more were coming in every day. As the ranking American officer he took command of the Americans present and in conjunction with the Chetnik area commander determined the best policy to follow in quartering and protecting the men and in effecting a high degree of camouflage discipline. Due to his careful planning, tact, and diplomacy, Captain Brooks obtained maximum aid and assistance from the Chetnik Army. Two entire army corps totaling 3,000 men were provided him to insure ample defense against possible German interference. At Captain Brooks' suggestion, all men to be evacuated were split into six groups with an American officer in charge of each. The first of these groups was composed of all the sick and injured who were quartered near a hospital so that they could receive medical attention. The rest of the groups were dispersed in the neighboring mountains, the most distant being two hours walking distance away. Keeping with him a staff of six officers to handle staff work, Captain Brooks then directed that, to insure the most orderly and expeditious evacuation possible, a list be drafted by name, rank, and serial number of all Americans in the area together with the date of their being shot down. Meanwhile, two men (one was 1st Lt. Tom Oliver (West Point, June 1943, B-24, 756th BS, 459th BG, 15th AF, Giulia, Italy) and, ironically, academy roommate of Captain Brooks) who had been sent to contact General Mihailovic's headquarters, brought back word that on one of three specified nights friendly planes would land to evacuate those present. Captain Brooks inspected the airfield, improvised a <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> with a number of kerosene lamps and then set up a watch to signal the planes when they came over. Only one plane arrived, however, and it did not land, dropping supplies and three men by parachute instead. These three men (OSS team, 1st Lt. Musulin, Master Sargent Rajacich, and Navy Petty Officer Jibilian) had been sent in as an Allied mission from Italy and had brought along a radio. The officer in charge of the mission brought word that the landing strip was not considered usable by 15th Air Force and that no landing would be made until a great amount of work had been done to it. After setting up an improvised radio station with the new equipment, Captain Brooks left one officer in charge of the construction work necessary at this particular field, gave him detailed instructions on how to complete the project, and procured for him through the Chetnik Army Commander a large number of Yugoslav laborers. The remaining six officers, including himself, he divided into two man teams to investigate possible sites for another field. In this manner two better locations were discovered and work was immediately begun on those fields as well. In the meantime, radio contact with 15th Air Force was reestablished and a request made for urgently needed supplies and a message sent with regard to the work that was being done on the first field. Two transports came over shortly thereafter and dropped a considerable quantity of needed supplies. Acting under instructions previously issued by Captain Brooks, the group quartered nearest the dropping site successfully brought in all of these supplies. Several days later when construction on the first field had progressed {{to the point where it}} was usable, the 15th Air Force was notified and a message came back from that headquarters that eight aircraft would arrive that evening, each with a capacity of 12 men. Captain Brooks then sent runners to alert the first 96 men scheduled to go. The field was cleared and signal fires built. One officer was put in charge of the men and ordered to have each group of twelve men leave the woods only when its plane was ready. During this time no one else was to be on the field. Another officer was detailed to meet the planes as they landed and park them for loading, while a third officer was detailed to guide them out for takeoff. Only four aircraft (C-47A, 60thTCG, 12thAF Brindisi, Italy) came in that night, the first carrying a doctor, several assistants, and medical supplies. These four airplanes were landed, unloaded, loaded with evacuees and successfully dispatched. From the pilot of the first plane to land, Captain Brooks learned the operation was to continue throughout the following morning with friendly fighter (said to be Red Tail P-51Cs, 332nd FG, 15th AF, Cattolica, Italy) cover. He immediately sent runners to all the different groups and by 07:00 on 10 August 1944 all the remaining evacuees had been assembled in the woods adjacent to the field. To assist the aircraft, Captain Brooks had had the field marked with strips of parachutes. As each airplane came in that morning 20 men were dispatched to it and it took off. Only after all the other evacuees had been loaded did Captain Brooks get aboard the last airplane. After this last airplane had been loaded, the pilot counted 21 men aboard, one in excess of the maximum. Assuming that one would have to be left on the ground Captain Brooks immediately left the airplane as the volunteer who would stay behind. A recount by the pilot of his passengers, however, brought out that he had had only 20 instead of 21 so that it was possible for Captain Brooks to reenter, but this he did only after assuring himself that the safety of the others would not be imperiled. A total of 240 Americans, seven British, 12 Russians, five French, and five Italian officers and men were evacuated in this operation.|$|E

40|$|A {{lighting}} system originally developed for NASA's Apollo and Skylab manned spacecraft {{resulted in a}} industrial spinoff and creation of a whole new company to produce and market the product line. The company is UDEC Corp., Waltham, Mass. UDEC's "Multi-Mode" electronic {{lighting system}}s are designed for plant emergency and supplemental use, such as night lighting, "always-on" stairwell lights and illuminated exit signs. Their advantages stem from the qualities demanded for spacecraft installation: extremely high fight output with very low energy drain, compactness, light weight, and high reliability. The Multi-Mode system includes long-life fluorescent lamps operated by electronic circuitry, a sealed battery that needs no maintenance for 10 years, and a solid-state battery charger. A typical emergency installation consists of a master module with battery and an eight watt lamp, together with four remote "Satellight" modules powered by the master's battery. As a <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> for maintenance or I security, UDEC fixtures can bypass the battery and 1 operate on normal current {{at a fraction of}} the energy 1 demand of conventional night lighting. Industrial customers have realized savings of better than ninety percent with UDEC night lights. UDEC started as a basement industry in 1972 but the company has already sold more than 1, 000 lighting systems to building operators...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{visual system}} plays an {{important}} role in maintaining balance. As a person ages, gait becomes slower and stride becomes shorter, especially in dimly lighted environments. Falls risk has been associated with reduced speed and increased gait variability. Methods Twenty-four older adults (half identified at risk for falls) experienced three lighting conditions: pathway illuminated by 1) general ceiling-mounted fixtures, 2) conventional plug-in <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> and 3) plug-in <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> supplemented by laser lines outlining the pathway. Gait measures were collected using the GAITRite © walkway system. Results Participants performed best under the general ceiling-mounted <b>light</b> <b>system</b> and worst under the <b>night</b> <b>light</b> alone. The pathway plus <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> increased gait velocity and reduced step length variability compared to the <b>night</b> <b>lights</b> alone in those at greater risk of falling. Conclusions Practically, when navigating in more challenging environments, such as in low-level ambient illumination, the addition of perceptual cues that define the horizontal walking plane can potentially reduce falls risks in older adults. </p...|$|R
