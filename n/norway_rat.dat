We exposed proximal tubule cells isolated from Sprague Dawley or Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats,</b> to a protocol of hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation in vitro. The cells isolated from both rat strains exhibited comparable {{responses in the}} disruption of intercellular adhesions and cytoskeletal damage. In vivo, after 24 [*]h of reperfusion, both strains showed similar degrees of injury. However, after 7 days of reperfusion, renal function and tubular structure almost completely recovered and inflammation resolved, but only in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats.</b> Hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent gene expression, ERK 1 / 2, and Akt activation were different in the two strains. Inflammatory mediators MCP- 1, IL- 10, INF-γ, IL- 1 β, and TNF-α were similarly induced at 24 [*]h in both strains but were downregulated earlier in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats,</b> which correlated with shorter NFκB activation in the kidney. Moreover, VLA- 4 expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes and VCAM- 1 expression in kidney tissues were initially similar at 24 [*]h but reached basal levels earlier in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats.</b> The faster resolution of inflammation in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> suggests that this strain might be a useful experimental model to determine the mechanisms that promote repair of renal ischemia–reperfusion injury...|$|R

40|$|In {{humans and}} rats, {{angiotensin}} I-converting enzyme activity is significantly {{determined by a}} gene polymorphism. Homozygous Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> have higher plasma angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity and circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) levels than Lewis rats. Because Ang II induces NAD(P) H oxidase activation, we hypothesized here that Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> have higher vascular NAD(P) H oxidase activity and superoxide anion production than Lewis <b>rats.</b> Homozygous Brown <b>Norway</b> (n = 15) and Lewis (n = 13) male rats were used. Plasma angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity (by fluorimetry), Ang II levels (by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay), and aortic NAD(P) H oxidase activity, as well as superoxide anion production (by chemiluminescence with lucigenin) were measured. Plasma angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity and Ang II levels were 100 % higher in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> than in Lewis rats (P < 0. 05). Aortic angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but not Ang II, was elevated (P < 0. 05). Aortic superoxide anion production and NAD(P) H oxidase activity were 300 % and 260 % higher in Brown Norway than in Lewis rats, respectively (P < 0. 05), which was not observed in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> treated with candesartan (10 mg/kg per day for 7 days). Endothelial NO synthase activity in the aorta from Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> was significantly lower than in Lewis rats. However, inducible NO synthase activity and both endothelial NO synthase and inducible NO synthase mRNA and protein levels were similar in both genotypes. In summary, Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> have higher vascular NAD(P) H oxidase activity and superoxide anion production than Lewis rats, suggesting {{the presence of a}} higher level of vascular oxidative stress in rats with genetically higher angiotensin I-converting enzyme levels.

40|$|Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> {{are widely}} used {{as a model of}} asthma, whereas Sprague Dawley rats do not develop {{allergic}} reactions under the same conditions. Given the importance of alveolar macrophages (AM) in down-regulating cellular immune responses in the lung, we postulated that the different susceptibilities in the development of airway allergic reactions in these rat strains may be related to functional differences in their AM. We investigated the production of important mediators in asthma, namely tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), IL- 12, IL- 13, nitric oxide (NO) and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α (MIP- 1 α), by AM of unsensitized Sprague Dawley and Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats.</b> AM were purified by adherence and stimulated with OX 8 (anti-CD 8 antibody) or LPS. OX 8 stimulation significantly increased the release of TNF, IL- 10 and NO in both strains of rats, whereas MIP- 1 α and IL- 12 release were increased in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> only. Interestingly, stimulated AM from Sprague Dawley rats released significantly more TNF and less IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 13, MIP- 1 α and NO compared with AM from Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats.</b> These differences were also observed at the mRNA level, except for TNF. Thus, AM from Brown Norway and Sprague Dawley rats are functionally different. Furthermore, LPS- and OX 8 -stimulated AM from Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> produce more Th 2 type cytokines (IL- 10 and IL- 13) than AM from Sprague Dawley rats, suggesting that these cells may {{play an important role in}} creating a cytokine milieu that may favour the development of allergic reactions...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} differences in host cellular immunity, we studied the dose-response relationship for infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) in two different rat strains, skewed towards T helper 1 (Th 1, Lewis rats) or T helper 2 (Th 2, Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats)</b> immunoregulation. Rats were exposed orally to different doses of SE after overnight starvation and neutralization of gastric acid. Animals were observed for clinical signs of disease, fecal excretion and SE load in spleen and cecum, histopathology of the cecum, hematology, and cellular and humoral immune responses. Exponential dose-response models were used for binary or continuous outcomes to analyze the experimental data. Cytokine patterns, antibody isotypes, and contact hypersensitivity tests confirmed that Lewis rats are Th 1 prone, whereas Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> are Th 2 prone. The probability of infection per single SE cell was approximately 100 times higher in Brown <b>Norway</b> <b>rats</b> than in Lewis rats.

60|$|A {{little before}} noon Messrs. Williams and Davies walked {{with me to}} part of a {{neighbouring}} forest, {{to show me the}} famous kauri pine. I measured one of these noble trees, and found it thirty-one feet in circumference above the roots. There was another close by, which I did not see, thirty-three feet; and I heard of one no less than forty feet. These trees are remarkable for their smooth cylindrical boles, which run up to a height of sixty, and even ninety feet, with a nearly equal diameter, and without a single branch. The crown of branches at the summit is out of all proportion small to the trunk; and the leaves are likewise small compared with the branches. The forest was here almost composed of the kauri; and the largest trees, from the parallelism of their sides, stood up like gigantic columns of wood. The timber of the kauri is the most valuable production of the island; moreover, a quantity of resin oozes from the bark, which is sold at a penny a pound to the Americans, but its use was then unknown. Some of the New Zealand forests must be impenetrable to an extraordinary degree. Mr. Matthews informed me that one forest only thirty-four miles in width, and separating two inhabited districts, had only lately, for the first time, been crossed. He and another missionary, each with a party of about fifty men, undertook to open a road, but it cost them more than a fortnight's labour! In the woods I saw very few birds. With regard to animals, it is a most remarkable fact, that so large an island, extending over more than 700 miles in latitude, and in many parts ninety broad, with varied stations, a fine climate, and land of all heights, from 14,000 feet downwards, {{with the exception of a}} small rat, did not possess one indigenous animal. The several species of that gigantic genus of birds, the Deinornis, seem here to have replaced mammiferous quadrupeds, in the same manner as the reptiles still do at the Galapagos Archipelago. It is said that the common <b>Norway</b> <b>rat,</b> in the short space of two years, annihilated in this northern end of the island the New Zealand species. In many places I noticed several sorts of weeds, which, like the rats, I was forced to own as countrymen. A leek has overrun whole districts, and will prove very troublesome, but it was imported as a favour by a French vessel. The common dock is also widely disseminated, and will, I fear, for ever remain a proof of the rascality of an Englishman who sold the seeds for those of the tobacco plant.|$|E
