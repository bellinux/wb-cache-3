5|$|Beginning in 1938 and {{throughout}} World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and {{units of the}} SS could form smaller sub-units, known as SS-Sonderkommandos, to carry out special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of SS-Sonderkommandos was widespread. According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> SS leadership knew how many SS-Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, especially on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Italian {{director}} Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Ossessione (1943), regarded both {{as one of}} {{the great}} noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism. (This was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French Le Dernier Tournant in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including Drunken Angel (1948), Stray Dog (1949), The Bad Sleep Well (1960), and High and Low (1963).|$|E
5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The former {{captain of}} the Black Pearl is resurrected during this film; however, he does not appear until the final shot before the credits. Having met his demise in the {{previous}} installment, Barbossa is resurrected by Tia Dalma and agrees to rescue Jack Sparrow {{in order to save}} the Black Pearl. For this role, Rush was uncredited to keep his return a surprise. The DVD commentary said that <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> cast of the movie knew that Rush would return his character, and that the expressions on the characters' faces when seeing {{him for the first time}} in three years were real.|$|E
5|$|Isa's {{early life}} is obscure. He {{was a member}} of the Shayban tribe from the Jazira, but {{otherwise}} <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> exact name of his father is known, it being variously given as al-Shaykh, Ahmad or Abd al-Razzak. Isa first appears in 848, in the ranks of the Abbasid army under Bugha al-Sharabi that was sent against the rebel Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith in his stronghold of Marand. Muhammad and most of his followers belonged to the Rabi'a tribal group, the same that the Shayban were part of. Consequently Bugha employed Isa as an envoy to the rebels, and Isa managed to convince several among them to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 NFL Network program “10 Worst Teams of All Time” (produced {{prior to}} the Lions’ winless season) {{recognized}} the 1976 Buccaneers as the worst NFL team ever, although it is disputed whether their record was not deceptive, as they were decimated by injuries and were a play away from victory several times. There is some opinion that the 1976 team was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> worst in Buccaneers history, with the 2–14 1986 squad deserving of that distinction.|$|E

5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E
5|$|While Johnny wanders {{the city}} and pines for a woman he sees in an {{apartment}} window ("Boulevard of Broken Dreams"), Tunny {{finds it hard to}} adjust to urban life and is seduced by a television ad for the army ("Favorite Son").

He enlists in the army.|$|E
5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted that <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able}} to enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E
5|$|The natives {{launched}} a furious mass assault against Santa María de Comayagua. The depleted garrison fought {{its way out}} under cover of night and {{set out on a}} desperate march to Gracias a Dios, leaving the town to be sacked – <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> livestock were spared. All across the province the Spanish were short of soldiers, arms and supplies, except at the Peñol de Cerquín, which remained the focus of Spanish attention. In {{a very short period of}} time, Spanish control had collapsed across Honduras; only two small Spanish pockets remained – at Gracias and San Pedro. Montejo sent Gonzalo de Alvarado to San Salvador to seek assistance, which was readily supplied in the form of 100 Indian auxiliaries, 1000 Indian carriers, livestock, arquebuses, crossbows, gunpowder, ammunition, shields, spears, armour and iron. Further supplies were forthcoming from San Miguel, but similar requests sent to Guatemala were largely rebuffed, as a response to Montejo's policies which were perceived as undermining the rights of Guatemalan colonists.|$|E
