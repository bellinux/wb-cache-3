The theory can best be {{described}} as a combination of set theory and combinatorics; however, the arguments to prove some of its results vary across many fields. In this thesis, we survey the field of Ramsey theory highlighting three of its main theorems (Ramsey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 2, Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 4, and Van DerWaerden 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> in Chapter 7), paying particular attention to Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> We discuss the origin (Chapter 5), proofs (Chapters 4 and 5), consequences (Chapter 6), and some generalizations (Chapter 8) of Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem.</b> Among generalizations we mention Rado and Szemerédi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorems.</b> Special attention is also paid to upper and lower bounds for Schur numbers. Along the way, we take a couple detours, going into areas of mathematics or history that are relevant to what we are studying. In particular Chapter 3 includes a biography of Issai Schur, and Chapter 6 discusses results related to Fermat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Last <b>Theorem,</b> namely that modular arithmetic does not suffice to provide a proof, and how this can be verified as a consequence of Schur 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> or by using Fourier analysis...|$|R

But it is not known whether Frostman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> and Tricot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> can be extended to general metric space or not. The aim of this paper is to analyse systematically the several fractional dimensions of a subset and a finite Borel measure and establish new relations among them in a general separable metric space.
