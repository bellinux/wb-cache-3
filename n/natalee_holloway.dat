5|$|A book by Van der Sloot and {{reporter}} Zvezdana Vukojevic, De zaak <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> (The Case of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway)</b> {{was published}} in Dutch in April 2007. In the book, Van der Sloot gives his perspective of the night Holloway disappeared and the media frenzy that followed. He admits and apologizes for his initial untruths, but maintains his innocence.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 2009, LMN aired <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway,</b> a {{television}} film based on Twitty's book Loving Natalee. Starring Tracy Pollan as Beth Twitty, Grant Show as Jug Twitty, Amy Gumenick as <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> and Jacques Strydom as Van der Sloot, the film retells {{events leading up}} to the night of Holloway's disappearance in 2005, and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. It was shot in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2011, St. Martin's Press {{published}} Portrait of a Monster: Joran van der Sloot, a Murder in Peru, and the <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> Mystery by Lisa Pulitzer and Cole Thompson.|$|E
50|$|In November 2010, a {{forensic}} expert {{determined that a}} jawbone found on an Aruban beach was from a young woman. The Netherlands Forensic Institute sent {{a part of the}} bone to The Hague, to be tested against <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway's</b> dental records. According to Altez Navarro, Van der Sloot began laughing when notified of the developments. Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein later announced that the bone was confirmed not to be from Holloway.|$|R
50|$|The film retells {{events leading}} up to the night of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway's</b> {{disappearance}} in Aruba, and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. The film does not solve the case, but stages re-creations of various scenarios, based on the testimony of key players and suspects, including Joran van der Sloot, who is the last person seen drinking with her and escorting her out of the bar. His contradictory accounts, some presented days and others presented years later, are used to present different reenactments of Holloway's final hours before she went missing.|$|R
5|$|On 9 March 2014, the Peruvian {{government}} announced that Van der Sloot would face extradition to the United States {{in the year}} 2038 to face charges of extortion and wire fraud, after completion of his 28-year sentence in Peru {{for the murder of}} Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez (see below). In February 2016, an undercover reporter filmed Van der Sloot confessing to <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway's</b> murder. The film shows Van der Sloot, in Dutch, laughing over how he never told the truth about the whole event and that he did in fact kill Natalee. His Peruvian wife is also present during this conversation.|$|R
5|$|While {{living in}} Aruba five years earlier, Van der Sloot {{had been the}} prime suspect in the {{disappearance}} of American teenager <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway,</b> who disappeared in Aruba on 30 May 2005. He was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in the U.S. for wire fraud and extortion related to Holloway's whereabouts. Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011—six {{years after}} Natalee's disappearance—Dave Holloway filed a {{petition}} with the Alabama courts seeking {{to have his}} daughter declared legally dead. The papers were served on Beth Twitty, his former wife, who announced her intention to oppose the petition. A hearing was held on September 23, 2011, at which time Probate Judge Alan King ruled that Dave Holloway had met the requirements for a legal presumption of death. On January 12, 2012, a second hearing was held, after which Judge King signed the order declaring <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> to be dead.|$|E
5|$|Van der Sloot (then age 17), {{along with}} the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak (then age 21) and Satish (then age 18), was arrested on 9 June 2005, as {{a suspect in the}} 30 May 2005 {{disappearance}} of an 18-year-old American woman, <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway,</b> who was declared legally dead six years after she disappeared. The Kalpoes were released from custody on 4 July, but were re-arrested on 26 August on suspicion of rape and murder, while Van der Sloot remained in custody. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were released on 3 September {{because of a lack of}} evidence. After his release, Van Der Sloot was required to stay within Dutch territory pending the results of the investigation. On 5 September 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to study international business management at the HAN University of Applied Sciences. On 14 September, a higher court removed the travel restrictions. Gerold G. Dompig, former deputy commissioner of the Aruba Police Force, stated that the initial arrests were made prematurely under pressure from Holloway's family. Dompig charged that the family sidetracked the investigation by making it difficult for the police to collect evidence to solve the case.|$|E
5|$|<b>Natalee</b> Ann <b>Holloway</b> (born October 21, 1986) was an American {{teenager}} whose disappearance made {{international news}} after she vanished on May 30, 2005, {{while on a}} high school graduation trip to Aruba in the Caribbean. Holloway lived in Mountain Brook, Alabama, and graduated from Mountain Brook High School on May 24, 2005, shortly before the trip. Her disappearance caused a media sensation in the United States, and the case remains unsolved.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2008, the Lifetime Movie Network {{announced}} plans to create a television film based on Beth Holloway's bestselling book Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith. The {{senior vice president of}} original movies, Tanya Lopez, stated in the announcement that the network was [...] "pleased to be working closely with Natalee's mother" [...] and that they intended {{to tell the story of}} <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway's</b> disappearance [...] "sensitively and accurately." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post questioned whether it was too soon for such a film to be made. Holloway said that she was not sure at first that she could take this step, but felt that it was [...] "the right thing to do" [...] after meeting the creative staff in Los Angeles, California. Disney actress, Spencer Redford, was first offered the part of Natalee. But Redford turned down the role feeling it was still too soon after Holloway's disappearance to make a film because it was still being covered in the media. Sara Paxton was also considered for the role of Holloway.|$|R
50|$|De Vries {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to the June 2008 book Overboord: hoe ik Joran van der Sloot aan het praten kreeg (Overboard: how I got Joran van der Sloot to talk) in which Van der Eem recounts his experience with Van der Sloot with transcripts of the undercover video. On September 22, 2008 in New York, De Vries accepted an International Emmy Award in Current Affairs for his coverage while accompanied by <b>Natalee's</b> mother Beth <b>Holloway.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following her daughter's disappearance, Twitty {{became a}} speaker {{on the topic}} of {{personal}} safety. She founded the International Safe Travels Foundation to educate the public to help them travel more safely, and the <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> Resource Center to aid families of missing persons.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2006, Joran van der Sloot and {{his father}} Paul were in New York City for an {{interview}} with ABC Primetime when they were served with a lawsuit filed by Twitty and her former husband David Holloway. The lawsuit alleged personal injury against <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> and also alleged that Van der Sloot's father created a permissive environment. However, the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on August 3, 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{disappearance}} of Figueroa sparked controversy about media coverage because cable news channels, such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel, neglected {{to cover her}} story in favor of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway,</b> a Caucasian teen missing {{on the island of}} Aruba. Some observers protested that Figueroa's case was similar to the Laci Peterson case (which also covered the same timespan) and thus deserved greater attention, implying that race was a factor in the lack of coverage.|$|E
50|$|Weeks {{after the}} book was {{released}} on April 1, 2007, a new search involving around twenty investigators was launched at Van der Sloot's parents' home on Aruba. Dutch authorities did not comment on what prompted the new search, {{except that it was}} not related to Van der Sloot's book. <b>Natalee's</b> father Dave <b>Holloway</b> said that he did not think the book provided any new information beyond Van der Sloot's original statements that could help the ongoing investigation.|$|R
5|$|In 2016 <b>Natalee’s</b> father, Dave <b>Holloway,</b> hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|R
50|$|Around 29 March 2010, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} contacted John Q. Kelly, {{legal representative}} of <b>Natalee's</b> mother Beth <b>Holloway,</b> {{with an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of $25,000 against a total of $250,000. Kelly said that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On 10 May, Van der Sloot allegedly accepted the amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|R
500|$|In April 2007, De zaak <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> (The Case of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway),</b> a Dutch {{language}} book by Van der Sloot and reporter Zvezdana Vukojevic, {{was published}} by Sijthoff in the Netherlands. Van der Sloot started writing the book while attending business classes in Arnhem. He stated in the introduction, [...] "I see this book as my opportunity to be open and honest about everything that happened, for {{anyone who wants to}} read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Van der Sloot {{was portrayed}} by actor Jacques Strydom in the Lifetime {{television}} film <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> (2009), {{which was based}} on the bestselling book [...] (2007) by Beth Holloway. The movie brought in the highest television ratings in Lifetime's 11-year history at the time. Van der Sloot himself watched the film one evening in 2010, according to his friend John Ludwick, and said that some parts were true while others were not. The film was followed by a sequel, Justice for <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> (2011), in which Van der Sloot was played by actor Stephen Amell.|$|E
500|$|Joran Andreas Petrus van der Sloot ( [...] ; born 6 August 1987) is a Dutch {{convicted murderer}} who killed Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru in 2010. He {{is also the}} prime suspect in the 2005 {{disappearance}} of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> in Aruba.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to her daughter's disappearance, Twitty founded the International Safe Travels Foundation, a non-profit organization designed [...] "to inform and educate the public to help them travel more safely as they travel internationally." [...] In May 2010, she announced that the <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> Resource Center would open at the National Museum of Crime & Punishment. Located in Washington, D.C., the center opened on June 8 to aid families of missing persons.|$|E
500|$|The movie stages re-creations {{of various}} scenarios, {{based on the}} {{testimony}} of key players and suspects, including Van der Sloot. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest television ratings in the network's 11-year history. Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie received mixed reviews from critics. Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News called the movie [...] "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months." [...] However, Jake Meaney of PopMatters found the film to be surprisingly [...] "calm and levelheaded", and praised Pollan's portrayal of Holloway's mother. A follow-up film, Justice for <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway,</b> aired in mid-2011 on LMN. This film picks up in 2010, on the five-year anniversary of Holloway's disappearance. It continues to center on the investigation and what exactly happened to Holloway.|$|E
500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} Arianna Huffington wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now {{we can get back}} to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGraw {{was named}} a co-defendant, along with CBS Television, in a 2006 lawsuit filed in {{relation}} to the disappearance of <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway.</b> The lawsuit was filed by Deepak Kalpoe and his brother Satish Kalpoe, who claimed that an interview they did with McGraw, aired in September 2005, was [...] "manipulated and later broadcast as being accurate, and which portrays Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe 'as engaging in criminal activity against <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> and constitutes defamation.'" [...] The Kalpoe brothers claimed invasion of privacy, fraud, deceit, defamation, emotional distress, and civil conspiracy in the suit, which was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court.|$|E
2500|$|HarperOne, {{an imprint}} of HarperCollins {{published}} [...] on October 2, 2007. Written {{under the name}} [...] "Beth Holloway" [...] following her divorce from Jug Twitty, the book retells {{events leading up to}} the night <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> disappeared in 2005, and the ensuing investigation during the aftermath. It then focuses on the obstacles faced in Aruba by the Holloway and Twitty families in their search for <b>Natalee.</b> <b>Holloway</b> recounts her anger at what she felt was a lack of cooperation from local officials such as the Aruban police, including the failure to obtain a warrant to search the home of Van der Sloot. The book was soon on The New York Times best seller list.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{internet}} bloggers {{began writing}} about the inadequate coverage cable news networks gave to missing people of color and pressured them to give equal coverage of non-white young American women like <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> and Jennifer Wilbanks; they succeeded in gaining attention and Figueroa's case received coverage by major news outlets such as [...] CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel.|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 2009, Lifetime aired <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway,</b> {{starring}} Tracy Pollan as Beth Holloway-Twitty, Grant Show as George [...] "Jug" [...] Twitty, Amy Gumenick as <b>Natalee</b> <b>Holloway</b> and Jacques Strydom as Joran van der Sloot.
