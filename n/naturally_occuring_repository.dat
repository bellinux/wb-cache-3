40|$|Previous {{literature}} has experimentally investigated {{factors that contribute}} {{to the success of the}} voluntary provision of public goods. We examine a new factor, gender and group identity. The experiment uses a threshold public goods game that has both efficient and inefficient equilibria. We find that for women, interacting with members of a <b>naturally</b> <b>occuring</b> group increases coordination and efficiency, while for men, interacting with members of a <b>naturally</b> <b>occuring</b> group decreases coordination and efficiency. Psychological literature on gender differences and group identity explains these differences. We conclude with suggestions for the tailoring of these mechanisms for different organizations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>naturally</b> <b>occuring</b> lung tumors in rats {{is associated with}} aging. Rats younger than 12 months of age rarely have these neoplasms. The majority are founds in rats older than 24 months of age, but even then the prevalence is very low. Most of the available information consists of summarized data from 2 -years carcinogenicity or life span studies. Little {{is known about the}} pathobiology of <b>naturally</b> <b>occuring</b> tumors, in part because of their infrequent occurence. There is a growing body of information derived from experimental studies of pulmonary carcinogenesis in the rat (see Mohr and Dungworth 1988; Mohr et al., 1 990), although here also information on cellular and molecular aspects of the process is still very sketchy. The important primary lung tumors in rats are bronchiolo-alveolar tumors and squamous cell tumors, both of which arise in peripheral regions of pulmonary parenchyma. These will be the main focus of this chapter. <b>Naturally</b> <b>occuring</b> tumors of the tracheobr onchial tree are so rare in rats that they will mentioned only briefly...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} economics-based method for {{deciding}} the optimal rates at which vehicles {{are allowed to}} enter a highway.

Simulations based on realistic parameter values show that this strategy is feasible for <b>naturally</b> <b>occuring</b> traffic, and that even far from optimality, injection policies can improve traffic flow. Our results also allow {{a better understanding of}} the high flows observed in ``synchronized'' congested traffic close to ramps. Comment: Submitted to Physical Review on September 25, 1998.
