2500|$|The {{saxophone}} {{consists of}} an approximately conical tube, usually of thin brass, flared at the tip to form a bell. At intervals along the tube are between 20 and 23 tone holes of varying size and two very small vent holes to assist the playing of the upper register. These holes are covered by keys (also known as pad cups) containing soft leather pads, which are closed to produce an airtight seal. At rest some of the holes stand open and others are closed. The keys are activated by keytouches pressed by the fingers, either directly on the pad cup or connected to it with levers, either directly or with joints called [...] "linkages." [...] The right thumb sits under a thumb rest to stabilize and balance the saxophone, while the weight of most saxophones {{is supported by a}} <b>neckstrap</b> attached to a strap ring on the rear of the body of the instrument. The fingering for the saxophone is a combination of that of the oboe with the Boehm system and is very similar to the flute or upper register of the clarinet. Instruments that play to low A have a left thumb key for that note.|$|E

5000|$|The MR-Fxx series {{consisted}} of the MR-F10, MR-F20, and MR-F30. They were only available in Asia. They were all available with 512MB and 1GB flash memory, except the MR-F20 which only came in 512MB. They all had color screens with varying resolutions and color depth. The MR-F10 and MR-F20 had 65,536-colour organic electroluminescent displays, and the MR-F30 had a 262,144-color organic electroluminescent display. The MR-F10 was available in pearl white or gloss black, and came with an earbud <b>neckstrap.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{baritone}} saxophone’s {{relatively large}} mass (15 to 35 lb depending {{in large part}} on the horn’s age) has {{led to the development of}} harness-style <b>neckstrap</b> that distributes the instrument's weight across the user's shoulders. Several different kinds exist, produced by brands as well known as Neotech and Vandoren, and each distributes weight differently across the saxophonist’s neck, clavicle, and shoulder blades. Many marching saxophonists prefer this style for its ability to decrease fatigue. Those who mainly perform seated, on the other hand, may dislike the decreased ability to move one’s upper body.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recorder}} {{is supported}} by the lips, which loosely seal around the beak of the instrument, the thumb of the lower hand, and, depending on the note fingered, by other the other fingers and the upper thumb. A practice documented in many historical fingering charts is the use of finger seven or eight to support the recorder when playing notes for which the coverage of this hole negligibly affects the sounding pitch (e.g. notes with many holes uncovered). Larger recorders may have a thumbrest, or a <b>neckstrap</b> for extra support, and may use a bocal to direct air from the player's mouth to the windway.|$|E
5000|$|When the K-3 was {{originally}} announced, Ricoh made available a Premium Silver Edition {{that included the}} camera body and battery grip with a silver paint finish {{as well as an}} exclusive red leather neck strap. According to Ricoh, this would match the silver versions of Pentax HD DA Limited lenses. In July 2014, Ricoh announced the Prestige Edition, which included a K-3 and battery grip in a [...] "gunmetal gray" [...] finish as well as two batteries and black artificial leather <b>neckstrap,</b> embossed with the lettering [...] "2014 TIPA BEST DIGITAL SLR EXPERT" [...] and the Pentax K-3 logo. Each edition was limited to 2000 units.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the role of psycho-social factors in headgear compliance. Fifty-one patients, with an Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion comprised the study sample. The treatment plan aimed to correct the malocclusion using cervical pull headgear. An electronic module timer was attached to the <b>neckstrap</b> to evaluate the number of hours the patients wore the headgear. One of their parents was asked to answer the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), which defi nes a patient’s behaviour. The patients were monitored for 6 months and the modules were measured at the end of each 2 month period. Mann–Whitney U and Chi square tests were used to analyse the data. The patients were separated into groups according to their compliance. The results showed that although there were signifi cant differences in the use of headgear between the groups (P ≤ 0. 001), age, gender, and CBCL subgroup scores were not statistically signifi cant (P> 0. 05) ...|$|E
