40|$|This paper uses Factored Latent Analysis (FLA) {{to learn}} a factorized, {{segmental}} representation for observations of tracked objects over time.

One hundred young swimmers (49 boys and 51 girls, aged between 11 and 13 years) underwent a test battery including anthropometrics (body mass, height, arm span [AS], and trunk transverse surface area), kinematic and efficiency (velocity, stroke frequency, stroke length, speed fluctuation, <b>normalized</b> <b>speed</b> fluctuation, stroke index, and Froude efficiency), hydrodynamics (active drag and active drag coefficient), and power output (power to overcome drag, power to transfer kinetic energy to water, and external power) assessments and sprinting performance (official 100 freestyle race).

Turbulent flame propagation data are presented for premixed flames of mixtures of hydrogen, methane, ethylene, n-butane, and dimethyl ether with air, in near-isotropic turbulence in a dual-chamber, fan-stirred vessel. For each individual fuel-air mixture presented in this work and the recently published iso-octane data from Leeds, <b>normalized</b> turbulent flame <b>speed</b> data of individual fuel-air mixtures approximately follow a Re-T,f(0. 5) scaling, for which the average radius is the length scale and thermal diffusivity is the transport property of the turbulence Reynolds number.

This study explored speed-, aging-, and stroke-induced changes on sensorimotor control. Eleven stroke patients (affected sides and unaffected sides) and 20 control subjects (10 young and 10 age-matched individuals) were enrolled to perform elbow tracking tasks using sinusoidal trajectories, which included 6 target speeds (15. 7, 31. 4, 47. 1, 62. 8, 78. 5, and 94. 2 deg/s). The actual elbow angle was recorded and displayed on a screen as visual feedback, and three indicators, the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), normalized integrated jerk (NIJ) and integral of the power spectrum density of <b>normalized</b> <b>speed</b> (IPNS), were used to investigate the strategy of sensorimotor control. Both NIJ and IPNS had significant differences among the four groups (P< 0. 01), and the values were ranked in the following order: young controls < age-matched controls <un-affected sides of stroke patients <affected sides of stroke patients, which could be explained by the stroke- and aging-induced increase in reliance on feedback control. The RMSE in-creased with the increase in the target speed and the NIJ and IPNS initially declined and then remained steady for all four groups, which indicated a shift from feedback to feedfor-ward control as the target speed increased. The feedback-feedforward trade-off induced by stroke, aging and speed might be explained by a change in the transmission delay and neu-romotor noise. The findings in this study improve our understanding of the mechanism un-derlying the sensorimotor control and neurological changes caused by stroke and aging...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Due to {{increased}} interest in treadmill gait training, recent {{research has focused on}} the similarities and differences between treadmill and overground walking. Most of these studies have tested healthy, young subjects rather than impaired populations that might benefit from such training. These studies also do not include optic flow, which may change how the individuals integrate sensory information when walking on a treadmill. This study compared overground walking to treadmill walking in a computer assisted virtual reality environment (CAREN) in individuals with and without transtibial amputations (TTA). Methods Seven individuals with traumatic TTA and 27 unimpaired controls participated. Subjects walked overground and on a treadmill in a CAREN at a <b>normalized</b> <b>speed.</b> The CAREN applied optic flow at the same speed that the subject walked. Temporal-spatial parameters, full body kinematics, and kinematic variability were collected during all trials. Results Both subject groups decreased step time and control subjects decreased step length when walking in the CAREN. Differences in lower extremity kinematics were small (○) and did not exceed the minimal detectable change values for these measures. Control subjects exhibited decreased transverse and frontal plane range of motion of the pelvis and trunk when walking in the CAREN, while patients with TTA did not. Both groups exhibited increased step width variability during treadmill walking in the CAREN, but only minor changes in kinematic variability. Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} that treadmill training in a virtual environment should be similar enough to overground that changes should carry over. Caution should be made when comparing step width variability and step time results from studies utilizing a treadmill to those overground. </p...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{cerebral}} palsy (CP) are characterized by a large diversity of gait deviations; thus, lower limb movements during gait have been well-analyzed in the literature. However, the question of upper limb movements and, more particularly, arm movements during gait has received less attention for CP patients {{as a function of}} the disease type (Hemiplegic, HE or Diplegic, DI). Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate upper limb movements for a large group of CP patients; we used a retrospective search, including upper limb kinematic parameters and 92 CP patients (42 females and 50 males, mean±standard deviation (SD); age: 15. 2 ± 6. 7 years). The diagnoses consisted of 48 HE and 44 DI. A control group of 15 subjects (7 females and 8 males, age: 18. 4 ± 8. 4 years) was included in the study to provide normal gait data. For the DI patients and CG, 88 arms and 30 arms were analyzed, respectively. For the HE patients, 48 affected arms and 48 non-affected arms were analyzed. The kinematic parameters selected and analyzed were shoulder elevation angles; elbow flexion angles; thorax tilt and obliquity angles; hand vertical and anterior-posterior movements; and arm angles. Several gait parameters were also analyzed, such as the gait profile score (GPS) and <b>normalized</b> <b>speed.</b> Statistical analyses were performed to compare CG with the affected and non-affected upper limbs of HE patients and with the two upper limbs of DI patients. The results show that HE and DI patients adopt abnormal upper limb movements. However, DI patients have greater shoulder, elbow, thorax and arm angle movements compared with HE patients. However, HE patients adopt different movements between their affected and non-affected arms. Thus, the patients used their upper limbs to optimize their gait more where gait deviations were more important. These observations confirm that the upper limbs must be integrated into rehabilitation programs to improve inter-limb coordination...|$|E

We found that both the <b>normalized</b> differential ion <b>speed,</b> V_α p/V_A (where V_A is the Alfvén speed) and the proton temperature anisotropy, T_ p/T_∥ p, increase when the relative wave power is growing. Furthermore, if the <b>normalized</b> differential ion <b>speed</b> stays below 0. 5, the alpha-particle temperature anisotropy, T_α/T_∥α, correlates positively with the relative power of the transverse fluctuations. However, if V_α p/V_A is higher than 0. 6, then the alpha-particle temperature anisotropy tends to become lower and attain even values below unity despite the presence of transverse fluctuations of relatively high amplitudes.
