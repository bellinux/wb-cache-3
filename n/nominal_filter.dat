The performance of filter is decided based on the filter media and its rating. Filter rating is evaluated using multi pass test under constant flow conditions.

Glass fiber media is consided as absolute rated and possess high filtration efficiency compared to the stainless steel mesh media.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a robust {{deconvolution}} filter design that optimises a functional motivated by the a posteriori probability of the signals to be estimated. The problem is formulated in the framework of uncertain linear systems represented by discrete-time input–output ARMAX models, where the uncertainty is modelled as the realisation of a stochastic process with known statistics. The design is based on the use of a horizon of measurements in such a way that, for FIR systems, the functional to be optimised coincides with the one that maximises the a posteriori probability (MAP); and for ARMAX systems, the functional converges to the MAP functional as the length of the horizon is increased. The goal is to estimate signals with Gaussian or truncated Gaussian probability density functions based on measurements correlated with them. The robust design shows a very significant improvement, in a probabilistic sense for different systems, of the relative standard deviation of the estimation error when compared with the <b>nominal</b> model <b>filter</b> design...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} Saraga’s design method for {{insertion}} loss filters is investigated, and an attempt made to assess its practicality. The basic filter design method (Darlington, Cauer) leads to numerical accuracy problems. Accepted methods {{for dealing with}} inaccuracy either replace the independent variable (frequoncy) by the more suitable "z-variable" (Szentirmai, Bingham) or introduce rules for polynomial manipulation based on multiplication in preference to summation (Musson, Norek). In contrast to these approaches, Saraga chooses the dependent variables (network functions) {{so as to avoid}} "incompatibilities". Saraga’s method, applicable so far only to symmetrical filters (i. e. of odd degree n), had in the past been investigated only for n= 7. In this thesis the mathematical results obtained by Saraga are extended and generalised. Practical design tests carried out for n= 7 (using artificially introduced inaccuracies to test the power of the method to overcome inaccuracies) are supplemented and extended to n= 9. Various ways of comparing the practical results of different methods for overcoming numerical accuracy problems are discussed, and one particular method is chosen: to use the different methods to design the same <b>nominal</b> <b>filter,</b> with the same numerical accuracy which is reduced until one method breaks down. A comparison of Saraga’s method with Szentirmai’s/Bingham’s is carried out (and also with Orchard’s earlier method). The results are not conclusive; other methods of comparison may have to be used and the comparison will have to be applied to other filters (proposals for further work are made). Some programs Developed previously (in a now obsolete language) had to be rewritten and some new filter design programs had to be developed.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), {{under the}} Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM), is modifying and testing the SpinTek{trademark} rotary {{microfilter}} (RMF) for radioactive filtration {{service in the}} Department of Energy (DOE) complex. The RMF {{has been shown to}} improve filtration throughput when compared to other conventional methods such as cross-flow filtration. A concern with the RMF was that backpressure, or reverse flow through the disk, would damage the filter membranes. Reverse flow might happen {{as a result of an}} inadvertent valve alignment during flushing. Testing was completed in the Engineering Development Laboratory (EDL) located in SRNL to study the physical effects of backpressure as well as to determine the maximum allowable back-pressure for RMF disks. The RMF disks tested at the EDL were manufactured by SpinTek{trademark} Filtration and used a Pall Corporation PMM 050 filter membrane (0. 5 micron nominal pore size) made from 316 L stainless steel. Early versions of the RMF disks were made from synthetic materials that were incompatible with caustic solutions and radioactive service as well as being susceptible to delaminating when subjected to backpressure. Figure 1 - 1 shows the essential components of the RMF; 3 rotating disks and 3 stationary turbulence promoters (or shear elements) are shown. Figure 1 - 2 show the assembly view of a 25 disk RMF proposed for use at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and at the Hanford Facility. The purpose of the testing discussed in this report was to determine the allowable backpressure for RMF disks as well as study the physical effects of backpressure on RMF disks made with the Pall PMM 050 membrane. This was accomplished by pressurizing the disks in the reverse flow direction (backpressure) until the test limit was reached or until membrane failure occurred. Backpressure was applied to the disks with air while submerged in deionized (DI) water. This method provided a visual representation of membrane integrity via bubble flow patterns. Membrane failure was defined as the inability to filter effectively at the <b>nominal</b> <b>filter</b> pore size. Effective filtration was determined by turbidity measurements of filtrate that was produced by applying forward-pressure to the disks while submerged in a representative simulant. The representative simulant was Tank 8 F simulated sludge produced for SRNL by Optima Chemical. Two disks were tested. Disk 1 was tested primarily to determine approximate levels of backpressure where membrane failure occurred. These levels were then used to define the strategy for testing the Disk 2; a strategy that would better define and quantify the mode of failure...|$|E

The robot scrolls outside the catenary riser, used for underwater petroleum exploration, {{and is designed}} to perform several nondestructive tests. It {{can also be used}} to reconstruct the riser profile. Here, a realistic simulation model of robot kinematics and its environment is proposed, using different sources of data: oil platform characteristics, riser static configuration, sea currents and waves, vortex-induced vibrations, and instrumentation model. A dynamic finite element model of the riser generates a nominal riser profile. When the robot kinematic model virtually scrolls the simulated riser profile, a robot kinematic pattern is calculated. This pattern feeds error models of a strapdown inertial measurement unit (IMU) and of a depth sensor. A Kalman filter fuses the simulated accelerometers data with simulated external measurements.

40|$|The Lyman-alpha {{reference}} sample (LARS) {{is a program}} with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that provides a sample of local universe laboratory galaxies in which to study the astrophysics of the visibility and strength of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) line of hydrogen. This article presents {{an overview of the}} survey, its selection function and HST imaging observations. The sample was selected from the GALEX+SDSS catalogue at z= 0. 028 - 0. 19, in order to allow Lya to be captured with combinations of long pass filters in the Solar Blind Channel (SBC) of HST/ACS. In addition, LARS utilises Halpha and Hbeta narrow, and U, B, i broad-band imaging with ACS and WFC 3. In order to study galaxies in which large numbers of Lya photons are produced we demanded an Halpha equivalent width > 100 Å. The sample of 14 galaxies covers far UV (FUV) luminosities that overlaps with those of high-z Lya emitters and Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We present the reduction steps used to obtain the Lya images, including our LARS eXtraction software (LaXs) which utilises pixel-by-pixel spectral synthesis fitting to subtract the continuum at Lya. We demonstrate that the use of SBC long pass filters dramatically increase the signal to noise compared to the <b>nominal</b> Lya <b>filter</b> in SBC. To exemplify, we present results for Mrk 259. This irregular galaxy shows extended but strongly asymmetric Lya emission. Spectroscopy from HST/COS show a moderate outflow in the neutral ISM and an asymmetric Lya profile. Radiative transfer modeling is able to reproduce the Lya line profile, confirming the presence of an outflow. The integrated photometry provides a Lya luminosity of 1. 3 E 42 erg/s an equivalent width W(Lya) = 45 Å and a FUV absolute magnitude - 19. 2. Mrk 259 would hence be detectable in high-z Lya and LBG surveys. The total Lya escape fraction is 12...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, we {{investigate}} two different multiresolution (MR) models for discrete-time second-order wide-sense cyclostationary processes of period P (CS(P) processes). These models utilize the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) {{to find the}} best possible statistical representation of such processes at different resolutions. ^ The first model finds the best approximation s 0 l, of a CS(P) process s 0, from resolution 2 l by minimizing the average variance of the error in this approximation on a wavelet packet tree. The basis which determines this best estimate is called the optimum wavelet packet basis of s 0. The optimum basis selection algorithm determines the structure of the tree and the DWT filters at different nodes of this tree. We show that such an approach yields projections which significantly improve the quality of the low resolution estimates of s 0. ^ In the second model, based on the modified binary wavelet tree, we develop a hierarchical family of sets of CS(P) processes CS(P, WN) ={ CSl(P, WN), l= 0, 1, [...] ., L}, where P= 2 L for some L 3 ̆e 0. Each s 0 ∈ CSl(P, WN) can be parameterized by (i) l <b>nominal</b> DWT <b>filter</b> pairs {hk,gk}, (ii) l mutually uncorrelated WSS residuals rk and (iii) a CS(Pl) projection process sl, uncorrelated with the residuals rk, k= 1, 2, [...] .,l, where Pl=P/ 2 l. The sets CSl(P, WN) are nested within each other: CSl(P, WN) ⊇ CSl+ 1 (P, WN) The projection sk at resolution 2 k is shown to obey similar hierarchical properties: sk∈ CS 1 -k(Pk, WN), where Pk=P/ 2 k, for k= 1, 2, [...] .,l. Such a multiscale representation provides a significant {{reduction in the number of}} second-order moments required for the exact statistical representation of s 0, enabling independent analysis and processing of its low resolution signal components {r 1,r 2, [...] .,rl, sl}. ^ Finally, we present a model fitting algorithm to find the closest process s 0,l∈ CSl(P, WN) to a CS(P) process s 0 by minimizing the distance between s 0 and all s̃ 0 ∈ CSl(P, WN). The effectiveness of this algorithm in fitting the hierarchical model to any CS(P) process is demonstrated with experiments using synthesized CS(P) processes and voiced speech. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} detection and estimation techniques {{in order to ensure}} the safety and security of modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) even in the presence of arbitrary sensors faults and attacks. We leverage the fact that modern CPS are equipped with various sensors that provide redundant information about the system 2 ̆ 7 s state. In such a setting, the system can limit its dependence on any individual sensor, thereby providing guarantees about its safety even in the presence of arbitrary faults and attacks. ^ In order {{to address the problem of}} safety detection, we develop sensor fusion techniques that make use of the sensor redundancy available in modern CPS. First of all, we develop a multidimensional sensor fusion algorithm that outputs a bounded fusion set which is guaranteed to contain the true state even in the presence of attacks and faults. Furthermore, we provide two approaches for strengthening sensor fusion 2 ̆ 7 s worst-case guarantees: 1) incorporating historical measurements as well as 2) analyzing sensor transmission schedules (e. g., in a time-triggered system using a shared bus) in order to minimize the attacker 2 ̆ 7 s available information and impact on the system. In addition, we modify the sensor fusion algorithm in order to provide guarantees even when sensors might experience transient faults in addition to attacks. Finally, we develop an attack detection technique (also in the presence of transient faults) in order to discard attacked sensors. ^ In addition to standard plant sensors, we note that modern CPS also have access to multiple environment sensors that provide information about the system 2 ̆ 7 s context (e. g., a camera recognizing a nearby building). Since these context measurements are related to the system 2 ̆ 7 s state, they can be used for estimation and detection purposes, similar to standard measurements. In this dissertation, we first develop a <b>nominal</b> context-aware <b>filter</b> (i. e., with no faults or attacks) for binary context measurements (e. g., a building detection). Finally, we develop a technique for incorporating context measurements into sensor fusion, thus providing guarantees about system safety even in cases where more than half of standard sensors might be under attack. ...|$|R

The {{result is an}} unecessary loss of performance, because the fixed schedules are designed to accommodate {{a wide range of}} engine health. These fixed control schedules may not be optimal for a deteriorated engine. This problem may be solved by including a measure of deterioration in determining the control variables. These engine deterioration parameters usually cannot be measured directly but can be estimated. A Kalman filter design is presented for estimating two performance parameters that account for engine deterioration: high and low pressure turbine delta efficiencies.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{inserted}} in the scenario of innovative, power-efficient {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC) architectures for wireless applications. The work is organized into two distinct parts. The first section focuses on the verification of the performance of a 6 -bit 90 -nm prototype of a low-power area-efficient successive approximation (SAR) ADC, denoted as "Threshold-Configuring" SAR ADC. Measurements have proven the validity and efficiency of this architecture, making it suitable as a channel converter in a time interleaving system compliant with UWB specifications. The second section regards a RF Bandpass Delta-Sigma (BP DS) ADC, paving the way towards direct RF sampling receiver architectures: the intent is to move the A/D conversion {{as close as possible to}} the antenna, while transfering part of the classical analog signal conditioning to the digital domain. One possible way to meet the stringent dynamic range requirements posed by this approach, is to use a cascaded architecture (Leslie-Singh) to estimate and cancel the in-band portion of the quantization noise introduced by the first stage BP DS ADC. In this framework, the first stage BP DS ADC has been modeled so as to derive the required <b>nominal</b> digital cancellation <b>filter.</b> A complete mixed-signal model of the Leslie-Singh architecture has then been developed to demonstrate the approach.

No significant effect was noted suggesting that the north equatorial area, as a whole, is a pertinent skipjack core area. A standardization procedure was applied to datasets based on CPUEs aggregated by 1 °longitude/ 0. 33 ° latitude and by month, to which corresponding environmental data such as the depth of the mixed layer, the sea surface anomaly, the speed of the current and the chlorophyll concentration were added. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to explore the shape of relationships with fishery-derived and environmental covariates, and undertake transformation in the dataset used by generalized linear models (GLMs). Seven models with various assumptions were tested. They denote a clear skipjack CPUE decline since 2002, with a steeper rate of decline since 2009. We suggest that the massive deployment of FADs during the 1990 s and the development of efficient FAD fishing tactics have likely contributed to such decline, as more than 60 % of skipjack is caught on FADs. However, environmental fluctuations are also at stake in such decline and notably the chlorophyll concentration which reflects the productivity level at the base of the food chain. The surface chlorophyll concentration has been anomalously low in the Somali Basin since 2006 and this could lead to detrimental foraging conditions for the upper trophic levels, or trigger spatial shift of the population in search of more productive areas. The biological and ecological processes associated to this decline would deserve more research. However, the fact that a sustained CPUE decline for skipjack has been occurring since 2002 could become a concern for the conservation of this stock...|$|R
