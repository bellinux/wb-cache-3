500|$|The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago {{received}} Till's body. Upon arrival, Bradley {{insisted on}} viewing {{it to make}} a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away. She decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying, [...] "There was just <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see." [...] Tens {{of thousands of people}} lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.|$|E
500|$|Ferguson remarked the Shield {{should not}} have been settled on penalties; to him it was a [...] "celebration of success", though {{ultimately}} he was delighted his team won. He was pleased with the team's start – [...] "I thought in the first 25 minutes we were really good and could have tied the match up then" [...] – and considered lining the team up in a 4–3–3 formation to begin with, though wanted to see [...] "how Keane played with Ince, what the balance was like". Ince believed he should have been awarded a penalty after Jensen fouled him: [...] "I was past their last man and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would have dived from there." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the final climb, the leading duo were joined by Jonathan Castroviejo (...) and Bartosz Huzarski (...) [...] Sky set a high pace in pursuit of the leading group, and with [...] to go, Chris Froome attacked, {{followed}} by Tejay van Garderen, and they soon passed the leaders. With [...] remaining, Froome attacked to win the stage by a margin of seventeen seconds. Van Garderen moved into the lead of the general classification, and although placing second in the stage, he was content, saying [...] "My tactic was just to mark Froome and when he went there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could follow him, but I'm very happy with the yellow jersey." ...|$|E

500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} minute of play, with Phil Esposito, Yvan Cournoyer and Peter Mahovlich out on the ice, Paul Henderson stood up at the bench and called Mahovlich off the ice as he was skating by. [...] "I jumped {{on the ice and}} rushed {{straight}} for their net. I had this strange feeling that I could score the winning goal", recalls Henderson. Bobby Clarke was supposed to replace Esposito, but Phil didn't come off ("There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was coming off the ice in that situation" [...] Esposito said). Cournoyer picked up a puck that had been passed around the boards by the Soviets in a clearing attempt. He missed Henderson with a pass, but two Soviets mishandled the puck in the corner and Esposito shot the puck on Tretiak.|$|E
500|$|Before {{discovering}} Larkin, Disney {{had been}} insisting on auditioning exclusively performers who {{were capable of}} singing {{as well as they}} could act. However, after Williams' recruitment, the studio relented in favor of casting [...] "strong actors" [...] instead. When Larkin first auditioned for the role, [...] "A Whole New World", Jasmine's only surviving song, had not yet been written; she admitted, [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would have even auditioned... {{if there had been a}} song from the beginning." [...] After writing Jasmine's first song, the filmmakers asked Larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing the character's singing voice. Larkin immediately declined, joking, [...] "I do ... but not like a princess!" [...] Thus, Disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic Larkin's speaking voice instead, despite the actress' fear that the studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether.|$|E

"I {{had long}} wished to hunt tigers, {{and it had}} come into my head {{that it would be}} a grand and novel idea, and also {{extremely}} practicable, to shoot at these savage creatures from a balloon.

500|$|Metallica's {{performance}} at the ceremony, held in February 1989 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, {{marked the first time}} a heavy metal group had performed during the Grammy Awards. Metallica was expected to win the award, and members of Jethro Tull were told by their record label Chrysalis Records not to bother attending the ceremony because they [...] "weren't likely to win." [...] However, Jethro Tull won the award (recipients included members Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg), and when presenters Alice Cooper and Lita Ford announced the result, booing could be heard from the crowd. Anderson, who assumed that the band was being recognized for their twenty-year history, as opposed to a single album, later stated that he was [...] "lucky" [...] not to have attended the ceremony, as [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could have accepted it under those circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E

2500|$|Warwick {{has very}} outspoken {{opinions}} about the future, {{particularly with respect to}} artificial intelligence and its effect on the human species, and argues that humanity will need to use technology to enhance itself to avoid being overtaken by machines. He states that many human limitations, such as sensorimotor abilities, can be outperformed by machines, and is on record as saying that he wants to gain these abilities: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> want to stay a mere human." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bowles {{had been}} asked some years earlier to play Jerry Leadbetter, the husband of Keith's Margo, in The Good Life. Owing to prior commitments, Bowles turned down the role, but had he played Jerry, it is {{unlikely}} {{he would have been}} offered the part of Richard; as Bowles later said, [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could have played Penelope Keith's screen husband in two separate sitcoms". However, in 1987 Bowles replaced Geoffrey Palmer as Keith's onscreen husband in the ITV sitcom Executive Stress.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2017 {{interview}} with USA Today, Jackson admitted {{he never would}} have played football if he had known the health risks associated with it. [...] "I wish I had known about all of those head injuries, but no one knew that. And the people that did know that, they wouldn’t tell anybody," [...] he said. “The game has gotten so violent, so rough. We’re so much more educated on this CTE stuff (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), there’s <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would ever allow my kids to play football today." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was {{controversy}} in April when Graham Yallop released a (ghost written) {{book about the}} Ashes, Lambs to the Slaughter where he claimed Hogg ran [...] "roughshod" [...] over him during the English series. [...] "There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> tried to run roughshod over him", said Hogg. [...] "I simply didn't get any support at all for field placings in the early Tests {{and that is why}} we had continual disagreements". Yallop said he didn't actually write the book and wanted the Hogg chapter re-written. The book was released regardless.|$|E
2500|$|On March 31, 2004, the United States {{closed its}} Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on {{mainland}} Puerto Rico. A skeleton staff of 200, down from approximately 1,200 civilian and 700 military personnel, stayed {{on at the}} facility until {{the transfer of the}} property was completed. The closure of the base at Roosevelt Roads resulted in a substantial financial loss to the economy of Puerto Rico that the Navy estimates at $250 to $300 million a year. Admiral Robert J. Natter, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, is on record as saying: [...] "Without Vieques there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> need the Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads — none. It's a drain on Defense Department and taxpayer dollars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moore {{said that}} he [...] "was in a rather unique position" [...] in the {{disinformation}} campaign: [...] "judging by {{the positions of the}} people I knew to be directly involved in it, [...] definitely {{had something to do with}} national security. There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 November 2010 Ledley {{added another}} goal to his tally against Aberdeen {{in a league}} record 9–0 victory.

[...] Ledley publicly defended himself, stating [...] "I couldn’t believe it when the ref sent me off.

[...] Manager Neil Lennon also defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson's decision as [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
