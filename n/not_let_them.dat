5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity. On 24October, {{the company was}} declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated {{that the cause of}} the bankruptcy was that Autolink had <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> make a private placement of NOK10 million.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E

The restored King Louis XVIII made Sérurier a Peer of France, but he joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, when the former emperor briefly returned to power. This caused him to lose his post at Les Invalides and his marshal's salary after Napoleon's second downfall. Despite his Bonapartist sympathies, as Peer Sérurier voted in favour of the death penalty for Marshal Michel Ney.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E

The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called the police. Officers arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E

25|$|The band {{released}} {{their debut}} album, The Stone Roses, in 1989. The album was a breakthrough {{success for the}} band and garnered critical acclaim, with many critics regarding {{it as one of}} the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their record label at the time, Silvertone, would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991. The Stone Roses then released their second album, Second Coming, which was met with mixed reviews in 1994. The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni first departing in late 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at Reading Festival.|$|E
25|$|In the Vasse region {{relations}} between the white settlers and the native Wardandi people were strained {{to the point of}} violence, resulting in several Aboriginal deaths. In June 1841, George Layman was speared to death by Wardandi elder Gaywal. According to one source, Layman had gotten involved in an argument between Gaywal and another Wardandi tribesman over their allocation of damper, and pulled Gaywal's beard, which was considered a grave insult. According to another source, Layman had hired two of Gaywal's wives to work on his farm and would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go back to their husband. A manhunt for Layman's killer went on for several weeks, involving much bloodshed as Captain Molloy, the Bussell brothers, and troops killed unknown numbers of Aboriginals in what has become known as the Wonnerup Massacre. The posse eventually shot Gaywal and captured his three sons, two of whom were imprisoned on Rottnest Island.|$|E
