According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a medical use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) [...] "swallow the doctor".

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) is {{a powerful}} and widely used imaging technique that can visualize single molecules under physiological condition at the nanometer scale. In this chapter, an AFM-based nanorobot for biological studies is introduced. Using the AFM tip as an end effector, the AFM can be modified into a nanorobot that can manipulate biological objects at the single-molecule level. By functionalizing the AFM tip with specific antibodies, the nanorobot is able to identify specific types of receptors on the cell membrane.

By locally updating the AFM image based on interaction force information and objects' model during nanomanipulation, real-time visual feedback is obtained through the augmented reality interface. The development of the AFM-based <b>nanorobotic</b> system enables us to conduct in situ imaging, sensing, and manipulation simultaneously at the nanometer scale (e. g., protein and DNA levels).

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided <b>nanorobotic</b> {{systems that}} could perform diagnostic, {{curative}} and reconstructive treatments {{in the human}} body at the cellular and sub-cellular level in a controllable manner have recently been proposed. The concept of a MRI-guided <b>nanorobotic</b> system is based on the use of a MRI scanner to induce the required external driving forces to guide magnetic nanocapsules to a specific target. However, the maximum magnetic gradient specifications of existing clinical MRI systems are not capable of driving superparamagnetic nanocapsules against the blood flow and therefore these MRIs do not allow for navigation. The present paper proposes a way to overcome this critical drawback through the formation of micron size agglomerations where their size can be regulated by external magnetic stimuli. This approach is investigated through modeling of the physics that govern the self-assembly of the nanoparticles. Additionally a computational tool has been developed that incorporates the derived models and performs simulation, visualization and post-processing analysis. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate that external magnetic field causes aggregation of nanoparticles while they flow in the vessel. This is a promising result -in accordance with similar experimental results- and encourages further investigation on the nanoparticle based self-assembly structures for use in <b>nanorobotic</b> drug delivery. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

Even if these controllers operate with satisfactory nominal tracking performance, considerable attention has been focused on appropriate control strategies to compensate hysteresis, nonlinearities, drift and creep for high bandwidths and large scanning regimes. As these closed-loop controllers are very cost-effective, a special interest in robust plug-in compensators seems to be a solution.

40|$|Abstract—Pick-place {{of single}} {{nanowires}} inside scanning elec-tron microscopes (SEM) {{is useful for}} prototyping functional de-vices and characterizing nanowires’s properties. Nanowire pick-place has been typically performed via teleoperation, which is time-consuming and highly skill-dependent. This paper presents an au-tomated approach to the pick-place of single nanowires. Through SEM visual detection and vision-based motion control, the system automatically transferred individual silicon nanowires from their growth substrate to a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device that characterized the nanowires’s electromechanical prop-erties. The performance of the <b>nanorobotic</b> pick-up and placement procedures was experimentally quantified. Note to Practitioners—Manipulation of single nanowires or nanotubes is important for their characterization and nanodevice construction. Joystick-based teleoperation of nanomanipulators installed inside a SEM is a commonly used approach for the pick-place of individual nanowires/nanotubes. Nevertheless, the manual process is tedious and time-consuming, even for skilled operators. To address this issue, this paper presents a set of SEM-vision-based techniques to automate the nanowire pick-place process. The techniques can facilitate nanowire/nan-otube property characterization and nanodevice prototyping.
