A plane strain non-slipping model, a plane strain <b>non-coupling</b> model and an axisymmetric <b>non-coupling</b> model have been analyzed, respectively. Our results show that under a finite normal force, the equilibrium of the adhesive system may lost its stability at a critical value of mismatch strain, which significantly depends on both the graded material constants {{and the degree of}} mode-mixity. This indicates that the strongest or weakest adhesion strength under substrate stretching can be achieved by designing the physical constants of the adhesive system appropriately.

Two NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases were revealed: (i) proton-motive, capsaicin-sensitive and oxidizing dNADH as well as NADH enzyme and (ii) enzyme <b>non-coupled</b> to the energy conservation, capsaicin-resistant and oxidizing only NADH. The level of the oxidoreductases strongly depends upon [O 2] and [NH 3] in the growth medium. Increase in [O 2] results in lowering of the coupled-enzyme level and in rise of the <b>non-coupled</b> one. Exclusion of NH 3 from the growth medium increases {{the level of the}} <b>non-coupled</b> enzyme whereas that of the coupled enzyme remains constant.

40|$|AbstractThe {{volatile}} pollutants that spill into {{natural waters}} cause water pollution. Air pollution {{arises from the}} water pollution because of volatilization. Mass exchange caused by turbulent fluctuation is stronger in the direction normal to the air-water interface than in other directions due to the large density difference between water and air. In order to explore the characteristics of anisotropic diffusion of the volatile pollutants at the air-water interface, the relationship between velocity gradient and mass transfer rate was established to calculate the turbulent mass diffusivity. A second-order accurate smooth transition differencing scheme (STDS) was proposed to guarantee the boundedness for the flow and mass transfer at the air-water interface. Simulations and experiments were performed to study the trichloroethylene (C 2 HCl 3) release. By comparing the anisotropic coupling diffusion model, isotropic coupling diffusion model, and <b>non-coupling</b> diffusion model, {{the features of the}} transport of volatile pollutants at the air-water interface were determined. The results show that the anisotropic coupling diffusion model is more accurate than the isotropic coupling diffusion model and <b>non-coupling</b> diffusion model. Mass transfer significantly increases with the increase of the air-water relative velocity at a low relative velocity. However, at a higher relative velocity, an increase in the relative velocity has no effect on mass transfer...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the theory}} of {{characteristic}} modes (TCM) {{is used for the}} first time to analyze the behavior of defected ground structures (DGS) when added to antenna designs. A properly designed DGS introduces currents opposite in direction to the original characteristic modes (CM) currents thus reducing mutual coupling. TCM is also applied to multiple-inputmultiple- output (MIMO) antenna systems to develop a systematic approach that can predict whether the isolation can be enhanced further or not. For this purpose two 4 -element and one 2 -element MIMO designs, i. e. monopole and planar inverted-F antennas (PIFA) are studied. The addition of different antenna elements affects the CM significantly as well as differently. Some of the CM excited on the antenna surface contribute to the coupling between the antenna ports that is why they can be classified as coupling modes. To improve the isolation, the DGS should be introduced at certain locations that blocks the coupling modes but at the same time does not affect the <b>non-coupling</b> modes. If their is no such location or the current on the surface of the chassis for coupling and <b>non-coupling</b> modes is approximately same, the isolation cannot be enhanced further. Using this approach, isolation was improved on an average by 11 dB in all the designs considered, giving the most isolation enhancement following a systematic way compared to other works...|$|E

40|$|During the lest {{years the}} {{importance}} of muscle mitochondria, and mitochondrial function, not only for performance but else for health has been highlighted. The main function of the mitochondria is to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (coupled respiration). In skeletal muscle {{a substantial part of}} the energy is lost in <b>non-coupled</b> reactions, {{it has been estimated that}} <b>non-coupled</b> respiration accounts for as much as 20 - 25 % of the total energy expenditure. It is now almost 10 years since the discovery of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP 3), but the functional role of UCP 3 in <b>non-coupled</b> respiration is not completely understood. The aim of this thesis was to investigate mitochondrial efficiency (P/ 0 ratio), mitochondrial fat oxidation, noncoupled respiration (state 4) and protein expression of UCP 3 in response to exercise and training in human skeletal muscle. In study I eight healthy subjects endurance trained for 6 weeks and 9 subjects performed one exercise session (75 min). In the cycling efficiency study II, end in the study on mitochondrial lipid oxidation III, 9 healthy trained and 9 healthy untrained men participated. In study IV mitochondrial function end reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was studied in 9 elite athletes after extreme exercise, 24 hours of cycling, running end peddling. Endurance training increased whole body oxygen uptake (V 02 peck) by 24 % and muscle citrate synthase (CS) activity (marker of mitochondrial volume) by 47 % (P< 0. 05), but <b>non-coupled</b> respiration end UCP 3 adjusted for mitochondrial volume were reduced (P< 0. 05). One session of exercise did not cif f ect noncoupled respiration or UCP 3. Cycling efficiency (expressed as work efficiency) was inversely related to protein expression of UCP 3 (r= 0. 57) and correlated to type 1 fibers (r= 0. 58). Work efficiency was not influenced by training status or correlated to mitochondrial efficiency. UCP 3 was 52 % higher in the untrained men (P< 0. 05). Mitochondrial capacity for fat oxidation was not influenced by training status, but related to fiber type composition. The hypothesis that mitochondrial fat oxidation is related to whole body lipid oxidation during low-intensity exercise was confirmed (r= 0. 62). Mitochondrial capacity for fat oxidation increased after 24 hours of exercise, whereas mitochondrial efficiency (P/ 0 ratio) decreased. P/ 0 ratio remained reduced else after 28 hours of recovery. Formation of ROS by isolated mitochondria increased after exercise. <b>Non-coupled</b> respiration (state 4), however, decreased and UCP 3 tended to be reduced after recovery from ultraendurance exercise (P= 0. 07). In conclusion: UCP 3 does not follow exercise induced mitochondrial biogenesis. UCP 3 is reduced by endurance training and lower in trained men compered with untrained men. <b>Non-coupled</b> respiration, measured in isolated mitochondria was reduced by endurance training and reduced after recovery from ultra-endurance exercise, but similar in trained end untrained men.

40|$|Chemical sensing {{is a key}} {{component}} in modern society, especially in engineering applications. Because of their widespread impact, improvements to chemical sensors are a significant area of research. One class of sensors, plasmonic sensors, is being heavily researched because {{of their ability to}} detect low levels of analyte in near real time without destroying the analyte. This work studies a new class of plasmonic sensor that utilizes diffractive coupling to improve sensor performance. Specifically, this work outlines the first study of diffractive coupling sensors with typical nanoparticle shapes. Sensitivity of this new class of sensor is directly compared to typical localized surface plasmon resonance sensors. Spectral peak location sensitivity was found to be equal to or greater than typical plasmonic sensors. These results were corroborated with numerical simulation with and without nanoparticle interaction to demonstrate the power of harnessing diffractive coupling in nanoparticle sensors. The sensing results were then extended to analyze ordered arrays of nanorings. Nanorings were chosen because they have the highest reported sensitivity of any plasmonic shape (880 nm/RIU) in the literature and have a high surface area to volume ratio, which is a key parameter for plasmonic sensors. Theoretical simulations of diffractive coupling nanorings indicate that sensitivity is comparable to <b>non-coupling</b> nanorings in the literature (890 nm/RIU vs. 880 nm/RIU, respectively). Another metric of sensor performance, the figure of merit, was much higher (34) than the <b>non-coupling</b> ring (2).
