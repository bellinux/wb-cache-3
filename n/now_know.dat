5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists <b>now</b> <b>know</b> that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E

50|$|The Charter of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL), with 8 {{chapters}} and 32 articles, {{came into}} effect on April 1, 1967. It {{stated that the}} WACL should immediately set up its regional organizations in six regions: Asia (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy), Middle East (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as Middle East Solidarity Council), Africa (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as the African Organization for Freedom and Democracy), and Europe (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as the European Council for World Freedom), North America (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as the North American Federation for Freedom and Democracy), and Latin America (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as the Federation of Latin American Democratic Organization). The organization in the Asian region was the main force to push for {{the mission of the}} World League.|$|R
5|$|However, by AD 500, {{the land}} that would become Wales had divided {{into a number of}} kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. The kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfed and Seisyllwg, Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as {{independent}} Welsh successor states. Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 to 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill, attributed to Arthur by Nennius. This tenacious survival by the Romano-Britons and their descendants in the western kingdoms was to become the foundation of what we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> as Wales. With the loss of the lowlands, England's kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria, and later Wessex, wrestled with Powys, Gwent and Gwynedd to define the frontier between the two peoples.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They <b>now</b> <b>know</b> that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E
5|$|The stele almost {{certainly}} did not originate {{in the town of}} Rashid (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> as the Rosetta Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone probably was re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the Mameluke Sultan Qaitbay (c. 1416/18–1496) to defend the Bolbitine branch of the Nile at Rashid. There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.|$|E

50|$|In 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) was {{established}} by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, EMI, Festival Records, CBS (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as Sony Music), RCA (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as BMG), WEA (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as Warner Music) and Polygram (<b>now</b> <b>known</b> as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.

5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We <b>now</b> <b>know</b> that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We <b>now</b> <b>know</b> that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
