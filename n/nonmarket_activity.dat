40|$|We {{introduce}} {{home production}} into the neoclassical growth model and examine its consequences for development economics. In particular, we study {{the extent to}} which one can account for international income differences with differences in policies that distort capital accumulation. In models with home production, such policies not only reduce capital accumulation but also change the mix of market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity.</b> Hence these models can generate larger differences in output than standard models for a given policy differential. We also show how the welfare implications change when we incorporate home production. ...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that firms develop nonmarket strategies {{in an effort to}} shape public policy changes to their advantage. But are there no limits to this? This paper argues that there is, in fact, an important limitation, internal to the firm, that stems from the necessity for firms to integrate market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities.</b> Because the two types of activities are not always complements but sometimes substitutes, firms end up forgoing part of their <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities</b> to avoid restricting the development of their market strategies. This argument is tested {{in the context of the}} European telecommunications industry. Results suggest that there is reasonable ground for optimism regarding the potentially negative influence that firms’ <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities</b> might play in a democracy. ...|$|R

The activities of the poor are also typically more concentrated in the nonmarket sector than the activities of those who are not poor. A consideration of both market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities</b> is critical to achieving Millennium Development Goals.

40|$|Drawing on the {{resource}} dependence theory and {{the resource}}-based view, this paper investigates the interactions between market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities</b> of firms {{in the context of}} the post-merger integration phase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Based on a cross-country survey of 111 M&A practitioners who were personally involved in cross-border M&As around the world, we test seven hypotheses on various market and nonmarket aspects of post-merger integration. We find a positive correlation between buffering strategies and adaptive capabilities in the nonmarket environment, and between bridging and adaptive capabilities in the market environment. However, we could not find any significant correlation between buffering and adaptive capabilities in the market environment, and bridging and adaptive capabilities in the nonmarket environment. We also find that adaptability in the nonmarket environment is positively correlated with adaptability in the market environment, and in turn adaptability in the market environment leads to positive organizational performance of a cross border M&A. These results provide further support for the value of the alignment between market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities</b> and help to fill a gap in the literature on the market-nonmarket interactions in post-merger integration...|$|R
40|$|Our {{economic}} accounts center {{primarily on}} market transactions. But much of economic activity, {{and in all}} likelihood much of economic welfare, depends upon activities outside of the marketplace. Moreover, although {{we do not yet}} have economic accounts that incorporate the use of time, it is plausible that the economic value of time is the most important single nonmarket input, and perhaps also nonmarket output. I will consider three issues relating to the use of time in this chapter. First, how might we integrate time into our economic accounts? Second, are attempts to use hedonic psychology likely to be a fruitful way of valuing time in our economic accounts? Third, do measures of emotions have the property of “interpersonal cardinality ” that is required to construct quan-titative social indicators? To begin with, it is worth refl ecting on the importance of time use for nonmarket economic activity. <b>Nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> consists of activities like education, recreation and other uses of leisure time, babysitting, home production of laundry and similar services, and work- related activities like commuting. The inputs into these activities consist of nonmarket and mar-ket labor, capital services, and material inputs. By far the largest inputs for <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> are labor (time). Indeed, virtually the entire value added of the nonmarket sectors comes from time inputs, while most of the nontime inputs are purchased in the market economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{national}} income and product accounts (NIPA) {{are the most}} important measures of overall economic activity for a nation. Much as a satellite in space can survey the weather across an entire continent, so can the GDP give an overall picture {{of the state of the}} economy. Nevertheless, since their inception, there have been concerms that the accounts are incomplete and misleading because they omit vast continents of <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> such as unpaid work, the value of leisure time, investment in human capital, and most recently, the environment. The threshold question is: why should we devote scarce intellectual resources to studying nonmarket sectors? The basic insight behind nonmarket accounts is that economic and social welfare does not stop at the market's border, but extends to many nonmarket activities. Three particular areas are worth emphasizing. One important reason why we need better measures of <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> is because we spend increasingly fewer of our lifetime hours in market activities. A second and more speculative reason concems the growing importance (or at least the great importance) of nonmarket assets or mispriced market assets such as the environment and technology. A third point is that current measures of national saving and investment are highly defective. The examples later in this paper address each of these issues. Many of these issues were reviewed in a recent report on augmented accountin...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{definitions of}} production boundaries in economics, explores {{the limitations of}} these definitions {{with respect to the}} inclusion of unpaid domestic labor, and considers the significance of such an exploration for feminist economic analysis. Margaret Reid's ''third party criterion,'' a definition of economic activity advocated by many feminists and one used to set the production boundary for most household production models, sets an implicit market standard for defining nonmarket economic activity and therefore contributes to the marginalization of such production. Similarly, production boundaries considered appropriate in third world contexts, such as those defined in the recently revised System of National Accounts, also use implicit market standards for defining nonmarket economic activity. A ''first world'' criterion implicit in such production boundaries defines <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> as work only if it would have been dealt with on the market in the first world; this results in the inclusion of some of the unpaid domestic activity of rural women on grounds which reinforce the exclusion of work such as child care and the preparation of meals in theory and policy.

40|$|To {{understand}} women’s {{decision on}} labor market participation, {{it is crucial}} to correctly measure the value of household production as well as earning ability. Researchers have attempted to measure home production and other <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> by looking at the amount of time devoted to nonmarket production or the amount of household capital investment.

In this paper we use data on life insurance holdings of married couples by age, education, and employment status to infer how much nonmarket value they produce across different demographic stages. We construct a fully specified overlapping generation model of multiperson households where individuals face mortality risk, have access to life insurance markets, and consume and save. Then we use the model to find out the profile of home production which generates employment rates, life insurance holdings, and key statistics as in the US data. We find that the profile of women’s home production has a very different picture from the profile implied by hours worked at home...|$|E
40|$|National income {{accounting}} {{would be}} a relatively simple matter {{were it not for}} “capital. ” All flows of output would then be for immediate consump-tion, and labor would be the sole factor of production (and relatively undif-ferentiated labor at that, since there would be no investments in health and education to complicate matters). The question of how the boundary be-tween market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activity</b> should be defined {{would be one of the}} main issues of contention; how to measure the real output associated with intangible products like services {{would be a}}nother. However, both problems are essentially issues of implementation rather than of basic the-ory, since there is no conceptual reason to exclude the nonmarket use of economic resources from a complete set of national accounts, nor is there a controversy about the need to express inputs and outputs in both current and constant prices. When it comes to capital, however, it is more a question of what to do than how to do it. No issue has given economic theory more trouble, from Karl Marx and the Austrian capital theorists to Keynes and the Cam-bridge Controversies, and the ambiguity has only gotten worse with the in-creased theoretical focus on Schumpeterian uncertainty, partial informa-tion, imperfect competition, and the emerging literature on the importance of intangible capital assets.

We also argue that this effect is moderated by the MNE’s overall experience, its experience within the host country, and its technological intensity. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 378 foreign MNEs (among the largest 500) operating in the United States (U. S.), spanning the 8 year period 2006 - 2013, and representing 29 home countries.

A regionally specified {{general equilibrium model}} is used to derive the efficiency conditions for a competitive equilibrium to guarantee a Pareto optimal outcome, and some conclusions regarding compensation payments are drawn. Furthermore, existing compensation models in Europe are discussed. The empirical analysis focuses on tourists' willingness to pay (WTP) {{for the provision of}} agricultural landscape-cultivating services in Austria. The mean and median WTP of vacationers is 0. 65 ECU and 0. 25 ECU per person per day, respectively, with the figures varying among the nationalities of the tourists. A comparison of these measures with current voluntary compensation payments made to farmers for the preservation of an agricultural countryside in several Austrian tourism communities suggests that the hypothetical contingent valuation (CV) results represent a valid order of magnitude for the value of recreationrelated agricultural services.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{cyclical}} behavior of an equilibrium search model with endogenous job creation and destruction and extract from it a wage equation {{that can be}} compared with the econometric evidence. Job creation in the model is influenced by wages in new matches. I summarize microeconometric evidence on wages in new matches and show that the key model elasticities are consistent with the evidence. Therefore sticky wages is not the answer to the unemployment volatility puzzle. I discuss some alternative mechanisms that can increase volatility, in particular extensions of the model and alternative driving mechanisms. Jobs in the search and matching model command monopoly rents that are shared between the firm and the worker by a wage contract. The most common wage contract found in the literature is derived from Nash, and yields a wage rate that is a linear combination of the productivity of the match and the worker’s returns from search and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities.</b> Pissarides (1985) and Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) have shown that because nonmarket returns are less cyclical than labor productivity, employment in the model exhibits more cyclicality than in a competitive market-clearing model.

The lower the cost-per-life year gained, the more costeffective the treatment was. Four ERSD treatments were evaluated over 20 years. Home dialysis and transplantation were more cost-effective than in-center dialysis, regardless of whether gross or net social costs were used.

Self-concordance, i. e., internalized motivation, {{has been shown}} to increase satisfaction and increase efficacy of goal attainment. Further, experiential hobbies such as gardening may help individuals feel more satisfied, adopt more intrinsic life aspirations, and be less materialistic. This study explored satisfaction, materialism, and food activities by focusing on first-person, lived experiences of eight urban gardeners in Portland Oregon who grow, prepare, and eat their own food. Little is known about what specific food experiences lead to increased feelings of well-being and satisfaction. Whereas previous research focused on defining and assessing materialism based on life aspiration measures, this study explored how intrinsic life aspirations translate into concrete, lived experiences expressed through food activities. The goal of the current study was to gain a deeper understanding of how food experiences satisfied the psychological needs of urban gardeners. Qualitative analysis of interviews and other data revealed that food experiences: 1) were motivated by intrinsic reasons, such as competency, creativity, and curiosity, and also sometimes for extrinsic reasons such as status and security, 2) were affected by enabling factors such as social relationships, and disabling factors such as time, energy, and financial limitations, and 3) resulted in increased life satisfaction, and feelings of strength, and confidence. Additionally, participants 2 ̆ 7 level of general materialism often corresponded with their level of materialism regarding their food experiences. The results indicated that individually tailored experiential long-term food related hobbies are highly valued and a source of great satisfaction for a variety of psychological needs, such as relatedness, connection, work-life balance, and abundance. These results show that food activities can be intrinsically satisfying and can mitigate the negative effects of materialism.

The authors conclude that these organizations {{have a role to play}} in the agricultural development of Sub-Saharan Africa, but that role should be complemented by other programs that directly target the poorest farmers.

40|$|Excerpt] Enormous {{advances}} {{have been made}} in closing the education and health gap between females and males in Asia and the Pacific. Nonetheless, the average labor force participation rate of women around the globe has remained stubbornly constant over the last 25 years at just over 50 % of the economically active female population. There has been some progress but still, women face a labor market that offers them lower wages and lower quality jobs than their male counterparts. These trends persist even in economies in Asia and the Pacific where the female labor force participation rate in 2014 was a high 53 %—roughly the same as the DMC average, which in itself is a rate that masks significant variations across countries. This special report looks into the complex and varied causes behind this gap in economic empowerment between males and females across Asia and the Pacific, then analyzes the available evidence for its implications to economic growth. This report shows that the low labor force participation of women is intimately related to how they allocate time between market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities.</b> Indeed, in deciding whether to work outside of home, women of whatever education or socioeconomic status tend to put more weight on the need to care for their children and dependents. This choice is reinforced by social norms that emphasize domestic tasks as a woman’s primary responsibility and, in some countries, also constrain women’s social activities and mobility. In some places in Asia and the Pacific, these norms severely limit the possibility for women to achieve wage or income growth or to engage in productive entrepreneurial activities, or both. Thus, policy makers need to focus on the specific reasons behind the gender gap so they can develop and implement effective policies for improving female economic empowerment. This {{will go a long way}} in leveling the playing field between men and women as well as unleash a country’s full potential for sustainable economic growth and prosperity...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{taxation}} on {{the allocation of}} time within households to market work, home production, and child care is empirically examined using cross-section data on a sample of two-earner families. Taxes are found to have {{little effect on the}} two-earner family's allocation of time, compared with other factors, such as the number and ages of children in the family. Studies of the consumption of household time typ-ically focus on market uses of family time, either neglecting non market uses of time or treating them as a time residual in the same category as leisure. 1 One of the first studies to examine the home production behavior offamilies was by Reid (1934), who carefully tabulated hours devoted to non market work by eco-nomic and demographic characteristics. She found in-come, family size and composition, and location of residence to be important determinants of time spent in home production. The pioneering work of Mincer (1962) opened the way for viewing the allocation of time decision as not simply between work and leisure, but between work in the market, work at home, and leisure. With a par-ticular interest in the impact of education on time in-puts to household activities, Leibowitz (1974) applied econometric techniques to study the influences on time spent in household production. She found that the number and ages of children are important influ-ences on time spent in home production, but that pro-ductivity factors such as education have a weak effect. In the Leibowitz study, wage rates were omitted from the specification so the separate influence of education on home production activity could not be studied. Recently, a few studies have explored the influence of the wage rate on the allocation of time to market and <b>nonmarket</b> <b>activities.</b> Bloch (1973) used the 1964 National Study of Work and Planning to estimate home production and labor supply functions for hus-bands and wives. Bloch found that hours devoted to home production vary inversely with the wage rate and positively with the number of children. Gronau (1977), using data drawn from the Michigan Incom...|$|R
