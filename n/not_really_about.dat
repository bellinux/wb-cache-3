2500|$|Sigmund Freud was vehemently anti-American. Historian Peter Gay {{says that}} in [...] "slashing away at Americans wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was {{ventilating}} some inner need".

2500|$|Stoppard's later {{works have}} sought greater inter-personal depths, whilst {{maintaining}} their intellectual playfulness. Stoppard acknowledges that around 1982 he {{moved away from}} the [...] "argumentative" [...] works and more towards plays of the heart, as he became [...] "less shy" [...] about emotional openness. Discussing the later integration of heart and mind in his work, he commented [...] "I think I was too concerned when I set off, to have a firework go off every few seconds... I think I was always looking for the entertainer in myself and I {{seem to be able to}} entertain through manipulating language... it's really about human beings, it's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> language at all." [...] The Real Thing (1982) uses a meta-theatrical structure to explore the suffering that adultery can produce and The Invention of Love (1997) also investigates the pain of passion. Arcadia (1993) explores the meeting of chaos theory, historiography, and landscape gardening.|$|E

2500|$|Released in February 1988, Starfish {{found its}} way into the mainstream, marking a new {{worldwide}} commercial peak for the band. It reached No.11 in Australia and Top50 in the US. The album was awarded a gold record in December 1992 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Also released in February, the single [...] "Under the Milky Way" [...] reached #24 on the US Hot 100, #22 in Australia and entered the Canadian Top 100. It peaked at No.2 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks. The track was written by Kilbey and then-girlfriend Karin Jansson (ex-Pink Champagne). A near-five minute video received airtime on music television programs. [...] "Under the Milky Way" [...] won an ARIA Award in 1989 for 'Single of the Year'. In 2008, readers of The Australian voted it the best Australian song of the last 20 years. In response Kilbey said, [...] "it's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> anything at all. I just wanted to create an atmosphere and I didn't even put a lot of thought into that. History has given it something that it never really had".|$|E
2500|$|Rubens's The Queen Opts for Security {{represents}} Marie de' Medici's {{need for}} security through a {{depiction of the}} event when Marie de' Medici was forced to sign a truce in Angers after her forces had been defeated at Ponte-de-Ce. Though the painting shows Marie de' Medici's desire for security with {{the representation of the}} Temple of Security, the symbols of evil at bay, and the change of smoky haze to clarity, there is also underlying symbolism of unrest to the acceptance of the truce. The round shape of the temple, like those built by the ancients to represent the world, and has an Ionic order that is associated with Juno and Maria herself. The temple defines itself, by also including a plaque above the niche that says [...] "Securitati Augustae" [...] or For the Security of the empress. She is shown with the snakes of the caduceus emblem having uneasy movement and the forced escorting of the queen by Mercury into the Temple of Peace give the feeling of a strong will not to be defeated. It can also be debated that the painting is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> peace or security, but really an unrelenting spirit that does not give into loss. As she is a divine power, she is heroically depicted in a classical setting using neoplatonic hierarchy and visual cues of light on her face. [...] These ultimately imply that this allegory of Marie de' Medici is an apotheosis. Additionally, the inclusion of two differently adorned personifications of Peace hints at the fact that Rubens wanted to confuse or excite the viewer to look deeper into this particular painting as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] " [...] is a {{much more}} complex film than Mr. Carpenter's 'Halloween,' though it's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>about</b> {{anything}} more complicated than a scare down the spine. A lot of its eerie power comes from the kind of unexplained, almost supernatural events one expects to find in a horror movie but not in a melodrama of this sort … If the movie is really about anything at all, it's about methods of urban warfare and defense. Mr. Carpenter is an extremely resourceful director whose ability to construct films entirely out of action and movement suggests that he may one day be a director to rank with Don Siegel." [...] Jeffrey Wells of Films In Review wrote, [...] "Skillfully paced and edited, Assault was rich with Hawksian dialogue and humor, especially in the clever caricature of the classic 'Hawks woman' by Laurie Zimmer." [...] Tom Allen and Andrew Sarris of the Village Voice described the film as [...] "one of the most stylishly kinetic independent films of the 1970s." [...] Alan Jones of Starburst wrote, [...] "Bravura remake of Rio Bravo." [...] Dave Golder of SFX magazine hailed the film as, [...] "A superb, bloody thriller about a siege in an abandoned L.A. cop station." [...] In his book The Horror Films of the 1970s, John Kenneth Muir gave the film three and a half stars, calling it [...] "a lean, mean exciting horror motion picture... a movie of ingenuity, cunning and thrills." [...] Mick Martin & Marsha Porter of the Video Movie Guide gave the film four and a half stars out of five, writing, [...] "…John Carpenter's riveting movie about a nearly deserted L.A. police station that finds itself under siege by a youth gang. It's a modern day version of Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, with exceptional performances by the entire cast." [...] In 2003, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly described Assault as [...] "a tight, tense thriller … Carpenter's eerie score and Douglas Knapp's stylish cinematography give this low-budget shoot-out all the weight of an urban Rio Bravo." [...] Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars out of four: [...] "A nearly deserted L.A. police station finds itself under a state of siege by a youth gang in this riveting thriller, a modern-day paraphrase of Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo. Writer/director Carpenter also did the eerie music score for this knockout." ...|$|E

25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio.
