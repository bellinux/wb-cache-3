40|$|The Chairperson, Mehdi Manaa {{welcomed the}} {{participants}} and indicated that the CRG would discuss the same topics in the agenda as the previous CRG Telco: (i) the T 2 S functionality related to cross-CSD settlement business; and (ii) Change Request T 2 S- 0435 -SYS (Replace dependency of static data updated on auto-collateralisation eligibility by a time-based approach). 2. T 2 S functionality related to cross-CSD settlement business The Chairperson explained that during the last CRG Telco, the CRG members asked for further information about the recycling and optimisation in the three possible solutions identified by the T 2 S Board: Option 1 : Provision check on the omnibus accounts and full scope of optimisation Option 2 : Provision check on the omnibus accounts with limitations in optimisation Option 3 : Introduce a check if omnibus and mirror accounts are in sync for cross-CSD settlement The 4 CB described how the recycling and optimisation processes currently works in T 2 S and how these processes have been foreseen for the above-mentioned options 1. It was explained {{that there is no}} difference in the <b>night-time</b> <b>settlement</b> between the three identified options; the onl...|$|E
40|$|The age-group {{composition}} of populations varies considerably across the world, and obtaining accurate, spatially detailed estimates of {{numbers of children}} under 5 years is important in designing vaccination strategies, educational planning or maternal healthcare delivery. Traditionally, such estimates are derived from population censuses, but these can often be unreliable, outdated and of coarse resolution for resource-poor settings. Focusing on Nigeria, we use nationally representative household surveys and their cluster locations to predict {{the proportion of the}} under-five population in 1 Ã— 1 km using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model. Results showed that land cover, travel time to major <b>settlements,</b> <b>night-time</b> lights and vegetation index were good predictors and that accounting for fine-scale variation, rather than assuming a uniform proportion of under 5 year olds can result in significant differences in health metrics. The largest gaps in estimated bednet and vaccination coverage were in Kano, Katsina and Jigawa. Geolocated household surveys are a valuable resource for providing detailed, contemporary and regularly updated population age-structure data in the absence of recent census data. By combining these with covariate layers, age-structure maps of unprecedented detail can be produced to guide the targeting of interventions in resource-poor settings...|$|R
