40|$|Introduction: The {{potential}} <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> of paramedics is {{a significant}} issue. Despite widespread support of paramedics joining other registered health practitioners under the <b>National</b> <b>Registration</b> and Accreditation Scheme, New South Wales continues to oppose. Methods: This paper considers the New South Wales submission to the Senate Committee’s inquiry into {{the establishment of a}} <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> system for Australian paramedics. It evaluates the reasons for New South Wales Health’s opposition to <b>national</b> <b>registration.</b> Results: New South Wales Health’s reasons for opposing <b>national</b> paramedic <b>registration</b> includes the cost to implement a registration scheme, the desire to maintain vocational entry to employment and the purported efficiency of their current regulatory system. Conclusion: NSW Health’s position fails to address the challenges of employer-based regulation and the significant public protection benefit of national statutory regulation...|$|R

40|$|In July 2006, the Council of Australian Governments {{agreed to}} {{establish}} a single <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> scheme for health professionals and at its meeting in March 2008, COAG agreed to establish the scheme by 1 July 2010 (Intergovernmental Agreement, 2008). The establishment of this scheme presents nurses with an exciting opportunity to express their opinions about <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> and the principles it should underpin (Cook, 2007). Nurses and midwives {{make up more than}} half of the total health workforce; making it essential nurses' play an active role in the design and implementation of <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> (White, 2007; Linsell & Kiejda, 2009). The purpose of this research is to make available the information that nurses require to make informative judgments on the current changes and to be active participants in the framing of their future (White, 2007). The research poster delivers information on six key issues including; what is <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> & why do we need it, who will <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> affect, how will it affect nurses & midwives, the commencement date, the nursing & midwifery board of Australia & quick FAQ's. The poster aims at delivering facts in an informative non-biased manner. <b>National</b> <b>registration</b> is the optimal method of achieving national consistency for nursing practices and standards, through abolishing the individual state and territory boards and replacing it with a single national board (Clark, 2006; Carrigan, 2008; Allen, 2009). It will facilitate flexibility, responsiveness, sustainability and mobility of nurses (Intergovernmental Agreement, 2008). Most importantly, National regulation is about protection of the public and as nurses we must join the health care consumers and have a say in how best we can achieve this (White, 2007; Cook, 2007).

50|$|Before SIR, {{there were}} two departments, namely the Singapore Immigration and the <b>National</b> <b>Registration</b> Department. Both organisations merged on 1 April 1998, to form Singapore Immigration and <b>Registration.</b> The <b>National</b> <b>Registration</b> Office existed during colonial times, with birth {{registration}} starting in 1872 which was used for health and statistical purposes. However, in 1938, registration of births became compulsory by law. After the Second World War, the British colonial government issued paper identity cards in 1948. The purpose of those cards was to identify those born in the colony. The independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the <b>National</b> <b>Registration</b> Act.
