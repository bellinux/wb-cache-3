5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told what she can and cannot do. After {{it is confirmed that}} she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

60|$|The agent agreed, {{and thus}} it came to pass {{that at the time}} of which we now write, Little Tim was doing his best to catch a live bear, but, <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> laughed at even by his son in the event of failure, he had led him and his bride to suppose that he had merely gone out hunting in the usual way.|$|R

25|$|Like all fish, {{goldfish}} do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> petted. In fact, {{touching a}} goldfish can endanger its health, {{because it can}} cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care. The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|Giles {{describes}} her musical style as [...] "fk a genre", <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> categorised. Her manager is Jeffrey O'Neill of Blood Company and her agents are Paradigm Talent Agency. Giles feels {{that she has}} been the equal of her male peers and that the male domination of the EDM scene is slowly changing; she says [...] "I don't think about it often -- only when asked in interviews".|$|R

25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> challenged.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{admits that}} Protagoras has given an {{excellent}} answer {{and that there}} is only one small thing to clarify which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom are one or many things, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together or that of a face which form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into a rhetoric which does not answer the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. Socrates complains that Protagoras is long-winded, like a gong that booms when you strike it and won't stop until you lay a hand on it. It is a typical moment of Socrates opposite a Sophist where the latter is using eloquent speech to hide arguments that might not stand logical scrutiny while the former is trying to use his notorious question/answer format that will lead to a logical conclusion in his favour. Protagoras begins to bristle at this and so Socrates supposes that their styles are opposite. He personally doesn't like long-winded speeches like the one Protagoras just delivered, because he is forgetful and cannot follow the train of thought (334d), and Protagoras does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> peppered with questions that seem to lead them off track. Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk is one thing and public speaking another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.|$|E
500|$|Webster in turn became {{increasingly}} resentful of Thomas, {{to the point}} that Thomas attempted to persuade friends to stay with her as she did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone with Webster. It was arranged that Webster would leave Thomas' service on 28 February. Thomas recorded her decision in her last diary entry: [...] "Gave Katherine warning to leave".|$|E
60|$|The King {{scowled at}} this speech, <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ridiculed, {{but he said}} nothing more. He and his men {{returned}} that same day to Regos, after restoring the bridge of boats. And they held a wild carnival of rejoicing, both in the King's palace and in the city, although the poor people of Regos who were not warriors were all sorry that the kind young Prince had been captured by his enemies and could rule them no longer.|$|R

50|$|The boat isn't {{completely}} vacant as the flapper girl {{is still}} on board. <b>Not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone there, she yells for help. Toby, trailing behind, swims to reach her. The boat then approaches a waterfall but Toby <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> reach it and gets back on board in time. He then moves the paddle wheels from the sides to the front. As the boat reaches {{the edge of the}} waterfall, the paddle wheels at the front work like aircraft propellers, enabling it to fly. Relieved of her troubles, the flapper girl kisses Toby.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the four}} soldiers, a womanizer and card player. The {{character}} is also known for being arrogant and distrustful, and shows hatred towards his white commanders. Lee stated that the character is “a happy-go-lucky guy. He does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under the thumb of authority. He likes card games and women.” [...] Ealy described the character’s indifference: “I think Bishop is the voice that doesn’t believe change is going to come, and doesn’t believe that he belongs over there fighting.” [...] Terrence Howard was originally in talks to play Bishop, prior to Ealy's casting.|$|E
500|$|Charlene was a {{self-described}} tomboy, who preferred {{to be known}} by her nickname [...] "Lenny". She was known for her quick temper and her [...] "heart of gold". She always stuck up {{for those who were}} considered the underdog. In her book Neighbours: The First 10 Years, Josephine Monroe wrote that Charlene did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> patronised and had a sharp tongue. Monroe observed that Charlene's feisty side helped endure her to viewers. In keeping with her tomboyish nature, Charlene trained as a mechanic after leaving school and got an apprenticeship with Rob Lewis (Ernie Bourne). The character's style often consisted of khaki overalls, baggy sweatshirts and her hair set in a perm. A reporter for the Daily Mail said this look helped to launch Minogue [...] "into the public eye" [...] as Charlene.|$|E
500|$|As late as March 2011, McGary ranked 92nd in the {{national}} class of 2012 by Rivals.com. [...] During the LeBron James Skills Academy in July, McGary stood out as {{the best player in}} attendance. [...] He was {{invited to participate in the}} 5th annual Nike Global Challenge the following month. Due to an ankle injury he did not participate. [...] However, later that month, he participated in the Boost Mobile Elite 24 event, where he shattered a backboard. His other 2011 summer camps included Pittsburgh Jam Fest, the National Basketball Players Association Top 100 camp and the Under Armour Best of the Best Camp, where he was the most valuable player. Also in August, ESPN reported that McGary had narrowed his list of schools to six: University of Florida, University of Maryland, University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Duke University and University of Kentucky. Because McGary does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the bearer of bad news, when he narrowed his list, he had his father contact the coaches of the teams no longer in contention for his services. McGary scheduled his official Michigan visit for the beginning of September. McGary completed his official campus visits to University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, and Duke University, in that order, by October 4. [...] However, due to injuries suffered a few weeks earlier while shattering the backboard, he only played pick-up games at Duke. He also made an unofficial visit to Florida prior to these official visits. While Michigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander was recruiting him, a Brewster Academy groundskeeper relayed a story about McGary consoling a freshman who was in tears when his parents dropped him off on the first day of school. [...] Alexander says the groundskeeper told him that [...] "McGary spotted the kid from a distance, stopped his conversation and ran to him, consoled him and brought him into school with his group of friends." [...] Alexander said that McGary's character made him a great fit for Michigan.|$|E

50|$|Annoyed, Oswald confronts {{and tells}} the {{elephant}} to stop, threatening <b>to</b> attack. <b>Not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commanded by someone, the elephant gives a raspberry as Oswald turns around. Oswald then retaliates as he roughs up and wrestles the elephant to the ground. Momentarily, the elephant's huge father comes by. Seemingly intimidated by the larger pachyderm, Oswald helps the downed son get back on his feet. The elephant walks away, leaving Oswald to face the wrath of his father. But Oswald isn't actually hopeless as he reveals and opens a cage containing a mouse, much to the big elephant's panic.|$|R

2500|$|In 1852, the Democratic Party made Pierce their {{candidate}} for president; Jane fainted at the news.

So I went joyfully though my mother grieved to part with me; she had little to love save me, my father, Conrad Montressor, having been lost at sea when but three months wed.|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} {{of natural law}} {{is one of the}} most influential parts of Thomist philosophy.

God gave this light and this law in creation... For no one is ignorant that what he would <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to himself he should not do to others, and similar norms."
