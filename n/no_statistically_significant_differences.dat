25|$|In a pooled {{analysis}} of 7 comparative trials with imipramine, milnacipran and imipramine {{were shown to}} have comparable efficacy while milnacipran was significantly better tolerated. A pooled {{analysis of}} studies comparing milnacipran and SSRIs concluded a superior efficacy for milnacipran with similar tolerability for milnacipran and SSRIs. A more recent meta-analysis of 6 studies involving more than 1,000 patients showed no distinction between milnacipran and SSRIs in efficacy or discontinuation rates, including discontinuation for side effects or lack of efficacy. A meta-analysis {{of a total of}} 16 randomized controlled trials with more than 2200 patients concluded that there were <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant agents. However, compared with TCAs, significantly fewer patients taking milnacipran dropped out due to adverse events. As with other antidepressants, 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before significant antidepressant action becomes clinically evident.|$|E

Under the neutral story format, ego-involved subjects rated their behavior more positively than did role-taking subjects.

Under the positive story format, intentional story subjects rated their behavior more positively than accidental story subjects. The following null hypotheses for the neutral story condition failed to be rejected: there would be <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between the behavior ratings of subjects presented an intentional story format and subjects presented an accidental story format; and there would be <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between behavioral ratings of male and female subjects.

500|$|The American white ibis pairs up {{in spring}} and breeds in huge colonies, often with other waterbird species. Nesting begins as soon as {{suitable}} foraging and nesting habitat is available. The female selects the site, usually in {{the branches of a}} tree or shrub, which is often over water, and builds the nest, and males assist by bringing nest material. Anywhere from one to five eggs are typically laid, with two or three being the most common. The eggs are matt pale blue-green in color with brown splotches and measure [...] and weigh on average [...] Clutch sizes are usually lower in coastal colonies as compared to inland colonies, although there are <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in the fledging rate of both colonies. Throughout the mating and incubation period, the male undergoes a period of starvation to stay close to the nest and aggressively defend his nest and mate from both predators and other ibises in preference to foraging for food. In the 2006 breeding season, a non-breeding adult female was observed to be tending to multiple nests that belonged to other American white ibises—the first time the behavior has been documented for this species.|$|E

2500|$|The proper {{interpretation}} of the data is considered controversial only by those opposed to amalgam. The vast majority of past studies have concluded that amalgams are safe. However, although {{the vast majority of}} patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in the upper 99.9 percentile) exhibit urine test results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety. Two recent randomized clinical trials in children discovered <b>no</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over a five-year period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. In contrast, one study showed a trend of higher dental treatment need later in children with composite dental fillings, and thus claimed that amalgam fillings are more durable. However, the other study (published in JAMA) cites increased mercury blood levels in children with amalgam fillings. The study states, [...] "during follow-up [...] 1.0 to 1.5 μg higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group." [...] EPA considers high blood mercury levels to be harmful to the fetus and also states that, [...] "exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages." [...] Currently, EPA has set the [...] "safe" [...] mercury exposure level to be at 5.8 μg of mercury per one liter of blood. While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above [...] "safe" [...] levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects.|$|E
