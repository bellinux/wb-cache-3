5|$|Magia is a {{collection}} of songs written by Shakira between the ages of 8 and 12, and mainly consists of pop ballads. It was produced by Miguel E. Cubillos and Pablo Tedeschi, and recorded at Aga Studios in Bogotá, when Shakira was 13. A Sony Music Columbia representative said that the recording process was simple and went perfectly fine. But for Shakira, the process was problematic, as she had no ability to decide which tracks would be included and <b>no</b> <b>input</b> into the rhythmic structure or artistic production of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed <b>no</b> <b>input</b> steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|The octopus (along with cuttlefish) has {{the highest}} brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates. It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is {{localised}} in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have <b>no</b> <b>input</b> from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.|$|E

30|$|Let us say an {{oscillator}} has a non-constant phase PDF ρ(ϕ). We {{can think}} that this oscillator’s phase has a constant rate of change dϕ/dt = ω, but its inputs reshape the phase PDF so it becomes ρ(ϕ). Alternatively, we could image that the oscillator receives <b>no</b> <b>inputs,</b> but instead has a phase whose velocity dϕ/dt = ω(t) is changing over time so that ρ(ϕ) is produced. The idea to be introduced here is to use this oscillator with <b>no</b> <b>inputs</b> and variable phase velocity in order to model the oscillator with constant phase velocity and random inputs.|$|R
5|$|Crime and Dissonance, a {{collection}} of Ennio Morricone's film scores from the 1970s, was conceived as a follow-up to Dagored releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001. However, that label abandoned the project, and Mike Patton of Ipecac Recordings decided to release it instead. Morricone had <b>no</b> <b>input</b> in the project; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop. Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well. All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period, spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s. Bishop {{had been given a}} list of films whose scores were available to use in the collection; he set about compiling the two-disc set from there. However, the final song on the album, an eleven-minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da rispettare, {{was not included in the}} list of available material. The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song.|$|E

25|$|To {{capitalise}} on publicity surrounding the band's comeback, the re-release record label Music Club issued a hastily compiled double album Tattva : The Very Best Of Kula Shaker on 16 July 2007, which included all the tracks from the band's first two albums {{and a handful}} of previously released non-album tracks. The band had <b>no</b> <b>input</b> into any aspect of the release and their consent was not obtained for its release. They have been asking their fans not to buy it.|$|E
25|$|With a {{partitioning}} algorithm such as {{the ones}} described above (even with one that chooses good pivot values), quicksort exhibits poor performance for inputs that contain many repeated elements. The problem is clearly apparent when all the input elements are equal: at each recursion, the left partition is empty (<b>no</b> <b>input</b> values are less than the pivot), and the right partition has only decreased by one element (the pivot is removed). Consequently, the algorithm takes quadratic time to sort an array of equal values.|$|E

25|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, {{possibly}} {{more so than}} any other order of invertebrates. The level of their intelligence and learning capability are debated, but maze and problem-solving studies show they have both short- and long-term memory. Octopus have a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localized in their brain. Two-thirds of an octopus' neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of their arms. Octopus arms show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have <b>no</b> <b>input</b> from the brain.

25|$|Input offset voltage: This voltage, {{which is}} what is {{required}} across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, there would be <b>no</b> <b>input</b> offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage {{of the vast majority}} of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, President Akufo-Addo {{nominated}} {{him to be}} Works and Housing Minister as part of {{his second}} batch of minister designates. Prior to his vetting by the appointments committee of Parliament, it emerged that he had made almost <b>no</b> <b>input</b> relevant to the ministry he had been nominated to head in addition he had not been involved in any relevant interaction with the Works and Housing committee. It was however, a credit to him that his track record for building strong institutions and enforcement of constitutional provisions would bode well for him in the sector. During his vetting by the appointments committee on 31 January 2017, he expressed his vision for the ministry he had been appointed to and promised to complete all uncompleted housing projects started by the John Dramani Mahama administration.

25|$|Out of Reach {{has been}} reissued along with Can's 1979 self-titled release Can (which {{is also known}} as Inner Space, named after the band's {{recording}} studio). Various other reissued versions of this album do exist on CD, such as the issue of Out of Reach (without Can) on MagMid (TKO Magnum Music) in the United Kingdom, although it is considerably more difficult to find than other Can albums in general. However, this album, being the only Can album that features <b>no</b> <b>input</b> from Holger Czukay (as its 1979 followup Can had some editing by Czukay), has been disowned by the band in recent years as it is not listed as part of Can's discography on their official website, and was not remastered on CD in the 1990s, nor was it reissued on Super Audio CD in the mid-2000s as all the other Can studio albums were.|$|E
25|$|Robert Moses {{simultaneously}} held twelve titles (including NYC Parks Commissioner and Chairman of the Long Island State Park Commission), but {{was never}} elected to any public office (he ran only once, {{for governor of}} New York as a Republican in 1934 and lost to Herbert H. Lehman). Nevertheless, he created and led numerous public authorities that gave him autonomy from {{the general public and}} elected officials. Through these authorities, he controlled millions of dollars in income from his projects, such as tolls, and he could issue bonds to borrow vast sums for new ventures with little or <b>no</b> <b>input</b> from legislative bodies, allowing him to circumvent the power of the purse as it normally functioned in the United States, and the process of public comment on major public works. As a result of Moses' work, New York has the United States' greatest proportion of public benefit corporations, which are the prime mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York and account for most of the state's debt.|$|E
25|$|Profile sought <b>no</b> <b>input</b> or consent from Thorpe {{before doing}} this, and this aggravated the already troubled {{relationship}} between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding {{the ownership of}} the Robot Wars concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002. Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however, and the initial series of Robot Wars in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than 2 million viewers, and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total, and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for the TNN (now Spike) network, and a version was also shown on Nickelodeon. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn, and executive produced by Tom Gutteridge and Steve Carsey. The initial series were staged in various film studios around London but the stage and pit area became too large to fit {{into any of the}} conventional studios, so filming was later moved to an aircraft hangar at RAF Newton.|$|E
