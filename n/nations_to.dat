5|$|A {{total of}} 66 cyclists have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, <b>nations)</b> <b>to</b> place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation did not occur.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E
5|$|Australia is {{the second}} of only two <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> have participated in IBAF-sanctioned {{continental}} tournaments {{for more than one}} continent: the Asian Baseball Championship between 1971–1993, and the Oceania Baseball Championship since 2003. The first nation to achieve this was Guam, who competed in the Asian tournament within the same timeframe as Australia, though they were involved in the first Oceania tournament in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Contested by twelve {{national}} teams, {{the tournament}} had Zambia invited {{as a guest}} nation to fill in for Djibouti, who failed to participate for a second consecutive year. This followed the tournament's recent tradition of inviting other African <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> take part once a CECAFA nation pulled out; Malawi were invited {{to take part in}} the previous edition held in Uganda, while they and Zimbabwe took part in 2011 after Eritrea withdrew from the competition.|$|E

50|$|The 2015 tournament was {{hosted by}} England. The tournament was won by New Zealand, who {{defeated}} Australia 34-17 {{to become the}} first <b>nation</b> <b>to</b> successfully defend their World Champion title and the first <b>nation</b> <b>to</b> win the tournament three times.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 Norway {{became the}} first European <b>nation</b> <b>to</b> lose to Nigeria, falling 0-5 in Lagos, and they were also the first European <b>nation</b> <b>to</b> lose to Senegal the {{following}} year. Three players debuted against Senegal; Bent Ove Pedersen and Audun Jensen lost the doubles match, while Anders Håseth played singles with one win and one loss.|$|R
5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company. The newspapers printed a counterview that warned against Jingoism and starting rumors that could lead to developing unwanted war airships or a cause for other <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> make military equipment against this new war technology.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council {{called on}} member <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> aid South Korea.

On 1 July, one day after President Truman committed American ground forces to Korea, the first Australian operation in Korea took place; Shoalhaven escorted an American ammunition ship from Japan to Pusan.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1960, the Copa Libertadores had predominantly been won by clubs from nations with an Atlantic coast: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.

5|$|Great Britain was {{the only}} <b>nation</b> <b>to</b> win two medals in the triathlon events at the 2012 Summer Olympics with one gold medal and one bronze medal, both in the men's race.

Australia won its fifth Olympic medal with Densham's bronze {{which is more than}} any other <b>nation</b> <b>to</b> that point. Sweden, Spain and Great Britain all won their first Olympic triathlon medal.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics. The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.|$|E
5|$|The United States also observes tribal {{sovereignty}} of the American Indian <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they {{have a great deal of}} autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.|$|E

5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would {{be threatened by}} global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E
5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou was {{concerned}} with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from <b>nations</b> <b>to</b> adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
