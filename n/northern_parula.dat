25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the <b>northern</b> <b>parula,</b> American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E

50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> (Setophaga americana) {{is a small}} New World warbler. It breeds {{in eastern}} North America from {{southern}} Canada to Florida.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> winters {{south of}} its {{breeding}} ranges in Central America and the West Indies, where the tropical parula is a usually a permanent resident.|$|E
50|$|Setophaga pitiayumi has {{occasionally}} been lumped {{with the}} closely related <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> (S. americana) {{as a single}} species. Hybrids are routinely found in the Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas, though {{this may be a}} recent phenomenon. Most tropical parulas can be distinguished from the <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> by their lack of white eye crescents, but this may be ambiguous in hybrids. One should also look for the distribution and extent of non-yellow coloration on the breast, and the extent of yellow below the cheek and on the belly.|$|E
50|$|This is a monogamous species, however, a {{few cases}} of {{polygamy}} have been reported. Southern populations can start breeding as soon as March but {{to the north of}} the range, the species does not nest until May. The breeding habitat is humid woodland with growths of Old Man's Beard lichen or Spanish moss. <b>Northern</b> <b>parulas</b> nest in trees in clumps of these fungi (Old Man's Beard; Usnea) or plants (Spanish moss; Tillandsia usneoides), laying 3-7 eggs in a scantily lined cup nest. Sites located near water sources are preferred and many nests are found at the end of branches suspended over water. Due to their longer breeding season, southern parulas frequently raise two broods, as opposed to northern ones who raise only one. The female hollows out a clump of vegetation in the moss and proceeds to fill the cavity with vegetation fibers, animal hair, grass, or pine needles. These nests average 7 cm in outside diameter. The incubation period typically lasts 12 to 14 days and the young fledge at 10 to 11 days. Breeding maturity is attained the following year.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the rural}} village of Downsville, you can enter Bryan Park by roadway or walking {{path from the}} graveled apron on LA 151. The park drive is {{approximately}} 3330 ft on a rise bordered by pines {{on one side and}} a meadow on the other. Cresting the rise, you may leave your vehicle at the parking areas and take a walk under the oaks. Follow an easy walking trail through bottomland hardwoods and mixed pine forest around the 3 acre pond, where you may sight such nesting species as black-throated green or black and white warblers, <b>northern</b> <b>parulas,</b> and red-shouldered and Cooper’s hawks. Wading birds such as great egret, great blue heron, and green heron also frequent the pond and the cattail perimeter hosts red-winged blackbirds. In the warmer months, honeysuckle attracts ruby-throated hummingbirds. Wetland migrants include marsh wren and common yellowthroat in the fall and spring. In the late winter until spring, black vultures court and cruise. Generally, the park boundaries are alive with woodpeckers, eastern bluebirds, various sparrows, vireos, Indigo buntings, eastern meadowlarks, bobwhites, mourning dove, northern cardinals and blue jays. There are also owls.|$|R
25|$|The American artist Joseph Mason — a {{great friend}} of John James Audubon — painted a precise image of what was then known as the Louisiana Flag or Copper Iris (Iris fulva), to which Audubon {{subsequently}} added two <b>Northern</b> Paraula birds (<b>parula</b> americana) for inclusion as Plate 15 in his Birds of America.|$|R
50|$|More than 35 {{species of}} spring New World warbler have been seen, {{including}} the golden-winged warbler, magnolia warbler, <b>Northern</b> <b>parula,</b> tropical parula, American redstart, palm warbler, and yellow-breasted chat.|$|E

2500|$|Trail #5 {{is about}} 0.9 mile long {{and is a}} medium {{challenge}} trail. There is {{a significant amount of}} mud on this trail, but less so in the dry season months of December through March and June through July. To reach this trail from the visitor's parking area hikers must first head northbound to trek the entire length of Trail #7 (the Camping Area trail, 0.1 mile long), cross the bridge over the Doña Juana Creek and then hop on Trail #8. From this point on Trail #8, hikers head West for about 0.2 mile where Trail #5 begins; its entrance is located on the right hand side. The trail heads North and leads to Puerto Rico Highway 564. The first segment of the trail runs downhill for 0.9 mile. [...] The trail runs a thick tropical jungle of banana trees, sierra palms, tree ferns, flamboyant trees, and elephant ears. The trail is muddy, steep, and scantily-marked. Visibility is minimal through the dense foliage. There are several creeks near this trail and birds are abundant: black-throated blue warblers, <b>northern</b> <b>parulas,</b> green mangos, Cape May warblers, belted kingfishers, among others. After the 0.9 mile trek, the trail reaches PR-564. There is water pumping station on the left. From this point the [...] "trail" [...] turns right, as PR-564 is intended {{to be part of the}} trail. Hikers walk South on PR-564 for 0.6 mile where the northern terminus of Trail #9 (the Doña Petra trail) is located to the right. Continuing southbound on PR-564 for another 0.1 mile, the road trail meets PR-143, where hikers turn right to continue South on Trail #5. From this point hikers walk another 0.25 mile to arrive at the visitor's parking area on the right side of the road. Considering the hikes on Trails #7 and #8 plus the hikes on roads PR-564 and PR-143, Trail #5 is 2.95 miles long, making it the second longest hike of all of Toro Negro's trails.|$|R

50|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in the park during any season. The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> nests in clumps of Spanish moss while the prothonotary warbler lives along the river. Fall and winter bring a host of migratory waterfowl to the area to join the native wood duck.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> forages mostly or {{entirely on}} {{terrestrial}} invertebrates. Prey items include spiders, damselflies, locusts, bugs, grasshoppers, aphids, beetles, caterpillars, flies, wasps, bees, and ants. Regardless of season, caterpillars and spiders are consumed most often. During the winter, the <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> consumes more beetles and occasionally forages on berries, seeds, and nectar. This species primarily captures prey from vegetation by a hover-glean method, however this species is versatile in {{using a variety}} of foraging methods. It may make short flights from a perch to snatch prey in mid-flight or even hang upside-down to forage. It is most often seen foraging in the mid- to upper canopy levels of vegetation. Though most foraging activity occurs in arboreal vegetation, this species occasionally forages on or around the ground as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{name for the}} family, Parulidae, originates {{from the fact that}} Linnaeus in 1758 named the <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> as a tit, Parus americanus, and, as taxonomy developed, the genus name was modified first to Parulus and then to Parula. The family name derives from the name for the genus.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mixed}} pine-oak forests, the brown-headed {{nuthatch}} (Sitta pusilla) feeds on pine seeds. The yellow-throated warbler (Dendroica dominica) is widely distributed. The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> warbler (Parula americana) {{and the eastern}} bluebird (Sialia sialis) are also found here. The Bachman sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) and red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), both uncommon, also live in this ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|Documented {{examples}} of the species' songs were composed of a rapid series six to twenty-five buzz notes, sometimes ending in a sharp, slurred note zip. The song {{was similar to that}} of the <b>northern</b> <b>parula,</b> but distinguishable in that it was noticeably monotone. Multiple call notes have been recorded, ranging from a soft tsip to a low, hissing zee-e-eep.|$|E
50|$|In addition, a {{partially}} leucistic tropical parula female {{was seen in}} 2005, at Reserva Buenaventura in El Oro Province, Ecuador. With several small white areas on the forehead and around the eyes, this bird appeared much like a hybrid, but such birds would only occur {{as far south as}} Panama (if they would migrate like the <b>northern</b> <b>parula).</b>|$|E
50|$|The crescent-chested warbler is superficially {{similar to}} both the <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> and the {{tropical}} parula, with yellow underparts, a gray head, and a greenish back, but neither of these has a bold white eyebrow. Adult males have a discrete chestnut crescent on the breast, which is less prominent and sometimes lacking in females and young birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> inhabits various {{habitats}} {{depending on}} season and location. This {{is primarily a}} forest-dwelling species, but {{the northern and southern}} breeding populations select different habitats. In general, abundance of this species {{has been found to be}} positively correlated with increased tree species diversity, canopy height, and percent canopy cover. Northern populations breed in mature, moist coniferous forests. This species constructs its pendulum nests in hanging vegetation and so it is often attracted to suspended clumps of moss or coniferous twigs that are more abundant in moist spruce bogs or hemlock swamps. Southern populations breed in mature, moist, bottomland forest where Spanish moss is prevalent. Outside of the breeding season, the <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> becomes more of a habitat generalist and may be found in a wide variety of habitats during migration and winter. These habitats may include: pastures; moist, dry or wet forests; and agricultural fields or plantations.|$|E

50|$|Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge is {{along the}} southernmost {{portion of the}} lower Mississippi River, which does not have levees. It {{experiences}} floods most years. The refuge is home to many species, including the federally listed Louisiana black bear. The Mississippi River is a major bird migration corridor; it is located within an area of high importance for neotropical migratory birds, including the swallow-tailed kite, which is a species of special concern. Other wildlife found in the area include white-tailed deer, bobcat, mink, river otter, wild turkey, black-crowned night-heron, wood duck, blue-winged teal, woodcock, solitary sandpiper, greater yellowlegs, prothonotary warbler, <b>northern</b> <b>parula,</b> pileated woodpecker, green tree frog, and red-eared slider.|$|E
50|$|United States Fish and Wildlife Service {{conducted}} a breeding land bird survey in 2003. A total of 75 {{species of birds}} were sighted on the property during the 2003 survey. An initial scouting survey conducted in May 2003 revealed that a great diversity of migratory songbirds use Mt. Tom for stopover habitat. Species sighted during that time include Blackburnian warbler, black-throated blue warbler, blue-winged warbler, <b>northern</b> <b>parula,</b> and yellow-rumped warbler. None of these species were counted during the landbird breeding survey. Early migratory stopover studies will be conducted by USFWS in subsequent years to further assess the use of Mt. Tom by neo-tropical migrants for stopover habitat.|$|E
50|$|Reports {{of birds}} from the Missouri and Arkansas {{breeding}} grounds lasted through the 1940s, while birds were reported breeding in South Carolina's I'on Swamp until 1953. Individuals were reported from Fairfax County, Virginia in 1954 and 1958, and a male was seen singing near I'on Swamp in April 1962. On March 30, 1977 an immature female {{was seen in}} Brevard County, Florida. Credible reports ended in the 1980s. More recent reports of the species from the Congaree National Park in the early 2000s have prompted formal investigation, but were attributed as misidentifications of hooded warbler sightings and <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> songs. A thorough and systematic search using playback of recorded Bachman's warbler songs did not reveal any territorial males and did not provoke any aggressive response from other bird species.|$|E
50|$|During the {{two years}} he {{traveled}} with Audubon (October 1820 to August 1822), Mason painted, by his own reckoning, between 150 and 200 background watercolors for Audubon. Over 50 of these were used, uncredited, in Audubon's book of 450 bird paintings. For example, for Audubon's study of two blue yellow-backed warblers (now known as <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> birds; plate 15 of Birds of America), Mason painted an image of Iris fulva, the copper iris, which Audubon called Louisiana flag. Similarly, plate 73 shows Mason's painting of a branch of Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia, called by Audubon great magnolia) on which is perched a Canada warbler (called by Audubon Bonaparte's flycatching warbler). A former curator of the National Gallery of Art considers that Mason's backgrounds significantly contribute to the scientific worth of Audubon's project because of how they help to establish scale, proportion, and environment.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, a {{breeding}} bird {{survey was conducted}} on the reservation in order to inform management of Quinebaug Woods. During the survey, a total of 37 species of birds were identified on the property including seven species listed as Massachusetts Priority Neotropical Migrant Bird Species. A male <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> was observed along the river in June 2002. It is unlikely that this state-listed, threatened warbler is breeding on the property as it was only observed on one occasion. It is more likely that this individual was an unpaired male or a late migrant. Brown-headed cowbirds were one of the few problematic or non-native species observed. These birds pose a risk to neotropical migrants in that their habit of laying their eggs in the nests of other species impacts the productivity of native, neotropical migrants. In June 2002, a Louisiana waterthrush was observed feeding an immature cowbird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} North American migratory warblers, often being one of the {{smallest}} birds in a mixed feeding flock besides kinglets or gnatcatchers. Length is 10.8 to 12.4 cm, wingspan is 16 to 18 cm and body mass is 5 to 11 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 5.1 to 6.5 cm, the tail is 3.7 to 4.5 cm, the bill is 0.8 to 1.1 cm and the tarsus is 1.5 to 1.8 cm. This species has mainly blue-gray upper parts, with a greenish back patch and two white wing bars. The breast is yellowish shading into the white belly. The summer male has bluish and rufous breast bands and prominent white eye crescents. At the end of the breeding season, individuals molt into a duller version of the breeding plumage. Females are similar-looking but tend to be duller and lack the breast bands. The unique breastband fades in males and may disappear altogether in females.|$|E

5000|$|Rogers' {{reputation}} {{among the}} British birding community was {{of someone who}} took {{the scientific study of}} birds extremely seriously, and believed that [...] "serious" [...] ornithology should take precedence over [...] "popular" [...] approaches at all times. As an illustration, following the publication in British Birds magazine of an account by Robin Chittenden of the finding of a <b>northern</b> <b>parula</b> on the Isles of Scilly in October 1983 (Chittenden 1986), in which Chittenden wrote effusively about his excitement at this find, which was then only the fourth record for Britain, Rogers wrote to the British Birds letters page criticising both Chittenden for an article consisting of [...] "60 lines full of irrelevances", and the journal's editors for [...] "letting editorial standards slip ... perhaps in an attempt to widen journal's circulation" [...] (Rogers 1987). Providing information and encouragement to casual birding visitors to Portland Bill was low on Rogers' list of priorities compared with the day-to-day running of the observatory; as a result, many birders visiting Portland for the first time felt that they were not welcome there.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{conducive to}} songbirds because of its {{northern}} location, boreal forests, mountain peaks, bodies of water and marshes.
