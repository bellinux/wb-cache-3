5|$|The move to Adidas as the NHL's uniform {{provider}} necessitated some slight {{changes in}} the Senators uniforms. While the overall design was carried over from the Reebok Edge look, the fonts <b>now</b> <b>use</b> the style that {{was found on the}} barber-pole third jerseys they wore from 2011–17.|$|E
5|$|Korean Air still flies from New York JFK International Airport to Seoul. However, {{the flight}} no longer stops at Anchorage {{as well as}} flying to Gimpo International Airport as it now flies to Incheon International Airport. Flight number 007 has been retired since, using flight numbers for two {{separate}} flights as 82 and 86. The separate flights <b>now</b> <b>use</b> an Airbus A380 and a Boeing 747-8.|$|E
5|$|Most {{thermometers}} <b>now</b> <b>use</b> pigmented alcohol {{instead of}} mercury, and galinstan alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally {{used in the}} medical field {{because they are more}} accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.|$|E

5|$|One hundred asteroids {{had been}} located by mid-1868, and in 1891 the {{introduction}} of astrophotography by Max Wolf accelerated the rate of discovery still further. A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921, 10,000 by 1981, and 100,000 by 2000. Modern asteroid survey systems <b>now</b> <b>use</b> automated means to locate new minor planets in ever-increasing quantities.|$|E
5|$|The longer {{distance}} tracks carry Regionalbahn and Regional-Express routes RE1 (Magdeburg to Eisenhüttenstadt), RE2 (Rathenow to Cottbus), RE7 (Dessau to Wünsdorf-Waldstadt) and RB14 (Nauen to Berlin Schönefeld Airport). Although most InterCity and Intercity-Express trains <b>now</b> <b>use</b> {{the north-south}} tunnel route via Hauptbahnhof, some trains do still {{remain on the}} Stadtbahn's long distance tracks. These trains, mainly those heading toward Hanover and Cologne, usually call at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs <b>now</b> <b>use</b> either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
50|$|Some of the manipulatives are <b>now</b> <b>used</b> {{in other}} {{subjects}} {{in addition to}} mathematics. For example, Cuisenaire rods are <b>now</b> <b>used</b> in language arts and grammar, and pattern blocks are used in fine arts.|$|R
50|$|The most {{noticeable}} remaining structures from the SP/IER lines are the Northbrae Tunnel, <b>now</b> <b>used</b> to extend Solano Ave eastwards, {{turning to the}} south to connect with Sutter St, and the Alameda shop building, <b>now</b> <b>used</b> by private businesses.|$|R

5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will <b>now</b> <b>use</b> 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining {{that it was an}} issue with the Steam system, and was something that the company was seeking to fix shortly. While others stated issues with co-op gameplay on the PS3, the companies stated that they were not aware of any issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter. After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could <b>now</b> <b>use</b> this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E
5|$|Only the rugby {{ground and}} the Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club <b>now</b> <b>use</b> the name Cardiff Arms Park. The rugby ground has two main stands, the North Stand and the South Stand. Both the Stands have {{terracing}} below seating. The other stands in the ground are the Westgate Street end (currently known as the Coastal Cottages Family Stand), which has rows of seating below executive boxes, plus the club shop, and the River Taff end (the Barry Nelmes Suite, named after Barry Nelmes, the former Cardiff RFC captain), which has 26 executive boxes. The rugby ground has two main entrances, the south entrance, and the Gwyn Nicholls Memorial Gates (Angel Hotel entrance), which was unveiled on 26 December 1949 in honour of the Welsh international rugby player Gwyn Nicholls. The Cardiff Athletic Clubhouse is situated {{in the corner of}} the ground between the South Stand and the Westgate Street end.|$|E

5|$|It was {{now that}} Philip applied {{the coup de}} grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks {{that he and his}} army was heading for Halos, but it seems certain that he also sent other units {{straight}} to Thermopylae. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. Philip could be certain of dictating the terms {{of the end of the}} Sacred War, since he could <b>now</b> <b>use</b> force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed him to leave, with his mercenaries, and go wherever he wished. Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} disk is removed, again while 'live'. The vdev {{that remains}} contains two 6TB disks {{and is now}} a 2-way 6TB mirror, of which 4TB is being used.
