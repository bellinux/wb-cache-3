40|$|Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) is {{proposed}} as a suitable diagnostic method {{in this paper}} for implementation on energized oil-paper insulation systems. In present FDS tests, the measurement method is only designed for offline applications. To overcome the deficiencies with the offline testing, this work investigates the feasibility of performing FDS measurements on energized transformers with the view to developing an online diagnostic tool using <b>neutral</b> <b>connections</b> as injection and measurement paths. In the proposed technique, a low-pass filter system is designed to remove the high frequency noise {{as well as the}} power frequency signals present in the measured neutral currents. The technique has been successfully applied in a laboratory environment on transformers with oil-paper insulation systems with different operational ages and is feasible for single-phase as well as 3 -phase transformers with the accessible neutral points. Compared with the conventional FDS results, a nonlinear dielectric phenomenon is observed from the energized insulation systems as higher dissipation factor TanÎ´ values primarily due to the increased losses under power frequency voltage excitation. The degree of the nonlinearity is found to correlate well with the degradation status of insulation systems under test...|$|R
40|$|A four-level {{inverter}} configuration for an {{induction motor}} is proposed in this paper. The drive {{used for this}} scheme is an open-end winding induction motor which {{can be obtained by}} separating the <b>neutral</b> <b>connections</b> of any general threephase induction motor. The proposed scheme uses two three-level inverters, with asymmetric DC link voltage, feeding the induction machine from both sides and can generate voltage space vector locations similar to a conventional seven-level inverter. The four-level scheme is based on the use of only those space vector combinations of the seven-level inverter, which generate zero common mode voltage in the machine phase voltages. The proposed four-level inverter scheme requires only two isolated DC links as compared to the conventional diode-clamped four-level inverter scheme, which needs three isolated power supplies. The common mode voltage, in the pole voltages of the proposed four-level inverter, is significantly lower than that of the conventional four-level inverter while the machine phase voltages have zero common mode content. The proposed power circuit bus structure is simple to fabricate when compared to the conventional four-level inverter. A SVPWM scheme is presented, which generates the inverter gate switching signals from sampled amplitudes of reference phase voltages. The proposed four-level inverter scheme is implemented of a 1. 5 kW open-end winding induction motor and the experimental results are presented...|$|R

30|$|The grid <b>neutral</b> wire <b>connection</b> to the {{capacitive}} divider midpoint warrants {{a more or}} less constant voltage that inhibits leakage current through the moduleâs parasitic capacitance [54]. The half H-bridge uses half of the semiconductors, which makes it simpler and less costly than the H-bridge topology [55]. However, serious disadvantages limit its use. For example, the switches need to support twice the voltage required in full H-bridge topology, the output waveform has only two levels, and the output current is so distorted that produces high electromagnetic interference emissions [54, 56]. Therefore, it needs higher blocking voltage power transistors that in turn increase the switching losses.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) analysis, {{based on}} measurement data, assumes that PD signals propagate inside a transformer winding from the PD source to the measurement points. In this paper, signals are injected via an external connection into specific {{points along the}} winding of a transformer experimental model. The measurement data obtained using radio frequency current transducers (RFCT) connected to the external bushing tap and the <b>neutral</b> to earth <b>connections</b> are illustrative of the propagation of signals inside a transformer winding. Thus, this paper reports {{on the development of}} a simulation model based on a lumped parameter network approach and compares simulation results with experimental measurements of PD signal propagation inside a high voltage transformer winding model. The physical model is an interleaved disc type winding which consists of eight sections and is modeled as having internal winding series resistances (R), inductances (L), series capacitances (K) and shunt capacitances (Cg), the model also includes the effect of their mutual inductances. The parameters are calculated using analytical calculations based on geometrical dimensions and the winding is modeled using a commercially available mathematics package. The simulation creates PD signals {{at both ends of the}} winding i. e. at terminal 1 and terminal 8, which are grounded through a small capacitive and resistive element to represent the bushing end and <b>neutral</b> to earth <b>connection</b> respectively.

40|$|AbstractâThis paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} operation of a three-phase pulsewidth modulation rectifier system formed by the star-connection of three single-phase boost rectifier modules (-Rectifier) without a mains <b>neutral</b> point <b>connection.</b> The current forming operation of the-Rectifier is analyzed and it is shown that the phase current has the same high quality and low ripple as the Vienna Rectifier. The isolated star point of-Rec-tifier results in a mutual coupling of the individual phase module outputs {{and has to be}} considered for control of the module dc link voltages. An analytical expression for the coupling coefficients of the-Rectifier phase modules is derived. Based on this expres-sion, a control concept with reduced calculation effort is designed and it provides symmetric loading of the phase modules and solves the balancing problem of the dc link voltages. The analysis also provides insight that enables the derivation of a control concept for two phase operation, such {{as in the case of}} a mains phase failure.

The basic concepts of operational modifications, blocking DC series capacitors in the lines and series resistors in the transformer <b>neutral</b> ground <b>connection</b> of wye windings and autotransformers, are introduced in Section 1, and explored in more detail in Section 2. Section 3 examines the existing systems that have introduced series capacitors in a substantial fraction of the system, specifically the Hydro Quebec system from the mid 1990 s and the WECC region in the western U.

Section 4 briefly performs a generic evaluation of the effect of neutral blocking resistors as a function of line length.
