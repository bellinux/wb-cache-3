This version was tri-current, {{as it was}} also enabled for the 1.5 kV DC system used on conventional lines in Southern France. These sets had only 8 middle cars: three 1st class cars, a restaurant car, and four 2nd class cars. Multiple trains, including sets 39, 54, 58 and 60 were converted and used for tests in France from 2001 to 2005 on the LGV Nord line. However, <b>no</b> <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> was granted for the trains in France even after the tests, the trains never entered regular cross-border service. Both the middle and power cars were rebuilt as standard P units in 2006-7.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe World-wide {{harmonized}} Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP) issued as UNECE GTR No. 15 {{is designed}} to check the emissions compliance of Light Duty Vehicles (LDVs) {{around the world and}} European Commission is planning to introduce the WLTP in the European Type Approval process starting on 1 September 2017. WLTP has greatly reduced the flexibilities that are in the NEDC procedure and has eliminated many loopholes. However a certain degree of flexibility in the test procedure is necessary, otherwise <b>no</b> <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test would be valid. In order to lower the impact of those flexibilities having influence on CO 2 emissions, a European Task Force dealing with the corrections of WLTP flexibilities was established. The work presented in this paper shows the result of the practical implementation of some corrections, such as imbalances in the state of charge (SOC) of the battery, deviations against the target road load, target speed, target distance, and target soak temperature. These corrections have been applied also to NEDC tests, in order to compare their impact with WLTP corrections. The repeatability “r” (test-to-test variations) and the reproducibility “R” (lab-to-lab variations) of CO 2 results measured in different laboratories, for the same vehicles, are evaluated before and after the normalization. In summary, all corrections steps performed in this study influenced the average CO 2 emissions by approximately 1. 3 % and 3. 8 %, for WLTP and NEDC respectively, which in our opinion is an indication of the reduction of flexibilities from NEDC to WLTP. This initial analysis {{of the impact of the}} correction on the repeatability and reproducibility of test results shows promising potential, however it must be pointed out also that in several cases the application of this methodology has led to a worsening of either r and/or R. In particular, the correction of the Road Load coefficients seems to have practical issues of difficult solutions. Further tests and analyses are needed and expected for a better understanding of this issue and for the improvement of the whole procedure...|$|E

50|$|Although all countries' <b>type</b> <b>approvals</b> {{are legally}} equivalent, {{there are real}} and {{perceived}} differences in the rigour with which the regulations and protocols are applied by different national <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> authorities. Some countries have their own national standards for granting <b>type</b> <b>approvals,</b> which may be more stringent than called for by the UN regulations themselves. Within the auto parts industry, a German (E1) <b>type</b> <b>approval,</b> for example, {{is regarded as a}} measure of insurance against suspicion of poor quality or an undeserved <b>type</b> <b>approval.</b>|$|R

All electric bikes available in Hong Kong {{fail to meet}} the <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> requirement, and the Transport Department has never granted any <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> for an electric bike, making all electric bikes effectively illegal in Hong Kong. Even if they got <b>type</b> <b>approval,</b> the driver would need a motorcycle driving license to ride. As a side note, Hong Kong doesn't have a moped vehicle class (and therefore no moped driving license), and mopeds are considered motorcycles too.|$|R

The greatest impact of this effort {{has been in the}} area of standards in the automotive sector. The EU Commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive, technical and environmental standards between all the member states. EU legislation defines the standards in the areas of noise, particle emissions and safety. In addition, the EU’s directive on <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> (EU Council Directive 92/53) eliminates the need for national <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the EU.

40|$|Real-world CO 2 {{emissions}} of passenger cars very often deviate from the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> value. The <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> value for CO 2 {{emissions of}} passenger cars {{is based on}} a chassis dynamometer test in a laboratory. The total vehicle resistance of a vehicle, or 'road load', is simulated on the chassis dynamometer to obtain representative emissions. The road load of a vehicle is determined by means of a coast down test. As a large number of parameters and external conditions influence the coast down test, the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> procedures for performing the coast down test allow for certain margins within which certain test parameters should lie. These margins can partly explain the difference between the real-world and <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> CO 2 emissions. TNO investigated the effect of variations in test parameters during the execution of a coast down test on the vehicle’s road load by performing a series of coast down measurements.
