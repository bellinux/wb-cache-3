40|$|A {{quantitative}} assay for viable Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{in ground}} beef based on immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) was developed. Bacterial cells inoculated into ground beef, were captured by immunomagnetic beads (IMB) after a 6 h <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment.</b> The percent capture of the target cells was consistent for the inoculation levels of 0. 7 to 70 colony-forming-units (CFU) /g. Captured bacteria were lysed with PCR buffer containing 0. 2 mg/mL proteinase K at 65 °C for 30 min. DNA sequences of Shiga-like toxin 1 and 2 (Stx 1 and 2) were amplified independently. Log-linear relationships were observed between CFU of E. coli O 157 :H 7 inoculated into ground beef and the integrated fluorescent image of the PCR products with Stx 1 and 2 primers after enrichment. The quantitative range was between 0. 7 to 70 CFU/g...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{flow cytometric method}} (RAPID-B™) with {{detection}} sensitivity of one viable cell of Escherichia coli serotype O 157 :H 7 in fresh spinach (Spinacia oleracea) was developed and evaluated. The major impediment to achieving this performance was mistaking autofluorescing spinach particles for tagged target cells. Following a 5  h <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment,</b> artificially inoculated samples were photobleached, using phloxine B as a photosensitizer. Samples were centrifuged at high speed to concentrate target cells, then gradient centrifuged to separate them from matrix debris. In external laboratory experiments, RAPID-B and the reference method both correctly detected E.  coli O 157 :H 7 at inoculations of ca. 15 cells. In a follow-up study, after 4 cell inoculations of positives and 6  h enrichment, RAPID-B correctly identified 92 % of 25 samples. The RAPID-B method limit of detection (LOD) was one cell in 25  g. It proved superior to the reference method (which incorporated real time-PCR, selective enrichment, and culture plating elements) in accuracy and speed...|$|E

40|$|Two {{enrichment}} {{methods for}} Listeria monocytogenes using Immuno Magnetic Separation (IMS) were tested {{to determine if}} they selected the same subtypes of isolates. Both methods used a <b>non-selective</b> primary <b>enrichment</b> and one included subculture in Fraser Broth, while the other involved direct plating of IMS beads. Sixty-two naturally contaminated watershed samples from the Central California Coast were used as a source of L. monocytogenes, and subtype diversity was measured by serotype and Multiple Number Variable Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). Three different serotypes were detected from both methods with serotype 4 b strains making up 87 % of the isolates, serotype 1 / 2 a making up 8 %, and serotype 1 / 2 b making up 5 %. The data suggest that serotype 1 / 2 a strains {{were more likely to be}} isolated from the Fraser Broth culture method. Sixty-two different MLVA types were detected and the more common MLVA types were detected by both culture methods. Forty-three MLVA types were detected only from one culture method or the other, while 19 types were detected from both culture methods. The most common MLVA type- 12 was detected in 33 of the 62 water samples, and represented 31 % of the isolates from both culture methods. This limited study provides evidence that using both enrichment culture methods allowed for detection of a greater diversity of isolates among the samples than the use of one method alone, an...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented here is to investigate presence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in turkey flocks and personnel on the respective farms. MRSA For evidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), cloaca and trachea swab samples were taken from a total of 200 turkeys and dust samples from 20 turkey houses as well as swab samples from the noses of 59 personnel on the respective farms. The investigations were conducted according to Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) guidelines based on Commission Decision 2008 / 55 /EG {{using a combination of}} <b>non-selective</b> pre-enrichment, selective <b>enrichment</b> and subsequent cultivation on a selective, chromogenic agar plate (Anon, 2008 a; BfR, 2009). The identification of genus and species was by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and mecA gene detection via real-time PCR. In conclusion, the isolate carrying the mecA gene was molecularbiologically characterised via spa and SCCmec typing. In each isolate of every identified spa type the MLST type was additionally determined. MRSA could be detected in 71. 5 % (143 from 200) of the examined turkeys in a total of 90 %(18 from 20) of the farms. In all 18 of the positive farms the dust swab samples always tested positive for MRSA. In this way testing for MRSA bacteria presence in turkey flocks can be simplified with sufficient reliability through collecting dust swab samples. 90. 2 % of the MRSApositive birds could be identified through a trachea swab sample alone. This enables identification of MRSA presence with individual birds through testing the trachea sample only. In addition to MRSA bacteria, MRS/SA (methicillin-resistant staphylococci, with exception of S. aureus) bacteria were also present on 11 of the farms. These results showed that the examined turkeys were not only substantially infected with MRSA bacteria but also – although to a clearly lesser extent – with MRS/SA bacteria. From the 59 personnel examined via nose swab sampling, 22 of them (37. 3 %) were shown to be MRSA carriers and eight (13. 5 %) to be carriers of MRS/SA. Looking at the detection of MRSA {{in the light of the}} frequency of stay in the turkey stables so was the chance of colonization with MRSA in people who were regularly in turkey stables clearly increased, compared to people, who were rarely or never in turkey stables (OR = 3. 43). MRSA isolates belonging to the sequence type ST 398 and, with that, the livestock-associated MRSA (laMRSA), were always isolated from the tested people and isolated in the majority of the cases from the tested turkeys. VRE For detecting VRE bacteria in this study, cloaca swab samples were taken from 200 living turkeys and dust swab samples from 20 turkey houses as well as nose swab samples from 59 humans. The detection of VRE bacteria was carried out using the method described by Ellerbroek et al. (2004). This combines an enrichment procedure using Chromocult® enteroccoci broth with subsequent cultivation of a selective agar supplemented with vancomycin. The identification of the enterococci took place with the help of biochemical parameters according to Ruoff et al. (2003) and real-time PCR was applied for identifying the vanA, vanB 1 / 2 / 3 and vanC 2 / 3 resistance genes. VRE bacteria could be identified in 27 % (54 from 200) of the examined turkeys in total 75 % (15 from 20) of the examined feeding farms. At 93. 3 % of the positive flocks was the pooled swab dust sample VRE-positive. The spectrum of detected VRE resistance genes was limited in the study presented here to only the vanA gene (17. 6 %, 12 from 68) and the vanC 1 gene (82. 4 %, 56 from 68). The resistance genes vanB 1 / 2 / 3 and vanC 2 / 3 which were also tested for, could not be detected in the investigations. Although VRE bacteria could be detected in a high proportion of dust samples, VRE bacteria were not isolated from the nose swab samples from any of the 59 persons sampled...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} and opportunistic pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii {{is responsible}} for severe meningitis, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates and infants associated with ingestion of contaminated powdered infant formula (PIF). The current ISO method for isolation and detection of Cronobacter spp. is laborious, time-consuming and expensive. In this study, a multiplexed lateral flow test strip was developed to rapidly detect and simultaneously serotype O 1 and O 2 C. sakazakii serotypes. The assay is based on two monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that specifically bind to the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of these pathogens. The test strip provides results very quickly; C. sakazakii could be detected in pure culture within 15 min with a sensitivity of 107 CFU/ml. After <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> for 18 h as low as one Cronobacter cell per g PIF could be detected. Moreover, the established lateral flow assay (LFA) offers excellent specificity showing no cross-reactivity with other C. sakazakii serotypes, Cronobacter species or Enterobacteriaceae tested. These characteristics, together with several advantages such as speed, simplicity in performance, low analysis cost, and no requirement of specialized skills or sophisticated equipment make the developed multiplexed LFA suitable for reliable detection and serotyping of C. sakazakii serotypes O 1 and O 2...|$|E
40|$|Very low {{cell count}} {{detection}} of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in foods is critical, since an infective dose for this pathogen {{may be only}} 10 cells, and fewer still for vulnerable populations. A flow cytometer is able to detect and count individual cells of a target bacterium, in this case E. coli O 157 :H 7. The challenge {{is to find the}} single cell in a complex matrix like raw spinach. To find that cell requires growing it as quickly as possible to a number sufficiently in excess of matrix background that identification is certain. The experimental design for this work was that of a U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) In-House Level 3 validation executed in the technology’s originating laboratory. Using <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> broth, 6. 5 h incubation at 42 °C, centrifugation for target cell concentration, and a highly selective E. coli O 157 fluorescent antibody tag, the cytometry method proved more sensitive than a reference regulatory method (p = 0. 01) for detecting a single target cell, one E. coli O 157 :H 7 cell, in 25 g of spinach.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} two enrichment broths for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{detection and}} compare results with direct plating. Methods: Swabs from 1224 patients were re-analysed for MRSA {{in a central}} laboratory (Münster) using six methods. Swabs were suspended in 0. 5 mL of <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> broth (NB) and vortexed. Aliquots of 100 mL were inoculated on/into: (I) ChromID MRSA agar; (II) Columbia sheep blood (5 %) agar (BA) and ChromID MRSA; (III, IV) NB incubated overnight followed by plating on BA and ChromID MRSA; and (V, VI) a semi-selective broth containing cefoxitin and aztreonam (TSB-SSI) incubated overnight followed by plating on BA and ChromID MRSA. In III–VI, 100 mL of the enriched broth was plated on each agar. Results: The combined MRSA-positive rate was 21. 5 %. MRSA isolates detected by each method were: TSB-SSI, n 223; NB, n 205; BA and ChromID MRSA, n 203; ChromID MRSA alone, n 183. TSB-SSI detected more positive throat samples than the comparators and significantly reduced methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) growth. The maximum sensitivity obtained was only 85 %, possibly due to the study design using pre-used swabs and dilution of swab material. For 997 samples, results from Münster were compared with initial results. Peripheral laboratories identified 172 MRSA compared with Münster where 186, 186 and 204 MRSA were found for direct plating, NB and TSB-SSI broth, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The immunomagnetic {{separation}} (IMS) is {{a technique}} {{that has been used}} to increase sensitivity and specificity and to decrease the time required for detection of Salmonella in foods through different methodologies. In this work we report on the development of a method for detection of Salmonella in chicken cuts using in house antibody-sensitized microspheres associated to conventional plating in selective agar (IMS-plating). First, protein A-coated microspheres were sensitized with polyclonal antibodies against lipopolysacharide and flagella from salmonellae and used to standardize a procedure for capturing Salmonella Enteritidis from pure cultures and detection in selective agar. Subsequently, samples of chicken meat experimentally contaminated with S. Enteritidis were analyzed immediately after contamination and after 24 h of refrigeration using three enrichment protocols. The detection limit of the IMS-plating procedure after standardization with pure culture was about 2 x 10 CFU/mL. The protocol using <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> for 6 - 8 h, selective enrichment for 16 - 18 h and a post-enrichment for 4 h gave the best results of S. Enteritidis detection by IMS-plating in experimentally contaminated meat. IMS-plating using this protocol was compared to the standard culture method for salmonellae detection in naturally contaminated chicken cuts and yielded 100 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity. The method developed using in house prepared magnetic microespheres for IMS and plating in selective agar was able to diminish by at least one day the time required for detection of Salmonella in chicken products by the conventional culture method...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four research parts: a literature review that covers Salmonella spp., {{one of the more}} prominent foodborne pathogens that represents a major risk to humans (chapter 1). Understanding the growth of Salmonella serovars and strains is an important basis for more in depth research. In this case we studied a) the aerobic and anaerobic growth responses of multiple strains from six different serovars, b) how the spent media from different serovars, more importantly S. Heidelberg, affect the growth of S. Typhimurium, and c) determined whether or not two different serovars undergo competitive interactions when they were grown together (chapter 2). Growth responses of four Salmonella serovars, Heidelberg, Kentucky, Typhimurium, and Enteritidis in enrichment and non-enrichment media were compared to determine the effectiveness of a <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> media, such as Luria Bertani broth over selective enrichment methods (chapter 3). Since antimicrobial resistance continues {{to be one of the}} major concerns about Salmonella, and consumers are demanding more natural antimicrobials we studied the effectiveness of five essential oils against Salmonella Heidelberg. Besides being one of the top five Salmonella enterica serovars associated with human infections, S. Heidelberg is the primary focus for our research (chapter 4). Given that Salmonella enterica are important facultative intracellular pathogens that are widely known to be isolated from poultry and to cause infections in humans, understanding the ability of this pathogen to attach and invade different cell types is of great importance. We studied the adhesion and invasion of four different strains to chicken macrophage (HD 11), and human epithelial (Caco- 2) cells (chapter 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Burkholderia cepacia from the environment in a regional adult cystic fibrosis (CF) care centre. Methods Two hundred and eighty-five environmental samples were taken from inpatient and outpatient environments within the CF centre. Following a <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> step, broths were plated onto a selective medium and B. cepacia isolates were confirmed by phenotypic tests and also genotypically by species specific 16 S rRNA PCR. Results B. cepacia was not detected from commonly shared items of equipment, staff hands, staff uniforms or toilets. In addition, the organism was not detected in toilet bowls, even in the B. cepacia unit. With regard to positive environments for B. cepacia, 4 / 10 (40 %) of the outside surfaces and inner rims of patients ’ plastic disposable sputum collection containers and 4 / 17 (23. 5 %) of air from patients ’ rooms, following physiotherapy, were positive. Conclusions All positive samples originated in the B. cepacia segregation area of the inpatient wards and B. cepacia was not detected in the non-cepacia area of the CF centre. Consequently, these two positive sites should therefore be treated as high risk, where organisms may be potentially transmitted from environment to patient. As there is now evidence to suggest differences in the virulence and hence clinical outcome of certain of the genomovars of this organism, this study may be important in highlighting the areas that patients who are B. cepacia positive should avoid, to minimise the risk of transmission and acquisition of this organism within the CF cepacia population. These results indicate that effective infection control procedures are required in patients ’ rooms following physiotherapy, for prevention of B. cepacia transmission and to avoid the transmission of different genomovar types within CF patients, who are already colonised with this pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} {{occurring in}} foods cause various human illnisses. Standard methods {{for the detection}} of pathogenic microorganisms are time consuming (e. g. the determination of Salmonella in a food sample takes more than 5 days). In the food industry and health service there is a demand for a rapid pathogen detection method. The aim of this work was to develop a rapid method {{for the detection of}} Salmonella in food samples. The first step of the process optimisation was the connection of non-selective pre-enrichment of bacteria and filtration. Various materials were tested for the construction of the filtration bag, which would allow to passage the bacteria into the cultivation medium {{and at the same time}} avoid releasing of food particles. Usage of a polyamide material with pores of defined size for the construction of filtration bags was not successful. Better results were obtained with materials of paper with polyethylene (used for production of tea bags), or filtration membranes of commercially produced homogenisation bags (A. E. S. Laboratoire). The cultivation time required for filtration pre-enrichment was estimated to seven hours. Optimisation of shortened cultivation procedure for Salmonella enrichment in food samples was evaluated. Both the addition of iron compounds to buffered peptone water and the growth in various selective media did not enhance the growth rate of Salmonella cells significantly. Commercial kits for the shortened enrichment of Salmonella cells did not fulfil the demand for efficacy of selectivity. Good results were obtained using a combination of shortened enrichment in buffered peptone water followed by selective cultivation in Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was chosen for the final specific detection of Salmonella. Primers were prepared according to sequences of the chromosomal gene invA and plasmid gene spvC. PCR is often inhibited by compounds from food matrices. To prevent this inhibition it is necessary to separate target bacteria or DNA from the sample. After the enrichment of bacteria from food sample the following separation methods were applied: immunomagnetic separation using anti-Salmonella Dynabeads (Dynal), two-step centrifugation, magnetic separation of DNA using Dynabeads DNA Direct (Dynal) and centrifugation on sucrose layer. Results differed according to the composition of sample food matrices. Immunomagnetic separation was not successful when applied to samples with high contents of fat and competitive microflora. Centrifugation methods provided good results for meat and egg samples. The optimised protocol including shortened <b>non-selective</b> <b>enrichment</b> in buffered peptone water, selective enrichment in Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium, two-step centrifugation and final detection by PCR was applied on real food samples. The reached sensitivity of the method were units of Salmonella cells added to 25 g of food sample. Positive determination of Salmonella occurrence in entrails of infected animals was achieved by this method. Real-time fluorescence PCR was used for determination of Salmonella in samples of minced meat and chicken carcass rinse. The efficacy of four separation methods for sample pre-treatment before PCR was compared: gradient centrifugation using BactxtractorTM solution (Quintessence Research AB), magnetic separation of DNA using Dynabeads DNA Direct (Dynal), DNA isolation by DNeasyTM Tissue kit (Qiagen) and the combination of BactxtractorTM with DNeasyTM Tissue kit. BactxtractorTM and DNeasyTM Tissue kit provided reproducible results with the required sensitivity. Results obtained during this work can be exploited for the automation of food pathogen detection by PCR.
