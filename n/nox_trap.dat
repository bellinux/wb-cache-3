This reduction may be conducted by use of selective Catalytic reduction catalyst (SCR) which required feed of ammonia precursor or by use of Lean <b>NOx</b> <b>Trap</b> (LNT) which contains expensive precious metals. Another option is the use a reactor with LNT catalyst followed by one with SCR to avoid the need to inject ammonia precursors.

50|$|Reduction in NOx {{emissions}} from compression-ignition engines {{has previously been}} addressed {{by the addition of}} exhaust gas to incoming air charge, known as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). In 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet new federal emissions requirements. There are two techniques that have been developed for the catalytic reduction of NOx emissions under lean exhaust conditions: selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> or NOx adsorber. Instead of precious metal-containing NOx absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a reagent such as ammonia to reduce the NOx into nitrogen. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of urea into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia. One trademark product of urea solution, also referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), is AdBlue.|$|E
40|$|Large-bore {{natural gas}} engines {{are used for}} {{distributed}} energy and gas compression since natural gas fuel offers a convenient and reliable fuel source via the natural gas pipeline and distribution infrastructure. Lean engines enable better fuel efficiency and lower operating costs; however, NOx emissions from lean engines are difficult to control. Technologies that reduce NOx in lean exhaust are desired to enable broader use of efficient lean engines. Lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts have demonstrated greater than 90 % NOx reduction in lean exhaust from engines operating with gasoline, diesel, and natural gas fuels. In addition to the clean nature of the technology, lean NOx traps reduce NOx with the fuel source of the engine thereby eliminating the requirement for storage and handling of secondary fuels or reducing agents. A study of lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts for lean natural gas engines is presented here. Testing was performed on a Cummins C 8. 3 G (CG- 280) engine on a motor dynamometer. Lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts were tested for NOx reduction performance under various engine operating conditions, and the utilization of natural gas as the reductant fuel source was characterized. Engine test results show that temperature greatly affects the catalytic processes involved, specifically methane oxidation and NOx storage on the lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap.</b> Additional studies on a bench flow reactor demonstrate the effect of precious metal loading (a primary cost factor) on lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> performance at different temperatures.

It is shown that both methods are able to detect the different catalyst loading states. However, the sensitivity of the microwave-based method turned out to be small compared to that previously observed for other exhaust aftertreatment devices. This may limit the practical applicability of the microwave-based NOx loading detection in lean <b>NOx</b> <b>traps...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{drive to}} develop a NOx sensor comes from {{environmental}} factors. NOx gases can cause various problems such as smog and acid rain. Many governments {{around the world have}} passed laws to limit their emissions (along with other combustion gases such as SOx (oxides of sulfur), CO (carbon monoxide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) and hydrocarbons). Companies have realized that one way of minimizing NOx emissions is to first detect them and then employ some sort of feedback loop in the combustion process, minimizing NOx production by, for example, combustion optimization or regeneration of <b>NOx</b> <b>traps.</b>|$|R
40|$|The diesel engine, {{because of}} its {{superior}} fuel economy compared with spark ignition engines, has attracted considerable attention. Significant improvement in their performance and engine emissions has been achieved. The use of various advanced internal measures has resulted in significant reduction of pollutant emissions inside the combustion chamber. Nevertheless, considering the increasingly restrictive 'engine-out' emission standards to be adopted, {{it appears that the}} use of air throttling systems is possibly inevitable {{in order to meet the}} future limits. This is because NOx and soot emissions are usually affected in the opposite way from the various internal measures. However, the use of conventional air throttling systems in DI diesel engines is not possible owing to the lean nature of diesel combustion, which does not permit the use of catalysts for controlling NOx emissions. Currently, alternative solutions are proposed focusing on the use of a selective catalytic reduction system, requiring a carefully controlled injection of urea or <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (adsorbers) When the storage capacity of the trap is reached, during normal lean operation, the engine must switch to rich operation in order to produce the necessary reducing agents, that is, CO and H 2, which release the stored NO, to react with CO in a catalyst to finally form N,. In this work, an extended computational investigation has been conducted to examine various strategies for achieving rich combustion in diesel engines. Rich diesel combustion has recently attracted attention for the regeneration of <b>NOx</b> <b>traps.</b> Rich combustion can be achieved using either internal or external measures, (fuel injection at the exhaust manifold). Rich operation is expected to have a negative impact on engine performance and emissions resulting in an increase of brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc), soot and exhaust gas temperature. For this reason, in this work, various strategies are examined for achieving rich combustion using internal measures, namely intake air throttling or/and waste gate operation, EGR and late post injection. The investigation was conducted on a heavy-duty DI diesel engine, using a phenomenological simulation code that is based on a multizone combustion model. Information is provided concerning the impact of the various rich strategies examined on engine performance and emissions. This enables us to estimate the most appropriate one. Using this information, we established a combination of strategies to achieve the lowest possible A value with acceptable overall fuel and soot penalties.

40|$|Presented is a {{nonlinear}} {{model of}} a, lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> with applications to diagnostics {{and to a}} lean burn engine control strategy for purging NO x from a trap. A lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> purging strategy is proposed based on a fundamental understanding of trap behavior and {{a model of the}} propagating transient reductant front through the trap during purge. ^ Purging a lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> of NOx emissions is challenging for several reasons. First, the engine air/fuel ratio must be controlled such that lean and rich operation are possible. Secondly, spark ignition engine torque changes with air/fuel ratio. Therefore, engine torque control is necessary for lean burn applications. Thirdly, the engine a. ir/fuel ratio purge profile, which determines the rich exhaust gas profile used to purge the lean NO x trap, must accomplish two goals. The profile must be designed such that the fuel economy penalty, during purge, is minimized to ensure the overall fuel economy during both lean and rich operation is maximized. In addition, the purge profile must send reductant to reduce NOx and oxygen stored in the trap without excessive tailpipe emissions. The focus of this work is the development of a lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> model to be used in conjunction with a model based purge profile which meets the aforementioned goals. ^ The purge profile proposed in this work is based on the development of a nonlinear lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> purge model. The model includes critical purging phenomena such as NOx storage and release dynamics, NO x and oxygen reduction dynamics, and includes an on-line stored oxygen estimate. A first principle based chemical model describing the reduction of NOx during purge forms the fundamental lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> purge model. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are considered the most effective reductants and a method of estimating exhaust gas hydrogen content downstream of a catalyst is presented. Validation of the NOx purge model is achieved through engine dynamometer experiments. ...|$|E

In this paper the real world emissions from a substantial sample of the latest Euro 6 diesel passenger cars are presented {{with a focus on}} NOx and primary NO 2. Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) data is analysed from 39 Euro 6 diesel passenger cars over a test route comprised of urban and motorway sections. The sample includes vehicles installed with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT), or selective catalytic reduction (SCR).

The average fraction primary NO 2 (fNO 2) is 44 (sd. 20) %. Higher emissions during the urban section of the route are attributed to an increased number of acceleration events. Comparisons between PEMS measurements and COPERT speed dependent emissions factors show PEMS measurements to be on average 1. 6 times higher than COPERT estimates for NOx and 2. 5 times for NO 2.

First part focuses on the sulfur poisoning issues in ceria based three-way catalysts employed in gasoline engines. Second part concentrates on the efficiency of NOx storage phase in BaO-Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the lean burn diesel engines. ^ Species formed upon SO 2 poisoning on ceria and zirconia modified ceria were characterized theoretically and experimentally under different poisoning conditions. Surface and bulk Ce 2 (SO 4) 3, Ce(SO 4) 2, Ce 2 O 2 S could form depending on poisoning temperature and SO 2 /O 2 fugacity. Their influence on the Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC) of the catalysts and the related deactivation mechanism for Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction have also been investigated thoroughly in a simulated pulse reactor. Basically, the redox (reduce-oxidize) cycle of the TWC was blocked by the formation of Ce 2 O 2 S under reducing condition, which is hard to be reoxidized by either H 2 O or CO 2. ^ Additionally, the influence of various BaO*Al 2 O 3 structures on the <b>NOx</b> <b>trapping</b> capacity was studied using XRD, TPD and FTIR techniques. Different than pure barium oxide, the BaAl 2 O 4 shows interesting NO 2 trapping properties by blocking the formation of carbonate in the catalysts. ...|$|R

The objective of this work is to give additional insight into HT technology. In the industrial research laboratory, HT screening has matured to become a reliable approach for rapid screening of both reaction parameter spaces, as well as material properties relevant for exhaust gas catalyst development.

40|$|The {{demanding}} {{legislation for}} vehicle emissions pushes {{the automotive industry}} to the commercialization of advanced exhaust systems. The careful design of each aftertreatment device fitted in exhaust line and the interactions with the engine management, makes modelling {{an important part of}} systems engineering for these applications. Almost all catalytic converter models that are found in the literature use tunable parameters which typically address the kinetic terms of chemical reactions. A great effort has been given to the definition of complex reaction schemes and mechanistic description of them in-vitro, in order to assist the advanced design of catalytic washcoats and explain their complex chemistry. This paper presents a systematic effort towards the modelling of advanced commercial exhaust treatment systems, using a unified approach for the different devices. The model used in this work describes the catalytic processes with global reactions, using apparent Arrhenius type rate expressions with L-H kinetics. The model is used to predict transient performance of commercial catalytic converters under legislated test conditions. During these tests the existing uncertainties and intrinsic variations of engine and catalyst operation make the robustness and flexibility of the model prominent targets. Comparison of computed and measured second-by-second emissions demonstrate a high level of modelling accuracy, adequate to fit the behavior of advanced commercial applications of three-way catalytic converters and <b>NOx</b> <b>traps,</b> using a minimum set of 3 tunable parameters for each device.

40|$|NO {{oxidation}} catalysts {{are used in}} conjunction with NOx adsorbents to remove toxic nitrogen oxides from combustion effluents that lack CO and residual hydrocarbons as reductants. Efficient <b>NOx</b> <b>trapping</b> strategies require detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for NO oxidation and for NOx adsorption, which are investigated here by kinetic, isotopic, and spectroscopic methods. NO oxidation rates on Pt, PdO, RhO 2, and Co 3 O 4 catalysts increase linearly with O 2 and NO pressures and are inhibited by NO 2, consistent with a kinetically-relevant NO oxidation step that requires the reaction of O 2 with vacancies (*) on active sites nearly saturated with oxygen atoms (O*). Equilibrated reactions between catalyst surfaces and NO and NO 2 molecules establish the concentration of oxygen vacancies during NO oxidation. Measurements of 16 O 2 - 18 O 2 exchange rates are used to confirm and to further investigate the O¬ 2 activation steps proposed for NO oxidation. NO oxidation rates on all catalysts are markedly higher on large metal and oxide clusters that bind oxygen more weakly than small clusters; consequently, oxygen vacancies become more abundant as cluster size increases. Both RhO 2 and Co 3 O 4 undergo one-electron reductions to intermediate oxidation states (Rh 2 O 3 and CoO) when vacancies form during NO oxidation, which allows both Rh and Co oxides to effectively catalyze NO oxidation. The pervasive NO 2 inhibition of NO oxidation turnovers leads to synergistic effects between NOx adsorbents and NO {{oxidation catalysts}}. NO oxidation rates are much higher when NO 2 adsorption sites are present to bind NO 2 as it forms on catalyst sites, and NO oxidation rates depend critically on the rate of NO 2 adsorption on oxide substrates. NOx adsorption on BaO-containing solids leads to nitrites (NO 2 -) and nitrates (NO 3 -). The formation of nitrites on BaO/Al 2 O 3 requires vicinal co-adsorption of NO and NO 2 to displace carbonates that form during exposure to CO 2 in combustion effluent. NO and NO 2 bind rapidly as nitrite, but NOx uptakes as nitrite are limited in CO 2 -rich streams by thermodynamics that result in most binding sites being occupied with carbonate at high CO 2 /NOx ratios. Nitrates are more stable, and their formation is required to achieve large NOx uptakes from combustion effluent. The conversion of nitrites to nitrates, however, requires N 2 O 4 molecules as oxidants that form slowly by non-activated homogeneous NO 2 dimerization reactions, consistent with nitrate formation rates that increase with (NO 2) 2 and are independent of adsorbate coverage. Pt clusters present in close proximity to nitrite-saturated BaO domains provide a catalytic route for the formation of N 2 O 4 that reacts subsequently with nitrites. These elementary steps lead to nitrate formation rates on BaO/Pt/Al 2 O 3 that are inhibited by NO and are proportional to NO 2 pressure and the coverage of unreacted nitrites. The results herein identify the physical limitations of oxidation catalysts and NOx adsorbents that are used for <b>NOx</b> <b>trapping</b> and provide new opportunities for optimizing NOx storage materials by exploiting previously unrecognized synergies between the catalyst and adsorbent components...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of CO 2 and H 2 O on NOx storage and {{reduction}} over a Pt–Ba/¿-Al 2 O 3 (1 wt. % Pt and 30 wt. % Ba) catalyst is shown. The experimental results reveal that {{in the presence of}} CO 2 and H 2 O, NOx is stored on BaCO 3 sites only. Moreover, H 2 O inhibits the NO oxidation capability of the catalyst and no NO 2 formation is observed. Only 16 % of the total barium is utilized in NO storage. The rich phase shows 95 % selectivity towards N 2 as well as complete regeneration of stored NO. In the presence of CO 2, NO is oxidized into NO 2 and more NOx is stored as in the presence of H 2 O, resulting in 30 % barium utilization. Bulk barium sites are inactive in <b>NOx</b> <b>trapping</b> in the presence of CO 2 ·NH 3 formation is seen in the rich phase and the selectivity towards N 2 is 83 %. Ba(NO 3) 2 is always completely regenerated during the subsequent rich phase. In the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O, both surface and bulk barium sites are active in NOx storage. As lean/rich cycling proceeds, the selectivity towards N 2 in the rich phase decreases from 82 % to 47 % and the N balance for successive lean/rich cycles shows incomplete regeneration of the catalyst.

40|$|Distributed {{energy is}} an {{approach}} for meeting energy needs that has several advantages. Distributed energy improves energy security during natural disasters or terrorist actions, improves transmission grid reliability by reducing grid load, and enhances power quality through voltage support and reactive power. In addition, distributed energy can be efficient since transmission losses are minimized. One prime mover for distributed energy {{is the natural}} gas reciprocating engine generator set. Natural gas reciprocating engines are flexible and scalable solutions for many distributed energy needs. The engines can be run continuously or occasionally as peak demand requires, and their operation and maintenance is straightforward. Furthermore, system efficiencies can be maximized when natural gas reciprocating engines are combined with thermal energy recovery for cooling, heating, and power applications. Expansion of natural gas reciprocating engines for distributed energy is dependent on several factors, but two prominent factors are efficiency and emissions. Efficiencies must be high enough to enable low operating costs, and emissions must be low enough to permit significant operation hours, especially in non-attainment areas where emissions are stringently regulated. To address these issues the U. S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission launched research and development programs called Advanced Reciprocating Engine Systems (ARES) and Advanced Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (ARICE), respectively. Fuel efficiency and low emissions are two primary goals of these programs. The work presented here {{was funded by the}} ARES program and, thus, addresses the ARES 2010 goals of 50 % thermal efficiency (fuel efficiency) and < 0. 1 g/bhp-hr emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). A summary of the goals for the ARES program is given in Table 1 - 1. ARICE 2007 goals are 45 % thermal efficiency and < 0. 015 g/bhp-hr NOx. Several approaches for improving the efficiency and emissions of natural gas reciprocating engines are being pursued. Approaches include: stoichiometric engine operation with exhaust gas recirculation and three-way catalysis, advanced combustion modes such as homogeneous charge compression ignition, and extension of the lean combustion limit with advanced ignition concepts and/or hydrogen mixing. The research presented here addresses the technical approach of combining efficient lean spark-ignited natural gas combustion with low emissions obtained from a lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalyst aftertreatment system. This approach can be applied to current lean engine technology or advanced lean engines that may result from related efforts in lean limit extension. Furthermore, the lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> technology has synergy with hydrogen-assisted lean limit extension since hydrogen is produced from natural gas during the lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalyst system process. The approach is also applicable to other lean engines such as diesel engines, natural gas turbines, and lean gasoline engines; other research activities have focused on those applications. Some commercialization of the technology has occurred for automotive applications (both diesel and lean gasoline engine vehicles) and natural gas turbines for stationary power. The research here specifically addresses barriers to commercialization of the technology for large lean natural gas reciprocating engines for stationary power. The report presented here is a comprehensive collection of research conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysis for lean natural gas reciprocating engines. The research was performed in the Department of Energy's ARES program from 2003 to 2007 and covers several aspects of the technology. All studies were conducted at ORNL on a Cummins C 8. 3 G+ natural gas engine chosen based on industry input to simulate large lean natural gas engines. Specific technical areas addressed by the research include: NOx reduction efficiency, partial oxidation and reforming chemistry, and the effects of sulfur poisons on the partial oxidation, reformer, and lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts. The initial work on NOx reduction efficiency demonstrated that NOx emissions < 0. 1 g/bhp-hr (the ARES goal) can be achieved with the lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalyst technology.

Such transformations of the barium species are found to significantly promote NO(x) uptake from 250 to 450 C.

40|$|Lean <b>NOx</b> <b>Traps</b> (LNT), {{a leading}} {{automotive}} NOx abatement technology, {{have been under}} intense investigation from industry and academia {{for the past two}} decades. This work presents the results of our reaction experiments which simulate the cyclic exhaust conditions over monolithic Lean <b>NOx</b> <b>Traps</b> (LNT) samples, providing overall performance data, and in situ Diffuse Reflectance Infra-red Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies which provide information about the surface chemistry. Insights from these data, when combined, have enabled conception of physico-chemical models of the NOx storage-reduction processes upon which our mathematical models of trap performance are based. ^ A set of seven LNT formulations with 0. 6 – 6. 3 wt. % Pt and 4 – 20 wt. % Ba on Al 2 O 3 were investigated for their NO x trapping abilities at 300 °C, 30000 hr− 1. It was found that the initial complete NOx storage ability of the traps depends on the proximity of Ba to Pt and thus on the Pt, Ba loading and dispersion. It was also concluded that the NOx storage occurs via two parallel pathways—(1) using the spilled over oxygen as the oxidant for nitrate formation on Ba vicinal to Pt (fast route) and (2) using NO 2 itself as the oxidant via the disproportionation reaction on the remaining Ba sites (slow route). The NO 2 disproportionation rate was also found to be susceptible to the NO 2 partial pressure over the <b>trap,</b> rendering <b>NOx</b> storage less efficient when NO + O 2 was used as the NOx source vs. NO 2 + O 2. DRIFTS showed that bulk-like nitrates were formed on samples with 20 wt. % Ba but existed primarily in the form of surface nitrates on 8 and 4 wt. % Ba samples. Furthermore, the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O in the lean-rich feed led to competitive adsorption on Ba and led to formation of carbonates (20 wt. % Ba) /carboxylates (8 and 4 wt. % Ba), hydroxides and nitrates. In addition, presence of water was found to cause agglomeration of the highly dispersed Ba phase on 8 and 4 wt. % Ba. A phenomenological model was developed to explain all these observed effects on the variety of LNTs. The insights gained from the NOx storage experiments allowed us to speculate that having higher Pt loading near the inlet of the monoliths and lower loadings downstream might prove to be a formulation with higher trapping efficiency and lower cost as compared to the traps with constant Pt loadings across the monolith channel length. ^ Regeneration was studied between 150 – 300 °C with H 2 as a model reductant. At 30000 hr− 1, the regeneration was found to be H-atom feed rate limited. It was observed that NH 3 was as good a reductant as H 2 and was found that ammonia actually played the role of an intermediate during regeneration with H 2. H 2 O or CO 2 did not have any significant impact on the regeneration mechanism. A ‘plug flow’ (moving front) model for regeneration was proposed and based on this mechanism it was concluded that to achieve maximum selectivity towards N 2, an incomplete regeneration of the trap was needed since NH 3 escaped only in the absence of NOx downstream of the reductant front. ^ In summary, the fundamental knowledge gained from the experiments could be extended to formulation of more efficient and cheaper LNT systems and optimum strategies for their operation in addition to being used as the building block for a mathematical model of the process.

40|$|An {{independent}} controller {{was proposed}} to perform real-time diagnosis and modeling based control for diesel aftertreatment devices, {{such as the}} diesel particulate filters (DPF) and the lean <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT). The diesel aftertreatment devices for this research were in active flow control configuration. As opposed to passive aftertreatment control where the engine tailors the raw exhaust conditions, in active aftertreatment configuration, the raw exhaust conditions were modified with independent controls, such as aftertreatment temperature control, exhaust flow control, and aftertreatment excess air/fuel ratio (A) control. The determination of the diesel engine transient exhaust gas temperature is essential for effective active flow aftertreatment control schemes. To overcome the slow response of the high-inertia thermocouples used in the harsh diesel exhaust environment, a temperature response model was developed {{as part of this}} research. The temperature response model was verified by tests conducted on a Yanmar NFD 170 single cylinder diesel engine setup. The model was then implemented into a National Instrument PCI- 6023 E multifunction data acquisition board with LabVIEW. The LabVIEW program was tested on the Yanmar engine setup and was capable of estimating the transient exhaust gas temperature in real-time using the temperature data obtained from two high-inertia thermocouples with a proper diameter ratio. The simplified transient aftertreatment model representing the regeneration behavior of the DPF and the performance of the LNT were also proposed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Sulfur {{poisoning}} and regeneration of lean <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> {{were investigated}} using experiments and kinetic modeling. A commercial Pt, Rh and barium containing NOx storage catalyst was used. The catalyst also contained oxygen storage material. First the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was investigated using steps with oxygen and hydrogen. The OSC was substantial {{with a total}} use of all hydrogen (1 %) for about 20 s. The results were similar at the three investigated temperatures (300, 400 and 500 degrees C), indicating {{that it is a}} low activation barrier connected with the process. Further, no effect was observed when adding 15 ppm SO 2 to the feed. Since no SO 2 was observed in the outlet it is possible that SO 2 is adsorbed during the lean period and then reduced to form H 2 S in the rich period (not measured). Further, the NOx storage was found to decrease during SO 2 exposure, and the decrease was linear and dose dependent. In addition, we investigated different regeneration strategies. When using 500 ppm H- 2 for 60 min at 700 degrees C the regeneration was poor. However, when adding 5 % CO 2 to the 500 ppm H- 2 the regeneration was increased drastically. Further, the regeneration was decreased when decreasing the temperature to 600 degrees C, and further decreased when using 500 degrees C. In addition, it was beneficial with increasing the hydrogen concentration. The kinetic model contains three sub-models; (i) NOx storage and regeneration, (ii) oxygen storage and reduction and (iii) sulfur poisoning and sulfur regeneration. It was crucial to add NOx storage on two sites; barium and alumina. The NOx adsorbed on alumina is more loosely bound. Further, in the model formation of sulfates were added on both components. This was important in order to describe the rate of the sulfur deactivation. If sulfur was adsorbed only on barium the deactivation would have been too rapid. The model could describe the experimental features well...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> (LNT) and Selective Catalytic Reduction {{catalysts}} (SCR) are {{two leading}} candidates for Diesel NOx after-treatment. Each technology exhibits good properties to reduce efficiently Diesel NOx emissions {{in order to}} match the forthcoming EURO 6 standards. NOx reduction in LNT is made through a two-step process. In normal (lean) mode, Diesel engine exhausts NOx is stored into the NOx trap; then when necessary the engine runs rich during limited time to treat the stored NOx. This operating mode has the benefit of using onboard fuel as NOx reducer. But <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> solution is restrained by limited active temperature windows. On the other hand, NH 3 -SCR catalysts operate in {{a wider range of}} temperature and do not contain precious metals. However, NH 3 -SCR systems traditionally use urea-water solution as reducing agent, requiring thus additional infrastructure to supply the vehicles with enough reducer. These pros and cons are quite restrictive in classical LNT or NH 3 -SCR architecture. The present paper presents an after-treatment architecture combining a <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> and a passive NH 3 -SCR. Synergy of the two systems is possible if the SCR takes advantage of the LNT ability to produce Ammonia (NH 3). Indeed, during the rich phases (purges), small amounts of Ammonia are formed as by-product, which can be used in the downstream catalyst as the NOx reducing agent. A major difficulty to operate the proposed architecture is the real-time management of the NOx purge: for future control and diagnosis applications, it is crucial to have accurate but low-complexity models. A complete reduced model of the physicochemical phenomena involved is proposed in the present paper. Based on simplified chemical assumptions and time scale separation, the latter is suitable for on-board diagnostics and model-based control. Validation has been achieved through extensive experiments...|$|E
40|$|Lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> (LNT) {{catalysts}} {{represent a}} promising approach to meet increasingly stringent NOx emission regulations on diesel and other lean-burn engines. Pt material properties, including dispersion and particle size, {{are known to}} be important factors in determining NOx uptake performance, since Pt provides active sites for NO oxidation to NO 2 necessary for storing NOx as nitrates, and for the reduction of nitrates to N- 2. In this work, the physicochemical properties of Pt in Pt-BaO/Al 2 O 3 LNT catalysts, such as the Pt accessible surface area and particle size, were investigated by using various tools, such as irreversible volumetric H- 2 chemisorption, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), following successive reductive treatments at elevated temperatures. NOx uptake activities were also measured to establish a relationship between the properties of Pt and NOx storage following identical high-temperature reductive treatments. We find that the reductive treatments of Pt-BaO/Al 2 O 3 lean <b>NOx</b> <b>trap</b> catalysts at temperatures up to 500 degrees C promote a significant increase in NOx uptake explained, in part, by an induced close interaction between Pt and BaO phases in the catalyst, thus enabling facilitation of the NOx storage process.

The catalyst samples are located in series in a nearly isothermal lab mini-reactor. Dynamic behavior {{of the system is}} examined in periodic lean/rich operation at different temperatures.

40|$|Sulfur {{poisoning}} from {{engine fuel}} and lube {{is one of}} the most recognizable degradation mechanisms of a NOx adsorber catalyst system for diesel emission reduction. Even with the availability of 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel, NOx adsorber will be deactivated without an effective sulfur management. Two general pathways are currently being explored for sulfur management: (1) the use of a disposable SOx trap that can be replaced or rejuvenated offline periodically, and (2) the use of diesel fuel injection in the exhaust and high temperature de-sulfation approach to remove the sulfur poisons to recover the <b>NOx</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency. The major concern of the de-sulfation process is the many prolonged high temperature rich cycles that catalyst will encounter during its useful life. It is shown that NOx adsorber catalyst suffers some loss of its trapping capacity upon high temperature lean-rich exposure. With the use of a disposable SOx trap to remove large portion of the sulfur poisons from the exhaust, the NOx adsorber catalyst can be protected and the numbers of de-sulfation events can be greatly reduced. Spectroscopic techniques, such as DRIFTS and Raman, have been used to monitor the underlying chemical reactions during NOx trapping/ regeneration and de-sulfation periods, and provide a fundamental understanding of NOx storage capacity and catalyst degradation mechanism using model catalysts. This paper examines the sulfur effect on two model NOx adsorber catalysts. The chemistry of SOx/base metal oxides and the sulfation product pathways and their corresponding spectroscopic data are discussed. SAE Paper SAE- 2003 - 01 - 3245 {copyright} 2003 SAE International.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{heavy-duty vehicle}} emission regulations are prompting {{the use of}} PM and NOx aftertreatment systems in the US, the EU and Japan. In the US, the EPA Highway Diesel Rule, which will be fully implemented in 2010, has stimulated debate over whether urea selective catalytic reduction (urea-SCR) or lean <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> (LNT) are the better NOx aftertreatment approach for meeting this new standard. And, if urea-SCR is indeed the preferred option, how can its compliance and infrastructure challenges be overcome during the relatively short window of time between now and 2010. This thesis begins by performing a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of urea-SCR and LNT aftertreatment to determine which technology is more appropriate for use in heavy-duty vehicles and how sensitive that judgment is to changes in key variables, such {{as the price of}} urea. The focus then shifts to an exploration of the various compliance and infrastructure challenges associated with urea-SCR, namely the need to have a replenishable supply of urea. In particular, the actions and policies necessary to surmount those obstacles are discussed. Next, the policies and market factors that {{played a role in the}} EU's successful introduction of urea-SCR are examined and assessed for their ability to be applied in the US context. Finally, the long-term viability of urea-SCR is appraised through an investigation of the potential for competing emission control technologies to emerge and the prospect that urea-SCR becomes adopted by the light-duty diesel market. This thesis concludes by offering both a prognosis for what can be expected to occur between now and 2010, given the current course of action, as well as policy recommendations for how that trajectory might be corrected, such that the introduction of urea-SCR in 2010 is achieved with the maximum air quality benefit at the lowest cost. by Kristian M.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The internal combustion engine has been under considerable pressure {{during the last few}} years. The publics growing sensitivity for emissions and resource wastage have led to increasingly stringent legislation. Engine manufacturers need to invest significant monetary funds and engineering resources {{in order to meet the}} designated regulations. In recent years, reductions in emissions and fuel consumption could be achieved with advanced engine technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), variable geometry turbines (VGT), variable valve trains (VVT), variable compression ratios (VCR) or extended aftertreatment systems such as diesel particulate filters (DPF) or <b>NOx</b> <b>traps</b> or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) implementations. These approaches are characterised by a highly non-linear behaviour with an increasing demand for close-loop control. In consequence, successful controller design becomes an important part of meeting legislation requirements and acceptable standards. At the same time, the close-loop control requires additional monitoring information and, especially in the field of combustion control, this is a challenging task. Existing sensors in heavy-duty diesel applications for incylinder pressure detection enable the feedback of combustion conditions. However, high maintenance costs and reliability issues currently cancel this method out for mass-production vehicles. Methods of in-cylinder condition reconstruction for real-time applications have been presented over the last few decades. The methodical restrictions of these approaches are proving problematic. Hence, this work presents a method utilising artificial neural networks for the prediction of combustion-related engine parameters. The application of networks for the prediction of parameters such as emission formations of NOx and Particulate Matters will be shown initially. This thesis shows the importance of correct training and validation data choice together with a comprehensive network input set. In addition, an application of an efficient and accurate plant model as a support tool for an engine fuel-path controller is presented together with an efficient test data generation method. From these findings, an artificial neural network structure is developed for the prediction of in-cylinder combustion conditions. In-cylinder pressure and temperature provide valuable information about the combustion efficiency and quality. This work presents a structure that can predict these parameters from other more simple measurable variables within the engine auxiliaries. The structure is tested on data generated from a GT-Power simulation model and with a Caterpillar C 6. 6 heavy-duty diesel engine...|$|R
