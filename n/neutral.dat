Both <b>neutrals</b> and ions are found to accelerate for a short interval immediately after ablation, which is attributed to internal Coulomb forces which create electrostatic potentials resulting in the charged particle acceleration. This process is further enhanced by laser-plasma energy coupling.

5|$|The <b>neutral</b> {{theory of}} {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of <b>neutral</b> mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the <b>neutral</b> theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly <b>neutral</b> theory, where a mutation that would be effectively <b>neutral</b> in a small population is not necessarily <b>neutral</b> in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of deuterium <b>neutrals</b> in the divertor chamber of tokamaks and their dynamics {{play a key role}} in achieving detached divertor conditions, the mode of operation foreseen in ITER, and in enabling particle (density) control via pumping. In present tokamaks, <b>neutrals</b> due to recycling of plasma ions at plasma-facing components are also one of the main sources of particles in the core plasma, and thus considered to impact the pedestal density and to lead to power losses in the core due to charge exchange with plasma ions. The physical divertor geometry and plasma configuration are key parameters in confining <b>neutrals</b> within the divertor. In particular, vertical target (VT) configurations are considered to better confine <b>neutrals</b> than horizontal configurations as recycling <b>neutrals</b> are preferentially released in the direction of the separatrix and private flux region...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{generation}} through vapor breakdown during ablation of a Si target by nanosecond KrF laser pulses {{is modeled}} using 0 -dimensional rate equations. Although {{there is some}} previous work on vapor breakdown by microsecond laser pulses, {{there have been no}} attempts made on vapor breakdown by nanosecond laser pulses. This work intends to fill the gap. A kinetic model is developed considering following factors: (1) two temperatures of both electrons and heavy-body particles (ions, <b>neutrals,</b> and excited states of <b>neutrals),</b> (2) absorption mechanisms of laser energy include inverse bremstrahlung (IB) processes and photoionization of excited states, (3) ionization acceleration mechanisms included are electron-impact excitation of ground state <b>neutrals,</b> electron-impact ionization of exited states of <b>neutrals,</b> photoionization of excited states of <b>neutrals,</b> and all necessary reverse processes. The rates of various processes considered are calculated according to the formula given by Zel`dovich and Raizer. The authors use a second order predictor-corrector numerical scheme for iterations of the rate equations. The rate equations are solved for five quantities, namely, densities of electrons, <b>neutrals,</b> and excited states of <b>neutrals,</b> and the temperatures of electrons and heavy-body particles. The total breakdown times (sum of evaporation time and vapor breakdown time) at different energy fluences are then calculated. The results are compared with experimental observations of Si target ablation using a KrF laser. A more detailed description of the model and the results will be published later...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a <b>neutral</b> pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a <b>neutral</b> pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain <b>neutral</b> unless the Soviet Union attacked them first.

The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the <b>neutral</b> Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a <b>neutral</b> party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti.

5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain <b>neutral</b> proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily <b>neutral.</b> Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and <b>neutral</b> proposal, or an offer and a <b>neutral</b> proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a <b>neutral</b> port; largely because no <b>neutral</b> port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{overshooting}} convective motions in {{the solar}} photosphere are frequently proposed as the source for the excitation of Alfvén waves. However, the photosphere is a) very weakly ionized, and, b) {{the dynamics of the}} plasma particles in this region is heavily influenced by the plasma-neutral collisions. The purpose of this work is to check the consequences of these two facts on the above scenario and their effects on the electromagnetic waves. It is shown that the ions and electrons in the photosphere are both un-magnetized; their collision frequency with <b>neutrals</b> is much larger than the gyrofrequency. This implies that eventual Alfvén-type electromagnetic perturbations must involve the <b>neutrals</b> as well. This has the following serious consequences: i) in the presence of perturbations, the whole fluid (plasma + <b>neutrals)</b> moves; ii) the Alfvén velocity includes the total (plasma + <b>neutrals)</b> density and is thus considerably smaller compared to the collision-less case; iii) the perturbed velocity of a unit volume, which now includes both plasma and <b>neutrals,</b> becomes much smaller compared to the ideal (collision-less) case; and iv) the corresponding wave energy flux for the given parameters becomes much smaller compared to the ideal case. 1...|$|R
