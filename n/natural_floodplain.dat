500|$|Proposals by {{agencies}} such as Metro, the regional government of the Portland metropolitan area, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1970s and 1980s to control Johnson Creek flooding were abandoned after groups of residents objected to every proposal. In 1990, the City of Portland formed the Johnson Creek Corridor Committee from multiple agencies and citizen groups with varied interests related to the watershed. Led by the city's Bureau of Environmental Services, the combined groups in 2001 produced the Johnson Creek Restoration Plan to reduce flooding, improve water quality, and improve fish and wildlife habitat. Goals varied from section to section along the creek and included controlling storm water runoff, reducing erosion, replacing or mitigating impervious surfaces, and protecting riparian zones. Through 2007, at least 75site-specific restoration projects had been {{carried out in the}} Johnson Creek Watershed, ranging from the $1.2-million Brookside Project, a constructed wetland, to small riparian repair projects. Most involved voluntary citizen participation in all phases, including the long-term management and care of the sites. In late 2012, the city completed the East Lents Floodplain Project, which restored [...] of the <b>natural</b> <b>floodplain</b> to a low-lying area along the creek.|$|E

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>floodplains</b> {{comprise}} a spatial mosaic of habitat types that vary in successional development. The physical–chemical properties of soils and sediments in these habitats vary spatio-temporally {{with changes in}} hydrology, thereby influencing microbial dynamics and general floodplain functioning. The major goals {{of this study were}} to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of different floodplain habitats and elucidate microbial function as a mechanistic basis underlying floodplain functioning. Microbial functional parameters (i. e. soil-sediment respiration, enzyme activity) as well as a microbial state variable (i. e. bacterial abundance, BA) were assessed in conjunction with abiotic properties of respective soils and sediments in different floodplain habitats over an annual cycle. BA and respiration differed significantly among habitat types, being lowest in early successional gravel and stream channel habitats and highest in older successional habitats of mature forest, islands, and riparian pasture/grassland. Coarse-scale floodplain hydrology influenced the spatial variation in microbial measures within specific habitats. A non-metric multidimensional scaling clearly separated habitat types based on the functional activities of eight tested enzymes and specific microbial variables could be linked to soil-sediment respiration. These results document a high functional heterogeneity of soil and sediment microbial variables that complements the shifting habitat mosaic found in most <b>natural</b> <b>floodplains.</b> Moreover, the use of functional measures such as respiration enhances the understanding of complex floodplain functioning...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} century, land use change, such as {{settlement}} development and intensification of agriculture, {{has led to}} a decreased capacity of <b>natural</b> <b>floodplains</b> to provide flood regulation across large areas of Europe. The expansion of built-up areas in flood zones has reduced retention areas, potentially leading to an increase of downstream flood risk and an increased demand for flood regulation measures. The goal of this paper was to analyse the historic development of settlements from the 1850 s until 2011 in relation to flood exposure in {{the upper reaches of the}} river Main, Germany. The settlement area of pre-industrial times was derived from historical land cover maps with the aid of object-based classification. Current settlement areas were extracted from the real estate map of Bavaria. Topographic and flood exposure variables were utilized for the statistical analysis of settlement change. Results showed a strong increase in settlements in all administrative districts of the case study area since the 1850 s. The total built-up area within the flooding zone of the investigated section of the Main river increased almost fivefold. Such expansion of settlement into the <b>natural</b> <b>floodplains</b> indicates a high growth in demand for flood regulation. Furthermore, our results suggest that flood exposure affected site selection of settlement in the past much stronger than it does today. Technical flood control (e. g. channels, dams and retention areas) reduced the area of settlement at risk for many towns in the case study region, but for some, it remains remarkably high...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{resistance of}} vegetation {{can play a}} major role in the hydrodynamics of rivers with extensive <b>natural</b> <b>floodplains.</b> Contrary to commonly used wall roughness methods, vegetation penetrates the flow field and thereby causes drag and, subsequently, additional energy losses. In this study, these processes are treated in an idealized form by replacing vegetation with cylindrical elements with homogeneous geometrical dimensions. Based on scaling considerations of the forces involved, depth-averaged flow velocities within the roughness layer and in the free flowing layer above the roughness elements are estimated. Consequently, conditions in the two separate flow layers yield a new description of the overall average flow field, which is entirely determined by measurable geometrical boundaries.

50|$|Today {{the land}} {{next to the}} rivers is {{protected}} with many flood control methods, and <b>natural</b> <b>floodplain</b> activity occurs in few places.

Recent large floods have been noted to deposit thick layers of silt, destroying plants. Also, the disturbance of flooding is rare enough now that riversides become overgrown with brush, shading out the plants in a similar way. In fact, in some areas the plant now depends on periodic human disturbance, such as mowing, to clear away the brush the way severe natural flooding once did.|$|E

5000|$|The Assiniboine River {{rises in}} eastern Saskatchewan {{east of the}} {{community}} of Kelvington on the upper prairie level above the Manitoba Escarpment. The Assiniboine River flows through three basic zones with different channel characteristics. Upstream of Brandon, the main stem of the river and its most important tributaries flow within a very large valley. The valley was cut by huge glacial melt water flows {{at the end of the}} last glaciation. The floor of this spillway valley provides a <b>natural</b> <b>floodplain</b> for the river and the valley provides a significant storage volume making the construction of the Shellmouth Dam near Russell both technically and economically viable. The major tributaries in this reach are the Qu’Appelle, Shell and Little Saskatchewan Rivers.The glacial flows created a large delta east of Brandon extending almost to Portage la Prairie. The river has eroded down through sediments of the delta cutting a narrow valley through these sediments as it drops through a vertical distance of about 150 m to the Lake Agassiz - Red River Plain [...] In this valley, the river is confined with a narrow valley floor. The Souris River is the primary tributary contributing flow to the Assiniboine in this reach.Near Portage la Prairie the river emerges from the delta reach onto the relatively flat Red River plain (the floor of former Glacial Lake Agassiz) and at this point it can flow in any direction from roughly northwest to roughly southeast. The gradient of the river channel within the delta reach to the west is relatively high, so the river water velocities are fairly high and the waters of the river carry significant amounts of sediment. The gradient in the flat Red River plain is much less and the velocity of the river water flowing over this plain is much lower. Therefore, the sediments carried by the river waters as they flow through the delta reach are deposited onto the plain. The Assiniboine winds its way east eventually joining the Red River at [...] "The Forks" [...] in Winnipeg, Manitoba.|$|E

40|$|By {{accepting}} periodic flood as {{an unavoidable}} circumstance, urban communities in eastern Pampanga can adapt to flood {{flows from the}} Pampanga River better during high-intensity storms by creating a more ecologically-resilient multi-equilibria system of adaptation. A typical solution is to apply engineering solutions to flooding, resulting in a forced state of equilibrium that is ill-adapted to the changing forces of nature. By understanding the dichotomous theory of urban resilience to floods, strategies can be formed to assess and plan a more adaptive flood hazard management framework.
