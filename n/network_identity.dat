By {{this time the}} TV Australia moniker had all but disappeared from network branding. On 13 January 1991 TV Australia was replaced with the launch of The Entertainment Network, a backronym that repositioned the network toward a younger demographic. At this time CTC dropped all Channel 10 branding in favour of Capital Television, the name of its parent company.

40|$|In recent years, {{substantial}} {{academic research}} has focussed on {{solving the problem}} of email spam using reputation mechanisms (e. g., [1] and [2]) while others [3] have discussed the generalised problem of any unsolicited network transaction in client-server scenarios. We propose a reputation model based on behavioural history {{as a solution to}} this problem. We use behavioural history of long-lived <b>network</b> <b>identities</b> to develop local and global reputation. This helps the provider to make decisions regarding future network transactions. The decisions are either binary (e. g., provide service or cut-off) or more fine grained where the provider can vary levels of service. A declarative specification of behaviour quality of <b>network</b> <b>identities</b> in relation to relevant terms in the service contract is being developed, which will relate network activities to discrete units of good or bad behaviour. In most cases, clients have their own identities or they are identified as members of a group (e. g., customers of a particular Internet Service Provider). In situations where the identity of the client is anonymous and cannot be associated with an...|$|R
40|$|Through cross-site {{authentication}} schemes such as OAuth and OpenID, users increasingly rely {{on popular}} social net-working sites for their digital identities–but {{use of these}} iden-tities brings privacy and tracking risks. We propose Crypto-Book, an extension to existing digital identity infrastructures that offers privacy-preserving, digital identities {{through the use of}} public key cryptography and ring signatures. Crypto-Book builds a privacy-preserving cryptographic layer atop existing social <b>network</b> <b>identities,</b> via third-party key servers that convert social <b>network</b> <b>identities</b> into public/private key-pairs on demand. Using linkable ring signatures, these key-pairs along with the public keys of other identities create unique pseudonyms untraceable back to the owner yet can resist anonymous abuse. Our proof-of-concept implementation of Crypto-Book cre-ates public/private key pairs for Facebook users, and includes a private key pickup protocol based on E-mail. We present Black Box, a case study application that uses Crypto-Book for accountable anonymous whistle-blowing. Black Box al-lows users to sign files deniably using ring signatures, using a list of arbitrary Facebook users – who need not consent or even be aware of this use – as an explicit anonymity set...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the multi-faceted role of {{language}} and language-sensitive recruitment processes in knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNCs). In particular, we develop a framework that helps to better understand how language-sensitive recruitment is related to competence, <b>networks,</b> <b>identity</b> and power. We started by conducting a qualitative interview-based study of 101 MNC subsidiaries. This analysis elucidates the productive and counterproductive effects of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer related to communication competence, <b>networks,</b> <b>identity,</b> and power. To further understanding of the productive and counterproductive effects, we conducted a quantitative study in 285 MNC subsidiaries. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between language-sensitive recruitment and knowledge transfer. Together, these two studies provide {{a better understanding of}} the multifaceted and at times counterintuitive implications of language-sensitive recruitment on knowledge transfer in MNCs. By elucidating these effects, this paper contributes to the stream of research examining the role of language in MNCs and international business more generally. It also adds to research on MNC knowledge transfer that to date has focused little attention on language. By elaborating on the potential unintended consequences of language-sensitive recruitment, this paper also has implications on international human resource management research...|$|R

We present an IBC infrastructure setup phase, a peer registration solution using Shamir’s (k, n) secret sharing scheme, and a secure key issuing scheme, which adopts key generate centre (KGC) and key privacy authorities (KPAs) to issue private keys to peers securely. This enables the IBC systems to be more acceptable and applicable in real-world P 2 P networks...|$|R

50|$|It follows that, in principle, the <b>network</b> <b>identity</b> of {{a device}} should be {{established}} before permitting network connectivity, for example by using digital certificates in place of hardware addresses which are trivial to spoof as device identifiers.

50|$|The {{system was}} founded in 1968 {{by an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature {{establishing}} the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority (NJPBA). New Jersey already had a public television station licensed within the state—WNET, licensed to Newark.

With state funding and four UHF licenses assigned years earlier by the Federal Communications Commission, the NJPBA went to work building the state's public television stations. The first station, WNJT in Trenton, went on the air on April 5, 1971, with the other three stations signing on over the next two years.

Identity and certificate services allow administrators to manage user accounts and the digital certificates {{that allow them to}} access certain services and systems.
