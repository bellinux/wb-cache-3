5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, which he did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate.</b>|$|E

5|$|On October2, the {{government}} of Belize {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm's threat. The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in Belmopan. Overall, about 25,000people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population. Three hospitals were evacuated in the country. In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> such intensity.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Claudette {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August7. On August11, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave when it was located roughly 600mi (965km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity was associated with the westward moving wave; however, the NHC did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> further development of the system. By the afternoon of August12, little convective activity remained with the wave. Strong upper-level wind shear created an unfavorable environment for the system to re-organize as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{tropical}} cyclone's short life, overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models indicated {{the system would}} reach hurricane status within {{two to three days}} under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.|$|E
5|$|Sector General is a {{gigantic}} multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from {{opposite sides of}} humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, {{but many of the}} stories feature types of patient that the builders did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate.</b> Initially most of the stories center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations.|$|E

ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale {{as a result of}} their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict, and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps, which was falling apart due to low morale.

5|$|The war {{was mostly}} a mopping-up {{operation}} intended {{to complete the}} expansion of the earlier Anglo-Maratha war, which was stopped due to economic concerns of the British. The war began as a campaign against the Pindaris. Seeing that the British were in conflict with the Pindaris, the Peshwa's forces attacked the British at 16:00 on 5 November 1817 with the Maratha left attacking the British right. The Maratha forces comprised 20,000 cavalry, 8,000 infantry, and 20 guns whereas the British had 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 infantry, and eight guns. On the Maratha side, an additional 5,000 horse and 1,000 infantry were guarding the Peshwa at Parvati Hill. The British numbers include Captain Ford's unit, which was en route from Dapodi to Khadki. The British had also asked General Smith to come to Khadki for the battle but they did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> he would arrive in time.|$|E
5|$|Early on September7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{noted that}} {{although}} Maria {{was in an}} area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> any strengthening. The system changed little in organization over the next 24hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible satellite imagery depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear. The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) on September8 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight into the system early on September9, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a non-tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands. Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance. When the system approached the northern Leeward Islands on September10, satellite imagery and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40mi (65km) east-southeast of Antigua.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Giri was {{classified}} a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar. Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, {{this was because}} forecasters did <b>not</b> <b>anticipate</b> Giri to strengthen {{as quickly as it}} did. The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6m (12ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri. According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, two Canadian ships took {{advantage}} of thinning summer ice cover on the Arctic Ocean to make the crossing. It is thought that climate change is likely to open the passage for increasing periods, making it potentially attractive as a major shipping route.
