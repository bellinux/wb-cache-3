5|$|On 30 April 1969, the Working Committee for Nuclear Issues (AAA) was created. It met 27 {{times between}} 26 September 1969 and 25 October 1988. However, the {{committee}} {{had only a}} preparatory role. As the Cold War started coming to an end, the AAA became less relevant. On 1 November 1988, Federal Councillor Arnold Koller signed the dissolution order, and the AAA ceased to exist on 31 December of that year, thus ending the 43-year Swiss <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed {{control of}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program</b> in June 1942, and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory became part of {{what came to be}} called the Manhattan Project.

Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.|$|E
5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E

5|$|Baxter {{was born}} in Wales, but grew up in England, {{entering}} the University of Birmingham at age 16. He joined Imperial Chemical Industries as a chemical engineer, and became head of the Central Laboratory of its General Chemicals Division in Widnes, investigating the chemistry of chlorine and fluorine. He {{was elected to the}} Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of uranium hexafluoride for Tube Alloys, the British wartime <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program,</b> and later established a pilot plant to produce it in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Leet's group reached Manila in July 1945, {{where they}} met with the {{intelligence}} staff of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's Army Forces, Pacific. Following the surrender of Japan the mission traveled to Japan and visited various research establishments including Tokyo Imperial University, Waseda University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, the Institute for Materials Research, Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Toshiba), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the National Research Council, and the Board of Technology. The mission, which included Karl Compton, interviewed over 300 Japanese scientists and produced reports on Japanese research into radar, rockets, and other developments, including chemical and biological warfare. The Manhattan Project Intelligence Group, {{under the command of}} Philip Morrison, arrived in Japan in September 1945 and examined Japan's wartime <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>program.</b> The group concluded that lack of uranium ore and low priority had doomed the Japanese effort. They reported that, contrary to American belief, Japan's nuclear physicists were competent.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{proliferation}} {{can be seen}} as {{occurring in}} two stages, the development of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> production <b>program</b> and the actual possession of weapons. The first stage, the presence of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>programs,</b> is (or at least has been) a de facto precondition for the manufacture and possession of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> States intending to join the nuclear club must develop and maintain their own <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>programs</b> {{as long as they are}} intent on ascending to nuclear status. The second stage involves actual <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> possession. The five major powers proceeded to develop nuclear devices almost as soon as each possessed sufficient <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> technology. Other states have maintained nuclear opacity for a certain period time or refrained from manufacturing <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> even after they possessed a set of weapons materials and the capability to make <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> For instance, India refrained from making <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> until the late 1980 ’s, in spite of the fact that it had demonstrated a mature capability to build a nuclear device in 1974. We therefore treat possession as a distinct phase from the intention to seek <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> development through <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>programs</b> (Levite 2002, 69 - 73).
