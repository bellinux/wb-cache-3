5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} experiments on element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium. The Russian scientists proposed the name joliotium (Jo) for the new element after Irène Joliot-Curie, who had recently died, creating an element naming controversy that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> for several decades, which each group using its own proposed names.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.|$|E
5|$|Now {{that the}} Romans and Gauls had blooded one another, {{intermittent}} Roman-Gallic wars were to continue {{between the two}} in Italy {{for more than two}} centuries, including the Battle of Lake Vadimo, the Battle of Faesulae in 225 BC, the Battle of Telamon in 224 BC, the Battle of Clastidium in 222 BC, the Battle of Cremona in 200 BC, the Battle of Mutina in 194 BC, the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC, and the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. The Celtic problem would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> for Rome until the final subjugation of all Gaul following the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC.|$|E

5|$|The county {{magistrate}} and commandery administrator {{were the}} official court judges {{of the county}} and commandery, respectively. Their jurisdictions overlapped, yet the commandery administrator only interfered in county court cases when necessary; it was generally agreed that whoever arrested a criminal first {{would be the first}} to judge him or her. If a commandery-level court case could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved,</b> the central government's Commandant of Justice was the final authority of appeal before the emperor. Yet he most often dealt with cases of political rebels and regicide in regards to kings, marquesses, and high officials. Above the Commandant was the emperor, the supreme judge and lawgiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum. The type specimen was a 35cm (14in) long immature male caught near Cooktown, Queensland, Australia. Other common names for this species are the itar shark and the blind shark (also used for Brachaelurus waddi). Goto's 2002 morphological {{analysis of the}} carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy, meaning that the phylogenetic relationships between the {{epaulette shark}} and its sister species could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war in 1917, General John J. Pershing sent Brice P. Disque, a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to {{determine}} if local labor issues within the forest products industry could be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.|$|E

5|$|The 1932 NFL season {{resulted}} in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> by the typical winloss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won {{the game and the}} championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game {{in each of the four}} seasons before the completed merger. The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, Random House revamped the series, naming it The 3 Investigators — Crimebusters Series. The {{investigators}} were now 17 years old, could drive cars and {{were much more}} independent.

The series was well-received, but was halted during 1990, when legal disagreements between Random House and the heirs of the Arthur estate could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved.</b> By 2005, the disagreements were still not settled.|$|E
25|$|The smelter in Trail, British Columbia is {{operated}} by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company (COMINCO) and has processed lead and zinc since 1896. Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada–US border in Washington. The smoke from the smelter distressed residents, resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation. The dispute between the smelter operators and affected landowners could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved,</b> resulting in the case being sent to an arbitration tribunal. Negotiation and resulting litigation and arbitration was settled in 1941.|$|E

25|$|Despite the transcontinental {{success and}} {{millions}} in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy {{less than three}} years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Crédit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad.

When the National Highway passes through the city, the traffic hurried to pass over the railway gates {{in the city and}} outskirts, which makes taffic worse. To avoid the traffic congestion, the {{government}} of India constructed a mini bypass road connecting Eastern locks and Vatluru on both ends of the city. Even then, the traffic problem could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved.</b> The main bypass road which was constructed under Golden Quadrilateral programme which was completed in the late 1990s but then only 10,000 vehicles passed through the main bypass road but now it has almost doubled.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the 1996–97 season, Everton {{approached}} Howard Kendall (by now at Sheffield United) following rejections from Bobby Robson and Andy Gray about a third spell as the club's manager. Kendall {{returned and}} there was much hype as the new season began about whether Kendall could still work his old magic and re-establish Everton as one of England's top playing sides. However, the 1997–98 campaign was a difficult one. As in 1994, Everton's survival was not assured until the last game of the season and only achieving survival on goal difference at the expense of Bolton Wanderers. Off the field, the club was in a major financial crisis at this time which would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> until 1999.|$|E
25|$|Stevens, in {{his initial}} draft, {{expressed}} great {{concern with the}} possibility that an individual might be liable for copyright infringement for copying a single program in his own home, and for his own use.

Justice White, noting Brennan's position, suggested that Stevens shift the basis of his opinion away from arguments about whether home-use was, in fact, an infringement. White pointed out that the issue need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>resolved,</b> because the suit was not against home-users, but against the producers of the technology that enabled them.|$|E
