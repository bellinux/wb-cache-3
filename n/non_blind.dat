40|$|Reverberation {{in speech}} {{is one of}} the primary factors caused by delayed image of speech signal plus the {{intended}} speech signals. Reverberation degrades the quality of the speech signal when recorded by a distant microphone and in the hands free telephonic scenarios. This causes a big problem for carrying out communication between people or in automatic voice recognition applications in which the voice is not properly recognized by the voice recognition applications. Here dereverberation is performed considering two mostly used real time scenarios. They are <b>Non</b> <b>blind</b> dereverberation and Blind dereverberation. Dereverberation in a hands free scenario using various adaptive algorithms has been a research topic for several years. This scenario is considered as a <b>Non</b> <b>blind</b> situation. For this <b>non</b> <b>blind</b> situation, here two types of recently proposed adaptive algorithms are used. They are Non Parametric Variable Step Size Normalized Least Mean Square (NP VSS NLMS) and Variable Step Size Normalized Least Mean Square (VSS NLMS) adaptive filters. The scenario in which the knowledge of clear speech signal is unknown is considered to be the blind situation. Here we introduce the Non parametric Variable Step Size NLMS (NP VSS NLMS) based step size adaptive filter in Maximum kurtosis linear prediction (LP) residual of speech to remove the reverberations from the reverberated speech signal. The performances of both blind dereverberation and <b>non</b> <b>blind</b> dereverberation are analyzed using Spectrogram plot, Reverberation Index (RI) and Speech Distortion (SD) parameters...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} evidence cited {{in favor of}} the operation of genetic factors in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Like other psychiatric conditions, a belief in the genetic basis of ADHD is derived from the results of family, twin, and adoption studies. Because family studies are widely believed to be confounded by environmental factors, primary emphasis is placed on twin and adoption studies. ADHD twin studies depend on the validity of the equal environment assumption (EEA), which holds that the environments of identical (MZ) and fraternal (DZ) twins are the same. Here it is argued that however the EEA is defined, it cannot be accepted. Therefore, the greater similarity or concordance of MZ twins when compared to DZ twins is plausibly explained by environmental factors. Adoption studies constitute a third method for investigating the role of genetic factors in ADHD. It is argued that these studies are greatly flawed by factors including <b>non</b> <b>blinded</b> diagnoses and the failure to study the biological relatives of adoptees. After an examination of the total weight of evidence in favor of a genetic basis or predispo-sition for ADHD, it is concluded that a role for genetic factors is not supported an...|$|R

Design: Cross- sectional case-control study. Setting: Headquarters of the Sudanese Blind Union, Khartoum North. Subjects: Fifty blind adults (congenital or soon after birth) and fifty control sighted subjects matched for age and gender. (age ≥ 18 years). Method: Consent, CPITN index, data form and statistical analysis (Chisquare tests). Results: The most frequent age range was 18 - 25 years. Males were 72 % of the study and control groups. The blind individuals who need periodontal treatment are more than the control group (98 % and 90 % respectively). The need for OHI and scaling was observed in 80 % of the study group compared to 58 % of the control group.

30|$|In {{traditional}} channel {{estimation methods}} for point-to-point systems, {{they can be}} divided into two groups: data-aided (DA) [10 – 17] and <b>non</b> data-aided (<b>blind)</b> [18 – 26]. In general, DA channel estimation methods differ in the way they interpolate or filter punctual DA least square (DA-LS) channel estimates over data subcarriers. This can be accomplished using time-frequency Wiener filtering [10, 11], which is optimal in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense if knowledge of the channel statistics (KCS) is available. On the other hand, channel estimation can be accomplished by elaborating raw estimates in the time domain using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based scheme. In [12], the MMSE channel estimator working in the time domain has been proposed. In order to reduce computational complexity, using the singular value decomposition and several low-rank approximations to the MMSE estimator has been proposed in [13] and [14]. Li et al. [12 – 14] also require complete KCS. In [15], the authors compare the MMSE approach with maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation, where complete KCS is not required. This latter approach works well with dense multipath channels and quasi-uniform profiles. In practice, after the inverse DFT (IDFT), not all the channel impulse response (CIR) samples are significant because many may correspond to delays where no propagation channel paths are actually present. Therefore, the authors in [16] exploit this idea to estimate channel. In [17], the authors propose a method to approach the MMSE channel estimation performance, while avoiding the need for a priori KCS.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{light of}} the {{ever-increasing}} demand for new spectral bands and the underutilization of those already allocated, the concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) has emerged. Opportunistic users could exploit temporarily vacant bands after detecting the absence of activity of their owners. One of the crucial tasks in the CR cycle is therefore spectrum sensing and detection which has to be precise and efficient. Yet, CRs typically deal with wideband signals whose Nyquist rates are very high. In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the power spectrum of such signals from sub-Nyquist samples, rather than the signal itself as done in previous work, in order to perform detection. We consider both sparse and non sparse signals as well as blind and <b>non</b> <b>blind</b> detection in the sparse case. For {{each one of those}} scenarii, we derive the minimal sampling rate allowing perfect reconstruction of the signal’s power spectrum in a noise-free environment and provide power spectrum recovery techniques that achieve those rates. The analysis is performed for two different signal models considered in the literature, which we refer to as the analog and digital models, and shows that both lead to similar results. Simulations demonstrate power spectrum recovery at the minimal rate in noise-free settings and show the impact of several parameters on the detector performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensing time and sampling rate.

40|$|Blurring is {{a common}} {{artifact}} that produces distorted images with unavoidable information loss. The Blind image deconvolution is to recover the sharp estimate of a given blurry image when the blur kernel is unknown. Despite the availability of deconvolution methods, it is still uncertain how to regularize the blur kernel in an effectual fashion which could substantially improve the results even when the image is blurred to its extend. This paper presents a novel deconvolution method that describes an efficient optimization scheme that alternates between estimation of blur kernel and restoration of sharp image until convergence. The system engenders a more efficient regularizer for the blur kernel that can generally and considerably benefit the solution for the problem of blind deconvolution. Also the blur metric concept in the system provides an automated environment for the selection of deconvolutoin parameters. The outlier handling model used in this work detects and eliminates the major causes of visual artifacts. As a result the system produces high quality deblurred results that preserves fine edge details of an image and complex image structures, while avoiding visual artifacts. The experiments on realistic images show that the proposed deconvolution method can produce high quality deblurred images with very little ringing artifacts even when the image is severely blurred, {{and the ability of}} system in choosing the appropriate input parameters for deconvolution.

40|$|Aim: To analyse the {{influence}} of serving method on compliance and consumption of nutritional supplement drinks in older adults with cognitive impairment. Background: Oral nutritional supplement drinks have positive benefits on increasing nutritional status within undernourished elderly people leading to weight gain. However, consumption of these drinks is low and therefore limits their effectiveness. Design: This study was a <b>non</b> <b>blind</b> randomised control trial where participants either consumed nutritional supplement drinks in a glass/beaker or consumed them through a straw inserted directly into the container. Method: Participants with longstanding cognitive impairment were recruited from nursing homes (n= 31) and hospitals (n= 14). Participants were randomised to serving method. Nursing and care staff were instructed to give the supplement drinks three times per day on alternate days over a week by the allocated serving method. The researcher weighed the amount of supplement drink remaining after consumption. Data were collected over 12 months in 2011 - 2012. Results: 45 people {{participated in this study}} mean age 86. 7 (SD 7. 5) years. After randomisation {{there was no significant difference}} between the baseline characteristics of the two groups. Participants randomised to consume nutritional drinks from a glass / beaker drank significantly more than those who consumed them via a straw inserted directly into the container. However, supplements allocated to be given in a glass/beaker were more frequently omitted. Conclusion: Nutritional supplement drinks should be given to people with dementia who are able to feed themselves in a glass or a beaker if staffing resources allow (NIHR CSP ref 31101) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{recognize}} the etiological agent responsible for severe acute respiratory failure (ARF) in patients in mechanical ventilation (MV) {{is important to}} determine their treatment and prognosis, and to avoid the excessive use of antibiotics. Mini bronchoalveolar lavage (mini BAL) is a <b>blind,</b> <b>non</b> bronschoscopic procedure, used to obtain samples from the lower respiratory tract from patients on mechanical ventilation (MV). Aim: To assess the feasibility, complications and preliminary results of mini BAL among patients with severe ARF on MV. Material and Methods: Prospective study in 17 patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distess syndrome (ARDS) on MV and with negative conventional microbiological studies. Mini BAL was performed using standardized protocols. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters where measured {{before and after the}} procedure. Samples obtained were sent to quantitative cultures. Results: At baseline: APACHE II score of 22 ± 6, 7, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was 176. 6 ± 48. 6 and the oxygenation index was 9. 74 ± 3. 78. All procedures were performed by an ICU resident. Thirty five percent of the procedures had positive cultures and no complications related to the procedures were reported. The procedure lasted an average of 12 minutes and the instilled and rescued volume were 60 ml and 19. 6 ml, respectively. There {{were no significant differences between}} hemodynamic and respiratory variables before and after the procedure. Conclusions: Mini BAL is a safe, fast and easy technique for obtaining samples from the inferior airway in patients with ALI or ARDS on MV...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} the most {{leading cause of death}} in {{developing}} countries. The women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the advance stadium, often develops extraordinary emotional stress. Psychotherapy administration can exert positive effect. Objective: To analyze the difference of cortisol level in advanced-stage cervical cancer patient having received reality psychotherapy intervention compared with standard therapy. Method: Experimental double <b>blind</b> <b>non</b> randomized clinical trial post test group design. The 30 subjects of research were divided into 2 groups (standard therapy without realty psychotherapy and standard therapy reality psychotherapy intervention) and each group consisted of 15 subjects. This research was conducted in obstetric and gynecology ward and polyclinic of dr. Moewardi Local General Hospital of Surakarta and Prodia Laboratory, from July to September 2014. Result: The distribution of cortisol level mean value in cervical cancer patient group receiving chemoradiation with reality psychotherapy seemed to be lower(0. 97 ± 0. 46 mg/dL), then that in the group without reality psychotherapy (11. 54 ± 7. 13 mg/dL). From the t-test analysis, it could be seen that {{there was a significant difference}} of cortisol level in cervical cancer patient group receiving chemoradiation with reality psychotherapy and the group without reality psychotherapy with p value = 0. 000 (< 0. 05). Conclusion: There was a significantly decreasing serum cortisol level in the group receiving standard therapy with reality psychotherapy intervention. The administration of reality psychotherapy effectively lowered the serum cortisol level in the advanced stage-cervical cancer patient.

40|$|More than 40 % of all {{malignancy}} on woman were gynecologic cancer, {{the most}} common cancer is cervical cancer. On advance stage of cervical cancer, {{there may be a}} stres that comes from biologic, psychology and social aspects. The patients may face a physical and emotional burden which could activate the mechanism response of HPA-axis. Repeat activation could impair HPA-axis and circadian rhythm of cortisol. Psychotherapy, especially logotherapy is found to give benefit on cancer patient’s therapy by improving their knowledge about their disease and therapy, improving their emotional adjustment, quality of life, survival ability, satisfaction of therapy, as well as physical and functional heath adjustment. Purpose: To Analyze the effectivity of logotherapy towards cortisol serum level cervical cancer with intervention and not in dr. Moewardi general Hospital, Surakarta, Central Java. Methods: This study using experimental double <b>blind</b> <b>non</b> randomized clinical trial post-test group design towards cortisol serum level advance stage cervical cancer. The subjects of this study using purposive random sampling which consist of 30 patients, devided into 15 patients on control group, and the other 15 were treated group. Control group were having standard therapy only while treated group were having a 6 session of logoteraphy with 45 minutes duration on each session for a week plus standard therapy. All subjects were met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The result were analyzed by SPSS 19. 0 version for windows and using t test. Result: Distribution of mean cortisol level were lower in the serum of patients treated group (3. 99 + 5. 22 ng / ml), compared with the control group (20 : 28 + 7 : 44 ng / ml). Analysis of cortisol level variables using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in both groups showed the results are normally distributed with p = 0. 069 (p> 0. 05), for the treatment group and p = 0. 805 (P> 0. 05) for the control group. The results of t-test showed a significant difference with p = 0. 000 (< 0. 05). Conclusion: There is an effectiivity of logotherapy towardscortisol serum level of advanced stage cervical cancer.
