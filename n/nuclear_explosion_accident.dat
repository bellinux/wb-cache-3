Acute radiation sickness due to ingestion of radioactive material is possible, but rare; examples include the 1987 contamination of Leide das Neves Ferreira and the 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. Alpha and beta radiation have low penetrating power and are unlikely to affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and beta radiation can only do so if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of erythema.|$|R

Most of serious accidents are the gas <b>explosion</b> <b>accidents</b> in coal mine. By investigating the damage situations of the gas <b>explosion</b> <b>accidents</b> and the related material, finding out why these incidents happen is an important way to prevent or reduce the gas <b>explosion</b> <b>accidents.</b> Based on the occurred gas <b>explosion</b> <b>accidents,</b> the author use the FLUENT software to simulate the process of gas explosion and get the variation law of various air current parameters is obtained in gas explosion. The explosion causes and development course are discussed. Compared with the explosion parameters collected on scene of accident, it provides comprehensive scientific basis for the accident investigation. The conclusion is helpful to adopt suitable measures to prevent the gas explosion...|$|R
