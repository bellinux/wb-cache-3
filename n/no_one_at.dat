5|$|In October 1887, Dubois {{abandoned}} his academic career {{and left for}} the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) {{to look for the}} fossilized ancestor of modern man. Having received no funding from the Dutch government for his eccentric endeavorsince <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the time had ever found an early human fossil while looking for ithe joined the Dutch East Indies Army as a military surgeon. Because of his work duties, it was only in July 1888 that he began to excavate caves in Sumatra. Having quickly found abundant fossils of large mammals, Dubois was relieved of his military duties (March 1889), and the colonial government assigned two engineers and fifty convicts to help him with his excavations. After he failed to find the fossils he was looking for on Sumatra, he moved on to Java in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Thespis {{opened on}} Boxing Day {{and ran for}} 63 performances. It outran five of its nine {{competitors}} for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond {{the length of a}} normal run at the Gaiety, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the time anticipated that this {{was the beginning of a}} great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in The Pirates of Penzance, and the Act II ballet music.|$|E

5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E

Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E

In almost all societies, sleeping partners are strongly regulated by social standards.

25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for what is still widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what it was when he had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E

500|$|Major General Charles A. Willoughby's G-2 (intelligence) section did {{not agree}} with the airmen's {{assessment}} the islands were unoccupied. Drawing on Ultra and Allied Intelligence Bureau reports from interrogating local civilians, it reported on 15February that there were 3,000Japanese troops in the Admiralty Islands. On 24February, it revised the estimate to 4,000. G-2 attributed the lack of anti-aircraft fire to the Japanese logistical situation, believing it was a measure to conserve ammunition. Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the commander of U.S. Sixth Army later recalled <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> his headquarters believed the islands unoccupied. In the original plan, a team of Alamo Scouts was to have thoroughly reconnoitred the island before the landing. Krueger had a six-man party of Alamo Scouts inserted on the southern coast of Los Negros by PBY under cover of a bombing raid on 27February. The scouts reported the south coast was [...] "lousy with Japs".|$|E
500|$|As Russell concluded, {{to strong}} applause from gold delegates, {{there was a}} buzz of {{anticipation}} as Bryan ascended to the podium. There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there, waiting for his audience to calm. Bryan's lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As yet, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1840s, the Audit Office was {{questioning}} the amount spent on Pistrucci. In 1844, the Master of the Mint, William Gladstone restored Pistrucci's salary {{to the full}} £350 and offered him £400 to complete the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci moved his residence from the Mint on Tower Hill to Fine Arts Cottage, Old Windsor, and set to work in full earnest. [...] He was slowed by injuries from a fall, {{and it was not}} until the beginning of 1849 that he submitted the matrices of the medal, and was paid the remaining balance of £1,500. The matrices were so large <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Mint was willing to take the risk of hardening them and possibly ruining three decades' work. So only soft impressions were taken, with no medals in gold, silver and bronze as intended, though replicas have since been minted from other dies.

500|$|The Union {{supply ship}} Eugene was fired at by Confederate rebels on the Mississippi River {{at the second}} Chickasaw Bluff, while {{carrying}} supplies to Memphis in September 1862.

500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style.

Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know."
