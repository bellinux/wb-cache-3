25|$|Being a <b>navvy</b> {{labourer}} {{became a}} cultural experience unto its own during the 19th century. Most accounts chronicling {{the life of}} a <b>navvy</b> worker come from local newspapers portraying navvies as drunk, and unruly men, but fail to provide any mention that families were formed and raised despite the navvy's traveling demands.|$|E

25|$|The {{line was}} built by over 6,000 <b>navvies,</b> who worked in remote locations, {{enduring}} harsh weather conditions. Large camps were established to house the <b>navvies,</b> most of them Irish, with many becoming complete townships with post offices and schools. They were named Inkerman, Sebastapol and Jericho. The remains of one camp—Batty Green—where over 2,000 <b>navvies</b> lived and worked, can be seen near Ribblehead. The Midland Railway helped pay for scripture readers to counteract the effect of drunken violence in these isolated communities.|$|R
50|$|In November 1874 {{a number}} of skirmishes were fought between the native villagers and Irish <b>navvies.</b> The <b>navvies</b> had been brought in to help {{construct}} the railway, and fighting broke out {{between them and the}} locals on {{a number of}} occasions. This led to the locals being refused work on the line. Causing a small group of locals to throw stones at the <b>navvies,</b> who responded with mattock shafts and spades. The fighting lasted {{for most of the day}} eventually ending in the afternoon. Police were called in from Huddersfield but arrived after the disturbances had finished.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Navvies,</b> {{shorthand}} for navigational engineers, {{worked on the}} reservoir under the [...] "Butty Gang" [...] system, whereby groups of <b>navvies</b> were paid on a fixed lump sum basis, leaving the workers to divide the money between themselves. They were well-paid, hard-working, and hard-living; some were lodged in the Long Shed at Kitcliffe. One Betty Whitehead, a seventy-year old local woman, recalled in the Oldham Chronicle newspaper in 1957 that the <b>navvies</b> [...] "usually had a pocketful of money and a bellyful of beer" [...] It was said that navies [...] "spilt more beer than locals drank". Fights were common.|$|R

25|$|A {{study of}} 19th century British railway {{contracts}} by David Brooke, coinciding with census returns, conclusively demonstrates a {{great majority of}} <b>navvies</b> in Britain were English. He also states; 'only the ubiquitous Irish {{can be regarded as}} a truly international force in railway construction', although the Irish only comprised about 30% of the <b>navvies.</b> By 1818, high wages in North America attracted many Irish workers to become {{a major part of the}} workforce on the construction of the Erie Canal in New York State, and similar projects. <b>Navvies</b> also participated in building canals in Britain, where by the 20th century, they were the predominant workforce.|$|R

25|$|Due {{to limited}} safety protocols, navvies were {{frequently}} injured or {{killed on the}} job. For each mile of rail laid, there was an average of 3 work related deaths, which was even higher when working on sections that required tunnelling. The particularly high incidence of <b>navvy</b> mortality during {{the construction of the}} Woodhead Tunnel prompted the Enquiry of 1846, which eventually lead to the need for the formation of and evaluation by a Select Committee on Railway Labourers 1846.|$|E
25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim {{it was very difficult for}} Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than <b>navvy</b> work.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken {{the dust}} of London from his feet with not too {{emphatic}} a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.... has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a <b>navvy.</b> His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a <b>navvy.</b> She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to these unhygienic living conditions, navvies shared housing, some even sleeping on floors. The majority of navvies were Englishmen, with 30% of the group being Irish. While this ratio varied from <b>navvy</b> shanty town to shanty town, sleeping arrangements were segregated. [...] In at least one documented instance, a riot broke out between the two nationalities in one <b>navvy</b> shanty town, causing local magistrates to arrest 12 individuals. Though, {{this is not necessarily}} indicative of relations between the English and Irish in all <b>navvy</b> gangs.|$|E
