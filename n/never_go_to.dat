Cruttwell (who was to become the fourth {{principal}} of the refounded college, 1930–1939), and later naming a number of odious characters after him. Waugh wrote of his time at Hertford, 'I do no work here and <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Chapel'.

25|$|Roman Catholicism {{has long}} been the main {{religion}} of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class. Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, Judaism, and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law. According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 70% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 25% identify with no religion. Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services. This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church, 16% go to church some times a year, 9% some time per month and 15% every Sunday or multiple times per week. Recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20% to 27% of the Spanish population.|$|E

Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "as far as [...] go, 'Agua Mala' was pretty standard fare." [...] However, he criticized the episodes resolution, noting that Scully should have {{had no way to}} know pure water would kill the creature. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote that, [...] "'Agua Mala' won't end up on anybody's 'best of' list, but it's so silly that it's sort of fun." [...] Timothy Sexton from Yahoo!

During his first two terms, he generally followed convention; he smoked a pipe, bought a bicycle, and gave his maiden speech at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion that [...] "This House would welcome Prohibition". Waugh wrote reports on Union debates for both Oxford magazines, Cherwell and Isis, and he acted as a film critic for Isis. He also became secretary of the Hertford College debating society, [...] "an onerous but not honorific post", he told Driberg. Although Waugh tended to regard his scholarship {{as a reward for}} past efforts rather than a stepping-stone to future academic success, he did sufficient work in his first two terms to pass his [...] "History Previous", an essential preliminary examination.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Warner Bros. planned {{to produce a}} feature biographical film about actor James Dean, and the studio hired Israel Horovitz to write the script. One of the working titles was James Dean: An Invented Life before it was {{finalized}} as James Dean. When Horovitz wrote the script, he explored the [...] "psychological insight" [...] of Dean by showcasing the abandonment of his father, which became the fulcrum of the storyline. Horovitz recalled, [...] "Why would a father ship his wife's body back on a train with an 8-year-old son, <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the funeral and never pick the son up again, never bring the son back out to him?" [...] The screenwriter felt {{it was best to}} portray Dean's purported homosexuality by innuendo rather than explicitly. He wanted to focus on the romance between Dean and Pier Angeli and Dean's growth as an actor, and believed that a homosexuality subplot would distract from the storyline. Producer Marvin Worth explained in July 1995, [...] "We'll try to make a good movie... not one of rumor and innuendo." ...|$|E

[...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E
500|$|Starkey {{was tried}} and convicted of {{counterfeiting}} {{and sentenced to}} a term of twenty years at Newgate Prison. In prison, Starkey was able to save up and set aside {{a good amount of}} money, but his good behavior helped him earn the favor and even friendship of prison officials. The construction of Wethersfield State Prison would lead to the closure and transportation of the inmates and Starkey reportedly made declarations that he'd <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the new prison. On September 28, 1827, the day prior to the transfer, Starkey requested that he have his final stay in the underground shaft and his request was granted. For reasons unknown, the well hatch was left open and Starkey was able to make an escape attempt by climbing up the well rope. The rope broke and Starkey fell down the shaft and fell to his death. According to Newgate of Connecticut, Starkey would amass a total of $100 in prison, [...] When his body was discovered, it was found that he had $50 in possession and it was believed that a bribe had been paid to leave the hatch open. More modern accounts state that he drowned, whereas earlier sources state that his skull had been crushed. According to Richard Harvey Phelps's Newgate of Connecticut, Starkey's feet were found tied together, likely to aid in ascending the rope.|$|E
