30|$|The largest cross-national {{variation}} in {{the values of the}} progressivity index is found in the case of contributory and non-contributory non-means-tested benefits. For example, in the case of contributory benefits, progressivity ranges from 0.84 in Netherlands and 0.78 in Denmark to 0.23 In Lithuania and 0.29 in Latvia. This suggests that despite being generally related to previous earnings, the impact of contributory benefits on the income distribution may vary a lot depending on their actual design as well as the features of the wider tax-benefit system they are embedded in. Similarly, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> range in progressivity from 0.63 in Hungary and 0.59 in Sweden to 0.11 in Lithuania and 0.18 in Portugal and Bulgaria. Given that by design they are not related to market incomes, we would expect this category of tax-benefits instruments to be generally progressive. However, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> are usually categorical benefits. Depending on the ranking in the income distribution of the groups they target, <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> may have a larger or smaller effect on inequality.|$|E

In contrast to previous studies we analyse {{differences in}} benefit levels allowing for potentially different takeup rates between immigrants and natives and use Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions to discuss residual welfare dependence. Results point to substantial heterogeneity in welfare dependence between countries when not controlling for observed characteristics {{of immigrants and}} natives. This is primarily due to different selection into benefits between immigrants and natives and differences in their characteristics (mainly income, personal, and household characteristics). Once this is controlled for, immigrants participate at most equally often in both types of benefits as natives and usually also receive lower or comparable benefit levels...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} redistributive effects of taxes and {{benefits}} in the 27 countries that form the European Union. We rely on various Gini class measures to assess the redistributive effect, {{as well as the}} contribution to overall inequality of eight different tax-benefit instruments, i.e. public pensions, means-tested <b>benefits,</b> contributory <b>benefits,</b> <b>non-contributory</b> non means-tested <b>benefits,</b> direct taxes, tax allowances, tax credits and worker insurance contributions. In line with previous research, we find that, overall, tax benefit systems do succeed in redistributing significant portions of market income and in doing so they reduce inequality considerably. However, the extent of the redistribution varies markedly across countries. Although precise country rankings vary somewhat depending on the Gini measure used, all indicators suggest that Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, France, Germany and the Czech Republic reduce inequality significantly via their taxes and benefits. In contrast, tax-benefit systems reduce inequality least in Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria, Latvia and Lithuania. According to the widest used Gini measure (v = 2.0), inequality reduction is more than twice as large in the former group of countries compared to the latter.|$|R
30|$|The {{influence}} of non-pension contributory {{and that of}} <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits</b> in disposable income inequality is largely muted. This is mostly due to their relatively small share of disposable income which is a general pattern across the EU. On the other hand, these are also the types of benefits where cross-national variation in progressivity is widest. One possible explanation might be that policy design in these two categories of benefits potentially varies {{more than in the}} case of the other tax-benefit instruments.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{fundamental}} changes in marriage behaviour and the typical division of labour between married spouses, the traditional form of providing survivor benefits within public pension schemes could now be seen as inequitable.

Problems of transition, with the potential for a Pareto-improvement, are neglected. Public pensions, survivor benefits, female labour supply, optimal taxation...|$|E
30|$|To summarize, {{our results}} confirm {{previous}} findings {{related to the}} substantial redistribution achieved via taxes and benefits, {{as well as to}} the large variation existent across EU countries. The largest elements of the tax-benefit system (pensions and direct taxes) are also the ones impacting strongest on redistribution despite occasionally having low progressivity. This result is consistent with previous scholarly work on the ‘paradox of redistribution’ suggesting that extensive, non-targeted social programs are able to redistribute more due to their increased resources (Korpi and Palme 1998; Nelson 2004). Finally, direct transfers, even when not targeted (contributory and <b>non-contributory</b> non-means-tested <b>benefits)</b> are more likely to reduce inequality compared to tax concessions (allowances and credits). Thus, fiscal ‘spending’ is much less likely to be redistributive compared to traditional ‘social’ spending.|$|R

It is tax-free, non-means-tested and <b>non-contributory.</b> The <b>benefit</b> was introduced in 1992, integrating the former benefits Mobility Allowance and Attendance Allowance and introducing two additional lower rates of benefit. Prior to 2013 it could be claimed by UK residents aged under sixty five years. However, the benefit was phased-out for the majority of claimants between 2013 and 2015 and replaced by a new Personal Independence Payment. DLA can still be claimed by children under sixteen and can still be received by existing claimants who were aged sixty five or over on 8 April 2013.|$|R

30|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of direct}} taxation into schedules, {{tax credits and}} a part attributable to tax allowances showed that redistribution is effected mainly via the schedules. The redistributive effect of tax schedules {{is largely due to}} their size {{and to a lesser extent}} to their progressivity. Neither tax allowances nor tax credits influence inequality levels to any great extent. However, it should be kept in mind that the effect of tax allowances and tax credits is critically linked to the design of tax schedules. In particular, tax allowances and tax credits cannot, by design, have a significant impact in the context of low taxation levels. Tax allowances are progressive in a context of flat rate taxation but regressive in a progressive regime. Both tax allowances and tax credits affect inequality much less than means-tested and even <b>non-contributory</b> <b>benefits.</b> This reinforces the idea that the inequality-reducing capacity of fiscal benefits is limited.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the impact of ageing on labor and pension income {{distribution}} in Mexico under different scenarios of social security coverage. Static and accounting micro-simulations are used to build synthetic populations in 2025 and 2050. The main findings of the work are, firstly, that, in spite of the critical increase in the elderly population share predicted by the main national and international economic institutions, the level of income dispersion is not likely to dramatically increase in the coming decades. On the contrary, inequality might be reduced in the next few decades because of the higher educa-tional attainment and female activity rates observed among young cohorts at the present moment. Secondly, an upward shift in pension coverage —either through an increase in the share of the population receiving contributory pensions or the establishment of <b>non-contributory</b> old-age <b>benefits</b> — could be an effective tool to achieve improvements in income distribution figures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the impact on the distribution of household income and poverty of the 2010 reform of the law that establish the <b>non-contributory</b> social <b>benefits</b> entitlement conditions in Portugal, with particular incidence in the Social Integration Income (RSI). Carried out in a period of serious deepening economic and social crisis, the changes in the resources condition appear fundamentally as a way of limiting and reducing the resources earmarked for social policies usage, precisely at the time when increased social insecurity should lead to a significant increase in the importance of such social policies. Using micro-data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), we simulate the impact of the reform and estimate its effects on the income distribution and on different dimensions of monetary poverty. The change in the size of government expenditure required to finance these programs will also be estimated. Social Policy, Income Distribution, Inequality, Poverty Alleviation, Portugal...|$|R
