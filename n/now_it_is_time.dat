2500|$|Dissemination has {{historically}} been interpreted as unilateral communication of information. With {{the advent of the}} internet, and the explosion in popularity of online communities, [...] "social media has changed the information landscape in many respects, and creates both new modes of communication and new types of information", changing the interpretation of the definition of dissemination. The nature of social networks allows for faster diffusion of information than through organizational sources. The internet has changed the way we view, use, create, and store information, <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to re-evaluate the way we share and spread it.|$|E

2500|$|The king {{declared}} in 2011 that {{women would be}} eligible to be appointed to the Shura Council, an unelected body that issues advisory opinions on national policy. '"This is great news," [...] said Saudi writer and women's rights activist Wajeha al-Huwaider. [...] "Women's voices will finally be heard. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to remove other barriers like not allowing women to drive cars {{and not being able}} to function, to live a normal life without male guardians."' Robert Lacey, author of two books about the kingdom, said, [...] "This is the first positive, progressive speech out of the government since the Arab Spring.... First the warnings, then the payments, now the beginnings of solid reform." [...] The king made the announcement in a five-minute speech to the Shura Council. In January 2013, King Abdullah issued two royal decrees, granting women thirty seats on the council, and stating that women must always hold at least a fifth of the seats on the council. According to the decrees, the female council members must be [...] "committed to Islamic Shariah disciplines without any violations" [...] and be [...] "restrained by the religious veil." [...] The decrees also said that the female council members would be entering the council building from special gates, sit in seats reserved for women and pray in special worshipping places. Earlier, officials said that a screen would separate genders and an internal communications network would allow men and women to communicate. Women first joined the council in 2013, occupying thirty seats. There are two Saudi royal women among these thirty female members of the assembly, Sara bint Faisal Al Saud and Moudi bint Khalid Al Saud. Furthermore, in 2013 three women were named as deputy chairpersons of three committees: Thurayya Obeid was named deputy chairwoman of the human rights and petitions committee, Zainab Abu Talib, deputy chairwoman of the information and cultural committee, and Lubna Al Ansari, deputy chairwoman of the health affairs and environment committee.|$|E

50|$|From its {{foundation}} in 1898, {{the community of}} Missionary Benedictines at Peramiho, Tanzania, had sought to evangelize the surrounding population.
