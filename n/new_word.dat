5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the <b>new</b> <b>word</b> back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

5000|$|In general, {{the theory}} states that <b>new</b> <b>words,</b> often synonyms, are created in {{influential}} areas and cultural centers. Over time, these words gradually move outward to less culturally influential areas in a ripple pattern. Over time, the <b>new</b> <b>words</b> may travel a great distance. However, during their slow progression outwards {{from the cultural}} center, <b>new</b> <b>words</b> are also being created and gradually moving outwards. <b>New</b> <b>words</b> {{may not have the}} [...] "momentum" [...] necessary to propagate to all areas where the language is used.

40|$|For this study, {{the writer}} {{analyzed}} the word formation processes of <b>new</b> <b>words</b> which occur in Friendster?s testimonials. The writer used Friendster?s testimonials as her data because Friendster {{is widely used}} and there are great numbers of testimonials which are written by many {{people all over the}} world. According to Plag (2003), word formation process {{is the way in which}} <b>new</b> <b>words</b> are created. The research problem of this research is how the <b>new</b> <b>words</b> in Friendster?s testimonials are created. Therefore, the writer is really interested in observing <b>new</b> <b>words</b> which occur in Friendster?s testimonials, the formation processes of those <b>new</b> <b>words</b> and the most frequent type of word formation process. The purpose of the study is to reveal the formation process of <b>new</b> <b>words</b> and the predominant word formation processes which occur in Friendster?s testimonials. The writer used theories of word formation processes proposed by Ingo Plag, Jane Aitchison and George Yule. Based on the findings, the process of blending is the most frequent type of word formation process. This fact shows that people like to create <b>new</b> <b>words</b> by combining two or more than two words to form one word. It may be caused by the simplicity and efficiency of typing and sending testimonials in the short time, and the ability and creativity to create their own different codes in order to obscure the real meaning of those words.

40|$|The {{continuous}} emergences of <b>new</b> <b>words</b> {{as well as}} {{the gradual}} disappearances of old words are the law of the development of language and vocabulary. Along with the development and progress of Chinese society, there are large numbers of <b>new</b> <b>words</b> emerged in our daily lives. The quality of the Chinese new words’ translations, especially those <b>new</b> <b>words</b> related to the nation’s current politics and economy, directly affects China’s foreign political, economical and cultural communications. Therefore, it is of vital significance to make researches on the translations of the current political <b>new</b> <b>words,</b> so as to strengthen the Sino-foreign exchanges and cooperation in various aspects. This paper starts from some elementary translation theories, combines with China’s current situations, and tries to find some proper basic principles and specific methods to translate Chinese <b>new</b> <b>words...</b>|$|R
40|$|An idle {{diversion}} with {{pencil and}} graph paper involves writing some ordered sequence of {{letters in the}} cells of a grid and searching the horizontal, vertical and diagonal rows of the resulting array for accidentally-formed <b>new</b> <b>words.</b> Since there is usually a multiplicity of possible ways to inscribe a given letter string into a grid, the question arises as to whether some inscription patterns {{are likely to be}} more productive of <b>new</b> <b>words</b> than others. Logic suggests that the answer is yes. Because any <b>new</b> <b>words</b> in the array must form along straight lines, and because no answer is yes. Because any <b>new</b> <b>words</b> in the array must form along straight lines, and because no <b>new</b> <b>words</b> can form entirely within the line of the original letter sequence, grid space that is occupied by straight-line segments of that sequence is partly unavailable for new-word formation. Ergo, those inscription patterns that break or fold the original letter string into the shortest straight-line segments presumably offer the greatest opportunity for <b>new</b> <b>words</b> to form...|$|R
25|$|A suffix (ek) is {{attached}} to a stem (gövde). A stem may be a root (kök) or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: constructive suffixes (yapım ekleri) and inflectional suffixes (çekim ekleri). A constructive suffix makes a <b>new</b> <b>word</b> from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used in a sentence. The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the constructive suffixes.|$|E
25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a <b>new</b> <b>word</b> is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
25|$|With Goodson-Todman {{established}} as a reliable producer of high-rated games for CBS, including What's My Line?, To Tell the Truth, and I've Got a Secret, the network confidently gave the <b>new</b> <b>word</b> association game the 2:00 PM (1:00 Central) time slot, replacing the courtroom-themed game Face the Facts. As television's first successful celebrity-civilian team game, Password attracted a large and loyal audience that made it into a solid Nielsen favorite for nearly five years as shows came and went with great frequency on the other networks.

25|$|As {{it comes}} to word {{formation}} processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes {{to show up in}} children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When {{it comes to}} compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely <b>new</b> <b>word</b> for each concept.|$|E

25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one <b>new</b> <b>word.</b> Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E
25|$|A word of {{explanation}} seems necessary {{with regard to}} the introduction of the new term Archebiosis. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word Biogenesis to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word Biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist , who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word Abiogenesis. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced {{the use of the word}} Biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a <b>new</b> <b>word,</b> in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{years went}} {{by the number of}} {{captured}} vessels became consistently smaller due to Spain's shifting its focus to the Mediterranean. Enríquez also lost his influence within the Church with the arrival of a new bishop, Sebastián Lorenzo Pizarro, who declined any gift or favor that he offered. After the war ended, the Empire's relation with Great Britain normalized, further complicating this venture. Under this circumstances, the work of Enríquez served as an obstacle and by 1731, Mendizábal's last year in office, he was no longer considered a key asset in the <b>New</b> <b>Word.</b> In 1731, Enríquez sent two sloops to spy a British warship that had been sailing adjacent to San Juan for a week. This action interfered with the international relation between both nations, Patiño now intended to rebuild the Empire's armada and required peace to accomplish this task. The sudden change in geopolitics combined with conclusion of Mendizábal's term to begin a downward spiral in Enríquez's life. On October 11, 1731, Matías de Abadía docked at San Juan and took office a few hours later. He arrived in one of Enríquez's ships after his original vessel lost registration midway. A military officer, Abadía was accompanied by three trusted men, who were quickly placed in the pivotal offices of treasurer of Puerto Rico, overseer and manager of the city. Even before traveling to San Juan, the governor had orders to settle the constant conflicts between its residents. Abadía was also placed in charge of attending Camino's case against Enríquez and of investigating the assassination attempts. Following his intervention, the cases of Danío and Álvarez were suddenly re-evaluated by the Council of the Indies and Enríquez was forced to pay 4,000 pieces of eight to the former governor, {{despite the fact that the}} investigation had already been closed. Álvarez was also released and reinstated in his military position, with the privateer being forced to pay again. The influence that Enríquez once possessed was now wavering and he was likely being held accountable for the incidents of the previous decades. His enemies exploited this and bishop Pizarro aligned himself with the governor, only contacting the privateer to order the use of his vessels for transportation. The fact that Spain needed an scapegoat to appease Great Britain complicated his position.|$|E
