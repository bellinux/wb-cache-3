40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} physical-organic {{studies of}} charge transport by tunneling through self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), based on systematic {{variations of the}} structure of the molecules constituting the SAM. Replacing a −CH 2 CH 2 − group with a −CONH − group changes the dipole moment and polarizability of a portion of the molecule and has, in principle, the potential to change the rate of charge transport through the SAM. In practice, this substitution produces no significant change in the rate of charge transport across junctions of the structure AgTS-S(CH 2) mX(CH 2) nH//Ga 2 O 3 /EGaIn (TS = template stripped, X = −CH 2 CH 2 − or −CONH−, and EGaIn = eutectic alloy of gallium and indium). Incorporation of the amide group does, however, increase the yields of working (<b>non-shorting)</b> junctions (when compared to n-alkanethiolates of the same length). These results suggest that synthetic schemes that combine a thiol group on one end of a molecule with a group, R, to be tested, on the other (e. g., HS∼CONH∼R) using an amide-based coupling provide practical routes to molecules useful in studies of molecular electronics...|$|E

We emphasize here the advantages to spacecraft designers and modelers from considering the stochastic distributions of breakdown {{and how it}} can be affected by factors including spacecraft environment conditions, design geometries, material temperature, material purity, charging history, and appropriate timescales. Spacecraft charging models and spacecraft designs typically rely on tabulated values or ranges of breakdown strength, often based on cursory measurements with little or no experimental detail. Depending on the timescales and history of environmental and orbital changes or durations of specific missions, it may be critical to consider breakdown as a probability distribution rather than a single number or range of values. We present measured distributions of ESD data across several test configurations and materials including low density polyethylene (LDPE), polyimide (Kapton HN or PI) and biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). Step-up ramp-to-breakdown tests measured the distribution of breakdowns as a function of applied field at various fixed ramp rates and temperatures. Time endurance tests measured breakdown after some time for samples held at sub-critical static electrostatic fields. Taken together, these tests begin to provide an understanding of the probability of breakdown, what tests are most applicable, and how to interpret this for specific missions and charging concerns. Achieving statistically significant results as described above for several candidate materials can be onerous, even with accelerated test methods. We have observed pre-arcing events (transient, <b>non-shorting,</b> current spikes) during voltage ramp-up tests with sufficiently slow ramp rates. The distributions of these events have a strong correlation with the distributions of ESD events in many polymeric materials. We propose that experiments observing pre-arcing versus applied electric field could be used a proxy for step-up to breakdown ESD tests to significantly accelerate sample characterization. *This work was supported by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship and funding through NASA GSFC and the James Webb Space Telescope...|$|E

This paradigm exposes sessions to various attacks along this path, such as eavesdropping, DoS attacks etc. As a result, certain nodes or network regions may form security threats {{and it is}} desired to consider node routing schemes which avoid them. The task of node avoidance routing is particularly challenging in distance-vector networks, where only shortest- distance information is available to the nodes. We address this problem by proposing a new routing paradigm in which the forwarding mechanism exploits the distance-vector information towards several nodes and utilizes it to forward network traffic on <b>non-shortest</b> paths routes; in particular on node-avoiding routes aiming at bypassing security-suspected nodes. We study this paradigm, propose a routing algorithm based on it and establish their properties. Extensive evaluation of the algorithm in general situations is conducted via simulation.

The key contribution of DIV, besides its ability to operate with any routing algorithm, is an update mechanism using simple message exchanges between neighboring nodes that guarantees loopfreedom at all times. DIV provably outperforms existing loopprevention algorithms in several key metrics such as frequency of synchronous updates {{and the ability to}} maintain paths during transitions. Simulation results quantifying these gains in the context of shortest path routing are presented. In addition, DIV’s universal applicability is illustrated by studying its use with a routing that operates according to a <b>non-shortest</b> path objective.

Finding similar substrings/substructures is {{a central}} task in {{analyzing}} huge amounts of string data such as genome sequences, web documents, log data, etc. In the sense of complexity theory, the existence of polynomial time algorithms for such problems is usually trivial since the number of substrings is bounded by the square of their lengths.

This paper ad-dresses the problems of finding pairs of strings with small Hamming distances from huge databases composed of short strings. By solving the problem for all the substrings of fixed length, we can efficiently find candi-dates of similar <b>non-short</b> substrings.
