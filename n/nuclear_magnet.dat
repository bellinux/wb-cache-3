40|$|Seven {{alcohols}} {{are being}} analyzed using <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Magnet</b> Resonance (NMR) {{to determine the}} chemical shifts of the hydrogen on the alcohol group. The oxygen in the alcohol group is more electronegative which causes the hydrogen closer to its electronegative field to shift down field on the NMR. This helps determine {{the location of the}} alcohol group based on the location of the peaks on the NMR spectra. The reason these alcohols are being analyzed using NMR is to compare them with the theoretical shifts that were calculated using the Gaussian 94 and Gaussian 98 programs. The theoretical shifts were calculated at two different temperatures: ambient and at 148. 6 Celsius. Each alcohol will be analyzed in gas phase using TMS as a reference solvent. In an ethanol spectra TMS will be located at 0 parts per million (ppm) on the NMR spectra, the CH 2 will be located 3. 687 ppm, the OH group will be located 2. 61 ppm, and the CH 3 will be located at 1. 226 ppm...|$|E
40|$|Disruption of {{peripheral}} circadian rhyme pathways dominantly {{leads to}} metabolic disorders. Studies on circadian rhythm proteins {{in the heart}} indicated a role for Clock or Per 2 in cardiac metabolism. In contrast to Clock 2 / 2, Per 22 / 2 mice have larger infarct sizes with deficient lactate production during myocardial ischemia. To test the hypothesis that cardiac Per 2 represents an important regulator of cardiac metabolism during myocardial ischemia, we measured lactate during reperfusion in Per 12 / 2, Per 22 / 2 or wildtype mice. As lactate measurements in whole blood indicated an exclusive role of Per 2 in controlling lactate production during myocardial ischemia, we next performed gene array studies using various ischemia-reperfusion protocols comparing wildtype and Per 22 / 2 mice. Surprisingly, high-throughput gene array analysis revealed dominantly lipid metabolism as the differentially regulated pathway in wildtype mice when compared to Per 22 / 2. In all ischemia-reperfusion protocols used, the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase, which is essential in fatty acid beta-oxidation, was regulated in wildtype animals only. Studies using <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnet</b> resonance imaging (NMRI) confirmed altered fatty acid populations with higher mono-unsaturated fatty acid levels in hearts from Per 22 / 2 mice. Unexpectedly, studies on gene regulation during reperfusion revealed solely pro inflammatory genes as differentially regulated ‘Per 2 -genes’. Subsequent studies on inflammatory markers showed increasing IL- 6 or TNFa levels during reperfusion in Per 22 / 2 mice. In summary, these studies reveal an important role of cardiac Per 2 for fatty acid metabolism and inflammation durin...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for solving nonlinear systems of differential, or integrodifferential, equations with stochastic fields. The method {{makes it possible}} to give an accurate solution for an interesting physical problem: What are the peculiarities of nonlinear spin dynamics in nonequilibrium <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnets</b> coupled with a resonator? Evolution equations for nuclear spins are derived basing on a Hamiltonian with dipole interactions. The ensemble of spins is coupled with a resonator electric circuit. Seven types of main relaxation regimes are found: free induction, collective induction, free relaxation, collective relaxation, weak superradiance, pure superradiance, and triggered superradiance. The initial motion of spins can be originated by two reasons, either by an imposed initial coherence or by local spin fluctuations due to nonsecular dipole interactions. The relaxation regimes caused by the second reason cannot be described by the Bloch equations. Numerical estimates show good agreement with experiment. 2 I...|$|R

40|$|The {{applications}} involving {{electromagnetic fields}} are so pervasive {{that it is}} difficult to estimate their contribution to the industrial output: generation of electricity, power transmission lines, electric motors, actuators, relays, radio, TV and microwave transmission and reception, magnetic storage, and even the mundane little magnet used to hold a paper note on the refrigerator are all electromagnetic in nature. One would be hard pressed to find a device that works without relaying on any electromagnetic principle or effect. This text provides a good theoretical understanding of the electromagnetic field equations but also treats a large number of applications. In fact, no topic is presented unless it is directly applicable to engineering design or unless it is needed for the understanding of another topic. In electrostatics, for example, the text includes discussions of photocopying, ink-jet printing, electrostatic separation and deposition, sandpaper production, paint spraying, and powder coating. In magnetics, the applications discussed include electric motors, implantable <b>magnets,</b> <b>nuclear</b> magnetic resonance, magnetic stirring of molten materials, and electromagnetic braking and bearings. Electric motors and transformers are used to demonstrate the ideas of magnetic forces and torques and of induction; the applications discussed include the new super-efficient electric drives, linear induction motors, and implantable transformers to power life-sustaining devices. The discussion of wave-propagation phenomena will include applications of new materials to aerospace systems, such as the so-called stealth materials, as well as the use of electromagnetic weaves for materials processing, such as grain drying with microwaves, microwave detection of explosives, and remote sensing of the earth and its resources...|$|R
40|$|Magnetos de Nd-Fe-B produzidos por metalurgia do pó são altamente susceptíveis à corrosão devido à porosidade intrínseca e à sua microestrutura complexa. Por outro lado, tais ímãs apresentam excelentes propriedades magnéticas tendo por isso várias aplicações. Na área nuclear, os ímãs permanentes à base de terras raras-metais de transição-boro (Nd-Fe-B) são utilizados na fabricação de suportes magnéticos (levitação magnética) para ultra-centrífugas utilizadas no enriquecimento isotópico do urânio natural de utilização em reatores nucleares. Em Odontologia são utilizados para fixar próteses totais e parciais sobre implantes, em Ortodontia, para corrigir maloclusões e fazer movimentações dentárias e em Cirurgia buco-maxilo-facial para fixar próteses de grandes defeitos da face. Em equipamentos eletrônicos, os magnetos são utilizados em balanças, cadeados, motores elétricos e principalmente na confecção de discos rígidos de computadores. Diante disso, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o comportamento de corrosão do magneto e testar tratamentos superficiais a fim de substituir principalmente os tratamentos com cromato que hoje em dia não estão sendo mais utilizados principalmente devido à sua toxicidade e altos custos dos tratamentos dos resíduos. A avaliação da resistência à corrosão foi feita através da análise de curvas de polarização potenciodinâmica, espectroscopia de impedância eletroquímica, medidas de potencial de corrosão versus tempo e microscopia eletrônica de varredura a fim de associar a microestrutura ao comportamento de corrosão apresentado pelas amostras. Os resultados obtidos mostram que estes magnetos são altamente susceptíveis à corrosão e esta ocorre preferencialmente na fase rica em Nd, localizada nos contornos da fase matriz e magnética (). Tratamentos para proteção da superfície com revestimento de silano, revestimento de conversão de cério, moléculas auto-organizáveis (SAM), Cr hexavalente, fosfato tricatiônico seguido por passivação em solução de trióxido de cromo, e revestimento de fosfato obtido por imersão por 24 h em solução de NaH 2 PO 4 (pH= 3, 8) seguido de imersão em solução de sulfato de zinco não melhoraram a resistência à corrosão do magneto. Dentre os tratamentos utilizados, o de fosfatização por 24 h em solução de NaH 2 PO 4 (pH= 3, 8) foi muito superior, conferindo maior proteção contra corrosão quando comparado com os outros tipos de tratamentos testados.

The evaluation of the corrosion resistance was carried out through the analysis potentiodynamic polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, monitoring of corrosion potential as a function of test time and scanning electron microscopy to try to correlate the magnet microstructure with its corrosion resistance. The results show that these magnets are highly susceptible to corrosion that occurs preferentially in the Nd-rich phase, located in the boundaries of the magnetic matrix phase (). Treatment with silane, cerium, sam, Cr 6 +, tricationic phosphate followed by bath of chromium trioxide and in NaH 2 PO 4 solution for 24 hours followed by bath of zinc sulphate did not improve the corrosion resistance of the magnet. Among the treatments used, immersion in NaH 2 PO 4 solution for 24 hours pH= 3. 8 was the one that provided the best corrosion protection against corrosion, when compared with the other types of tested treatments...|$|R
