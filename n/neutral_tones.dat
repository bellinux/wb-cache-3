25|$|The {{neutral tone}} is attested in the Fuzhou dialect, {{as well as}} being found in the Southern Min group and in {{varieties}} of Mandarin Chinese, including Beijing-based Standard Mandarin. It is commonly found in some modal particles, aspect markers, and some question-forming negative particles that come after units made up of one tone sandhi domain, and in some adverbs, aspect markers, conjunctions etc. that come before such units. These two types, the post-nucleus and the pre-nucleus neutral tone, exhibit different tone sandhi behavior. Disyllabic neutral tone words are also attested, as are some inter-nuclei <b>neutral</b> <b>tones,</b> mainly connected to the use of 蜀 siŏh // in verbal reduplication.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Etty's {{elevation}} to Academician, he exhibited two paintings at the Summer Exhibition in 1829, Benaiah, David's Chief Captain and Hero, Having Thrown Herself from the Tower at the Sight of Leander Drowned, Dies on his Body. Benaiah is on the same large scale as The Combat at 398cm (13ft 1in) wide, and is a very similar composition, although {{in place of the}} woman begging for mercy is the body of a dead soldier. Hero recycles the pose of the dead soldier from Benaiah as the dying Hero as she lies on the body of her dead lover. Unusually for Etty, Hero is painted in intentionally <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> rather than his usual Venetian colours, and the composition uses foreshortening of the bodies to create a single diagonal across the canvas. For the rest of his life, Etty considered Hero to be [...] "the finest of my fine pictures".|$|E
2500|$|Distinctive {{features}} of the Beijing dialect are the use of erhua, a final [...] "er" [...] (...) sound, often as a diminutive, in vocabulary items that are left unadorned in descriptions of the standard such as the Xiandai Hanyu Cidian, {{as well as more}} <b>neutral</b> <b>tones.</b> An example of standard versus Beijing dialect would be the standard men (door) and Beijing menr.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates how the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> when {{preceded by}} {{different}} full tones under different focus conditions, behaves in question intonation in Mandarin. Results indicate that 1) the preceding full/neutral tone largely determines the local F 0 {{trajectory of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> but the latter also gradually converges {{over the course of}} several <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> syllables, 2) post-focus lowering, which is caused by the effect of focus, occurs in both neutral-tone-ending and High-tone-ending sentences, with the interrogative intonation in questions realized as an upward shift starting from the focused word, and 3) sentence-final <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> has a falling contour even in questions, thus contrasting with sentence-final High tone, which has a rising contour in questions.

5000|$|Also called fifth tone or zeroth tone (in Chinese [...] qīng shēng, literal meaning: [...] "light tone"), <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> is {{sometimes}} {{thought of as}} a lack of tone. It is associated with weak syllables, which are generally somewhat shorter than tonic syllables. The pitch of a syllable with <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> is determined by the tone of the preceding syllable. The following table shows the pitch at which the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> is pronounced in Standard Chinese after each of the four main tones. The situation differs by dialect, and in some regions, notably Taiwan, the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> is relatively uncommon.|$|R
2500|$|The {{forces of}} the East India Company in India were forced by {{casualties}} to dye their white summer tunics to <b>neutral</b> <b>tones,</b> initially a tan called khaki (from the Hindi word for [...] "dusty"). This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the Second Boer War in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on dun for Service Dress. The Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was calm and hazy, and Lisle lounged with great content in a basket-chair on Millicent's lawn. His hostess sat near by, looking listless, a somewhat unusual thing for her, and Miss Hume, her elderly companion, genial {{in spite of}} her precise formality, was industriously embroidering something not far away. There was not a breath of wind astir; a soft gray sky streaked with long bars of stronger color hung motionless over the wide prospect. Wood and moorland ridge and distant hill had faded to dimness of contour and quiet <b>neutral</b> <b>tones.</b> Indeed, the whole scene seemed steeped in a profound tranquillity, intensified only by the murmur of the river.|$|E
60|$|The farmer's {{wife had}} promised to find Flora quarters, the men were offered {{accommodation}} in a barn, and when the air cooled sharply in the evening, Edgar walked out on to the prairie with the girl. She had kept near him since his arrival, but he was inclined to believe this was rather {{on account of his}} association with George than because she found any charm in his society. By and by, they sat down on a low rise from which they could see the sweep of grass run on, changing to shades of blue and purple, toward the smoky red glare of sunset on its western rim. To the south, it was all dim and steeped in dull <b>neutral</b> <b>tones,</b> conveying an idea of vast distance.|$|E
5000|$|In dictionaries, <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> may be {{indicated}} by a dot preceding the syllable; for example, ·ma. When a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> syllable has an alternative pronunciation in another tone {{a combination of}} tone marks may be used: zhī·dào (...) [...]|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} an acoustic {{analysis of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> in Brunei Mandarin. Recordings were made of a short text by 20 Bruneian (BN) and 20 Beijing Chi-nese (CN) speakers. F 0 contours and duration of three categories of disyllabic words for the BN and CN data were compared. It {{was found that the}} BN data tends to have a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> on grammatical morphemes such as le (perfective) and de (possessive) but not on the second syllable of other words that would have a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> in Standard Mandarin such as yīfu (‘clothes’) or reduplicates such as māma (‘mother’). In addition, {{it was found that the}} F 0 contour shows a clear distinction between BN and CN for the redupli-cated kinship term māma (‘mother’), but duration is a better indicator of the presence of a <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> for the other categories...|$|R

60|$|Edgar did {{not answer}} him. He was looking out of the open window, and now {{that there was little}} to obstruct his view, the {{prospect}} interested him. It had been a wet spring, and round the vast half-circle he commanded the prairie ran back to the horizon, brightly green, until its strong coloring gave place in the distance to soft <b>neutral</b> <b>tones.</b> It was blotched with crimson flowers; in the marshy spots there were streaks of purple; broad squares of darker wheat checkered the sweep of grass, and dwarf woods straggled across it in broken lines. In one place was the gleam of a little lake. Over it all there hung a sky of dazzling blue, across which great rounded cloud-masses rolled.|$|E

50|$|Very rarely, a tone letter {{consists}} {{of more than}} three elements (peaking or dipping tones), but occasionally, double-peaking or double-dipping tones are encountered.

50|$|The tone marks used in Zhuyin for the second, third, {{and fourth}} tones {{are the same}} as the ones used in Hanyu Pinyin.

50|$|Mandarin dialects {{frequently}} employ <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> in {{the second}} syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light {{that it is difficult}} or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.|$|E
50|$|More {{often than}} not, {{character}} colorisations tend {{to represent the}} character in some way. A more subdued character will be coloured with lighter tones, while a flamboyant character will be done in bright tones. Similarly, villains are often coloured in darker tones, while colder characters will be given <b>neutral</b> <b>tones</b> (black, white, grey, etc.).|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{contrast}} between weak and full syllables is often distinctive, the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> is often not described as a full-fledged tone; some linguists feel that it results from a [...] "spreading out" [...] of the tone on the preceding syllable. This idea is appealing because without it, the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone</b> needs relatively complex tone sandhi rules to be made sense of; indeed, {{it would have to}} have four allotones, one {{for each of the four}} tones that could precede it. However, the [...] "spreading" [...] theory incompletely characterizes the <b>neutral</b> <b>tone,</b> especially in sequences where more than one neutral-tone syllable is found adjacent.|$|R
