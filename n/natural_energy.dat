At that time, Naruto learns that the Fourth Hokage was his father who sealed the Fox so that Naruto could use it to defeat the Akatsuki founder Tobi who was behind the Fox's attack on Konohagakure.|$|E
25|$|Just as a gun recoils when {{a bullet}} is fired, {{conservation}} of momentum requires a nucleus (such as in a gas) to recoil during emission or absorption of a gamma ray. If a nucleus at rest emits a gamma ray, {{the energy of}} the gamma ray is slightly less than the <b>natural</b> <b>energy</b> of the transition, but in order for a nucleus at rest to absorb a gamma ray, the gamma ray's energy must be slightly greater than the <b>natural</b> <b>energy,</b> because in both cases energy is lost to recoil. This means that nuclear resonance (emission and absorption of the same gamma ray by identical nuclei) is unobservable with free nuclei, because the shift in energy is too great and the emission and absorption spectra have no significant overlap.|$|E

The purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for OTEC heat exchangers, increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost (heat exchangers being the #1 cost driver for an OTEC plant). And in March 2013, Makai announced an award to install and operate a 100 kilowatt turbine on the OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility, and once again connect OTEC power to the grid.|$|E

The temperature difference between {{roots in the}} cool soil and leaves in the warm air allows plants that evolved in temperate climates to be grown in the subtropics. Dr. John P. Craven, Dr. Jack Davidson and Richard Bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the <b>Natural</b> <b>Energy</b> Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). The research facility demonstrated that more than 100 different crops can be grown using this system. Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.|$|E

A user can master Senjutsu by combining their chakra with [...] "natures energy", a task that can only be completed by ninja with particularly large chakra reserves who learn to harmonize with nature by remaining perfectly still – anyone else who tries is quickly overwhelmed by this <b>natural</b> <b>energy,</b> as seen when Jugo's Clan rendered mentally unstable with fits of rage. For those who learn under the Great Toad Sage, the overdose of <b>natural</b> <b>energy</b> turns them into giant stone toad statues though this effect can be neutralized with the sage's beating stick. If the user is able to use Senjutsu, they only have {{a certain amount of time}} before the natural energies are expended, as the user will need to move around the battlefield and Senjutsu requires to user to remain still. Workarounds for this shortfall include summoning frog assistants or using shadow clones to help gather the energy. Those who master Senjutsu are able to enter a state called [...] where user adopts the physical features of the animal mentor. Because of the difficulty in maintaining the <b>natural</b> <b>energy,</b> only a few people have been able to properly master Senjutsu; Naruto Uzumaki is stated to be the first Senjutsu user under the tutelage of the Great Toad Sage, Gamamaru, who has achieved this feat. Ninja who are able to use Senjutsu include Jiraiya, Minato Namikaze, and Hashirama Senju; Kabuto Yakushi are also able to use Senjutsu, seemingly without the aid of an animal mentor. Because the chakra utilized is from the natural world, Senjutsu is an effective weapon against the Ten-Tails and Yin-Yang Style users.|$|E

The Luminoth lived peacefully, protecting the planet's pure <b>natural</b> <b>energy,</b> which they call the [...] "Light of Aether". Five decades before the game's events, a Phazon meteor collides into the planet and leaves a scar causing environmental damage and splitting the planetary energy. The split creates another planet in an alternate dimension, Dark Aether, a mirror version of Aether that is dark, arid, and has a poisonous atmosphere. Dark Aether becomes home to the Ing, cruel shapeshifting creatures who intend to destroy the Luminoth, {{and are able to}} possess bodies of the living, the dead, and the artificially intelligent. Eventually, the Ing and the Luminoth engage in a war over the planet's energywhichever race controls it is capable of destroying the other.|$|E

His clan {{has the ability to}} use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of <b>natural</b> <b>energy</b> they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with {{additional}} side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling. After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation. Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz.|$|E
