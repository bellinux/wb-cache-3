5|$|According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, the <b>Nakhichevan</b> uyezd of the Erivan Governorate had a {{population}} of 100,771, of which 34,672 were Armenian (34.4%), while Caucasian Tatars (Azerbaijanis) numbered 64,151 or 63.7% of the total population. The proportion of Armenian was around 40% prior to World War I. <b>Nakhichevan</b> was disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan from 1918 to 1920 during the countries' brief independence. The Armenian population of <b>Nakhichevan</b> largely fled the area during the Ottoman invasion in 1918. By June 1919, after the British troops left the area, Armenia succeeded in establishing control over <b>Nakhichevan.</b> Some of the <b>Nakhichevan</b> Armenians returned to their homes in summer 1919. Again, more violence erupted in 1919 leaving some 10,000 Armenians dead and some 45 Armenian villages destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Armenian {{tradition}} {{says that}} <b>Nakhichevan</b> (Նախիջևան Naxidjevan in Armenian and Naxçıvan in Azerbaijani) {{was founded by}} Noah. Armenians {{have been living in}} <b>Nakhichevan</b> since ancient times. It was one of gavars of Vaspurakan province of the Kingdom of Armenia. In 189 BC, Nakhchivan became part of the new Kingdom of Armenia established by Artaxias I. Within the kingdom, the region of present-day <b>Nakhichevan</b> was part of the Ayrarat, Vaspurakan and Syunik provinces.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} <b>Nakhichevan</b> {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its {{geographic}} position, it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of <b>Nakhichevan</b> and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of <b>Nakhichevan</b> {{to leave their homes}} and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, <b>Nakhichevan</b> became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to <b>Nakhichevan,</b> while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E

5|$|As life in Armenia grew {{relatively}} more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought {{to locate a}} woman he had met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in <b>Nakhichevan</b> with her family, had been married to an Armenian officer {{who had been killed}} during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who {{went on to become a}} painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.|$|E
5|$|As the Turkish forces moved towards <b>Nakhichevan,</b> Andranik {{with his}} Armenian Special Striking Division {{moved to the}} mountainous region of Zangezur {{to set up a}} defense. By mid-1918, the {{relations}} between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur had deteriorated. Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30,000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3,000 and 5,000 men. He established effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a connection point between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Under Andranik, the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum.|$|E
5|$|Most Armenian {{geographical}} names {{were in the}} eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, <b>Nakhichevan,</b> Tatvan), signify an Armenian name. Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was especially true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Van in 1846, {{he married}} Mariam Sevikian. In 1847 he crossed to Persia and the Russian Caucasus, where {{he visited the}} Ararat plain, Shirak, and <b>Nakhichevan.</b> He lived in Alexandropol (Gyumri) for six months. In 1848 once again moved to Constantinople via Tiflis, Batumi, and Trabzon. From 1848 to 1850 he taught at an all-girl school in Constantinople's Khasgiugh (Hasköy) quarter. In 1851 he {{traveled}} to Cilicia where {{he was sent to}} report on the state of Armenian schools. By traveling and living in various Armenian-populated provinces, he acquired an intimate knowledge of the problems and aspirations of ordinary Armenians. He was upset with the apathy the upper and middle classes of the Armenian community of Constantinople showed towards provincial Armenians.|$|E
5|$|Aram Khachaturian {{was born}} on 6 June (24 May in Old Style) 1903 {{in the city of}} Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia) into an Armenian family. Some sources {{indicate}} Kojori, a village near Tiflis (now in Georgia's Gardabani Municipality), as his birthplace. His father, Yeghia (Ilya), was born in the village of Upper Aza near Ordubad in <b>Nakhichevan</b> (present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan) and moved to Tiflis at the age of 13; he owned a bookbinding shop by the age of 25. His mother, Kumash Sarkisovna, was from Lower Aza, also a village near Ordubad. Khachaturian's parents were betrothed before knowing each other, when Kumash was 9 and Yeghia was 19. They had 5 children, one daughter and four sons, of whom Aram was the youngest. Khachaturian received primary education at the commercial school of Tiflis, a school for merchants. He considered a career either in medicine or engineering.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the National Bank of Azerbaijan minted {{a pair of}} {{gold and}} silver {{commemorative}} coins for the 85th anniversary {{of the creation of}} the <b>Nakhichevan</b> Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, Azerbaijan {{had been}} the {{deployment}} area of units of the Soviet 4th Army whose principle formations in 1988 included four motor rifle divisions (23rd Guards, 60th, 75th, and 295th). The 75th Motor Rifle Division was isolated in <b>Nakhichevan.</b> The 4th Army also included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. The 75th Division's stores and equipment were apparently transferred to the <b>Nakhichevan</b> authorities. Azerbaijan also hosted the 49th Arsenal of the Soviet Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery, which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units.|$|E
25|$|The Autonomous Republic of <b>Nakhichevan</b> in Azerbaijan {{has issued}} a {{resolution}} recognizing the independence of Northern Cyprus. As {{a result of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh issue, however, Azerbaijan itself has not recognised North Cyprus.|$|E

25|$|However, {{after the}} {{break-up}} of the USSR and {{the closing of}} the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan the Jolfa connection became a dead end, as it only links Iran with the isolated <b>Nakhichevan</b> exclave of the Republic of Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|An often-used {{policy by}} the Persians was the {{appointment}} of Turks as local rulers as so called khans of their various khanates. These were counted as subordinate to the Persian Empire. Examples include: the Khanate of Erevan, Khanate of <b>Nakhichevan</b> and the Karabakh Khanate.|$|E
25|$|With the {{annexation}} of eastern Armenia - i.e. Karabakh, Yerevan, <b>Nakhichevan</b> and Kars provinces - into the Russian Empire the titles, traditions and social {{institutions of the}} Russian nobility become dominant among the Armenian aristocrats as they were integrated into the imperial nobility Russian (rather western) style.|$|E
25|$|Azerbaijan claimed {{most of the}} {{territory}} Armenia was sitting on, demanding all or {{most parts of the}} former Russian provinces of Elizavetpol, Tiflis, Yerevan, Kars and Batum.

25|$|After the war, The Georgian-Armenian War 1918 soon {{followed}} over the Javakheti and Lori provinces, with Armenia gaining the latter. Armenia and Azerbaijan {{engaged in the}} Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918–1920) over Karabakh and <b>Nakhichevan,</b> with Armenia losing both due to Soviet intervention {{in favor of the}} anti west Turkish National Movement. The Turkish–Armenian War of 1920 resulted in the occupation/depopulation of even more Armenian land.|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} {{degree of}} hostility existed between Armenia and its new {{neighbor to the}} east, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, stemming largely from racial, religious, cultural and societal differences. The Azeris had close ethnic and religious ties to the Turks and had provided material support for them in their drive to Baku in 1918. Although {{the borders of the}} two countries were still undefined, Azerbaijan claimed most of the territory Armenia was sitting on, demanding all or most parts of the former Russian provinces of Elizavetpol, Tiflis, Yerevan, Kars and Batum. As diplomacy failed to accomplish compromise, even with the mediation of the commanders of a British expeditionary force that had installed itself in the Caucasus, territorial clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan took place throughout 1919 and 1920, most notably in the regions of <b>Nakhichevan,</b> Karabakh, and Syunik (Zangezur). Repeated attempts to bring these provinces under Azerbaijani jurisdiction were met with fierce resistance by their Armenian inhabitants. In May 1919, Dro led an expeditionary unit that was successful in establishing Armenian administrative control in <b>Nakhichevan.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1604, Shah Abbas I of Iran, {{concerned}} that the skilled peoples of <b>Nakhichevan,</b> its natural resources, and the surrounding areas could get in danger due to its relatively {{close proximity to the}} Ottoman-Persian frontline, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced the entire hundreds of thousands of local population—Muslims, Jews and Armenians alike—to leave their homes and move to the provinces south of the Aras River.|$|E
25|$|The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has around 106 {{aircraft}} and 35 helicopters. The country has four major airbases. Nasosnaya (air base) has fighters, Kyurdamir Air Base a bomber regiment, Ganja Air Base transports, and Baku Kala Air Base the helicopter unit. There are also four other airbases {{which do not}} appear to have aircraft based there. These are Dollyar Air Base, <b>Nakhichevan</b> Airport, Sanqacal Air Base, and Sitalcay Air Base.|$|E
25|$|In 1604, Shah Abbas I {{pursued a}} scorched-earth {{campaign}} against the Ottomans in the Ararat valley during the Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18). The old Armenian town of Julfa {{in the province of}} <b>Nakhichevan</b> was taken early in the invasion. From there Abbas' army fanned out across the Araratian plain. The Shah pursued a careful strategy, advancing and retreating as the occasion demanded, determined not to risk his enterprise in a direct confrontation with stronger enemy forces.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Yerevan that Roshdieh met Nasser-al-Din Shah, who {{took him to}} <b>Nakhichevan.</b> Roshdieh later return to his birthplace in Tabriz, where he {{established}} the first primary schools in Iran in 1886 or 1887. While Ahmad Kasravi has claimed in his book that the primary school were established {{with the help of}} Ali Khan Amin od-Dowle, the then Premier of Iran, this cannot be confirmed by the records of Fakhreddin Roshdieh, Mirza Hassan's son.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} named Armenian churches {{known to have}} existed in the <b>Nakhichevan</b> region is over 280. In as early as 1648 French {{traveller}} Alexandre de Rhodes reported seeing more than ten thousand Armenian tombstones made of marble in Julfa. The number of ecclesiastical monuments still standing in Nakhchivan in the 1980s {{is estimated to be}} between 59 and 100. The author and journalist Sylvain Besson believes them to have all been subsequently destroyed as part of a campaign by the Government of Azerbaijan to erase all traces of Armenian culture on its soil.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Guliyev was {{discharged}} from the army. He worked as deputy Minister of Education of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. He was later Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the republic. In 1953, he graduated from the Higher Party School of the Azerbaijan Communist Party. He worke as chairman of the Nakhchivan City Council and department head of the Babak District Executive Committee. Guliyev lived in <b>Nakhichevan.</b> On 6 November 1985, he was awarded a second Order of the Patriotic War 1st class on the 40th anniversary of {{the end of the}} war. He died on 30 December 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 1243, Queen Rusudan of Georgia {{signed a}} peace treaty with the Mongols in {{accordance}} with which Georgia lost her client-states, ceded western Shirvan, <b>Nakhichevan</b> and some other territories and agreed {{to pay tribute to}} the Mongols as well as to let them occupy and de facto rule {{more than half of the}} remaining territory. Although Mongol-occupied Tbilisi remained an official capital of the kingdom, the Queen refused to return there and stayed in Kutaisi until her death in 1245. In addition to all the above hardships, even the part of the kingdom that remained free of the Mongols started disintegrating: The Crown started losing control over the warlords of Samtskhe (southern provinces of Georgia) who established their own relations with the Mongols and by the year 1266 practically seceded from Georgia.|$|E
25|$|As it was {{impossible}} for Iran to give up Georgia, which had made part of the concept of Iran for centuries like the rest of its Caucasian territories, the annexation of Kartli-Kakheti led directly to the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century, namely that of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828. During the 1804-1813 war, the Russians scored a crucial victory over the Iranian army at the Zagam river saving Tbilisi from Iranian reconquest. The war eventually ended with the Treaty of Gulistan, which forced Iran to officially cede eastern Georgia, Dagestan, as well as most of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic to Russia. By the 1826-28 war, Russia took modern-day Armenia, the <b>Nakhichevan</b> Khanate, the Lankaran Khanate and Iğdır from Iran. Thus, by 1828, the Russians had gained an immensely strong foothold in the Caucasus. Parts of western Georgia were added to the empire during the same period through wars with the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Smbat's successes shortly {{came to a}} halt when Afshin {{decided that}} he could not countenance a {{powerful}} Armenia so close to his domains. He retook Dvin and managed to take Smbat's wife as a hostage until she was released in exchange for Smbat's son and nephew. The wars against Armenia continued even after Afshin's death in 901, when his brother Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj became ostikan of Arminiya. While Yusuf's reign was not immediately hostile, Smbat committed a series of blunders which led to several of his allies to turn their backs on him: having sought to placate his eastern ally, Smbat of Syunik, by ceding to him <b>Nakhichevan</b> city, Smbat inadvertently drove Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan into Yusuf's arms since the city was a part of Gagik's domains. Yusuf took advantage of this feud by awarding Gagik a crown in 908, thus making him King Gagik I of Vaspurakan and creating an Armenian state opposed to the one led by Smbat.|$|E
25|$|However, Umayyad rule in Armenia grew in cruelty in {{the early}} 8th century. Revolts against the Arabs spread {{throughout}} Armenia until 705, when under the pretext of meeting for negotiations, the Arab ostikan of <b>Nakhichevan</b> massacred {{almost all of the}} Armenian nobility. The Arabs attempted to conciliate with the Armenians but the levying of higher taxes, impoverishment of the country {{due to a lack of}} regional trade, and the Umayyads' preference of the Bagratuni family over the Mamikonians (other notable families included the Artsruni, Kamsarakan, and Rshtuni) made this difficult to accomplish. Taking advantage of the overthrow of the Umayyads by the 'Abbasids, a second rebellion was conceived although it too was met with failure partly because of the frictional relationship between the Bagratuni and Mamikonian families. The rebellion's failure also resulted in the near disintegration of the Mamikonian house which lost most of the land it controlled (members of the Artstruni house were able to escape and settle in Vaspurakan).|$|E
25|$|Several {{contemporary}} manuscripts {{from the}} 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes {{been attributed to}} Roslin. MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at Nor <b>Nakhichevan</b> and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions passant in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are {{much closer to the}} ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s. Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum leaves from the Gospel of John have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in Vaspurakan.|$|E
25|$|Intimately and {{inseparably}} intertwined histories for millennia, Turkic Qajar state, which ruled today's Iran irrevocably {{lost the}} territory that is nowadays Azerbaijan {{in the course}} of the 19th century. With the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 following the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) Turkic Qajar state had to cede eastern Georgia, its possessions in the North Caucasus and many of those in what is today the Azerbaijan Republic, which included Baku Khanate, Shirvan Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, Ganja Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Quba Khanate, and parts of the Talysh Khanate. Derbent (Darband) Khanate of Dagestan was also lost to Russia. These Khanates comprise most of what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan in Southern Russia. By the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828 following the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), the result was even more disastrous, and resulted in Turkic Qajar state being forced to cede the <b>Nakhichevan</b> Khanate and the Mughan regions to Russia, as well as Erivan Khanate, and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. All these territories together, lost in 1813 and 1828 combined, constitute all of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia, and southern Dagestan. The area to the North of the river Aras, among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan was historically a Turkic territory until they were occupied by Russia {{in the course of}} the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|In August 1987, the Armenian National Academy of Sciences {{started a}} {{petition}} to transfer <b>Nakhichevan</b> and Nagorno-Karabakh under jurisdiction of Armenia. In the nationalist movement to unite Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, Armenians [...] "used {{the example of the}} slow [...] "de-Armenianization" [...] of <b>Nakhichevan</b> {{in the course of the}} twentieth century as an example of what they feared would happen to them." [...] During the Nagorno-Karabakh War, clashes occurred between Armenian and Azeri forces in the Nakhichevan-Armenia border, however, the war did not spill over into <b>Nakhichevan.</b> Turkey, Azerbaijan's close ally, threatened to intervene if Armenia invaded <b>Nakhichevan.</b> <b>Nakhichevan</b> was in center of attention during the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa in the 2000s.
