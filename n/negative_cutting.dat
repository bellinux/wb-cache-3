50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>cutting</b> (also {{known as}} {{negative}} matching and negative conforming) {{is the process}} of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the film editor. Original camera negative (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a film splicer and film cement. <b>Negative</b> <b>cutting</b> is part of the post-production process and occurs after editing and prior to striking internegatives and release prints. The process of <b>negative</b> <b>cutting</b> has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process. Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s.

The cutting and thrust forces were measured by means of load washer under different <b>negative</b> rake angles, <b>cutting</b> speeds, and depths of cut. In each cutting condition, the thrust and cutting forces increased linearly with increasing cross sectional area of groove. Forces with diamond grains were greater in almost cases than the cutting with CBN grains, and much influenced by cutting condition. On the other hand, no significant influence except for rake angle was seen in forces in cutting with CBN grain. Furthermore, the friction angles under each cutting condition was calculated to detect the deformation condition in front of rake face at chip formation. It changed largely with grain type, rake angle and cutting speed. There was a quite difference between diamond and CBN grains. The reason for the difference would be the difference in coefficient of friction of two grain types...|$|R

Every month, cuttings with young inflorescences of Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea were exposed for 24 hours to water collected at three sites in the park: (S 1) head of the main stream; (S 2) head of a secondary stream; (S 3) a point past the junction of the two water bodies in which S 1 and S 2 were located. As a <b>negative</b> control, <b>cuttings</b> were exposed to distilled water for 24 h every quarter. Micronuclei (MCN) frequency was determined in young tetrads of pollen mother cells and described as MCN/ 100 tetrads. Rainfall data were also recorded. In nine months at S 1 and S 2, and in eleven months at S 3, micronuclei frequencies were significantly higher than in quarterly controls, in which frequencies varied from 1. 19 to 1. 62. During sampling, {{no significant differences were found}} in MCN frequencies at S 1, which ranged from 2. 2 to 3. 6.

There were no associations between rainfall and MCN frequencies at the three sampling sites. Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea confirmed genotoxicity in the water bodies of the PMHLR, even at the head of the streams, which suggests that actions should be promoted to control anthropogenic effects in the streams of this conservation unit. </p...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium alloy has {{attracted}} more attentions {{due to its}} excellent mechanical properties. However, in process of dry cutting operation, many problems restrict its further development. In this article, the effect of cutting parameters on machinabilities of magnesium alloy is explored under dry milling condition. This research {{is an attempt to}} investigate the impact of cutting speed at multiple feed rates on cutting force and surface roughness, while a statistical analysis is adopted to determine the influential intensities accurately. The results showed that cutting force is affected by the positively constant intensity from feed rate and the increasingly <b>negative</b> intensity from <b>cutting</b> speed. In contrast, surface roughness is determined by the gradually increasing negative tendency from feed rate and the positive effect with constant intensity from cutting speed. Within the range of the experiments, feed rate is the leading contribution for cutting force while the cutting speed is the dominant factor for surface roughness according to the absolute intensity values. Meanwhile, the trends of influencing intensities between cutting force and surface roughness are opposite. Besides, it is also found that in milling magnesium alloy, chip morphology is highly sensitive to cutting speed while the chip quality mainly depends on feed rate...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{management}} and vegetation complexity affect arthropod diversity and may alter trophic interactions between predators and their prey. Web-building spiders are abundant generalist predators and important natural enemies of pests. We analyzed how management intensity (tillage, cutting of the vegetation, grazing by cattle, and synthetic and organic inputs) and vegetation complexity (plant species richness, vegetation height, coverage, and density) affect rarefied richness {{and composition of}} web-building spiders and their prey with respect to prey availability and aphid predation in 12 habitats, ranging from an uncut fallow to a conventionally managed maize field. Spiders and prey from webs were collected manually and the potential prey were quantified using sticky traps. The species richness of web-building spiders and the order richness of prey increased with plant diversity and vegetation coverage. Prey order richness was lower at tilled compared to no-till sites. Hemipterans (primarily aphids) were overrepresented, while dipterans, hymenopterans, and thysanopterans were underrepresented in webs compared to sticky traps. The per spider capture efficiency for aphids was higher at tilled than at no-till sites and decreased with vegetation complexity. After accounting for local densities, 1. 8 times more aphids were captured at uncut compared to cut sites. Our results emphasize the functional role of web-building spiders in aphid predation, but suggest <b>negative</b> effects of <b>cutting</b> or harvesting. We conclude that reduced management intensity and increased vegetation complexity help to conserve local invertebrate diversity, and that web-building spiders at sites under low management intensity (e. g., semi-natural habitats) contribute to aphid suppression at the landscape scale...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of cutting}} {{on the growth}} of Potamogeton lucens L and Potamogeton compressus L were studied indoor under {{experimental}} conditions. Plants were cut every {{time they reached the}} water surface, applying three depth treatments at which the plants were cut; halfway down the water column, at three-quarters down the water column and at the sediment-water interface. For both species short term <b>negative</b> effects of <b>cutting</b> on biomass production and survival were observed. P. lucens seemed to be the more tolerant species as only below-ground biomass was significantly lower when cutting biomass at the sediment-water interface together with a downward trend in shoot biomass at increasing cutting depth. The low below-ground biomass (less than 20 % of that in the controls) was caused by the death of most plants in this treatment. P. compressus was more vulnerable with every treatment resulting in significantly lower below-ground and green shoot biomass production. The lowest biomass for P. compressus was observed when plants were cut at the sediment-water interface with values more than 80 % lower compared to the controls, while cutting halfway and at three-quarters resulted in values 30 - 50 % lower compared to the controls. Long term effects of cutting on P. lucens might occur through decreased development of the rhizome network. Long term effects on reproduction of P. compressus might be expected as flowering decreased when cut at the sediment-water interface, while turion formation only occurred in the uncut controls. Additionally, the decreased biomass production by P. compressus may lead to a competitive disadvantage in the field as fast-growing, disturbance tolerant species such as Elodea nuttallii St. John may outcompete the species. Creating patchiness in mowing height and frequency or applying a mowing regime that leads to reduced biomass development while species still survive might create opportunities to both maintain the water transporting function of drainage ditches while preserving the species in the system...|$|R
40|$|There {{exists a}} wide variety of {{important}} applications for micro- and meso-scale mechanical systems in the commercial and defense sectors, which require high-strength materials and complex geometries that cannot be produced using current MEMS fabrication technologies. Micromilling has great potential to fill this void in MEMS technology by adding the capability of free form machining of complex 3 D shapes from {{a wide variety}} and combination of traditional, well-understood engineering alloys, glasses and ceramics. Inefficiencies in micromilling result from the relationships between a cutting tool's breaking strength, the applied cutting force, and the metal removal rate. Because machining times in mesofeatures scale inversely to the part size, a feature 1 / 10 th as large will take 10 times as long to machine. Also, required chip sizes of 1 m or less are cut with tools having edge radius of 2 - 3 m, the cutting edge effectively has a highly <b>negative</b> rake angle, <b>cutting</b> forces are increased significantly causing chip loads to be further reduced and the machining takes even longer than predicted above. However, cutting forces do not increase with cutting speed, so faster spindles with reduced tool runout are the path to achieve efficient mesoscale milling. This research explored the development of new ultra-high speed micromilling spindles. A novel air-bearing spindle design is discussed that will run at very high speeds (450, 000 rpm) and provide very minimal runout allowing the best use of micromilling cutters and reducing overall machining time drastically. Two generations of this spindle design were completed; one with an air bearing supported tool shaft and one with a novel rolling element bearing supported tool shaft. Both designs utilized friction-drive systems that relied on diameter differences between the drive wheel (operating at speeds up to 90, 000 rpm) and the tool shaft to achieve high rotational tool speeds.

In addition, plant parts in yew contain taxol, an alkaloid, which {{is used as a}} medicine against cancer. For these reasons a study was undertaken to improve propagation through cuttings in these two plant species. The influence of growth regulators (IBA or K-IBA) on rooting was examined and their optimal concentrations were determined. Furthermore, the effect of cutting type, genotype, wounding, rooting medium and rooting system, supplementary lighting and harvesting season on rooting of Taxus and Arbutus cuttings were evaluated. In addition, the role of different rooting growth regulators and various genotypes on peroxidase and phosphatase activity modification and isoenzyme pattern during rooting were examined. The treatment of cuttings with auxins (IBA or K-IBA) had a strong influence on the rooting of these cuttings. In Taxus, the treatment either with IBA or K-IBA had a positive effect on rooting percentage, but the concentrations used differed only with the control. A concentration of 5, 000 - 10, 000 ppm (IBA or K-IBA) is recommended for Taxus. In Arbutus, the use of high concentrations of IBA had a <b>negative</b> effect on <b>cutting</b> survival rate due to tissue necrosis. For this reason, a concentration of 8, 000 ppm K-IBA is recommended for rooting of Arbutus cuttings. The type of cuttings had a great influence on rooting in Taxus. Apical cuttings from current season growth of medium stem diameter achieved higher rooting percentages with greater number of roots than cuttings of smaller or larger stem diameter and also hardwood cuttings. On the other hand, in Arbutus, apical cuttings from thin shoots rooted better than cuttings from thick shoots. The genotype had a strong influence on rooting percentage and rooting quality in both plant species. The percentage of rooting among Taxus genotypes ranged from 0 to 30 % without auxin application and from 0 to 100 % with auxin application. Cuttings of one genotype (T 6) did not root or rooted at very low percentages even with auxin application. The rooting percentages in all Arbutus genotypes were very low without auxin application. Even with auxin application, cuttings of the genotype K 3 had very low rooting percentages. The auxin application increased the rooting percentages (from 50 to 95 %) in the rest Arbutus genotypes. ...|$|R
