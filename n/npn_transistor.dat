25|$|A BJT {{consists}} of three differently doped semiconductor regions: the emitter region, the base region and the collector region. These regions are, respectively, p type, n type and p type in a PNP transistor, and n type, p type and n type in an <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor.</b> Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: emitter (E), base (B) and collector (C).|$|E
25|$|In typical operation, the base–emitter {{junction}} is forward biased, {{which means}} that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. In an <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor,</b> when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{avalanche}} pulser {{described below}} are both base triggered and have two outputs. Since the device used is an <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor,</b> [...] {{is a positive}} going output while [...] is a negative going output: using a PNP transistor reverses the polarities of outputs. The description of their simplified versions, where resistor [...] or [...] is set to zero ohm (obviously not both) {{in order to have}} a single output, can be found in reference [...] Resistor [...] recharges the capacitor [...] or the transmission line [...] (i.e. the energy storage components) after commutation. It has usually a high resistance to limit the static collector current, so the recharging process is slow. Sometimes this resistor is replaced by an electronic circuit which is capable of charging faster the energy storage components. However this kind of circuit usually is patented so they are rarely found in mainstream application circuits.|$|E
2500|$|NPN {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of bipolar transistors, {{consisting}} of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the [...] "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> to its emitter (that is, when the base is high relative to the emitter), as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter, the transistor becomes active. In this [...] "on" [...] state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than hole mobility.|$|E

25|$|The {{transistors}} Q3, Q4 help {{to increase}} the reverse VBE rating: the base-emitter junctions of the <b>NPN</b> <b>transistors</b> Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have VBE breakdown voltages around 50 V.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{types of}} BJT {{function}} by letting a small current input {{to the base}} control an amplified output from the collector. The {{result is that the}} transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> in what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage [...] and collector–base voltage [...] are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector–base junction. For a figure describing forward and reverse bias, see semiconductor diodes.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram shows a {{schematic}} representation of an <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> connected to two voltage sources. ( [...] The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) [...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E

40|$|Total dose {{damage in}} bipolar {{integrated}} circuits is investigated at low temperature, {{along with the}} temperature dependence of the electrical parameters of internal transistors. Bandgap narrowing causes the gain of <b>npn</b> <b>transistors</b> to decrease far more at low temperature compared to pnp transistors, due to the large difference in emitter doping concentration. When irradiations are done at temperatures of - 140 deg C, no damage occurs until devices are warmed to temperatures above - 50 deg C. After warm-up, subsequent cooling shows that damage is then present at low temperature. This {{can be explained by}} the very strong temperature dependence of dispersive transport in the continuous-time-random-walk model for hole transport. For linear integrated circuits, low temperature operation is affected by the strong temperature dependence of <b>npn</b> <b>transistors</b> along with the higher sensitivity of lateral and substrate pnp transistors to radiation damage...|$|R

25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die. Each {{of the nine}} <b>NPN</b> <b>transistors</b> was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a single-ended stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only <b>NPN</b> <b>transistors,</b> and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor common-mode rejection ratio, weak output drive capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{is illustrated in}} Figure 3. The gate current makes an equivalent <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> switch on, which in turn draws current {{from the base of}} an equivalent PNP transistor, turning it on also. Part of the gate current (dotted line) is lost through the ohmic path across the p-silicon, flowing directly into MT1 without passing through the <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> base. In this case, the injection of holes in the p-silicon makes the stacked n, p and n layers beneath MT1 behave like a <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor,</b> which turns on due to the presence of a current in its base. This, in turn, causes the p, n and p layers over MT2 to behave like a PNP transistor, which turns on because its n-type base becomes forward-biased with respect to its emitter (MT2). Thus, the triggering scheme is the same as an SCR. The equivalent circuit is depicted in Figure 4.|$|E
