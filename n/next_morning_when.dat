5|$|On 29 August, Murray {{commanded}} A Company—which {{consisted of}} fewer than one hundred men—in a successful attack that captured Mouquet Farm under heavy fire. His men repelled four German counterattacks before he ordered them to withdraw. He remained in command until the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> he fainted from loss of blood from two wounds he had sustained during the action. Murray was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the action, an event that was published in a supplement of the London Gazette dated 14 November 1916. He was later evacuated to England aboard the hospital ship Asturias, and admitted to the 4th General Hospital, London, where he was to share a ward with Albert Jacka and Percy Black, who were recovering from wounds received at Poziéres and Mouquet Farm respectively. After nearly six weeks of recuperation, {{he returned to the}} 13th Battalion in France on 19 October.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from {{underneath}} every Christmas tree in Springfield {{with the intention}} of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties argue all night until the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> they settle down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to wrap in to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E
25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> {{the fire}} was cooled, the bones and ashes of Venerable Ajahn Thate were reverently removed and safeguarded as relics.

25|$|In none of {{the papers}} is there any {{suggestion}} there was verbal or physical violence {{on the part of}} Sergeant Woodard. It's quite unclear what really happened.

25|$|On 12 January 1815 General Wellesley {{grounded}} on the South Breakers, apparently {{while being}} chased by a larger ship. During the night the prize master and some 12 men landed from the ship. They reported that some 60 men remained aboard, principally lascars and sepoys. <b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> boats went out the rescuers found that the wreck was mostly under water. They were able to retrieve two white seamen and five lascars. Some 50 men, however had died, including the boatswain and another white man.|$|E
25|$|After the grounding, the Captain {{immediately}} called for assistance {{to help with}} the evacuation of all passengers. All the soldiers were disembarked without incident onto nearby ships that had rushed in to help. The captain and crew stayed on board until the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> the ship began to list and the captain ordered to abandon ship. The Letitia split in two in the months following the grounding and her stern sank into deeper waters. Legal salvagers and looters removed much of her equipment before the ship sank completely.|$|E

60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> early, <b>when</b> Walter {{descended the}} stairs, he found Ralph Smith waiting for him. His face was {{strapped}} up with plaster {{and he wore}} his arm in a sling, for his armour had been twice cut through as he led his party in through the sally-port.|$|R
25|$|The {{area around}} Elsenborn Ridge became a {{collection}} point for ragtag groups of American troops whose units been broken and scattered {{at the start}} of the enemy offensive. With so many troops from different units arriving in every kind of condition, organizing a coherent defense was a huge task, but one that occurred with surprising speed under the circumstances. Intelligence about the attack that reached the Americans was spotty and contradictory. General Lauer, commanding officer of the 99th, ordered Col. Robertson at Wahlerscheid to stay put until at least the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> more orders would be forthcoming. Robertson told his men to hold and he also prepared them for an orderly withdrawal in the morning.|$|E
25|$|The {{standoff}} {{continued as}} locals kept the place surrounded until the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when,</b> cautiously entering, the authorities found two dead bodies, both with numerous bullet wounds to {{the arms and}} legs. One {{of the men had}} a bullet wound in the forehead and the other had a bullet hole in the temple. The local police report speculated that, judging from the positions of the bodies, one bandit had probably shot his fatally wounded partner-in-crime to put him out of his misery, just before killing himself with his final bullet. In the following investigation by the Tupiza police, the bandits were identified as the men who robbed the Aramayo payroll transport, but the Bolivian authorities didn't know their real names, nor could they positively identify them.|$|E
25|$|As the Pequod {{approaches}} the Equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only {{where he is}} and not where he will be. He dashes it to the deck. That evening, an impressive typhoon attacks the ship. Lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with a musket. <b>Next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker's needle. He orders the log be heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship with no way to fix its location.|$|E

Then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the Mes, the gifts of civilized life. The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant Isimud for the Mes, only to be informed that he has given them to Inanna. Upset at his actions, he sends Galla demons to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay at Uruk. Enki realises that he has been tricked in his hubris and accepts a peace treaty forever with Uruk.|$|E
25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> Dr. Miller {{receives}} Steve's voicemail message, {{it instead}} says that Bollinger slit his wrists and wrote Miller's name {{in his blood}} before expiring. The message unnerves Dr. Miller and {{he goes to the}} mansion to learn more. Patricia Waterman also has driven to the mansion after being unable to reach her son via his cell phone. The two arrive simultaneously, and their cars collide in the driveway when Mrs. Waterman swerves to avoid what she believes to be a figure running across the road. Terrified, Mrs. Waterman begins to run through the forest {{on the grounds of the}} mansion while calling for her son. Miller, wanting to get her insurance information, pursues her. Inside Rose Red, Emery hears his mother's cries but dismisses them as an auditory illusion created by the haunted house.|$|E

Clive arrived at Murshidabad on 29 June with a guard of 200 European soldiers and 300 sepoys in the wake of rumours of a possible attempt on his life. Clive was taken to the Nawab's palace, where he was received by Mir Jafar and his officers. Clive placed Mir Jafar on the throne and acknowledging his position as Nawab, presented him with a plate of gold rupees.|$|E
