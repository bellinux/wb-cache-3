[...] As the economic downturn continued, free silver advocates blamed its continuation on the repeal of the silver purchase act, and the issue of silver became more prominent. [...] Free silver especially resonated among farmers in the South and West, as well as miners. [...] June 1894 marked the publication of William H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School. [...] The book, composed of accounts of (fictitious) lectures on the silver issue given by an adolescent named Coin to Chicago audiences, became an immense bestseller. [...] The book included (as foils to the title character) many of Chicago's most prominent men of business; some, such as banker and future Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage, issued denials that they had participated in any such lectures. [...] This popular treatment of the currency issue was highly influential. [...] A Missourian, Ezra Peters, wrote to Illinois Senator John M. Palmer, [...] "Coins [...] Financial School is raising h— in this <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> [...] If those in favor of honest money don't do something to offset its influence the country is going to the dogs." [...] A Minnesota correspondent wrote in Outlook magazine: [...] "high school boys are about equally divided between silver and baseball, with a decided leaning toward the former".|$|E

Will is a worthy young surveyor and Lucy feels honored to have his love, and returns it. José, halfbreed trapper, adores Lucy and necessarily dislikes Will, whom he correctly counts his successful rival. More, he bears Will a grudge for responding to Lucy's cries for help when he forced his attentions on her in the lonely <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> His chance to even matters with Will come shortly when he fastens on the surveyor's responsibility for the shooting of the latter's assistant, of which the halfbreed is himself guilty, having shot the assistant from ambush in mistake for Will. José claims he witnessed Will's alleged deed and his falsehoods are believed by the lumbermen. Rarely are the courts resorted to in that portion of the North where these events transpired and the rough lumbermen quickly decide to lynch Will. Lucy hears of the fate intended for her sweetheart and cuts his bonds. Further, she sends the lumbermen off in the wrong direction when they set out to recapture Will. The fugitive is spied by the halfbreed, who steals up from behind and attempts to knife him. The surveyor turns just in time, and in the ensuing struggle the halfbreed is wounded and falls over a precipice. At this juncture Will is retaken by the lumbermen." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{most common}} cases of grammaticalization occur in {{connection}} with {{the rise and fall of}} case systems. As we know, some languages excel in cases (some Caucasian languages, such as Lak or Tabassaran, sport up to fifty of them; Finnish has at least 14, maybe even 16, depending on how one counts them). Other languages, especially the older ones in the Indo-European family, have more modest, although still impressive inventories: Sanskrit with its eight, most Slavic language with their seven, Latin with its six, and Greek with its five cases are among the best known instances. But even a modern language such as German still can boast of having four cases, something which seems like a quaint anomaly in this <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linguistic <b>woods,</b> where all its close relatives and neighbors have shed the casual garb a long time ago (there are remnants of cases in both English, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages, but these represent isolated or ‘petrified’ forms, the so called ‘genitive’ -s being among the former, the ‘dative’ ending -e, as in the Danish i levende live ‘in living [actual] life’, among the latter.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} diffusion MR imaging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur in Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD).

Forty-six MRIs {{were carried out}} with bilateral quantification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur. The intra- and inter-observer variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ADC measurements was evaluated. The association between the ADC and age {{as well as the}} healthy or pathological status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur and the Catterall classification were looked for. ResultsIntra- and inter-observer reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ADC measurements was excellent. A statistically significant negative correlation between <b>the</b> ADC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> healthy <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur and age was found.
