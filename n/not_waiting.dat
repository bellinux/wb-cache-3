5|$|After his acquittal, Blackburn {{remained}} in Canada to avoid arrest and prosecution by U.S. authorities. When {{he learned of}} a yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans and the Texas Gulf Coast, Blackburn wrote to President Andrew Johnson on September 4, 1867, asking permission {{to return to the}} U.S. and help treat the disease. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> for Johnson's response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans. After rendering aid during the epidemic, he and his family moved to an Arkansas plantation owned by his wife.|$|E

Changes in the adaptation include the sequence of events in the prologue (in the books it is Gared and not Will who survives and is beheaded by Eddard afterwards, and Arya's material is set before the arrival of the royal family), new scenes showing the Lannister twins' perspective, and Daenerys's wedding night showing Drogo <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> for her to consent to sex.|$|E

5|$|<b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> {{to take up}} his consulship in Rome, he {{left after}} his triumph but {{before the end of}} AD 17. He sailed down the Illyrian coast of the Adriatic Sea to Greece, where he {{restored}} the temple of Spes, and won a chariot race at the Olympic games that year. He arrived at Nicopolis near the site of the Battle of Actium, where he took up his second consulship on 18 January AD 18. He visited the sites associated with his adoptive grandfather Augustus and his natural grandfather Mark Antony, before crossing the sea to Lesbos and then to Asia Minor. There he visited the site of Troy and the oracle of Apollo Claros near Colophon. Piso left {{at the same time as}} Germanicus, but traveled directly to Athens and then to Rhodes where he and Germanicus met for the first time. From there Piso left for Syria where he immediately began replacing the officers with men loyal to himself in a bid to win the loyalty of his soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or matzos. After giving thanks for the loaf, it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken unleavened bread, as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|After Emperor Charles's {{death on}} 20 October, Frederick quickly {{resolved}} to strike first; on 8 November {{he ordered the}} mobilization of the Prussian army, and on 11 December he issued an ultimatum to Maria Theresa demanding the surrender of Silesia. In return, he promised to acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction and to give his vote as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election to Maria Theresa's husband, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> for a response, he then led his troops across the lightly defended Silesian frontier on 16 December 1740, beginning the First Silesian War.|$|E
25|$|The Cubists are <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> {{for the war}} to end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked {{women whose}} scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more.

25|$|The Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom {{planned to}} launch a two-pronged attack on Madrid {{in the fall of}} 1809. In the west, Del Parque's Army of the Left enjoyed some success against Marchand's weak VI Corps. When the Spanish general learned that the other {{offensive}} prong had been crushed at Ocaña, he turned around and began retreating rapidly to the south. At the same time, Marchand was reinforced by a dragoon division under Kellermann. Taking command, Kellermann raced in pursuit of the Army of the Left, catching up with it at Alba de Tormes. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> for their own foot soldiers, the French dragoons and light cavalry fell upon the Spanish infantry and defeated it. Marchand's infantry arrived in time to mop up, but the cavalry had done most of the fighting. Del Parque's men retreated into the mountains where they spent a miserable few months.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a fait accompli to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E
25|$|At Liberty Gap, 6 {{miles to}} the west, a similar battle occurred. The leading {{elements}} of McCook's advance was the 39th Indiana, commanded by Col. Thomas J. Harrison, which was also mounted and armed with Spencer rifles. Taking a few prisoners of the Confederate pickets that opposed them, they {{found that there were}} only two Confederate regiments in the Gap. <b>Not</b> <b>waiting</b> for the main infantry support to arrive, McCook ordered the brigade of Brig. Gen. August Willich to move forward as quickly as possible. Deploying a regiment {{on each side of the}} road, Willich's men drove up the slope. A frontal assault against the breastworks was not feasible, so a fierce battle of flanking maneuvers resulted against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. St. John R. Liddell and Patrick R. Cleburne. As a second Union brigade arrived in the evening to support Willich, the Union troops had pushed a half mile beyond the southern entrance to the Gap.|$|E

25|$|Rommel {{lost contact}} with General Hermann Hoth, having disobeyed orders by <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> for the French to {{establish}} a new line of defence. The 7th Panzer Division continued to advance north-west to Avesnes-sur-Helpe, just ahead of the 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions. The French 5th Motorised Infantry Division had bivouacked {{in the path of the}} German division, with its vehicles neatly lined up along the roadsides and the 7th Panzer Division dashed through them. The slow speed, overloaded crews and lack of battlefield communications undid the French. The 5th Panzer Division joined in the fight. The French inflicted many losses on the division but could not cope with the speed of the German mobile units, which closed fast and destroyed the French armour at close range. The remaining elements of the 1st DCR, resting after losing all but 16 of its tanks in Belgium, were also engaged and defeated, the 1st DCR retiring with three operational tanks for a German loss of 50 out of 500 tanks.|$|E
25|$|On July 17 at Money in the Bank, Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match {{which earned}} him a World Heavyweight Championship match at any point within the {{following}} year. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at WrestleMania XXVIII. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of SmackDown, after Henry challenged Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. Big Show, {{as a friend of}} Bryan, then urged a groggy Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. After losing a rematch, Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On November 25 at SmackDown, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry. However, SmackDown authority figure Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> for WrestleMania, but explained he felt strongly about exacting revenge on Henry and realised he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of his briefcase, Bryan won a four-way match on the same episode of SmackDown to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of SmackDown, Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain his title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.|$|E
25|$|A {{little before}} 5:00p.m. as the {{artillery}} fight began to wane, Confederate Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder fell mortally wounded. He had been ill {{that day and}} was taken onto the field in an ambulance wagon. While attempting to direct his troops, {{he was struck by}} a shell fragment. Winder's left arm and side were torn to pieces, and he died a few hours later. As a result, command of the division devolved on William Taliaferro, who was completely ignorant of Jackson's battle plan. Dispositions on his part of the field were still incomplete; Garnett's brigade was isolated from the main Confederate line, with its flank dangerously exposed to the woods. The Stonewall Brigade was to have come up to support them, but remained a half mile distant behind the artillery. Before leadership could properly be restored to the division the Union attack began. Geary and Prince were sent against the Confederate right. The Federal advance was swift and threatened to break the Confederate line, prompting Early to come galloping to the front from Cedar Mountain where he was directing troop dispositions. Early's stabilizing presence and the raking fire of the Confederate guns halted the Union advance on the Confederate right. On the left Crawford attacked Winder's division, sending one brigade directly at the Confederate line and another brigade through the woods on a flanking movement. The Federals came from the woods directly into the flank of the 1st Virginia Infantry, who under the pressure from attack on two fronts broke for the rear. The Federals pushed on, <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> to reform their lines, rolling through the outflanked 42nd Virginia until they found themselves in Taliaferro's and the artillery's rear. The Stonewall Brigade came up and was swept aside by Crawford's troops before it had a chance to react. Jackson ordered the batteries withdrawn before they were captured, but Taliaferro and Early's left were hit hard by the Union advance and threatened to break.|$|E

Peter, having found out about this from a letter by Apraksin, decided it to be [...] "very significant, but also very dangerous." [...] In the end he left the decision up to General Apraksin who, not wanting to bear the responsibility for a failure, decided to wait for reinforcements to arrive by sea once the ice had opened up.|$|E
500|$|In the Tests, Chapman scored 165 runs at 23.57, {{and in all}} {{first-class}} matches {{he reached}} 533 runs and averaged 33.31. Southerton summarised his performance: [...] "Chapman himself began well in batting but in the later matches was too prone to lash out at the off ball and, as the tour progressed, the Australian bowlers discovered his weakness." [...] On his captaincy, Southerton wrote: [...] "Chapman captained the side uncommonly well, improving out of all knowledge as the tour progressed." [...] Socially, Chapman enjoyed the tour; he attended many functions and events; Bill Ferguson, the team scorer, only saw him annoyed once on the tour: when his accustomed drink was <b>not</b> <b>waiting</b> for him at a lunch interval.|$|E
