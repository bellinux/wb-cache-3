5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a <b>noxious</b> <b>odour,</b> and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|E
2500|$|A strong, <b>noxious</b> <b>odour</b> {{coming from}} the rear of the plane was first {{reported}} to the cabin crew around 19:00. Flight attendant Judi Davidson, 33, traced the odour to the lavatory. She attempted to look into the lavatory but was forced back by thick grey smoke rapidly filling the small room; she then ordered the third ranking crew member to find Sergio Benetti, 37, the chief cabin crew officer, and ask him to investigate. As Benetti sprayed the interior of the affected lavatory with a CO2 extinguisher, Davidson reported the fire to the captain while 28-year-old flight attendant Laura Kayama began urging the passengers on the sparsely-populated flight to come away from the front and rear of the plane and sit close together near the over-wing exits. At no time did any of the cabin crew mention to either Cameron or Ouimet that they had not yet seen flames. [...] Benetti, the one person who had managed to get a good look at the scene, had not reported seeing anything resembling the traditional causes of airline fires in pre-smoking-ban days: flames from a trash bin fire or the paper towel dispenser, both of which were commonly set ablaze by passengers smoking in the lavatories on long flights. First officer Ouimet went to investigate personally at 19:03, but was driven back by the thick smoke. At 19:04, Benetti reported that he thought the fire was probably out because he had completely doused the lavatory with fire retardant.|$|E

40|$|The {{eutrophic}} {{state of}} North Lake {{is typical of}} other aquatic systems on the Swan Coastal plain. These bodies of water have long been regarded as convenient outlets for both urban and agricultural runoff.

The results of this study showed North Lake to be highly eutrophic throughout the year. Peak algal growth occurred during the winter months when the external loading of phosphorus and nitrogen to the lake was highest.

40|$|Traditional surface {{disinfectants}} {{that have}} long been applied in medicine, animal husbandry, manufacturing and institutions are inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst. Moreover, some of these substances have adverse environmental impacts: for example, quaternary ammonium compounds ("quats") are reproductive toxicants in both fish and mammals. Halogens are corrosive both to metals and living tissues, are highly reactive, can be readily neutralized by metals, and react with organic matter to form toxic, persistent by-products such as dioxins and furans. Aldehydes may be carcinogenic to both human and animals upon repeated exposures, are corrosive, cross-link living tissues and many synthetic materials, and may lose efficacy when pathogens enzymatically adapt to them. Alcohols are flammable and volatile and can be enzymatically degraded by certain bacterial pathogens. Quats are highly irritating to mucous membranes and over time can induce pathogen resistance, {{especially if they are}} not alternated with functionally different disinfectants. In contrast, peracetic acid (PAA), a potent oxidizer, liberates hydrogen peroxide (itself a disinfectant), biodegrades to carbon dioxide, water and oxygen, and is at least as efficacious as contact biocides e. g., halogens and aldehydes. Nevertheless, the standard form of liquid PAA is highly corrosive, is neutralized by metals and organic matter, gives off <b>noxious</b> <b>odours</b> and must be stored in vented containers. For the reasons stated above, Bioxy formulations were developed, a series of powder forms of PAA, which are odourless, stable in storage and safe to transport and handle. They generate up to 10 % PAA in situ when dissolved in water. A 0. 2 % aqueous solution of Bioxy (equivalent to 200 ppm PAA) effected a 6. 76 log reduction in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within 2 minutes after application. A 5 % aqueous solution of Bioxy achieved a 3. 93 log reduction in the bovine tuberculosis bacillus Mycobacterium bovis, within 10 minutes after contact. A 1 % solution of Bioxy reduced vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 6. 31 and 7. 18 logs, respectively, within 3 minutes after application. A 0. 5 % solution of Bioxy inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) within 15 minutes of contact, and a 5 % solution of Bioxy realized a 5. 36 log reduction in the spores of Clostridium difficile within 10 minutes of application. In summary, Bioxy is safe and easy to transport and store, poses negligible human, animal and environmental health risks, shows high levels of pathogen control efficacy and does not induce microbial resistance. Further investigations are recommended to explore its use as an industrial biocide...|$|R
40|$|Intensification of {{agricultural}} practices {{has led to}} the production of liquid slurries in sufficient volumes that prohibits year round application. To reduce the risk of environmental pollution from inappropriate land applications, slurry is stored along with parlour and yard washings during the winter months, resulting in the accumulation of large volumea During storage, anaerobic conditions prevail, resulting in the breakdown of biological compounds into noxious and toxic chemicals which are of primary concern in environmental pollution. The introduction of large scale anaerobic digesters on every firm is impractical, as extensive supervision of the digester is required. The problems associated with the application of anaerobically stored shiny back to land, such as <b>noxious</b> <b>odours,</b> ground and surface water pollution and crop scorching are no longer tolerated by the general public and government pollution agencies. To alleviate some of the problems faced by farmers storing large quantities of slurry, aerobic treatment systems have been devised that can reduce the risk of pollution. Slurry aeration has become a widely used method in the treatment of cattle slurry, as it is effective in reducing odours, preventing crust formation and provides a semihomogenous mixture. The aeration system can vary dramatically in design and operation, from very simple bubble diffusers consisting of holes pierced into pipes which are laid across the floor of a tank, to complex Venturi systems which rely on the generation of negative pressures from tapered nozzles to draw air into a stream of slurry. The aeration systems used in this thesis are of a fine bubble difiliser and a mechanical surface aerator design. These systems were chosen because of their low capital and running costs. Aeration efficiency was studied at three scales, laboratory (up to 1 litre), intermediate (up to 80 litres) and pilot (up to 10, 000 litres) using volumetric mass transfer coefficient, standard oxygen transfer rate and oxygenation efficiency as the testing criteria. The fine bubble diffuser used throughout all the scale up experiments was of the same principle. Air was delivered through a compressor which was isolated outside of the reaction vessel. Sufficient air was delivered to the slurry at all scales to prevent the need for an additional mixing unit to maintain the solids in suspension. However, at pilot scale the design of the diffuser layout as critical in order to prevent biological fouling of the material. The mechanical surface aerator used at pilot scale was placed within the centre of the reaction vessel and could only be accessed by removing it from the tank. The mode of operation was to thaw liquid up through a central volumetric screw and release it radially outwards above the suthce of the liquid. The ability of the mechanical suthce aerator to transfer oxygen to both water and slurry was higher than that of the fine bubble difibser, with concomitant higher kLa, SOTK and OE being recorded. The introduction of oxygen into cattle slurry had two effects, the generation of a stable microbial culture and a major reduction in physical and chemical pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand, total solids and total suspended solids. Each aeration device generated a microbial population which was distinctive in gross morphology and settling characteristic& Both microbial populations flocculated naturally and quickly settled to a clear liquor and brown sludge. Flocs generated through violent aeration were small and compact, unlike the large feathery flocs generated by the fine bubble diffliser. The mechanical surface aerator achieved higher reductions in all the measured pollutants than the fine bubble difihiser, with reductions of 75...|$|R

The analytical characteristics of each approach have been investigated and the selectivity, sensitivity and applicability of the reaction system critically assessed for a range of model compounds. The naphthoquinone system has a detection limit in the low micromolar range with little interference from other components common to discharge water with 96 % recovery of mercaptopropionate.

40|$|A harmful {{algal bloom}} (HAB) {{occurred}} along the southeast Arabian Sea, bordering Western India, during September to November 2004. This bloom was unique in the region {{in terms of its}} large spatial extent, and the trend was weakened towards November. Mass mortality of fish, emanation of <b>noxious</b> <b>odour,</b> and respiratory problems among the children on the coastal stretch were noticed. The phytoplankton species Gymnodiniium, class Dinophyceae bloom accounted for 98 % of the standing crop. The bloom Karenia mikimotoi showed a maximum density of 19. 37 × 104 [*]cells[*]L− 1 and 18. 94 × 104 [*]cells[*]L− 1 at nearshore and offshore, respectively. The remotely sensed chlorophyll a (Chl a) data from seaWiFS, sea surface temperature (SST) from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), rainfall from tropical rainfall measuring Mission (TRMM), and Sea winds from QuickSCAT reflected the bloom due to Karenia mikimotoi, suggesting the advection process at the coastal waters. The release of toxins specifically the neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) and azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP) from the bloom was assessed by chemical and mouse bioassay of the extract from mussel Perna indica, showing negative results.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the physiological and behavioural effects of a stress-inducing stimulus (predator odour) on potential prey species (Australian native and exotic). The aim {{was to determine if}} differences in the response of prey were related to the scent of evolutionary known predators compared to unfamiliar or short-term introduced ones. In laboratory experiments, responses were always restricted to changes in respiratory variables, with brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) showing no variation in metabolic rate after exposure to predator odours. Brushtail possums showed strong changes in ventilatory rate only when faced with the scent of an historical predator, increasing respiratory frequency (ratio after/before exposure = 4. 55 ± 1. 007) and decreasing tidal volume (ratio after/before exposure = 0. 38 ± 0. 113) in response to stale dingo urine. The changes were short-lived, lasting for only one minute of exposure. For this reason, it is unclear if the response observed could be considered as a fear reaction. However, there was no habituation after three exposures and this may indicate that possums were initially displaying an investigative approach to a predator scent and then relaxing once assessment was completed. The effect of predator and novel odours on the ventilation of rabbits appeared to be in general mediated by anxiety, as shown by the responses elicited by both predator and control scents. However, stronger reactions were observed in response to feral cat and quoll odours for both respiratory frequency (ratio after/before exposure to feral cat = 4. 39 ± 0. 721 and to quoll = 3. 75 ± 0. 486) and tidal volume (ratio after/before exposure to feral cat = 0. 47 ± 0. 065 and to quoll = 0. 64 ± 0. 129). This could be due to different intensity of the olfactory stimuli. Nevertheless, the effects of <b>noxious</b> <b>odours</b> on rabbits clearly demonstrate that they become highly vigilant at any sudden change in their environment. Tammar wallabies appeared to possess a mechanism for the recognition of predator odours as ventilatory responses were restricted to particular predator scents. After investigation, fox and cat odour provoked a stronger and more prolonged change in respiratory frequency (ratio after/before exposure to fox = 3. 58 ± 0. 918 and to feral cat = 2. 44 ± 0. 272) and tidal volume (ratio after/before exposure to fox = 0. 84 ± 0. 110 and to feral cat = 0. 98 ± 0. 155) compared to the other scents, suggesting that wallabies may have perceived these species as more immediate threats. For wild, free-living brushtail possums and southern brown bandicoots (Isodoon obesulus), there was no pattern of avoidance of historical or introduced predator odours, with no difference in number of animals captured in predator and control scented traps. This may indicate that predator odour avoidance has not evolved in these species and that they have poor possibilities of escaping potential predators. However it may also be explained by the long-term predator-free environment in which the study was conducted, and suggests loss of anti-predator behaviour in populations without predation risk. Wild, free-ranging western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) reacted to the odour of both historical (dingo) and novel (fox) predators by reducing number of feeding events (5. 2 ± 2. 08 for fox and 5. 9 ± 1. 33 for dingo) and time spent foraging (17. 7 ± 7. 2 sec for fox and 22. 2 ± 4. 6 sec for dingo) when predator scents were present and by escaping areas tainted with predator odours (41. 4 ± 17. 5 sec for fox and 33. 8 ± 13 sec for dingo). Clearly these results suggest that kangaroos are scared of predator odours. However, a close investigation of predator scents was necessary before a response could be elicited and feeding areas were not completely abandoned. It is still unclear if small Australian prey, such as southern brown bandicoots and brushtail possums, respond to olfactory cue of predation in the wild, as different results were obtained in the studies conducted in the laboratory and in free populations. However, this research showed that medium and large-sized macropods respond to both native, long-term and introduced predator odours. This indicates that at least some Australian prey species can recognise the odour of potential predators, although responses usually occur after a period of investigation, and do not always result in avoidance behaviour. Differential responses appear {{to be based on the}} perceived risk. Use of predator odour is unlikely to be an effective mechanism of deterring herbivores from preferred feeding locations...|$|R
