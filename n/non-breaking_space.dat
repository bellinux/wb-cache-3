25|$|Quebec French {{has some}} {{typographical}} differences from European French. For example, in Quebec French, unlike European French, a full <b>non-breaking</b> <b>space</b> {{is not used}} before the semicolon, exclamation mark, or question mark. Instead, a thin space (which according to Le Ramat de la typographie normally measures {{a quarter of an}} em) is used; this thin space can be omitted in word-processing situations where the thin space is assumed to be unavailable, or when careful typography is not required.|$|E
25|$|Also nonbreaking hyphen, {{non-breaking hyphen}} and {{no-break}} hyphen. This character looks {{identical to the}} regular hyphen, but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at {{what would be the}} end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The <b>non-breaking</b> <b>space</b> exists for similar reasons.|$|E

5000|$|Simplistic {{computer}} tools typically mishandle plenken {{by treating}} them as ordinary whitespace, potentially inserting incorrect linebreaks and wrapping the punctuation mark onto the next line, rendering the text difficult to read. More sophisticated computer tools have French spacing modes which automatically change plenked spaces to special typographic spaces {{such as the}} espace fine insécable (<b>non-breaking</b> thin <b>space).</b> However, such spacing behaviour is not necessarily replicated for other languages and their typists must manually enter <b>non-breaking</b> <b>spaces</b> (option-space in any Macintosh application, but application-specific in other operating systems).|$|R
25|$|This {{changed with}} the {{introduction}} of the HP82240B printer in 1989 and the HP48 series in 1990, which came with a new character set now based on ECMA94/ ISO8859-1 instead of HPRoman-8, but with the control codes in the range 128 to 159 (0x80 to 0x9F) being replaced by additional displayable characters. Compared to ISO8859-1, codepoint 127 (0x7F) showed a medium shaded gray box like in the former HPRoman-8 based character set. Code points 131 (0x83) to 142 (0x8E) were also taken over from the former HPRoman-8 based character set. In addition to this, codepoint 31 (0x1F) was used for ellipsis (…) and codepoints 169 (0xA9) and 174 (0xAE) showed ambiguous glyphs which could be viewed as inverse circled numbers ❸ or copyright (©) and as ❷ or registered trademark (®), respectively. This first version of the character set also had a <b>non-breaking</b> <b>space</b> at position 160 (0xA0).|$|E

50|$|In contrast, <b>non-breaking</b> <b>spaces</b> are not {{merged with}} {{neighboring}} whitespace characters when displayed, and {{can therefore be}} used by an author to simply insert additional visible space in the resulting output without using spans styled with peculiar values of the CSS “white-space” property.

50|$|Sentence spacing {{in digital}} media is the {{horizontal}} space between sentences in computer and web-based media. Digital media allow sentence spacing variations not {{possible with the}} typewriter. Most digital fonts {{permit the use of}} a variable space or a no-break space. Some modern font specifications, such as OpenType, have the ability to automatically add or reduce space after punctuation, and users may be able to choose sentence spacing variations. Modern fonts that allow spacing variations will allow the average user the ability to easily manipulate the following spaces: <b>non-breaking</b> short <b>spaces</b> (thin <b>spaces),</b> <b>non-breaking</b> normal <b>spaces</b> (thick spaces), breaking normal spaces (thick spaces), and breaking long spaces (em spaces).|$|R

2500|$|... {{specially}} encoding in Unicode the Buginese vowel [...] {{in such a}} {{way that}} it will never be reordered by a layout engine (conforming or not), for example by encoding this vowel after a <b>non-breaking</b> <b>space</b> (to make it appear in isolation) but still before the consonant (in visual order), provided that the font or layout engine correctly renders this combination (most layout engines support this universal convention displaying combining marks and diacritic character in isolation); this implies an orthographic change in texts (the vowel is no longer logically associated to any consonant, so full text searches and text correctors would need to also look for such isolated vowel occurring before a consonant), and additional complexities for users trying to enter Buginese texts.|$|E
5000|$|A second common {{application}} of <b>non-breaking</b> <b>spaces</b> is in {{plain text file}} formats such as SGML, HTML, TeX and LaTeX, whose rendering engines are programmed to treat sequences of whitespace characters (space, newline, tab, form feed, etc.) {{as if they were}} a single character (but this behavior can be overridden). Such [...] "collapsing" [...] of whitespace allows the author to neatly arrange the source text using line breaks, indentation and other forms of spacing without affecting the final typeset result.|$|R
5000|$|TeachText {{could only}} {{operate on a}} single {{document}} {{at a time and}} supported only the default text font (12-point Geneva at the time) in the MacRoman encoding, with formatting such as bold, italic and underline. It also included rudimentary support for embedded images; the images were stored in PICT format in the file's resource fork in ascending numbers from zero, instances of <b>non-breaking</b> <b>spaces</b> in the text loaded up the appropriately numbered image, the first instance loading image [...] "0", the second space loading image [...] "1", and so on.|$|R
50|$|In computing, {{the middle}} dot is usually used to {{indicate}} white space in various software {{applications such as}} word processing, graphic design, web layout, desktop publishing or software development programs. In some word processors, interpuncts are used to denote not only hard space or space characters, but also sometimes used to indicate a space when put in paragraph format to show indentations and spaces. This allows the user to see where white space {{is located in the}} document and what sizes of white space are used, since normally white space is invisible so tabs, <b>spaces,</b> <b>non-breaking</b> <b>spaces</b> and such are indistinguishable from one another.|$|R
2500|$|... {{which should}} now render {{correctly}} as ᨙᨀ (but note the possible larger left-side and/or right-side bearings around the vowel, {{which is now}} shown in isolation separately from the following letter ka, {{and in the middle}} of a <b>non-breaking</b> <b>space</b> which may itself be larger than the diacritic; this may be corrected in fonts, by including a single kerning pair for the vowel occurring after a whitespace). Although this solution is not ideal for the long term, text indexers may be adapted for compatibility of this encoding with the recommended encoding exposed in the previous paragraph, by considering this character triple as semantically equivalent as the previous character pair; and future fonts and text layout engines could also render this triple by implementing a non-discretionnary ligature between the two graphemes, so that it will render exactly like the standard character pair (which uses a single grapheme cluster).|$|E

25|$|MacKellar's The American Printer was the {{dominant}} language style guide in the US {{at the time}} and ran to at least 17 editions between 1866 and 1893, and De Vinne's The Practice of Typography was the undisputed global authority on English-language typesetting style from 1901 until well past Dowding's first formal alternative spacing suggestion in the mid-1950s. Both the American and the UK style guides also specified that spaces should be inserted between punctuation and text. The MacKellar guide described these as hairspaces but itself used a much wider space than was then commonly regarded as a hairspace. Spaces following words or punctuation were subject to line breaks, and spaces between words and closely associated punctuation were <b>non-breaking.</b> Additionally, <b>spaces</b> were (and still are today) varied proportionally in width when justifying lines, originally by hand, later by machine, now usually by software.|$|R
