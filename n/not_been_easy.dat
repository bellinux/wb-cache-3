His journey north had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy.</b> Mutiny had broken out and been {{suppressed}} among his New Mexican militia; and many of his horses had gone lame, or had been stolen by Pawnee raiders. He had left 240 of his men on the Arkansas in southern Kansas before turning northward with the other half of his force. In the Republican village, he met with Kitkehahki and Chaui leaders, to whom he presented gifts, including Spanish flags. The Pawnees agreed to expel Americans from their territory, but also opposed the Melgares expedition's continuing to the Missouri River. In the face of this opposition, and with no supply lines and a force too large to live off the country, Melgares returned to the Arkansas and thence to Santa Fe.|$|E

500|$|In 11 days {{of action}} in the Sangju area the 24th Regiment had {{suffered}} 323 battle casualties, 27 killed, 293 wounded, and 3 missing. The light casualty count was partially credited to effective use of fortifications and North Korean caution in advancing during the fight, {{but the fact that}} 24th Infantry troops were quick to withdraw was also blamed. The regiment, a mostly black unit left over from the US military's recently abolished segregated system, was blasted for its poor performance during the fight. Walker, seeing the 24th Infantry as an ineffective unit, resolved to use it only as a [...] "trip wire force" [...] on the front lines, requiring it to be reinforced by another regiment in reserve to conduct serious resistance when the 24th broke. Other leaders saw the poor performance as a reason to demand further integration of the armed forces, which had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to do before the war. The 24th Infantry was fully desegregated on October 1, 1951.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi said that the race had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> because his battery had greatly overheated and another lap would have meant {{he would not have}} been able to finish. Nevertheless, he was happy that he had begun the new season with a victory after having ended the previous campaign badly. He later confessed that luck played a role in him securing the win as his car was not set-up to his preferences but reserved praise to his strategist. Second-place finisher di Grassi spoke of his delight with the result and that his race had been [...] "crazy" [...] which demonstrated that this team they did not stop and it was [...] "a great start" [...] to his season. He praised his mechanics for helping him remain on the same lap as the leaders and believed that he was targeting the fastest lap award but his team instructed him to keep pushing. Heidfeld, who finished in third, stated that he was happy to achieve a podium position in the first race of the season and hoped that his team could finish their forward progress in the championship.|$|E

Lotterer was delighted over his team's performance, saying {{at this early stage}} of the season, Audi were [...] "amazed" [...] they were able to finish as the winners, but felt they were lucky because of Hartley's crash. Fässler said it had been [...] "a riveting race" [...] and the slower traffic made it more unpredictable. Tréluyer described the win as [...] "the best way to open a season as you can imagine." [...] Jani felt he would have had a possibility to challenge for the victory had he not been delayed by his late-race puncture. Dumas was satisfied with his early race battle with Jarvis and revealed that Porsche's target was to remain with their rivals. Sarrazin stated although his team still need improvements they were already closer than they had been the previous season and they were motivated to battle {{at the front of the}} field. Conway said the team's result was a [...] "a cool way to start the year" [...] but had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> because Toyota still needed to work on their car's pace to get closer to their opposition. Kobayashi said his first race in LMP1 was [...] "a positive start" [...] and was excited about the No. 6 car's development.|$|E

2500|$|This art {{produced}} {{for commercial purposes}} has provided an important, sustainable {{source of income for}} the Huichols. Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations. [...] However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the “authenticity” of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as floating heads in yarn paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol. (origensbarnett) Much of the “authenticity” of the modern works {{has to do with the}} continued use of traditional symbols and designs. However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the jaguar (a Mesoamerican symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs. Selling of the items has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and San Miguel de Allende as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe) ...|$|E

2500|$|Trump {{was listed}} on the initial Forbes List of wealthy {{individuals}} in 1982 as having an estimated $200million fortune, including a share of his father's estimated $200million net worth. After several years on the list, Trump's financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993; in 2005, The New York Times referred to Trump's [...] "verbal billions" [...] in a skeptical article about Trump's self-reported wealth. At the time, three individuals with direct knowledge of Trump's finances told reporter Timothy L. O'Brien that Trump's actual net worth was between $150 and $250million, though Trump then publicly claimed a net worth of $5 to $6billion. Claiming libel, Trump sued the reporter (and his book publisher) for $5billion, lost the case, and then lost again on appeal; Trump refused to turn over his unredacted tax returns despite his assertion they supported his case. In a sworn deposition, Trump testified that he once borrowed $9.6million from his father, calling it [...] "a very small amount of money", but could not recall when he did so; Trump has since told campaign audiences {{he began his career}} with [...] "a small loan of one million dollars" [...] from his father, which he paid back with interest: [...] "it has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for me", Trump told one New Hampshire crowd.|$|E

Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary to the War Committee, considered that; [...] "the Coalition never recovered. For (its) last five months, the function of the Supreme Command was carried out under the shadow of these inquests." [...] But these mistakes were overshadowed by the limited progress and immense casualties of the Battle of the Somme, which began on 1 July 1916, and then by another devastating personal loss, the death of Asquith's son Raymond, on 15 September at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. Asquith's relationship with his eldest son had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy.</b> Raymond wrote to his wife in early 1916; [...] "If Margot talks any more bosh to you about the inhumanity of her stepchildren you can stop her mouth by telling her that during my 10 months exile here the P.M. has never written me a line of any description." [...] But Raymond's death was shattering, Violet writing; [...] "…to see Father suffering so wrings one", and Asquith passed much of the following months [...] "withdrawn and difficult to approach". The War brought no respite, Churchill writing that; [...] "The failure to break the German line in the Somme, the recovery of the Germanic powers in the East , the ruin of Roumania and the beginnings of renewed submarine warfare strengthened and stimulated all those forces which insisted upon still greater vigour in the conduct of affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|E
