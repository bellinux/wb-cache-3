40|$|In this paper, we {{entertain}} {{the notion of}} Management of new Information Technologies in Organisations by Intelligent Software Agents. We start by reconsidering the psychology of an organisation by taking a Post-Cartesian approach based on Activity Theory. We consider an organisation as an entity that dynamically interacts with its constituents. We show how one can describe the dynamic process of concept development by considering both parts, i. e. both the individual constituents and the interaction among them. This will in a very natural manner explain how {{the introduction of new}} Technologies in Organisations can produce new concepts. Upon this we introduce the notion of Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) as autonomous, social, reactive, proactive and subservient software computer systems. Organisations are introduced to new Technology as a natural consequence of the ever continuous stream of new tasks within the boundaries of organisations. We not only use and invent our <b>newly</b> <b>acquire</b> [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Errors in {{linguistic}} performance not only occur in children <b>newly</b> <b>acquiring</b> their native language, second language learners, {{those with a}} disability or an acquired brain injury but among competent speakers as well. Types of performance errors that will be of focus here are those that involve errors in syntax, other types of errors can occur in the phonological, semantic features of words, for further information see speech errors. Phonological and semantic errors can {{be due to the}} repetition of words, mispronunciations, limitations in verbal working memory, and length of the utterance. Slips of the tongue are most common in spoken languages and occur when the speaker either: says something they did not mean to; produces the incorrect order of sounds or words; or uses the incorrect word. Other instances of errors in {{linguistic performance}} are slips of the hand in signed languages, slips of the ear which are errors in comprehension of utterances and slips of the pen which occur while writing. Errors of linguistic performance are perceived by both the speaker and the listener and can therefore have many interpretations depending on the persons judgement and {{the context in which the}} sentence was spoken.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the results of the research designed to produce a new curriculum for developing the intermediate language learner's meta-grammar abilities and therewith suggest some new ways of curriculum development and classroom practice. This paper has a tripartite structure. The first part argues that the classroom practice focused on meta-grammar learning not only helps students to acquire linguistic abilities as well as work collaboratively but also helps teachers to improve themselves professionally through efficient collegial collaboration. The second part gives the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the pre- and post-tests measuring the effects of meta-grammar teaching at the level of the fifth year in secondary school. The analyses show that a couple of meta-grammar classroom activities have not affected students’ ideas about grammar learning and problem-solving strategies but have helped them understand what they have learned and <b>newly</b> <b>acquire</b> grammatical awareness. The third part describes and analyzes the opinions of the teachers involved in meta-grammar teaching, who suggest the efficacy of meta-grammar instruction with focused contents to the fourth-year and fifth-year students who have learned the basic grammatical frameworks of Japanese and English. They also suggest some practical ways to incorporate meta-grammar activities into the regular school curriculum...|$|R

The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his <b>newly</b> <b>acquired</b> white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E

Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win.

Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge {{and asked him to}} introduce it in the Senate as his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The evils of war and political parties.) When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all <b>newly</b> <b>acquired</b> territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times.
