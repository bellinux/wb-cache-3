40|$|Despite the {{sanitary}} {{importance of}} the European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Trouessart, 1897), the pheromonal communication in this species has not been sufficiently studied. Headspace analysis using solid phase micro extraction (SPME) revealed that nerol, <b>neryl</b> <b>formate,</b> pentadecane, (6 Z, 9 Z) - 6, 9 -heptadecadiene, and (Z) - 8 -heptadecene are released by both sexes whereas neryl propionate was released by males only. Tritonymphs did not produce any detectable volatiles. In olfactometer experiments, pentadecane and neryl propionate were attractive to both sexes {{as well as to}} tritonymphs. (Z) - 8 -heptadecene was only attractive to male mites. Therefore it is discussed that pentadecane and neryl propionate are aggregation pheromones and (Z) - 8 -heptadecene is a sexual pheromone of the European house dust mite D. pteronyssinus. To study the potential use of pheromones in dust mite control, long-range olfactometer experiments were conducted showing that mites can be attracted to neryl propionate over distances of at least 50 cm. This indicates that mite pheromones might be useable to monitor {{the presence or absence of}} mites in the context of control strategies...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} two aliphatic formates, (Z,Z) - 8, 11 -heptadecadienyl formate and (Z) - 8 -heptadecenyl formate in the opisthonotal gland secretions of an unidentified acarid species, namely Sancassania sp. Sasagawa. Both compounds were isolated using silica gel column chromatography and the structures were elucidated by 1 H-NMR and GC/FT-IR. Further {{information on the}} double bond positions was obtained by GC-MS analysis of the corresponding dimethyl disulfide derivatives. Based on the estimated structures of the two formates and using linoleic and oleic acids as the respective starting materials, a simple four-step synthesis was achieved via Barton decarboxylation as the key step. The aliphatic formates identified in acarids thus far are <b>neryl</b> <b>formate</b> ((Z) - 3, 7 -dimethylocta- 2, 6 -dienyl formate) and lardolure (1, 3, 5, 7 -tetramethyldecyl formate), and both {{have been reported to}} have pheromone functions. The biological function of the two formates isolated in this study is currently being investigated. Although we can speculate that the two compounds were biosynthesized from linoleic and oleic acid, {{there is a possibility that}} the synthetic processes featured a novel chain shortening and formic acid esterification mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe monophyly of a clade {{consisting}} of Astigmata {{and some of}} the glandulate Oribatida is supported by a synapomorphic set of five oil gland-derived secretion compounds (neral, geranial, <b>neryl</b> <b>formate,</b> 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methylbenzaldehyde (= 2, 6 -HMBD) and 2 -formyl- 3 -hydroxybenzaldehyde (=gamma-acaridial)), known as ‘Astigmata compounds’. Another aromatic compound, 7 -hydroxyphthalide, was reported for Astigmata and Oribatida, but is not known from any other source in nature. It was discussed whether this compound was a ‘natural’ part of oil gland secretions (and thus probably of phylogenetic significance) or an artifact. Here, we show that 7 -hydroxyphthalide {{is the result of a}} post-extraction chemical transformation of gamma-acaridial, and not a natural compound of oil gland secretions. We compared time series of raw extracts from Archegozetes longisetosus stored at - 20 °C with extracts stored at + 23 °C and show that storage at room temperature conditions promotes the transformation. However, since this reaction is quantitatively coherent, summing the amounts of both components seems to be a suitable approximation for the quantity of gamma-acaridial in natural secretions, even if 7 -hydroxyphthalide is found in the analyses...|$|E
40|$|Numerous semiochemicals {{have been}} {{isolated}} from {{several species of}} astigmatid mites with various identified or unidentified functions. Alarm pheromonal activity is widespread with <b>neryl</b> <b>formate</b> and neral, being the most common compounds eliciting alarm response in conspecifics. The cosmopolitan astigmatid mite Suidasia medanensis (= S. pontifica) Oudemans (Acari: Suidasidae) {{has been reported to}} use neral as an alarm pheromone, but neral can also act as an allomone towards predators of oribatid mites. Suidasia medanensis can be utilised as a factitious prey for mass-rearing of the phytoseiid predatory mite Amblyseius (= Typhlodromips) swirskii (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), which is used for biological control of insect and mite pests in protected crops. This study investigated the potential defence properties of the S. medanensis volatiles against A. swirskii, comparing the repellency to pollen-reared (naïve) vs. S. medanensis-reared (experienced) predators using a synthetic blend of the isomers neral and geranial (1 : 1) as a model compound. In a repellency bioassay, the synthetic blend elicited a significant repellence to A. swirskii with no difference between naïve and experienced predators. During capture success studies, S. medanensis under repeated attack could release sufficient quantities of the defence volatile to deter 1 – 5 attacks from A. swirskii, whereas hexane-treated S. medanensis artificially depleted of volatiles were significantly more vulnerable to an attack. This is the first report of an astigmatid defence volatile with repellent activity to a phytoseiid mite and the starting point to understanding semiochemical interactions in any current or novel factitious predator-prey mass-rearing system...|$|E
