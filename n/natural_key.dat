500|$|A soprano recitative, [...] "" [...] (Alas! that {{my faith}} is yet so weak), adopts a {{modified}} version of the chorale melody as the continuo line. Gardiner notes the [...] "uncompromising" [...] way of changing the normal order: the soprano, usually singing a chorale cantus firmus (firm song) to the continuo, expresses weakness and insecurity here, marked [...] "a battuta", while the firm foundation is the chorale in the bass, to which the text of stanza three, [...] "" [...] (Therefore, I will hope in God), could be imagined. Gardiner points out a detail: the word [...] "Zeichen" [...] (sign) [...] "is given expressive, symbolic expression, a diminished seventh chord assigned to that word … formed by all three 'signs", one sharp (F-sharp), one flat (E-flat) and one natural (C). As Eric Chafe concludes, since St John's Gospel is known as the Book of Signs, and since the tonal plan of Bach's St John Passion appears to have been conceived as a form of play on the three musical signs (ie sharp, flat and <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> areas) this important detail in the plan of Aus tiefer Not perhaps possesses a wider significance, relating it to Bach's tonal-allegorical procedures in general.|$|E

60|$|The {{music of}} the {{mountains}} is peculiar and wild, having most probably received its inspiration from {{the grandeur of the}} natural objects. Most of the sounds partake of the character of echoes, being high-keyed but false notes; such as the rocks send back to the valleys, when the voice is raised above its <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> in order to reach the caverns and savage recesses of inaccessible precipices. Strains like these readily recall the glens and the magnificence amid which they were first heard, and hence, by an irresistible impulse, the mind is led to indulge in the strongest of all its sympathies, those which are mixed with the unalloyed and unsophisticated delights of buoyant childhood.|$|E

6000|$|Early in January, I {{was invited}} again to lunch with the Le Geyts. Hilda Wade was invited, too. The moment {{we entered the}} house, we were both of us aware that some grim change had come over it. Le Geyt met us in the hall, in his old genial style, it is true; but still with a certain reserve, a curious veiled {{timidity}} which we had not known in him. Big and good-humoured as he was, with kindly eyes beneath the shaggy eyebrows, he seemed strangely subdued now; the boyish buoyancy {{had gone out of}} him. He spoke rather lower than was his <b>natural</b> <b>key,</b> and welcomed us warmly, though less effusively than of old. An irreproachable housemaid, in a spotless cap, ushered us into the transfigured drawing-room. Mrs. Le Geyt, in a pretty cloth dress, neatly tailor-made, rose to meet us, beaming the vapid smile of the perfect hostess--that impartial smile which falls, like the rain from Heaven, on good and bad indifferently. [...] "SO charmed to see you again, Dr. Cumberledge!" [...] she bubbled out, with a cheerful air--she was always cheerful, mechanically cheerful, from a sense of duty. [...] "It IS such a pleasure to meet dear Hugo's old friends! AND Miss Wade, too; how delightful! You look so well, Miss Wade! Oh, you're both at St. Nathaniel's now, aren't you? So you can come together. What a privilege for you, Dr. Cumberledge, to have such a clever assistant--or, rather, fellow-worker. It must be a great life, yours, Miss Wade; such a sphere of usefulness! If we can only feel we are DOING GOOD--that is the main matter. For my own part, I like to be mixed up with every good work that's going on in my neighbourhood. I'm the soup-kitchen, you know, and I'm visitor at the workhouse; and I'm the Dorcas Society, and the Mutual Improvement Class; and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and to Children, and I'm sure I don't know how much else; so that, what with all that, and what with dear Hugo and the darling children"--she glanced affectionately at Maisie and Ettie, who sat bolt upright, very mute and still, in their best and stiffest frocks, on two stools in the corner--"I can hardly find time for my social duties." ...|$|E

5000|$|On earlier {{instruments}}, {{the use of}} rollers on the low E and C <b>natural</b> <b>keys</b> {{seems to}} have been more common than having them on the G, low C and B <b>natural</b> <b>keys.</b> Additionally on some (all?) instruments made by Buffet in the early 20th century, the G♯ key is [...] "semi-articulated" [...] so that a G natural to G trill can be made by an additional touchpiece for the right hand. Saxophones of this time period also have this mechanism. Additionally, there is no connection from G to low C or low B natural, which is also identical to how saxophones were constructed at that time.|$|R
50|$|A <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> (also {{known as}} {{business}} key) {{is a type}} of unique key, found in relational model database design, that is formed of attributes that already exist in the real world. It is used in business-related columns. In other words, a <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> is a candidate key that has a logical relationship to the attributes within that row. A <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> is sometimes called domain key.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of a <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> over a surrogate key, which has no meaning outside the database environment, is that it already exists; {{there is no need}} to add a new, artificial column to the schema. Using a <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> (when one can be identified) also simplifies data quality: It ensures that there can only be one row for a key; this single version of the truth can be verified because the <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> is based on a real-world observation.|$|E

50|$|In these cases, {{generally}} a new attribute must {{be added to}} the <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> (for example, an original_company column).With a surrogate key, only the table that defines the surrogate key must be changed.

50|$|In {{the above}} example, Supplier_Code is the <b>natural</b> <b>key</b> and Supplier_Key is a {{surrogate}} key.

50|$|Two spinets {{signed by}} Aston are {{currently}} known; {{the first is}} dated 1726 and has the range GG-g΄΄΄ (five octaves). The case is decorated with inlay. The <b>natural</b> <b>keys</b> are covered in bone, and the sharps are made of a “sandwich” of ivory and ebony, {{sometimes referred to as}} “skunktail sharps” because of their appearance. The instrument was restored by Arnold Dolmetsch in 1898; Colonial Williamsburg purchased it in 1960.|$|R
50|$|A spinet built c.1700 whose lowest key {{is marked}} “C.A.” has been {{attributed}} to Aston; this instrument is currently part of the Richard Burnett Heritage Collection. It has the range GG/BB-d΄΄΄ (4½ octaves), with a broken octave. This compass is very common in spinets made between 1690 and 1710. The <b>natural</b> <b>keys</b> are covered with ebony, while the sharps are solid ivory. Overall the instrument is similar to those made by John Player.|$|R
