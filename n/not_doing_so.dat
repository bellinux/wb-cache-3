5|$|In January 2015, Obama {{traveled}} to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, {{following the death}} of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was very}} {{disappointed}} and infuriated by the early reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle, and {{on the evening of}} 12 July he scolded Rotmistrov via a phone call. He considered sacking Rotmistrov and having him court-martialed, but ended up <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as Stavka representative, in order to assume control of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and {{the initial}} {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> to some extent.|$|E

5|$|The offense {{improved}} from 2014, progressing from 21st overall to 18th. The unit {{also recorded}} 5,514 total net yards and 344.6 per game. The passing attack improved from 28th in yards per play to 12th. On third down, Chicago ranked sixth in efficiency after converting 42.5 percent into first downs. With 21 turnovers allowed (13th in the NFL), the Bears had the fewest since {{the introduction of}} the 16-game schedule in 1978. Also, the Bears were able to score at least 30 points twice, after <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> in 2014. In the first and third quarters, the Bears scored only 41 and 45 points, respectively, but scored 125 and 124 in the second and fourth. However, with 20.9 points per game, the Bears ranked 23rd in the NFL in the category, while also scoring only 24 touchdowns on 50 red zone attempts for a 48 percent red zone efficiency, 27th in the league.|$|E
5|$|Aquaria was {{developed}} by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka {{over the course of}} two years, off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including I'm O.K with Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival. The name of the studio is intended to represent a fusion of art and technology. Aquaria is the studio's only game. Both members of the team continue to make video games, but are <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of Spelunky.|$|E

25|$|The {{custom of}} a woman {{adopting}} a different surname through marriage is not a Portuguese-Brazilian tradition.
