40|$|The first {{molecular}} hyperpolarizabilities (β) of {{a series}} of 2, 6 -di-tert-butylindoanilines, measured by electric-field-induced second harmonic generation are somewhat more sensitive to donor strength than was found for analogously substituted <b>nitrostilbenes,</b> and dimethylindoaniline has a β roughly twice that of its 2, 6 di-tert-butylated analogue, measured in chloroform; solvatochromic measurements on the former compound suggest that this decrease in hyperpolarizability is consistent with a bound-solvent effect...|$|E

40|$|Long-range {{corrected}} hybrid density functionals (LC-DFT), with range separation parameters {{optimally tuned}} to obey Koopmans' theorem, {{are used to}} calculate the first-order hyperpolarizabilities of prototypical charge-transfer compounds p-nitroaniline (PNA) and dimethylamino <b>nitrostilbene</b> (DANS) in the gas phase and various solvents. It is shown that LC-DFT methods with default range separation parameters tend to underestimate hyperpolarizabilities (most notably in solution) and that the tuning scheme can sharply improve results, especially in the cases when the standard LC-DFT errors are largest. Nonetheless, we also identify pathological cases (two pyrrole derivatives) for which LC-DFT underestimates the hyperpolarizabilities, regardless of tuning. It is noted that such pathological cases do not follow the usual inverse relation between the hyperpolarizability and amount of exact exchange, and thus this behavior may serve as a diagnostic tool for the adequacy of LC-DFT...|$|R
40|$|New {{polymers}} for second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) applications were synthesized and characterized. They were {{distinguished by}} the presence of chromophore groups, with various mol. hyperpolarizability values, used as pendants on substantially rigid backbones. The polymers were prepd. through the reaction of tolylene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate, or a suitable alkyloxyphthaloyl dichloride, with the N,N-diethanol- 4 -(phenyl) group azo-linked to a nitrofluorenone, <b>nitrostilbene,</b> nitrooxadiazole, or nitrothiadiazole moiety. The polymers exhibited good thermal stability, high glass-transition temps., and an absence of crystallinity. The second-order NLO properties of thin, transparent poled films, prepd. by spin coating and thermal corona poling, were investigated for some of the polymers. The second harmonic coeffs., ranging between 18 and 25 pmV, depended more on the alignment of the chromophore groups along the direction of the poling field than on their mol. hyperpolarizability. The ternporal stability of the NLO properties of the polymers was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} dynamics of amorphous and liquid-crystalline (LC) side-chain polycarbonates was studied by dielectric spectroscopy at frequencies from 10 (- 2) to 10 (6) Hz and at temperatures from - 160 to 180 degrees C. 'Model' compounds containing no mesogenic side-groups showed two relaxations, which originate from the carbonate group (alpha, beta(m) -relaxation). By contrast, in LC-polycarbonates bearing a mesogenic <b>nitrostilbene</b> side group around {{and above the}} glass transition temperature Tg UP to three relaxation modes were distinguished (alpha-, lambda(1) -, lambda(2) -process); below T-g four secondary relaxations (gamma-, beta(m) -, beta(s) -, beta(sc) - relaxation) were observed. The gamma-relaxation was found only in compounds possessing an aliphatic spacer linked to the backbone by an ether bond. Apart from beta(m) -, two additional beta-processes were identified as relaxations associated with the mesogenic unit in the glassy (beta(s)) or in the crystalline state (beta(sc)). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{relaxation}} spectroscopy using dielectric probes {{was applied}} to study the (glass transition) dynamics in binary blends of isotactic PP, PS and LDPE. The blends were prepared by melt-mixing and doped with 0. 5 % of the dielectric probe 4, 4 '-(N,N-dibutylamino) -(E) <b>nitrostilbene</b> (DBANS) (van den Berg O, Sengers WGF, Jager WF, Picken SJ, Wubbenhorst M. Macromolecules 2004; 37 : 2460. [17]). Due to the selective amplification of the dielectric relaxation processes related to the dynamic glass transition of the polymers, accurate relaxation data were obtained, even for the minor phases. No substantial influence of the blend composition and the blend morphology on the glass transition dynamics was found, indicating that both blend constituents behave like homogeneous bulk materials. The normalised relaxation strength of glass transition processes remained constant, regardless of the blend type and blend composition. This indicates that the probe molecule, DBANS, was equally distributed over the two blend components in all three polymer combinations PE-PP, PE-PS and PP-PS. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Two {{side-chain}} polyurethanes, HMDI-PU (29) and TDI-PU (2 b), {{have been}} synthesized from 2, 2 '-iminodiethanol (''diethanolamine'') N-substituted with a <b>nitrostilbene</b> group on a hexamethylene spacer with, respectively, hexamethylene diisocyanate and 1 -methyl- 2, 4 -phenylene diisocyanate ('' 2, 4 -toluenediisocyanate''). 2 a showed a smectic liquid-crystalline phase; 2 b {{proved to be}} amorphous. The phase behaviour was characterized by means of differential scanning calorimetry, polarization microscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering. Thermally stimulated discharge current measurements (TSD) revealed at least two strong relaxation processes above the glass transition temperature T-g which {{are related to the}} dynamic glass transition involving the backbone part (alpha) and the mesogenic units (lambda). Non-linear optical analysis of 2 a showed that the Pockels coefficient r(13) was low in the mesophase and high in the isotropic phase. Contrary to expectation, poling in the mesophase did not enhance the Pockels effect. The amorphous 2 b gave both a high and a stable Pockels coefficient (r(33) around 6. 0 pm/V). The stability could be improved by ageing and prolonged poling at the ageing temperature. However, the Pockels coefficient proved to be dependent on the temperature: high above 85 degrees C, low below 85 degrees C (provided that the sample had been heated once before). This was attributed to an antiparallel association of the chromophores. The role of hydrogen bonds influencing poling has been assessed by temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{a new series of}} organosiloxane liquid crystals and the effects of dye addition by mixing and synthetic addition. The organosiloxane compounds are the result of a building block process that seeks to combine the high tilt and wide phase range properties of laterally substituted biphenyl benzoate mesogens with the polymer ruggedness of siloxane head groups. Initially the biphenyl benzoate mesogenic precursors are investigated with bromine, chlorine and fluorine substituents. The materials yield 20 - 45 deg tilt angles with 70 - 130 nCcm"-" 2 spontaneous polarisation. When combined with a siloxane head group, the only liquid crystal phase seen is a 50 deg C wide SmC* phase {{in each of the three}} compounds. The siloxane moieties micro-segregate and form a virtual backbone. As a consequence of the new molecular arrangement, temperature independent, near 45 deg or 45 deg tilt angles are measured for all three compounds. Switching time measurements reveal sub-millisecond switching down to 40 deg C below the I#->#SmC* transition. The attachment of a biphenyl benzoate molecule at either end of the siloxane core results in a series of bi-mesogenic compounds. These compounds yield 60 deg C wide antiferroelectric SmC*_A phases. The antiferroelectric nature is proposed to arise due to a bent conformation of the bi-mesogenic molecules. The spontaneous polarisation is further enhanced to 100 - 140 nCcm"-" 2 whilst the other electro-optic properties broadly follow similar trends to the mono-siloxane compounds. The synthesis of 45 deg tilt ferroelectric compounds opens up the possibility of many new device applications. The feasibility of transferring the benefits offered by ferroelectrics to the field of dyed and single polariser devices is investigated. Three commercial dyes are mixed with the laterally halogen substituted mono-mesogenic organosiloxanes. The phase sequence of the host is maintained along with the near 45 deg tilt angles of the host material. The magnitude of the spontaneous polarisation is reduced in line with the dilution effect of the non-liquid crystalline dye compounds. The switching times, although marginally increased with dye addition, still remained in the hundred microsecond regime demonstrated by the hosts. With the addition of one of the commercial dyes to an antiferroelectric host, three optically distinct states can be observed in a suitably oriented cell. This single polariser tri-state dye guest host device is only made possible by the near 45 deg tilt angle of the bi-mesogenic organosiloxane compounds. In order to introduce more dye into the organosiloxane hosts, a <b>nitrostilbene</b> dye molecule is grafted onto a siloxane core via an eleven carbon length alkyl chain. Following the pattern of the host organosiloxanes, monomeric and dimeric <b>nitrostilbene</b> compounds are studied, and the effect that grafting has on the dye's absorption properties is examined. This attempt to mimic the host structure proved highly successful, with the resultant organosiloxane dyes exhibiting liquid crystalline phases and showing complete miscibility with the organosiloxane hosts over the entire concentration range. Of particular note is the presence of antiferroelectricity in a mono-mesogenic ferroelectric host on addition of a dimeric non-ferroelectric dye. The results of this work show that the virtual backbone effect in low molar mass organosiloxane liquid crystals can be used to increase the solubility of a dye guest moiety and influence the stability and form of the mesophases. The ferroelectric / antiferroelectric characteristics of the liquid-crystal host can be retained and room temperature ferroelectric phases are created with broad temperature invariant properties. In this thesis, as well as the study of the physical and chemical properties of these new materials, some of the potential devices that now become possible are considered.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{considerable}} interest in media which display significant non-linear optical properties; the telecommunications industry may exploit chin films of such materials for signal processing applications. The Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique provides a means of depositing organic layers of a precisely defined thickness. Moreover, by alternating layers of different materials, supermolecular arrays may be fabricated {{in which there is no}} centrosymmetry, and therefore the second-order non-linearity of the constituent molecules may be exploited. An investigation of the properties of water-surface monolayers of a number of novel materials with potentially large non-linearities is described. Several of these compounds are shown to form high quality homogeneous or heterogeneous LB films. The optical and electrical properties of the layers are characterized by optical absorption spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and measurements of capacitance, whilst their structure is examined by electron diffraction. Monolayers of a <b>nitrostilbene</b> dye are shown to exhibit: on exceptionally high degree of crystalline order. Data are also given for theoretical calculations of non-linear coefficients and for the relative efficiency of second harmonic generation from bulk samples of various materials. Studies of second harmonic generation from monolayer and alternate multilayer films are reported. Optical non-linearity in an alternating donor-acceptor: inverted donor-acceptor dye system is demonstrated for the first time; the results are analysed in terms of second harmonic surface susceptibilities, and the value of the second-order hyperpolarizability determined for the first bilayer is found to be much superior to that expected by the simple addition of the hyperpolarizabilities of the separate layers. Monolayers containing a mixture of hemicyanine and cadmium arachldate are found to give rise to second harmonic generation which is enhanced relative to that obtained from a pure monolayer of the dye. Corresponding changes in the absorption spectra of the layers can be observed. These findings may have important implications for improving the efficiencies of any non-linear optical device which utilises IB films...|$|R
