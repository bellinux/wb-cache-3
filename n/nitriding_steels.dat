The specimens were tested at wear testing temperatures of 25 °C and 500 °C under a normal load of 15 N at a sliding speed of 1 m/s. The increase in the wear temperature from 25 °C to 500 °C led to {{a decrease in the}} wear rate and coefficient of friction of the <b>nitrided</b> <b>steel</b> samples. At 25 °C, the wear resistance of the <b>nitrided</b> <b>steel</b> improved by 2. 3 times compared to the untreated specimen. There was about 57 times improvement in wear resistance as the wear temperature increased to 500 o C for the nitrided specimen.

40|$|Nitriding {{processes}} {{are widely used}} to improve the fatigue properties of steel. Fatigue failures in <b>nitriding</b> <b>steels</b> initiate from sub-surface non-metallic inclusions, which are usually oxide inclusions. It is known that duplex oxysulphide inclusions are less harmful to the fatigue properties of steel than oxide inclusions alone, since the sulphide outer phase acts as a buffer to the oxide in the core, and thus reduces the fatigue-initiating stress influence of oxide inclusions. Twelve nitriding steel melts were produced, and non-metallic inclusions, modified by adding CaSi cored wire, were investigated. Since calcium has a high vapour pressure and a low solubility in molten steel, {{it is difficult to}} effectively modify non-metallic inclusions by the addition of CaSi cored wire in small furnaces. However, {{it was found that the}} addition of CaSi cored wire at a lower temperature was favourable to higher calcium injection yield in a small furnace, and it was also observed that the reaction with liquid steel was less violent, resulting in the effective modification of non-metallic inclusions. Analysis by a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray technique showed a proportion of duplex oxysulphide inclusions formed in ingots from 11 A, with the remainder being predominantly globular calcium aluminate inclusions. Specimens for direct stress fatigue testing were produced from steels containing both modified and unmodified inclusions, and the fatigue properties were compared. It was found that calcium aluminate inclusions had a more deleterious effect on the fatigue properties of steel than alumina inclusions. In calcium modified steels, at lifetimes of more than 5 x 10 ⁵ cycles, fatigue cracks always initiated from calcium aluminate inclusions, which were partly or completely debonded from the matrix. The fatigue properties of the calcium modified steel was found to be inferior to those of the unmodified steel. No duplex oxysulphide inclusions were found among those inclusions which produced fatigue crack initiations, and this indicated that when they were present calcium aluminate inclusions governed the fatigue properties of steel whether or not duplex oxysulphide inclusions were present in the steel. It is inferred that the fatigue properties of steel can be improved if all large calcium aluminate inclusions are modified to duplex oxysulphide inclusions...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that the introduction of nitrogen into metallic surfaces improves the mechanical properties of engineering components, such as hardness, wear and fatigue {{as well as the}} corrosion resistance. In addition to conventional techniques such as salt bath and gas nitriding there are currently several methods which utilise plasma environments for mass transfer, e. g. D C plasma nitriding, R F plasma nitriding and plasma immersionion implantation (PI 3). It was the main aim of this investigation to study the plasma nitriding behaviour of a commercially available chromium bearing microalloyed steel, MAXIMA™, in the hot rolled and air cooled condition. The ultimate goal was to assess the possibility of using it as an alternative to conventional quenched and tempered <b>nitriding</b> <b>steels,</b> such as En 19 (AISI 4140) which was used as a reference in this investigation. In order to identify themost suitable gas mixture for the nitriding of MAXIMA™, a comprehensive investigation of DC plasma nitriding at 450 °C was performed by varying the hydrogen concentration in the nitriding atmosphere and examining the structure and the properties of the surface layers. A detailed study of RF plasma nitriding and PI 3 was undertaken using MAXIMA™ steel. In order to gain an insight into the influence of different modes of plasma generation on the formation of the hardened layer and the mass transfer mechanisms involved, a comparison was also made with DC plasma nitriding. All the experiments were conducted on MAXIMA™ steel for five hours at the temperatures of 350, 400, 450, 500 and 550 °C. Optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, in conjunction with microhardness and surface roughness measurements were employed to characterise the nitrided surfaces. X-ray diffraction, both in normal and glancing angle configurations and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy were also utilised to identify the phases that formed on the surface of nitrided specimens and the concentration profiles of different elements. It was found that DC plasma nitriding of MAXIMA™ at all temperatures developed cases with higher surface hardness and roughness, and a slightly thinner compound layer and diffusion zone than those obtained from Enl 9 steel. A comparative study between PI 3 and RF plasma nitriding revealed that the PI 3 process produced surface layers with more favourable properties, such as higher hardnesses and thicker cases, than RF plasma nitriding. Unlike DC plasma nitriding, for the conditions employed no compound layer was formed {{on the surface of the}} samples treated by either PI 3 or RF plasma nitriding. The best case, in terms of hardness and depth, was produced by PI 3 at 350 °C and by DC plasma nitriding at higher temperatures. At all temperatures, RF plasma nitriding produced the shallowest cases with the lowest hardnesses. It has been argued that the mode of plasma generation plays a critical role in nitrogen mass transfer. More specifically, the operating pressure and ion energy have been found to be the key parameters in determining the total nitrogen adsorption on the surface. In DC plasma nitriding mass transfer is primarily controlled by sputtering and re-deposition. The moderate ion energy in DC plasma nitriding causes sputtering of the cathodic surfaces. Sputtered species undergo collision with the nitrogen in the vicinity of the surface because of low mean free path for collision (few millimetres) which is a direct result of the relatively high operating pressure of a DC plasma. In stark contrast, in PI 3 and RF plasma nitriding, the mean free path for collision of the ions and atoms is in the order of several centimetres because of low operating pressure, hence there will be no collisions near the sample and no re-deposition of sputtered material will take place. Owing to extremely high ion energies involved in PI 3, ion implantation is the dominant mass transfer mechanism and sputtering of surface atoms is considerably lower than DC plasma nitriding. The lack of significantly energised ions in RF plasma nitriding eliminates the possibility of implantation and the main mass transfer mechanism is due to the adsorption of low energy neutral species which are incapable of inducing and sputtering...|$|E

The unlubricated sliding wear behaviour of gas nitrided, plasma nitrided, and ferritic nitrocarburized BS 970, 905 M 39 (EN 41 B) steels was investigated systematically from an engineering point of view. Commercial nitriding processes were employed, and the wear {{studies were carried out}} using a pin-on-disc machine over a wide range of sliding speeds and applied loads. The worn specimens and wear debris were examined by several techniques; including optical and electron microscopy and X-ray analysis. A sharp wear rate transition between mild and severe regimes was identified by varying the load for both untreated and gas <b>nitrided</b> <b>steels.</b> The wear rate was reduced by gas nitriding by up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the sliding condition. Moreover, gas nitriding expanded the mild wear region toward higher loads and sliding speeds. In the mild regime an oxidative wear mechanism operated, contrasting with the metallic wear in the severe regime. Wear maps for untreated and gas <b>nitrided</b> <b>steels</b> have been constructed, which show the dominant regimes of the wear mechanisms. A "wear-face-limited" gas nitrided pin test showed that the benefit of the treatment was lost once the effective surface layer was completely worn away. It is suggested that hardness has a crucial role in determining the wear rate through nitrided diffusion layers. A thick and porous compound layer produced by gas nitriding showed a poor wear behaviour owing to its brittleness, while a thin nitrocarburized E-Fe 3 N compound layer exhibited a low wear rate.
