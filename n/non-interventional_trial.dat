40|$|Background/Methods: The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument Project is a {{longitudinal}} study that recruited 644 cognitively healthy older subjects (aged between 75 and 93 years, 58 % women) at baseline and evaluated their cognitive change over 4 years. The study was structured like a clinical trial to anticipate a prevention trial and to determine the performance of novel trial instruments in {{a longitudinal}} <b>non-interventional</b> <b>trial</b> framework. Behavioral symptoms were assessed at baseline. Results: The existence of participant-reported behavioral symptoms at baseline predicted conversion to Clinical Dementia Rating scale score ≥ 0. 5 over the 4 -year period. Conclusions: The results imply that early anxiety and depression may be harbingers of future cognitive decline, and that patients exhibiting such symptoms, {{even in the absence}} of co-occurring cognitive symptoms, should be closely followed over time...|$|E
40|$|Not all Phase IV {{studies are}} post-marketing {{surveillance}} (PMS) studies but every PMS {{study is a}} phase IV study. Phase IV {{is also an important}} phase of drug development. In particular, the real world effectiveness of a drug as evaluated in an observational, <b>non-interventional</b> <b>trial</b> in a naturalistic setting which complements the efficacy data that emanates from a pre-marketing randomized controlled trial (RCT). No matter how many patients are studied pre-marketing in a controlled environment, the true safety profile of a drug is characterized only by continuing safety surveillance through a spontaneous adverse event monitoring system and a post-marketing surveillance/non-interventional study. Prevalent practice patterns can generate leads that could result in further evaluation of a new indication via the RCT route or even a signal that may necessitate regulatory action (change in labeling, risk management/minimization action plan). Disease registries are another option as are the large simple hybrid trials. Surveillance of spontaneously reported adverse events continues as long as a product is marketed. And so Phase IV in that sense never ends...|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{uncertain}} whether first trimester nuchal translucency (NT) {{is more effective}} than the well-established second trimester serum screening for fetal Down syndrome or whether their combination works best. We report data from a large multicentre <b>non-interventional</b> <b>trial</b> in which all subjects underwent both first and second trimester screening. Methods: All women who attended the obstetric clinic before 15 weeks' gestation were recruited. An ultrasound examination was performed at 10 to 14 weeks to measure the NT. The nuchal measurements were not acted upon unless the fetus showed gross features of hydrops fetalis. All women had serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) assay at 15 to 20 weeks. The Down syndrome risk assigned by serum screening was disclosed and amniocentesis was offered if this assigned risk was ≥ 1 : 250 or if the women were 35 years and older. The efficacy of different combinations of screening markers was compared. Results: Between January 1997 and August 2000, 17 590 women were recruited (19 % ≥ 35 years old). After excluding subjects who miscarried, defaulted the serum test and other reasons, 16 237 pregnancies were analysed. Of these, 35 pregnancies were affected by Down syndrome (2. 2 cases per 1000 pregnancies). At a false-positive rate of 5 %, the detection rate of Down syndrome by NT alone, NT and age, serum hCG, AFP and age, and NT, hCG, AFP and age were 61 %, 69 %, 73 % and 86 %, respectively. Conclusion: Integration of NT and second trimester serum AFP and hCG assay yielded the best screening efficacy for Down syndrome.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy and tolerability of avocado / soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) and their combination with intra-articular hyaluronic acid in patients with knee and hip osteoarthrosis (OA). Subjects and methods. A randomized observational <b>non-interventional</b> non-placebo controlled <b>trial</b> was conducted. It included 18 patients who were randomized to 2 groups with 9 in each. One patient group took only ASU along with nonsteroidal anti-nflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); the other received ASU in combination with intra-articular hyaluronic acid. Their treatment was performed for 6 months, followed by a 6 -month follow-up. The results were assessed by the WOMAC index. Account was taken of the opinions of a patient and his / her physician on therapeutic effectiveness, as well as altered needs for NSAIDs during treatment and after the follow-up. Results. There was a gradual reduction in joint pain, stiffness, and dysfunction (as shown by the visual analog scale) in both groups just one month posttherapy. This trend remained for 3 months. After 6 months of therapy, there were slight increases in the values of joint pain, stiffness, and dysfunction in the combined therapy group whereas the values continued to decrease in the monotherapy group. Six months after termination of treatment, the examined values doubled in the ASU monotherapy group and remained at posttreatment visit levels in the combined therapy group. Just the same, six months after termination of 6 -month therapy, both groups displayed the significantly lower values of pain, stiffness, and dysfunction than those prior to treatment. ASU used both alone and in combination with hyaluronic acid was noted to be well tolerated. The considerable reduction in the needs for NSAIDs in both groups and, {{in a number of}} cases, the possibility of reducing their intake proved the efficiency of ASU used alone and in combination with hyaluronic acid. The important result of this trial was the good tolerability of both test drugs. Conclusion. The results of the performed trial provided support for the efficacy of ASU in treating both moderate and severe knee and hip OA. Hyaluronic acid in combination with ASU ensures a longer duration of the achieved effect than that of ASU monotherapy (during 12  months, a minimum of 6 months after termination of treatment) regardless of the severity and duration of OA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{reduction}} of blood pressure {{alone does not}} eliminate the increased risk of arterial hypertension. Whilst concomitant metabolic risk factors {{have been shown to}} be responsible, the available pharmacotherapy has differential effects on these metabolic risk factors. For example, diuretics and betablockers worsen glucose metabolism, hence the starting point of the current subanalysis of the CHILI (Candesartan in patients with HIgher cardiovascuLar rIsk) study was the assumption that an angiotensin receptor blocker may counterbalance the metabolic effects of a low dose diuretic in patients with several metabolic risk factors. Methods The present study was performed as a non-interventional observational study in Germany. Patients with previously uncontrolled hypertension with at least one further risk factor in which physicians deemed a treatment with 16 mg Candesartan/ 12. 5 mg HCTZ to be necessary were included. The risk factors were calculated in patient subgroups with diabetes, the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) and neither condition (control). The risk of cardiovascular mortality within the next 10 years was calculated using the SCORE algorithm of the ESC. Results Between August 2006 and February 2007 a total of 3, 787 patients were included into the <b>non-interventional</b> <b>trial.</b> Patients were 62. 2 ± 11. 3 years old, 48. 1 % were female, 97. 5 % had at least one additional risk factor. Blood pressure was reduced by - 27. 2 /- 13. 4 mmHg with only minor non significant variations between patient groups. Waist circumference was reduced (P Conclusion The present study demonstrates that a 16 mg candesartan/ 12. 5 mg HCTZ based treatment results in a pronounced blood pressure reduction and was associated with a favourable change in metabolic risk factors such as HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose. These data indicate that metabolic effects observed in clinical trials like ALPINE, SCOPE or CHARM can also be observed in an unselected patient population in primary care. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} virtually {{lacks the}} results of investigations aimed to study the clinical picture of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the real practice of rheumatologists  in Russia. At the same time, these investigations may give information  on not only the epidemiological aspects of the disease, but also a variety of its clinical presentation, its social importance, allow evaluation of the efficiency of therapy, and plan a system of further health care costs. Subjects and methods. In early 2015, the cross-sectional multicenter  <b>non-interventional</b> <b>trial</b> EPICA 2 was conducted to refine the clinical picture of AS in the real practice of a rheumatologist. The trial involved 402 patients with AS from 10 centers of Russia. The patients were examined using the international standards accepted for this disease. Results and discussion. 180 out of the 402 patients were treated in hospital; the others were examined during outpatient visits. The patients' mean age was 40. 8 ± 11. 5 years; there were 292 (72. 6 %) men; 82. 6 % were HLA-B 27 positive. The average age of onset was 27. 6 years; the interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was 85. 2 months. The rheumatologists  established the diagnosis in 87. 3 % of the cases. BASDAI and BASFI averaged 4. 3 ± 2. 1 and 4. 1 ± 1. 8, respectively. At the trial, there was peripheral arthritis in 33. 1 % of the patients, enthesitis in 37. 1 %, and dactylitis in 1. 2 %. Joint endoprosthesis {{was carried out in}} 4. 7 % of the patients. The most common  comorbidities were hypertension (25. 1 %), gastric ulcer (9. 7 %), coronary heart disease (4. 0 %), and diabetes mellitus (3. 0 %). Conclusion. AS is diagnosed in real practice more than 7 years after its onset mainly by rheumatologists. The delay of the diagnosis is mostly associated with the fact that specialists of other medical specialties are unaware of the clinical presentation  of the disease. The examined group of patients with AS shows a relatively high activity and obvious functional impairments, which is primarily related to the specific features of patient selection in this trial. </p...|$|E
