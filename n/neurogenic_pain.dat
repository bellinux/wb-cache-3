METHODS AND MEASURES: Twenty patients with subacute peripheral <b>neurogenic</b> cervicobrachial <b>pain</b> were assessed. Besides other criteria, patients were included if a cervical segmental motion restriction was present which could be regarded as a possible cause of the neurogenic disorder.

40|$|Patients {{with severe}} and chronic <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain</b> {{are known to}} exhibit excess EEG {{oscillations}} in the 4 - to 9 -Hz theta frequency band in comparison with healthy controls. The generators of these excess EEG oscillations are localized in the cortical pain matrix. Since cortex and thalamus are tightly interconnected anatomically, we asked how thalamic activity and EEG are functionally related in these patients. During the surgical intervention in ten patients with <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain,</b> local field potentials were recorded from the posterior part of the central lateral nucleus (CL).

Median thalamocortical theta coherence was 27 %, reached up to 68 % and was maximal with frontal midline scalp sites. The observed high thalamocortical coherence underlines the importance of the thalamus for the synchronization of scalp EEG.

40|$|Abstract Background Management of pain {{involves}} {{a balance between}} inhibition of pain and minimization of side effects; therefore, in developing new analgesic compounds, one must consider the effects of treatment on both pain processing and behavior. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of the mu and kappa- 2 opioid receptor agonists on general and pain behavioral outcomes. Methods As a general behavioral assessment, we modified the cylinder rearing assay and recorded the number and duration of rearing events. Thermal sensitivity was evaluated using either a reflexive measure of hindpaw withdrawal latency to a radiant heat source or using an orofacial operant thermal assay. Acetic acid-induced visceral <b>pain</b> and capsaicin-induced <b>neurogenic</b> inflammatory <b>pain</b> were used as painful stimuli. The mu-opioid receptor agonist, morphine or the kappa- 2 receptor agonist GR 89696 was administered 30 min prior to testing. A general linear model repeated measures analysis was completed for baseline session comparisons and an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effects of treatment on each outcome measure (SPSS Inc). When significant differences were found, post-hoc comparisons were made using the Tukey honestly significant difference test. *P Results We found that morphine and GR 89, 696 dose-dependently decreased the number of reaching events and rearing duration. Rearing behavior was not affected at 0. 5 mg/kg for morphine, 1. 25 × 10 - 4 mg/kg for GR 89, 696. Hindpaw thermal sensitivity was significantly increased only at the highest doses for each drug. At the highest dose that did not significantly influence rearing behavior, we found that visceral and <b>neurogenic</b> inflammatory <b>pain</b> was not affected following GR 89, 696 administration and morphine was only partially effective for blocking visceral pain. Conclusion This study demonstrated that high levels of the opioids produced significant untoward effects and made distinguishing an analgesic versus a more general effect more difficult. Quantification of rearing behavior in conjunction with standard analgesic assays can help in gaining a better appreciation of true analgesic efficacy of experimental drugs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Functional brain imaging of pain {{over the}} last years has {{provided}} insight into a distributed anatomical matrix involved in pain processing which includes multiple cortical areas. EEG/MEG-based imaging studies have mostly relied on settings of evoked nociception. We report here the spontaneous presence of enhanced activations in the pain matrix of the patient group on the basis of continuous EEG and functional Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) from 16 chronic <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain</b> patients and 16 healthy controls. These overactivations occurred predominantly within the high theta (6 - 9 Hz) and low beta frequency ranges (12 - 16 Hz). Theta and beta overactivations were localized to multiple pain-associated areas, primarily to insular (IC), anterior cingulate (ACC), prefrontal, and inferior posterior parietal cortices, as well as to primary (S 1), secondary (S 2), and supplementary somatosensory (SSA) cortices. After a therapeutic lesion in the thalamus (central lateral thalamotomy, CLT), we followed a subgroup of 6 patients. Twelve months after surgery, activation in cingulate and insular cortices was significantly reduced. The presence of rhythmic processes in multiple, partially overlapping areas of the cortical pain matrix concur with the concept of thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD) that predicts increased thalamocortical low and high frequency oscillations ensuing from thalamic desactivation. These spontaneous, ongoing, frequency-specific overactivations may therefore serve as an anatomo-physiological hallmark of the processes underlying chronic <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to assess the {{influence}} of: a) trait anxiety on orofacial pain; and b) orofacial pain on state anxiety. Forty-four rats were initially exposed to the free-exploratory paradigm for the evaluation of their anxiety profiles. In accordance to the parameter "Percentage of time in the novel side", the animals were considered as presenting high or low levels of trait anxiety when presenting values below the 1 st quartile, or above the 3 rd quartile, respectively. A week later, formalin- 1. 5 % was injected into the upper lip of each animal. The behavioural nociceptive response, characterized by increased orofacial rubbing (OR), was quantified for 30 minutes, as follows: Total time OR (0 - 30 minutes: total pain), 1 st phase OR (0 - 6 minutes: <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain),</b> and 2 nd phase OR (12 - 30 minutes: inflammatory pain).

40|$|Background: Chronic {{shoulder}} and neck pain {{is a very}} common and costly condition, for which manipulative physiotherapy is frequently recommended, although evidence to support its use is limited. This study examined {{the effectiveness of a}} scheme of manipulative physiotherapy examination and treatment in the management of a subject with <b>neurogenic</b> cervicobrachial <b>pain.</b> Methods: A single case study ABC design was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} manipulative physiotherapy. The patient was a 44 -year old woman with an eight-month history of left-sided <b>neurogenic</b> cervicobrachial <b>pain.</b> Clinical examination demonstrated signs of upper quadrant neural tissue mechanosensitivity suggesting that neural tissue was the origin of the subject's complaint of pain. Corroborative magnetic resonance imaging verified that the cause for the patient's radicular signs and symptoms was discal pathology at the C 5 / 6 intersegmental level. The study involved three phases Phase A was a four-week pre-assessment phase; Phase B was a four-week treatment phase; Phase C was a two-week home exercise phase. Before phase A and at the end of each phase the patient's function (Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire), pain (Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire or SF-MPQ) and cervical and left shoulder abduction range of motion were measured. Manipulative physiotherapy treatment consisted of a lateral glide mobilisation technique of C 5 on C 6 towards the right side, performed by a physiotherapist with a postgraduate qualification in manipulative physiotherapy. Treatment was 3 sessions per week for 2 weeks and 2 sessions per week for 2 weeks. The two-week home exercise phase consisted of the patient performing an active cervical right side flexion movement. Results: From the end of Phase A to the 1 month follow-up there was a 42 % improvement in functional disability; there was a 70 % reduction in pain level recorded in the VAS aspect of the SF-MPQ; shoulder abduction increased from 280 to 1400 and cervical right side flexion increased from 180 to 520. Because of the controversy regarding performing statistical tests on single case studies, and because there was obvious clinical improvement, no statistical tests were performed on the results. Conclusion: This treatment protocol produced beneficial effects on functional disability, pain and cervical and shoulder mobility in a patient with chronic cervicobrachial pain. These improvements were maintained until a one-month follow-up. The single case design of the study limits generalisation of the findings, but the results give further impetus for a clinical trial...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} obtain more {{specific}} evidence on the possible mechanism of analgesic activity of L. sativus L. seeds, the effect of different doses of the plant extract on formalin test was examined. This test model is considered {{as a method of}} persistent pain produced by the intra-plantar injection of formalin that induces a biphasic nociceptive behavior. The early phase (0 – 5  min) is characterized by <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain</b> caused by C-fibre activation due to the stimulation of peripheral nociceptors caused by formalin [44]. A second burst of licking behavior occurs after 15 to 30  min and seems to be characterized by the inflammatory response elicited by formalin which is triggered by a combination of stimuli, including inflammation of the peripheral tissues and mechanisms of central sensitization [45, 46]. Again it is assumed that manifestation in the late phase is due to inflammation causing a release of serotonin, histamine, bradykinin and prostaglandins, which at least to some degree can cause the sensitization of the central nociceptive neurons [47]. It is reported that substance P is involved in the first phase whereas histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins and bradykinin are responsible for the second phase of inflammation [45]. In our research, the extract demonstrated antinociceptive activity in blocking both phases of the formalin response although the effect of the extract was more pronounced in the late phase of test. As oral pretreatment with L. sativus L. inhibited the first (<b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain)</b> and second (inflammatory nociception) phases of formalin-induced licking in mice therefore it may be postulated that the plant extract may possess both peripheral and central effect.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} of chronic <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain,</b> we compared the power spectra of the resting EEG of patients (n = 15, 38 - 75 years, median 64 years, 6 women) and healthy controls (n = 15, 41 - 71 years, median 60 years, 8 women). On an average, the patient group exhibited higher spectral power over the frequency range of 2 - 25 Hz, and the dominant peak was shifted towards lower frequencies. Maximal differences appeared in the 7 - 9 Hz band in all electrodes. Frontal electrodes contributed most to this difference in the 13 - 15 Hz band. Bicoherence analysis suggests an enhanced coupling between theta (4 - 9 Hz) and beta (12 - 25 Hz) frequencies in patients. The subgroup of six patients free from centrally acting medication showed higher spectral power in the 2 - 18 Hz frequency range. On an individual basis, the combination of peak height and peak frequency discriminated between patient and control groups: discriminant analysis classified 87 % of all subjects correctly. After a therapeutic lesion in the thalamus (central lateral thalamotomy, CLT) we carried out follow-up for a subgroup of seven patients. Median pain relief was 70 and 95 % after 3 and 12 months, respectively. The average EEG power of all seven patients gradually decreased in the theta band and approached normal values only after 12 months. The excess theta EEG power in patients and its decrease after thalamic surgery suggests that both EEG and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain</b> are determined by tightly coupled thalamocortical loops. The small therapeutic CLT lesion is thought to initiate a progressive normalization in the affected thalamocortical system, which is reflected in both decrease of EEG power and pain relie...|$|E

In 87 patients with venous TOS, only 21 patients had no thrombosis. We describe {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of these patients. Material and methodsTwenty-one patients with arm swelling, cyanosis, and venograms demonstrating partial subclavian vein obstruction were treated with transaxillary first rib resection and venolysis. ResultsEighteen (86 %) of 21 patients had good-to-excellent improvement of symptoms. There were two failures (9 %). ConclusionsUnilateral arm swelling without thrombosis, when not caused by lymphatic obstruction, may be due to subclavian vein compression at the costoclavicular ligament because of compression either by that ligament or the subclavius tendon most often because of congenital close proximity of the vein to the ligament.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{characterize}} the role of spinal endogenous ATP and P 2 X receptors in the generation of neurogenic and inflammatory pain. We examined the effects of intrathecal treatment with P 2 X receptor antagonists on the formalin- and capsaicin-induced nociceptive behaviours in mice. Intrathecal pretreatment with the general P 2 receptor antagonist, pyridoxal-phosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2 ′, 4 ′-disulphonic acid (PPADS), significantly suppressed both the first and second phases of the formalin-induced nociceptive behaviour. The second phase of the nociceptive response was also suppressed by intrathecal treatment with PPADS after the first phase. Furthermore, pretreatment with the selective antagonist for the P 2 X 1, P 2 X 3 and P 2 X 2 + 3 receptors, 2 ′, 3 ′-O-(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), significantly reduced the first phase, but not the second phase. The second phase was also not suppressed by intrathecal TNP-ATP after the first phase. Capsaicin-induced nociceptive behaviour that {{has been shown to be}} a model for <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain,</b> was also significantly suppressed by intrathecal pretreatment with PPADS or TNP-ATP. Nociceptive behaviour in the first phase of the formalin test and in the capsaicin test were significantly inhibited by intrathecal pretreatment with α,β-methylene ATP (α,βmeATP: 5 [*]μg mouse− 1) 15 [*]min prior to injection of formalin or capsaicin.

These findings suggest that spinal endogenous ATP may play a role in (1) the formalin- and capsaicin-induced <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain</b> via the PPADS- and TNP-ATP-sensitive P 2 X receptors which are also desensitized by α,βmeATP (perhaps the P 2 X 3 receptor subtype) and (2) formalin-induced inflammatory pain via PPADS-sensitive, TNP-ATP- and α,βmeATP-insensitive P 2 X (and/or P 2 Y) receptors...|$|E
40|$|Hot red chili peppers, which {{belong to}} the plant genus Cap-sicum, {{are among the most}} heavily and {{frequently}} consumed spices throughout the world. Their principal pungent ingredient is the phenolic substance capsaicin (8 -methyl-N-vanillyl- 6 -nonenamide). Although capsaicin can cause neurogenic inflam-mation per se under certain physiologic conditions, it also has analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities and is used currently in topical creams and gels (e. g., Axsain and Zostrix) to mitigate <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain.</b> A receptor for capsaicin and other structurally related substances was identified and cloned (1 – 3). This recep-tor, vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR 1), forms a nonselective cation channel in the plasma membrane that mediates some of the pleiotropic effects exerted by capsaicin and its analogues, which are collectively named vanilloids. The role of capsaicin in carcinogenic processes is quite con...|$|E
40|$|Kutajarishta (KTJ) is an Ayurvedic {{formulation}} {{approved by}} the “National formulary of Ayurvedic Medicine 2011 ”, of Bangladesh. It is widely available in the Bangladeshi market as an effective preparation to treat lumbago, sciatia and arthritic pain of joints. Our present studies make an attempt toward identifying probable anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of KTJ. KTJ, at three doses, (10 mL/kg, 20 mL/kg, and 40 mL/kg) showed no involvement of the CNS in anti-nociceptive activity of KTJ. Carrageenan induced paw edema and acetic acid writhing tests both gave significant results (P ≤ 0. 05), indicating possible peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory action. Formalin induced paw-licking test showed that KTJ had significant effect in suppressing inflammatory pain (P≤ 0. 05) but not <b>neurogenic</b> <b>pain.</b> Hence our study shows anti-inflammatory and peripheral analgesic action for KTJ. </span...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefit of}} {{antidepressant}} treatment in human neuropathic pain is now well documented, {{but the effect}} is limited and slow to appear. It has been demonstrated that the association of a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist and a serotoninergic antidepressant reduced the delay of action and increases the thymoanaleptic effect of the drug. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the combination of an antidepressant and a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist in animal models of chronic neuropathic pain. We studied the antinociceptive effect of the co-administration of clomipramine and a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist (WAY 100, 635) in a pain test applied in normal rats and in two models of <b>neurogenic</b> sustained <b>pain</b> (mononeuropathic and diabetic rats). The results show {{an increase in the}} antinociceptive effect of acutely injected clomipramine due to WAY 100, 635 in these models, which is majored when the two drugs are repeatedly injected. The 5 -HT 1 A antagonist reduced the delay of onset and increased the maximal antinociceptive effect of clomipramine. These new findings argue for using the combination of an antidepressant and a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist in human neuropathic pain therapy...|$|R
40|$|A {{single case}} study ABC design {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of manipulative physiotherapy in a 44 -year-old woman with an 8 -month history of <b>neurogenic</b> cervicobrachial <b>pain.</b> Clinical examination demonstrated significant signs of upper quadrant neural tissue mechanosensitivity indicating that neural tissue was the dominant tissue of origin for the subject's complaint of pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed correlating discal pathology at the C 5 / 6 intersegmental level. The study involved a 4 -week pre-assessment phase, a 4 -week treatment phase and a 2 -week home exercise phase. Functional disability was measured using the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire and pain was assessed using the McGill Short Form Pain Questionnaire. Cervical motion was measured by a cervical range of motion device (CROM) and the range of shoulder abduction with a mediclino inclinometer. Manipulative physiotherapy treatment involved a cervical lateral glide mobilization technique. Following treatment, visual analysis revealed beneficial effects on pain, functional disability as well as cervical and shoulder mobility. These improvements were maintained over the home exercise phase and at 1 -month follow-up. The single case limits generalization of the findings, but the results support previous studies in this area and gives further impetus to controlled clinical trials. <br/...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increased}} interest in load-sharing devices for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis. Although the neurovas-cular anatomy of the heel has been well described, {{the purpose of this}} study is to consider heel anatomy as it relates to plantar heel incisions and to well-defined flu-oroscopic landmarks to prevent complications during these procedures. Twenty lateral radiographs of normal feet while stand-ing were evaluated by two observers. The distance from the calcaneocuboid (CC) joint to a line parallel to the center of the intramedullary canal of the tibia was cal-culated. ln the second part of the study, 14 dissections of the arterial and neural anatomy were performed. The distances from the CC joint to structures crossing the heel proximal to the CC joint were studied. In the 20 standing radiographs, the mean distance from the CC joint to the middle of the intramedullary canal of the tibia was 2. 1 cm (standard deviation, 0. 55 cm). In the dissections, the only artery or nerve found to cross the plantar surface proximal to the CC joint was the nerve to the abductor digiti quinti (NAbDQ). The mean distance from the CC joint to the NAbDQ was 3. 1 cm (standard deviation, 1. 36 cm). Assuming reaming to 12 mm, NAbDQ would be at risk 42 % of the time. We recommend careful dissection of the heel during retro-grade roddings to avoid damage to NAbDQ and subse-quent <b>neurogenic</b> heel <b>pain...</b>|$|R
