5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be close to the}} coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E

25|$|A {{properly}} {{engineered structure}} does not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be extremely strong or expensive. It {{has to be}} properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while sustaining an acceptable level of damage.|$|E
25|$|Religion {{has several}} definitions. Religions that are {{organized}} {{can be seen}} as cultural systems, with corresponding behavior and practice. They often have sacred texts and holy places. A religious experience, however, does not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be understood through an established religious framework.|$|E
25|$|Delusions do not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be false}} or 'incorrect inferences about {{external}} reality'. Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature {{may not be}} falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.|$|E

50|$|Study {{software}} to a degree, seeks to circumvent this problem, by causing {{the student to}} follow good practices, {{through the use of}} the software, without <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> know about the background science of memory and learning.|$|R
50|$|Criticism {{which is}} professionally done - {{this implies that}} it is {{expertly}} done, and could hardly be improved. That usually means {{that it is so}} well-designed, that nobody can deny it, and that people feel something <b>necessarily</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be done about it.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 2015–16, {{the team}} that benefited from that rule did not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be a Bundesliga member. For example, {{although}} 2. Bundesliga sides Alemannia Aachen lost to Werder Bremen in the 2004 DFB-Pokal Final, Alemannia secured an entry in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, because Werder qualified for the Champions League as First Bundesliga champions.|$|E
25|$|The common pentatonic {{major and}} minor scales (C-D-E-G-A and C-E-F-G-B, respectively) are useful in modal composing, as both scales allow a melody to be modally {{ambiguous}} between their respective major (Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian) and minor (Aeolian, Phrygian, Dorian) modes (Locrian excluded). With either modal or non-modal writing, however, the harmonization of a pentatonic melody does not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be derived from only the pentatonic pitches.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{recent studies}} (above and Rohde 2005a,b) support {{the view that}} niche space is largely unsaturated, i.e. that {{numerous}} vacant niches exist. As a consequence, competition between species is not as important as usually assumed. Nonequilibria are caused not only by environmental disturbances, but are widespread because of nonsaturation of niche space. Newly evolved species are absorbed into empty niche space, that is, niches occupied by existing species do not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> shrink.|$|E
40|$|As {{networks}} {{continue to}} proliferate, {{the need to}} develop and deploy network management applications has become a critical issue. Two software development tools are described that allow developers to create powerful network management-side applications quickly without <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> be experts on network protocols...|$|R
50|$|An {{individual}} in South Africa may develop malnutrition because of several factors, {{not all of}} them <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> do with diet. According to UNICEF, factors that can cause malnutrition include {{but are not limited to}} stress, trauma, poor psychological care, neglect, and abuse.|$|R
5000|$|Strategic Attack {{is defined}} as [...] "offensive action {{specifically}} selected to achieve national strategic objectives. These attacks seek to weaken the adversary's ability or will to engage in conflict, and may achieve strategic objectives without <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> achieve operational objectives as a precondition" [...] (Annex 3-70, Strategic Attack).|$|R
25|$|The {{frequency}} response function (FRF) does not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be calculated from {{the knowledge of the}} mass, damping, and stiffness of the system—but can be measured experimentally. For example, if a known force over a range of frequencies is applied, and if the associated vibrations are measured, the {{frequency response}} function can be calculated, thereby characterizing the system. This technique is used in the field of experimental modal analysis to determine the vibration characteristics of a structure.|$|E
25|$|Bullshit {{does not}} <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be a {{complete}} fabrication. While a lie is related by a speaker who believes what is said is false, bullshit is offered by a speaker who does not care whether what is said is true because the speaker {{is more concerned with}} giving the hearer some impression. Thus bullshit may be either true or false, but demonstrates a lack of concern for the truth which is likely to lead to falsehoods.|$|E
25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be {{temporally}} the first. Thus, {{the question of}} whether or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E
5000|$|To begin with, however, such {{expansion}} <b>necessarily</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be kept {{within certain}} bounds.

50|$|Market {{consolidation}} {{and expansion}} has permitted service providers to offer faster and less expensives services with typical speeds {{of up to}} 24 Mbit/s downstream (subject to ISP and line length). They can offer products at sometimes considerably lower prices, due <b>to</b> not <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> conform to the same regulatory requirements as BT Wholesale: for example, 8 unbundled LLU pairs can deliver 10 Mbit/s over 3775 meters for half {{the price of a}} similar Fibre connection.|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the impact of}} the charity accounting regime on churches in the various legal jurisdictions of the UK. While churches have charitable status throughout the UK, historically they <b>have</b> not <b>necessarily</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> follow the normal requirements for charity financial reporting. But churches are now starting to submit accounts to regulators like other charities and the impact of this is considered...|$|R
25|$|However, these hybrids don’t <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be of low dingo-content. During an {{analysis}} of 56 wild dogs in Southeast-Queensland {{the researchers found that}} these dogs had a dingo-content of more than 50% or were “pure” dingoes. “Pure” feral dogs of other origin or hybrids with low dingo-content could not be found. Therefore, it was reasoned that the wild dogs of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast are the descendents of dingoes, instead of escaped or rejected dogs. During studies on wild dogs of the Kosciuszko national park, many hybrids were found but these dogs were of relatively high dingo-content.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some {{skepticism}} (most notably from Arthur Phillips himself), {{it would have been}} remarkably difficult for A.E.H. Phillips to have constructed a forgery to fool all modern forensic evidence and Shakespeare scholars, especially given the quarto would <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> predate much of the technology and research used to check its authenticity. Even though Phillips claims that the play is the work of his father, most Shakespeare scholars have discounted his theory. The only copy of the 1594 quarto of Titus Andronicus was discovered in an attic in Sweden in 1904, and so the bizarre means by which Arthur has been lost for centuries seem relatively plausible.|$|E
25|$|Mobile speed cameras may be hand-held, tripod mounted, or vehicle-mounted. In vehicle-mounted systems, {{detection}} equipment and cameras can be mounted {{to the vehicle}} itself, or simply tripod mounted inside the vehicle and deployed out a window or door. If the camera is fixed to the vehicle, the enforcement vehicle does not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be stationary, and can be moved either with or against the flow of traffic. In the latter case, depending on the direction of travel, the target vehicle's relative speed is either added or subtracted from the enforcement vehicle's own speed to obtain its actual speed. The speedometer of the camera vehicle needs to be accurately calibrated.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanic}} usually {{works from}} the workshop in which the (well equipped) mechanic <b>has</b> access <b>to</b> a vehicle lift to access areas {{that are difficult to}} reach when the car is on the ground.

500|$|Instead, in {{preparing}} the training course, Wilson drew on his knowledge that critical breaks in railroad systems could disrupt the entire system. He theorized that this was equally true of other industries, that by attacking vulnerabilities, whole industries could be brought to a halt without <b>necessarily</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> destroy all the factories. The school identified transportation, steel, iron ore, and electric power as key economic industries. Wilson termed this doctrine [...] "industrial web theory".|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} in his {{argument}} is that when people engage in trade, run a business or work in a job, they adopt and personify (personally represent) a certain function, role or behaviour pattern which is required of them to serve their obligations; their consent to the applicable rules is assumed, as a necessity {{to succeed in the}} activities. They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work with in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks {{which is part of the}} job.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} {{nature of}} Harmelin's sentence {{also did not}} require setting it aside. First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to set Harmelin's sentence aside, it would <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reject {{the judgment of the}} legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E
25|$|The {{program was}} the result of a {{compromise}} by NBC Universal's then-CEO Jeff Zucker to keep Jay Leno with the company following his retirement from The Tonight Show and replacement with Conan O'Brien. The Jay Leno Show was also intended to provide NBC with an alternative to the high-cost scripted dramas aired by competing networks in its time slot; the network believed that the lower cost of production, in combination with product placement deals, meant that the program did not <b>necessarily</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be highly viewed in order to turn a profit. NBC hoped to attract Leno's existing fans, as well as a larger primetime audience than that of his late-night program.|$|E
