5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by <b>narcissus</b> <b>fly</b> and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} common species in the genus, Merodon equestris {{is known as the}} Narcissus bulb fly, greater bulb-fly, large bulb fly or large <b>Narcissus</b> <b>fly.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pests of Scadoxus in {{cultivation}} in the UK include mealy {{bugs and}} <b>narcissus</b> bulb <b>fly</b> (Merodon equestris). Red spider mites (Tetranychus species), slugs and snails {{can also cause}} problems. In South Africa, where species such as S. puniceus can be grown outside, lily borer (Brithys crini) attacks plants.|$|R
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small <b>narcissus</b> bulb <b>flies</b> (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|R
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, <b>narcissus</b> bulb <b>fly</b> Merodon equestris, and {{two species of}} hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The {{hatching}} larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|R
5000|$|Merodon equestris (Narcissus bulb fly, greater bulb fly, large bulb fly, large <b>Narcissus</b> <b>fly)</b> is a Holarctic {{species of}} {{hoverfly}} (Family Syrphidae). [...] Like many other hoverflies it displays a colouration pattern {{similar to a}} stinging insect (a bumblebee in this case) as an evolutionary defense mechanism. Other syrphid bee mimics are Mallota, Arctophila, Criorhina, Pocota and Brachypalpus. Merodon species are distinguished from these by the very strong hind femora, which bear a large triangular projection on the underside near the tip. It flies in low vegetation while the other bumblebee mimics prefer higher vegetation layers.|$|E
50|$|James Allen (1832-1906) of Shepton Mallet was {{probably}} {{the first person to}} raise hybrid snowdrops from seed made from deliberate crosses. In 1891 he reported that he grew every known species of Galanthus and had raised over 100 distinct seedlings, but much of his collection was lost to botrytis and <b>narcissus</b> <b>fly</b> soon afterward. At least two of his cultivars, G. 'Magnet' and G. 'Merlin', survive and are widely grown by collectors. He also raised hybrids which he called G. 'Galatea' and G. 'Robin Hood', but the plants now grown under those names today may not be the same as those he selected. Galanthus x allenii is a hybrid, of unknown origin, that appeared in a batch of G. latifolius (now called G. platyphyllus), which Allen had got from an Austrian supplier in 1883 (according to Bishop et al. {{it is more likely that}} the bulbs were another broad-leaved species, G. woronowii, often confused with G. platyphyllus). The bulbs were most probably collected in the Caucasus but G. ×allenii has never been found in the wild since then, so one can only speculate where the cross occurred and what other species may have been involved. It is a handsome plant with broad, greenish-grey foliage and fairly large flowers which smell of bitter almonds. Margery Fish at East Lambrook Manor was another enthusiast and popularizer of Galanthus nivalis and its varieties in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
40|$|To {{develop a}} methyl bromide (MB) {{alternative}} control treatment based on vacuum, hermetic storage, or CO 2 enriched controlled atmosphere against the large <b>narcissus</b> <b>fly</b> (Merodon eques) investigations {{were carried out}} by Rindner et al. (2003). The large <b>narcissus</b> <b>fly</b> Merodon eques is a quarantine insect species that attacks narcissus bulbs as well as bulbs of other geophytes. Fumigation with methyl bromide (MB) is the only gaseous rapid treatment available for handling infested bulbs. However, the most recent international resolution under terms of the Montreal Protocol, ending the use and production of methyl bromide {{as well as the}} phytotoxic effects of MB required further studies to find alternative fumigation methods. According to Rindner et al., (2003) LT 99 values for Merodon eques maggot infested bulbs at 50 mm Hg absolute pressure, at hermetic conditions (for the bio-generation of modified atmospheres) and at 90 % CO 2 were 24, 34, and 24 h, respectively. Respiration of the bulbs, under hermetic conditions, depleted the O 2 concentration to 0. 1 % and increased the CO 2 to 21 % within 24 h at 30 ºC. The bio-generation of modified atmospheres under hermetic conditions did not adversely affect the germination levels of the bulbs. Based on these findings, Finkelman et al, (2002), reported on results of three semi-commercial experiment...|$|E
