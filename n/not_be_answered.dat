25|$|Alongside populism, Herzen is also {{remembered for}} his {{rejection}} of corrupt government of any political persuasion {{and for his}} support for individual rights. A Hegelian in his youth, this translated into no specific theory or single doctrine dominating his thought. Herzen came to believe the complex questions of society could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> and that Russians must live for the moment and not a cause, essentially life is an end in itself. Herzen found greater understanding by not committing himself to an extreme but rather lived impartially enabling him to equally criticise competing ideologies. Herzen believed that grand doctrines ultimately result in enslavement, sacrifice and tyranny.|$|E
2500|$|Kindred ‘s plot is non linear; rather, {{it begins}} {{in the middle of}} its end and {{contains}} several flashbacks that connect events in the present and past. In an interview, Butler acknowledged that she split the ending into a [...] "Prologue" [...] and an [...] "Epilogue" [...] so as to [...] "involve the reader and make him or her ask a lot of questions" [...] that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> {{until the end of the}} story. Missy Dehn Kubitschek sees this framing of Dana’s adventures as Butler’s way to highlight the significance of slavery to what Americans consider their contemporary identity. Because [...] "Prologue" [...] occurs before Dana travels in time and [...] "Epilogue" [...] concludes with a message on the necessity to confront the past, we experience the story as Dana’s understanding of what we have yet to understand ourselves, while the [...] "Epilogue" [...] speaks about the importance of this understanding. Roslyn Nicole Smith proposes that Butler’s framing of the story places Dana literally and figuratively in media res so as to take her out of that in media res; that is, to indicate Dana’s movement from [...] "a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences" [...] to [...] "a historically integrated identity" [...] who has knowledge of and a connection to her history.|$|E

2500|$|Following the September 11 attacks, Canadian forces {{joined with}} {{multinational}} forces that invaded Afghanistan to pursue al-Qaeda forces. President George W. Bush had also commended how Canada {{responded to the}} crisis. Among them included Operation Yellow Ribbon and the memorial service on Parliament Hill three days after 9/11. In January 2002, Chrétien together with the Defence Minister Art Eggleton were accused of misleading Parliament. When asked in Question Period if Canadian troops had handed over captured Taliban and al-Qaeda members in Afghanistan to the American forces amid concerns about the treatment of POWs at Guantanamo Bay, Chrétien stated this was only a [...] "hypothetical question" [...] that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> as the Canadians had taken no POWs. Critics of the government such as Joe Clark then pointed {{out that in the}} previous week, the Globe & Mail had run on its front page a photo of Canadian soldiers turning over POWs to American troops. Eggleton maintained that he {{and the rest of the}} Cabinet been kept unaware that the Canadian Forces were taking POWs in Afghanistan and turning them to the Americans, claiming that he had only learned of the policy of handing over POWs several days after the photo had appeared in the Globe. When pressed by opposition critics about his apparent ignorance of what was Canada's policy on turning over POWs captured in Afghanistan, Eggleton then claimed that he had not only forgotten that he had been briefed by senior bureaucrats that Canadian forces were to hand over POWs to the Americans, but that he had also forgotten to inform the Cabinet. When pressed by the opposition critics to fire Eggleton under the grounds that the Minister of Defence was either lying to Parliament or, if his story was true, that someone so forgetful should not be directing the Defence Department in the midst of a war, Chrétien informed the House of Commons that: [...] "Myself, cabinet and the Liberal Party have confidence in the abilities and dedication of the Minister of National Defence", and that Eggleton would stay on.|$|E
