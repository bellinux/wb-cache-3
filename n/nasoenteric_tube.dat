40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{enteral feeding}} through a nasoenteric feeding tube {{is often used}} in {{patients}} with severe acute pancreatitis to prevent gut-derived infections, but evidence to support this strategy is limited. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing early <b>nasoenteric</b> <b>tube</b> feeding with an oral diet at 72 hours after presentation to the emergency department in patients with acute pancreatitis. METHODS: We enrolled patients with acute pancreatitis who were {{at high risk for}} complications on the basis of an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 8 or higher (on a scale of 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating more severe disease), an Imrie or modified Glasgow score of 3 or higher (on a scale of 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease), or a serum C-reactive protein level of more than 150 mg per liter. Patients were randomly assigned to <b>nasoenteric</b> <b>tube</b> feeding within 24 hours after randomization (early group) or to an oral diet initiated 72 hours after presentation (on-demand group), with tube feeding provided if the oral diet was not tolerated. The primary end point was a composite of major infection (infected pancreatic necrosis, bacteremia, or pneumonia) or death during 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were enrolled at 19 Dutch hospitals. The primary end point occurred in 30 of 101 patients (30 %) in the early group and in 28 of 104 (27 %) in the on-demand group (risk ratio, 1. 07; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 79 to 1. 44; P= 0. 76). There {{were no significant differences between}} the early group and the on-demand group in the rate of major infection (25 % and 26 %, respectively; P= 0. 87) or death (11 % and 7 %, respectively; P= 0. 33). In the on-demand group, 72 patients (69 %) tolerated an oral diet and did not require tube feeding.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The enteral {{route is}} the {{preferred}} method of nutrition support in patients with functional gas-trointestinal tracts. Many techniques for obtaining en-teral access are available, and the decision regarding which one to use depends on several issues, including anticipated duration of support, aspiration risk, and local expertise. Using laparotomy, laparoscopy, fluoroscopy, or endoscopy, tubes can be placed into the stomach, the duodenum, and the jejunum. Nasogastric and <b>nasoenteric</b> <b>tubes</b> are useful for short-term supplementation; how-ever, patients needing support for more than 6 weeks may be better served with a more permanent tube. In this review, specific methods for obtaining enteral access are discussed along with their advantages and disadvan-tages...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Self-poisoning is not {{frequent}} during pregnancy. We {{present a}} successful {{treatment of a}} woman 20 weeks pregnant with twins with self-inflicted poisoning by a caustic substance. Case outline. A 34 -year-old pregnant woman was admitted to our institution after self-inflicted poisoning with concentrated acetic acid. Initial clinical evaluation showed severe diffuse erythema of the mouth and oropharynx, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy in the 20 th week of gestation confirmed on abdominal ultrasound. An indirect laryngoscopic examination revealed severe generalized hyperemia of the laryngeal mucosa with corrosive changes in the pharyngeal mucosa, especially of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Due to pain, urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy could not be performed, {{and because of the}} patient’s refusal a feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy could not be created. The patient was given “all-in-one” total parenteral nutrition in addition to other supportive therapy. Gradual introduction of enteral nutrition via a <b>nasoenteric</b> <b>tube</b> placed in the second month of hospitalization failed due to severe vomiting. After almost three months of total parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition was nevertheless introduced; we then started with oral fluids, increasing gradually to a regular diet, and needed almost half a month to reach the adequate nutritional goal.

40|$|Introduction Acute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is {{an inflammatory}} disease with no specific treatment. Mitochondrial injury followed by ATP depletion in both acinar and ductal cells is a recently discovered early event in its pathogenesis. Importantly, preclinical {{research has shown}} that intracellular ATP delivery restores the physiological function of the cells and protects from cell injury, suggesting that restoration of energy levels in the pancreas is therapeutically beneficial. Despite several high quality experimental observations in this area, no randomised trials have been conducted to date to address the requirements for energy intake in the early phase of AP. Methods/design This is a randomised controlled two-arm double-blind multicentre trial. Patients with AP will be randomly assigned to groups A (30 kcal/kg/day energy administration starting within 24 [*]hours of hospital admission) or B (low energy administration during the first 72 [*]hours of hospital admission). Energy will be delivered by <b>nasoenteric</b> <b>tube</b> feeding with additional intravenous glucose supplementation or total parenteral nutrition if necessary. A combination of multiorgan failure for more than 48 [*]hours and mortality is defined as the primary endpoint, whereas several secondary endpoints such as length of hospitalisation or pain will be determined to elucidate more detailed differences between the groups. The general feasibility, safety and quality checks required for high quality evidence will be adhered to. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the relevant organisation, the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Hungarian Medical Research Council (55961 - 2 / 2016 /EKU). This study will provide evidence as to whether early high energy nutritional support is beneficial in the clinical management of AP. The results of this trial will be published in an open access way and disseminated among medical doctors...|$|E

CONCLUSÃO: Os pacientes com CCeP apresentam redução das medidas de AB e ABm no decorrer da RT, principalmente se apresentarem redução da capacidade funcional, tiverem irradiação para os campos da boca e orofaringe e fizerem uso de SNE...|$|E
40|$|Introdução e Objetivos: A intubação orotraqueal (IOT) é utilizada no centro de tratamento intensivo (CTI) em pacientes graves que precisam de auxílio para manter a respiração. Quando prolongada é considerada um dos principais fatores de risco para disfagia orofaríngea (DOF). Nestes casos, o controle neurológico central e nervos periféricos estão intactos, mas as estruturas anatômicas responsáveis pela deglutição podem sofrer prejuízos. O tratamento para a DOF visa proteger as vias aéreas e garantir a nutrição. A terapia de reabilitação da deglutição, através de técnicas e exercícios orofaciais e vocais, parece ser benéfica em pacientes disfágicos. Sendo assim, essa pesquisa apresentou como objetivo avaliar a eficácia da fonoterapia em pacientes com DOF, pós-intubados e sem comorbidades neurológicas. Metodologia: Foram avaliados 240 pacientes, dos quais 40 (16, 6 %) apresentaram DOF. De acordo com os critérios de inclusão e exclusão, trinta e dois pacientes foram incluídos no estudo realizado de setembro de 2010 a dezembro 2012 no CTI de um {{hospital}} universitário. Os pacientes foram randomizados em dois grupos: tratamento fonoaudiológico e controle, sendo que o primeiro (53 %) recebeu orientações, técnicas terapêuticas, manobras de proteção de via aérea e de limpeza glótica, exercícios oromiofuncionais e vocais e introdução de dieta; o acompanhamento ocorreu durante 10 dias. Os dados da anamnese foram coletados do prontuário e o local de atendimento de todos os sujeitos foi à beira do leito. Os desfechos primários do estudo foram o tempo de permanência com sonda nasoentereral (SNE) e os níveis da escala FOIS. Resultados e Discussão: O grupo tratado permaneceu por menos tempo com SNE (mediana de 3 dias) em comparação ao grupo controle (mediana de 10 dias) (p< 0, 001). No grupo controle houve o dobro de sujeitos com a SNE por ainda apresentarem DOF ao final do tempo de acompanhamento fonoaudiológico. O grupo tratado apresentou evolução significativa nos níveis da escala FOIS (entre 4 e 7) em relação ao controle (p= 0, 005). O grupo tratado apresentou evolução favorável nos níveis de gravidade pelo protocolo PARD (DOF moderada passou para leve). A consistência alimentar líquida (água) foi a que os pacientes mais apresentaram sinais clínicos de DOF. As doenças respiratórias foram as mais frequentes em ambos os grupos. Conclusões: Os achados desse estudo demonstram que o tratamento fonoaudiológico favorece a progressão mais rápida de alimentação por SNE para via oral em pacientes pós-intubados. Isto sugere que a Fonoaudiologia, na área de DOF, tem um papel importante dentro do plano de tratamento destes indivíduos, hipótese que deve ser confirmada por estudos adicionais. Introduction: In {{intensive care}} units (ICU), orotracheal intubation (OTI) {{is used in}} severe patients who need assistance to maintain breathing. When OTI is prolonged, it {{is considered one of}} the main risk factors for oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD). In these cases, the central neurological control and peripheral nerves are intact, but the anatomical structures responsible for swallowing may suffer damages. Treatment of OPD aims to protect the airways and nutrition of individuals. Swallowing rehabilitation therapy, by means of orofacial and vocal techniques and exercises, seems to be beneficial to dysphagic patients. Thus, this research presented as objective to evaluate the efficacy of the speech therapy in patients with OPD, post-intubated and without neurological comorbidities. Material and Methods: The recruitment period of the study was from September 2010 to December 2012 in the ICU of a university hospital. Two hundred and forty patients were assessed, of whom 40 presented OPD (16. 6 %). According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, thirty-two patients were included in the study. Patients were randomized in two groups: speech treatment and control, and the first (53 %) received daily, for a maximum period of 10 days, assessment, guidance, therapeutic techniques, airway protection and glottal cleaning maneuvers, oromiofunctional and vocal exercises, as well as introduction of diet. Anamnesis data were collected from the patient’s medical records, and all individuals were seen on the hospital bedside. Primary study outcomes were length of stay with <b>nasoenteric</b> <b>tube</b> (NET) and levels on the FOIS scale. Results and Discussion: When compared to the control group (median of 10 days), NET permanence was shorter in the treated group (median of 3 days) (p< 0. 001). The control group there was twice the number of individuals with NET because they still presented OPD at the end of the speech therapy follow up. The treated group showed a significant evolution in levels on the FOIS scale (between 4 and 7) when compared to the control group (p= 0. 005). The treated group presented a favorable evolution in severity levels by the PARD (from moderate to mild OPD). Patients showed most clinical signs of OPD with liquid-consistency (water). Respiratory disorders were the most frequent in both groups. During treatment, in some cases it was not possible to complete the length of intervention. In the GT, interruption happened in 2 cases (11. 8 %) due to death, in 3 cases, (17. 6 %) due to reintubation, in one patient (5. 9 %) due to clinical worsening and in one patient (5. 9 %) due to withdrawal from treatment. In the GC, 4 (26. 7 %) patients were re-intubated. All these patients remained in the study for an intention-to-treat analysis (ITT). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that speech therapy favors a faster progression from NET feeding to oral feeding in post-intubated patients. His suggests that Speech Therapy in OPD area, has an important role in the treatment plan of these individuals, this hypothesis should be confirmed by additional studies...|$|E
