5|$|Following {{the launch}} of the French , the world's first ironclad warship, the Austrian Navy began a major ironclad {{construction}} program under the direction of Archduke Ferdinand Max, the Marinekommandant (naval commander) and brother of Kaiser Franz Josef I, the emperor of Austria. In 1861, the first two ships, the , were laid down and three more were ordered. These ships were designed by the Director of Naval Construction Josef von Romako; he based the design for the three <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> on the Drache class, but enlarged it and incorporated more powerful engines. The <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> also carried more guns.|$|E
5|$|After four Bremen roundtrips for United States Lines, Princess Matoika had sailed {{her last}} voyage under that name.

5|$|In August 2005 the Australian Government passed {{approval}} for the acquisition of two Canberra-class landing helicopter dock ships; these will displace over 20,000 tonnes, can carry over 1,000 troops, and will potentially be able to operate fixed wing aircraft. The project is expected to cost between A$1.5 and A$2billion, and be completed by around 2014. The <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> will be named Canberra and Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects on}} the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only {{confirming}} the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would continue to seek reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating {{on the construction of}} several <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action {{of the year in the}} Adriatic.|$|E

5|$|In February 2006 Band {{took over}} the {{positions}} of First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff from Admiral Sir Alan West and in a press statement set out the Navy's priorities in the 21st century. Upon taking up the post of First Sea Lord he became the professional head of the Royal Navy. Band is a proponent for the Sustained surface combatant capability {{and the creation of}} <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> to maintain the Royal Navy as one of the world's leading navies. These include the new Type 45 destroyer and the Royal Navy CVF programme, designed to replace the UK's current aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{the onset of the}} first World War, four <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> were purchased: Bermagui, Bonandera, Bodalla and Bergalia. Bodalla was requisitioned for the war effort and {{repurposed}} as a minesweeper, and she was lost in 1924. After the war the company purchased another three vessels: Nergalia, Cobargo and Kianga. Two of these three boats, Nergalia and Kianga, were requisitioned during World War II, but while both survived the hostilities, Kianga was not returned to the company after being decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the <b>new</b> <b>ships.</b> They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, {{during the}} same year that the Stockholm was delivered, SAL had already begun market {{research}} {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, with the prospect of building a <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> in mind. Based on the results of the research, the company decided to order a 20,000 gross register ton combined ocean liner / cruise ship that could accommodate 802 passengers. After contacting 50 shipyards around the world about the prospects of buildings their <b>new</b> <b>ship,</b> SAL placed an order for their <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> with the De Schelde shipyard in The Netherlands on 1 April 1950.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of new D-class cruisers were canceled {{to make way for}} Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The provisional names of the planned D-class cruisers, Ersatz Elsass and Ersatz Hessen, were reallocated to the <b>new</b> <b>ships,</b> the contracts for which were awarded to the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. Construction was held up by 14months, partly because Hitler wanted to secure the treaty with Britain before work began, and partly due to numerous design changes after the ships had been ordered.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912. Consideration was given to {{equipping}} the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> with triple turrets mounting the 30.5cm (12in) guns of the preceding s, but after examining the gun turrets of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the , {{it was determined that}} the triple gun turrets still had too many problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the turrets was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E
5|$|The pre-dreadnought age saw the {{beginning}} of the end of the 19th century naval balance of power in which France and Russia vied for competition against the massive British Royal Navy, and saw the start of the rise of the 'new naval powers' of Germany, Japan and the USA. The <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy and to a lesser extent the U.S. Navy supported those powers' colonial expansion.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of whether the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> should be powered entirely by oil-fired boilers was less controversial. The design staff was generally in agreement with the standard practice of using coal-fired boilers for two-thirds of the power plant, with the remainder being oil-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers were preferred because the coal, stored in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts. The finalized design was approved on 23 May 1914.|$|E
5|$|The quick pace {{of change}} meant that many ships were {{obsolete}} {{as soon as they}} were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use. <b>New</b> <b>ships</b> were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} based on the {{incomplete}} hull of the Italian passenger ship Ausonia, which was being built in Hamburg. The conversion was proposed by the Air Department of the Reichs Navy Office, but it was abandoned after negotiations within the German Navy over a proposed moratorium on <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> {{at the end of the}} war. After World War I ended, high inflation in Germany added to the cost of the ship, and as a result, the Italian shipping company for whom the ship was originally built, declined to purchase her. The vessel was therefore sold to shipbreakers and dismantled in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Venizelos and the King {{were united}} in their belief that the nation {{required}} a strong army {{to repair the damage}} of the humiliating defeat of 1897. Crown Prince Constantine was reinstated as Inspector-General of the Army, and later Commander-in-Chief. Under his and Venizelos's close supervision the military was retrained and equipped with French and British help, and <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> were ordered for the Hellenic Navy. Meanwhile, through diplomatic means, Venizelos had united the Christian countries of the Balkans in opposition to the ailing Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|While the {{merchant}} marine was technologically outdated, and slower {{than that of}} the First World, it still attracted a consistent volume of cargo. The reason for the technological backwardness of {{the merchant}} marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping. This led the Soviet Union to become isolated from the international shipping industry, and skip over such important innovations as shipping containers. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> in the world. Because of the size of its navy, the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why <b>new</b> <b>ships,</b> reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
