40|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>multinomial</b> <b>distributions</b> can be considered: the {{singular}} [...] for modeling univariate categorical data [...] and the non-singular [...] for modeling multivariate count data.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to probability theory based on quantum mechanical and Lie algebraic ideas is proposed and developed. The underlying fact is the observation that the coherent states of the Heisenberg-Weyl, $su(2) $, $su(r+ 1) $, $su(1, 1) $ and $su(r, 1) $ algebras in certain symmetric (bosonic) representations give the ``probability amplitudes'' (or the ``square roots'') of the well-known Poisson, binomial, <b>multinomial,</b> <b>negative</b> binomial and <b>negative</b> <b>multinomial</b> <b>distributions</b> in probability theory. New probability distributions are derived based on coherent states of the classical algebras $B_r$, $C_r$ and $D_r$ in symmetric representations. These new probability distributions are simple generalisation of the <b>multinomial</b> <b>distributions</b> with some added new features reflecting the quantum and Lie algebraic construction. As byproducts, simple proofs and interpretation of addition theorems of Hermite polynomials are obtained from the `coordinate' representation of the (<b>negative)</b> <b>multinomial</b> states. In other words, these addition theorems are higher rank counterparts of the well-known generating function of Hermite polynomials, which is essentially the `coordinate' representation of the ordinary (Heisenberg-Weyl) coherent state.

It is explained how these results generalize directly to $d$ variables. Comment: 22 page...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 In many {{statistical}} applications {{an interval}} is needed that will contain {{the values of}} all J future observations with some preassigned probability. For example, suppose twenty rockets have been fired in a test program and three have failed. If two more test programs are to be conducted, an interval that will, with probability 1 -α, contain {{the maximum number of}} failures in either of the two programs is called an a confidence level prediction interval. In this thesis a general procedure is given for predicting future observations when there is one unknown parameter and other conditions are satisfied. The normal and the gamma distributions are used as examples to illustrate the procedure in the continuous case. It is shown that Poisson random variables can be predicted using the <b>negative</b> <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution.</b> Tables of negative multinomial probabilities are provided and approximation procedures are suggested. It is also shown that negative binomial random variables can be predicted using the multivariate beta negative binomial and binomial random variables can be predicted using the multivariate negative hypergeometric distribution. The prediction intervals given in this thesis can also be used for simultaneous hypothesis testing for the Poisson, negative binomial and binomial distributions...|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of traffic safety, {{expected}} crash frequencies across sites are generally estimated via the negative binomial model, assuming time invariant safety. Since the time invariant safety assumption may be invalid, Hauer (1997) proposed a modified empirical Bayes (EB) method. Despite the modification, no {{attempts have been made}} to examine the generalisable form of the marginal distribution resulting from the modified EB framework. Because the hyper-parameters needed to apply the modified EB method are not readily available, an assessment is lacking on how accurately the modified EB method estimates safety in the presence of the time variant safety and regression-to-the-mean (RTM) effects. This study derives the closed form marginal distribution, and reveals that the marginal distribution in the modified EB method is equivalent to the <b>negative</b> <b>multinomial</b> (NM) <b>distribution,</b> which is essentially the same as the likelihood function used in the random effects Poisson model. As a result, this study shows that the gamma posterior distribution from the multivariate Poisson-gamma mixture can be estimated using the NM model or the random effects Poisson model. This study also shows that the estimation errors from the modified EB method are systematically smaller than those from the comparison group method by simultaneously accounting for the RTM and time variant safety effects. Hence, the modified EB method via the NM model is a generalisable method for estimating safety in the presence of the time variant safety and the RTM effects...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{relationship}} between probability distribution and coherent states, for example the well known Poisson distribution and the ordinary coherent states and relatively less known one of the binomial distribution and the $su(2) $ coherent states, we propose ``interpretation'' of $su(1, 1) $ and $su(r, 1) $ coherent states ``in terms of probability theory''. They will be called the ``negative binomial'' (``multinomial'') ``states'' which correspond to the ``negative'' binomial (<b>multinomial)</b> <b>distribution,</b> the non-compact counterpart of the well known binomial (<b>multinomial)</b> <b>distribution.</b> Explicit forms of the <b>negative</b> binomial (<b>multinomial)</b> states are given in terms of various boson representations which are naturally related to the probability theory interpretation.

40|$|In this paper, outage {{performance}} of hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) is analyzed. Unlike prior analyses, time-correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channel is considered. The outage analysis thus involves the probability distribution {{analysis of a}} product of multiple correlated shifted Gamma random variables and is more challenging than prior analyses. Based on the finding of the conditional independence of the received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the outage probability is exactly derived by using conditional Mellin transform. Specifically, the outage probability of HARQ-IR under time-correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channels can be written as a weighted sum of outage probabilities of HARQ-IR over independent Nakagami fading channels, where the weightings are determined by a <b>negative</b> <b>multinomial</b> <b>distribution.</b> This result enables not only an efficient truncation approximation of the outage probability with uniform convergence but also asymptotic outage analysis to further extract clear insights which have never been discovered for HARQ-IR even under fast fading channels. The asymptotic outage probability is then derived in a simple form which clearly quantifies the impacts of transmit powers, channel time correlation and information transmission rate. It is proved that the asymptotic outage probability is an inverse power function of the product of transmission powers in all HARQ rounds, an increasing function of the channel time correlation coefficients, and a monotonically increasing and convex function of information transmission rate. The simple expression of the asymptotic result enables optimal power allocation and optimal rate selection of HARQ-IR with low complexity. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify our analytical results and justify {{the application of the}} asymptotic result for optimal system design...|$|E
