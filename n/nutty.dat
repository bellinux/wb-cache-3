60|$|The {{exercise}} {{did not act}} as a restorative. The blow {{had been}} too sudden, too overwhelming. <b>Nutty's</b> reason--such as it was--tottered on its throne. Who was Lord Dawlish? What had he done to ingratiate himself with Uncle Ira? By what insidious means, with what devilish cunning, had he wormed {{his way into the}} old man's favour? These were the questions that vexed <b>Nutty's</b> mind when he was able to think at all coherently.|$|R
5|$|First Contact {{earned an}} Academy Award-nomination for Best Makeup, losing to The <b>Nutty</b> Professor.

5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the <b>nutty,</b> malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was {{the hub of the}} temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|E

5|$|Madness {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios. The studio is still located on Caledonian Road in North London, in {{what was once the}} premises of their fan club office. They built a 24-track professional studio in the cellar. The ground floor has always been an office and chill out area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as The Madness album in 1988. Other acts to use the studio include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The <b>Nutty</b> Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8. The studio is still regularly used by musicians, including members of Madness themselves.|$|E
5|$|The flavour {{has been}} {{described}} as <b>nutty</b> and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several {{studies have shown that the}} fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The <b>Nutty</b> Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of fun}} during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company {{that had been in}} existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The <b>Nutty</b> Professor. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E

60|$|The doubts {{which she}} was trying to crush {{increased}} the violence of their attack. It was not that she respected <b>Nutty's</b> judgement in itself. It was that his view of what she had done chimed in so neatly with her own. She longed for someone to tell her that she had done right: someone who would bring back that feeling of certainty which she had had during her talk with Bill. And in these circumstances <b>Nutty's</b> attitude had more weight than on its merits it deserved. She wished she could cry. She had a feeling that if she once did that the right outlook would come back to her.|$|R
50|$|Raw acorn noodles are {{slightly}} coarser in cut and texture and more brittle than standard buckwheat soba noodles. Cooked acorn soba noodles are <b>nuttier</b> in flavor, healthier, and slightly saltier than buckwheat noodles.
