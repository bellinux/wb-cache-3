40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} protein (Rb) plays {{a critical role}} in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. To decipher the mechanism of Rb function at the molecular level, we have systematically characterized a number of Rb-interacting proteins, among which is the clone C 5 described here, which encodes a protein of 1, 978 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 230 kDa. The corresponding gene was assigned to chromosome 14 q 31, the same region where genetic alterations have been associated with several abnormalities of thyroid hormone response. The protein uses two distinct regions to bind Rb and thyroid hormone receptor (TR), respectively, and thus was named Trip 230. Trip 230 binds to Rb independently of thyroid hormone while it forms a complex with TR in a thyroid hormone-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of the protein Trip 230 in cells, but not a mutant form that does <b>not</b> bind <b>to</b> <b>TR,</b> enhances specifically TR-dependent transcriptional activity. Coexpression of wild-type Rb, but not mutant Rb that fails to bind to Trip 230, inhibits such activity. These results not only identify a coactivator molecule that modulates TR activity, but also uncover a role for Rb in a pathway that responds to thyroid hormone...|$|R
40|$|As {{a measure}} of local repolarization time (T(R)), the instant of maximum slope (T(up)) of the T wave in the local {{unipolar}} electrogram is commonly used. Measurement of T(up) can be difficult, especially in positive T waves. These difficulties have led some researchers to propose the instant of maximum downslope (T(down)) as a marker of T(R) when the T wave is positive. To improve understanding of T-wave parameters, we simulated electrograms with a bidomain model of the human heart. To test T-wave parameters, we compared them <b>to</b> <b>T(R)</b> determined from the local membrane potential. We propose a simple model of the electrogram, which we validated by comparison to the bidomain model. With the simple model, it is straightforward {{to show that the}} sign of the T wave is almost uniquely determined by T(R). We then used the bidomain model to simulate the effects of a variety of pathologies and technical difficulties, which the simple model could not account for. Generally, T(up) was a much better estimate for T(R) than T(down). Regional fibrosis could attenuate local electrogram components and reduce accuracy of T(up) as a marker for T(R). In fibrotic tissue, T(down) was <b>not</b> related <b>to</b> <b>T(R)</b> at all. This investigation of electrogram slopes required the simulation of extracellular potentials with about 100 times more precision than needed for simulation of visually acceptable waveforms alone. This requirement is more difficult to meet in larger models, but it was actually possible for a human-heart model with 60 million nodes. By sacrificing some spatial resolutions, we kept the computational requirements within acceptable limits for multiple simulation...|$|R
30|$|Areas {{of greater}} terrain {{roughness}} were prone to increased manual mapping error {{on the side}} of commission. There are at least two explanations for this. First, much of the area falsely classified as burned consists of small island polygons. As described in the introduction, unburned islands within a burned area are almost always included in manually mapped fire perimeters, since it is unsafe to map these locations during or even immediately following a fire, and more efficient to simply include them in the burned area. This is visually consistent with the imagery and the published fire perimeters for this study; there are several cases where a published perimeter skirts the base of a slope or canyon instead of following the fingers of burned area that lay on ridges or in canyons. Since errors of omission were <b>not</b> significantly correlated <b>to</b> <b>TR,</b> the weaker significant correlation between TR and overall mapping agreement can be attributed primarily to over-mapping in the areas of higher TR.|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Many {{euryhaline}} teleost fish, {{including the}} Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, are native to waters in which salinity varies tidally between that of freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW). Acclimation {{to changes in}} environmental salinity is regulated largely by the neuroendocrine system, which directs ion extrusion or ion uptake response via the gill and other osmoregulatory tissues. In teleosts, prolactin (PRL) is critical to FW acclimation, stimulating ion uptake mechanisms. Osmoregulation in euryhaline teleosts has been studied extensively in steady state FW and SW, and after one-way transfers between FW and SW. It is unclear, however, how euryhaline fish respond to cyclical salinity changes. Mozambique tilapia were reared in FW, SW, and under a tidal regimen (TR), characterized by salinity changes between FW (TF) and SW (TS) every 6 hours (h), and transferred from FW or SW <b>to</b> <b>TR</b> <b>to</b> investigate adaptive ability <b>to</b> <b>TR.</b> TR fish were also sampled every 3 h in a 24 -hour period to observe osmoregulatory parameters throughout the TR cycle. Regardless of the rearing regimen, plasma osmolality changed in direct relation to salinity, rising in SW and falling in FW, while plasma PRL was inversely related to salinity. In fish reared in TR, branchial gene expression of effectors of ion transport and PRL receptors was more {{similar to those of}} fish reared in SW than to those in FW. When fish were transferred from either FW or SW <b>to</b> <b>TR,</b> all measured osmoregulatory parameters were identical to those of fish reared in TR by 7 days. In TR fish sampled multiple times over a 24 -hour period the greater resolution in sampling revealed several nuances within the overall patterns of salinity and regimen-dependent changes in osmoregulatory parameters. These findings indicate that life-long acclimation to SW and FW does <b>not</b> preclude adaptation <b>to</b> <b>TR</b> at the adult stage. The results also show that throughout a 24 -hour period, TR fish are able to compensate for broad and frequent changes in external salinity while maintaining osmoregulatory parameters within a narrow range. These are the first known studies to investigate environmental adaptation of adult Mozambique tilapia <b>to</b> <b>TR,</b> and <b>to</b> characterize osmoregulatory parameters in TR fish over multiple iterations of TF & TS during a full diurnal cycle. As such, these studies have further characterized the effects of TR-acclimation at a more advanced life stage than addressed by previous reports, and have yielded greater insights to rearing in an environment that approximates the native habitat of the Mozambique tilapia...|$|R

40|$|Transcription of the [lambda] genome, {{initiating}} at {{the early}} rightward promoter (PR), traverses the cII-O-P operon and extends through the Q gene. In {{the absence of the}} [lambda] N function, this transcription is prematurely terminated at either of two termination sites, tR 1 and tR 2. The cII-O-P operon lies distal <b>to</b> <b>tR</b> 1, but proximal <b>to</b> <b>tR</b> 2. A number of mutations resulting in new promoter activities (e. g., c 17 and ric 5 b) mapping distal <b>to</b> <b>tR</b> 1, but proximal <b>to</b> <b>tR</b> 2, have been isolated. Although phages carrying the c 17 mutation grow in a normal Escherichia coli host, we find that [lambda] derivatives carrying this mutation will not grow in mutant E. coli K 12 hosts, Nus-, which limit [lambda] growth by inhibiting the expression of N function. However, under the same conditions, a [lambda] phage containing only the normal [lambda] promoters grows significantly better in the Nus- hosts. Our studies demonstrate that under conditions of limited N expression, phage carrying the c 17 mutation can express functions coded for by genes in the cII-O-P operon, but not endolysin, a function coded for by a gene distal <b>to</b> <b>tR</b> 2. Thus, under conditions of low N activity, functions whose genes lie downstream from the c 17 promoter without any intervening termination signals are expressed. On the other hand, functions whose genes lie downstream from this promoter with an intervening termination signal are not expressed. These results are consistent with a model of N action, which has N acting only with transcription initiating at a specific class of promoters (e. g., PR), c 17 not being a member of this class. Although previous studies (Friedman and Ponce-Campos, 1975) have shown that the ric 5 b promoter is also {{not a member of the}} N-utilizing class of promoters, we find that [lambda]ric 5 b grows on Nus- hosts. This suggests that whereas c 17 interferes with transcription from PR, ric 5 b does not show such an interference. We also find that [lambda] variants carrying two mutations v 3 and vs 326, which map in the OR - PR region, exhibit the same growth characteristics in Nus- hosts as phages carrying the c 17 mutation. These observations imply that the combination of v 3 and vs 326 interfere with N-modification of transcription initiating at PR, and lead us to conclude that one site for N recognition is located within the PR promoter...|$|R
