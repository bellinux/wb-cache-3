5|$|Busch did <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> in Frankfurt. Towards {{the end of}} the 1860s he alternated between Wiedensahl and Lüthorst, and Wolfenbüttel {{where his}} brother Gustav lived. The {{association}} with Johanna Kessler lasted five years, and after his return to Wiedensahl in 1872 they communicated by letter. This contact was interrupted between 1877 and 1891, after which it was revived with the help of Kessler's daughters.|$|E
5|$|The French troops, {{commanded}} by General Charles Louis Joseph Olivier Guéhéneuc, did <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> idle during these nearly five years. Fortifications were raised, like those at Navarino. Bridges were constructed, {{such as those}} over the Pamissos River between Kalamata and Methoni. The Methoni–Navarino road was built, and improvements were made to Peloponnesian towns (barracks, bridges, gardens, etc.).|$|E

5|$|An {{alliance}} between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious {{in a very}} uncomfortable situation, because he {{being a member of}} Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> indifferent to this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other Silesian princes also belonged).|$|E
5|$|As a {{minister}} of finance, Banza directed {{much of his}} energy and time into lifting the country out of bankruptcy. Banza was also successful {{in his efforts to}} build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> as Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer. After Banza was promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel in 1965, Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> in one post for too long, and he wished {{to be free to}} accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of the}} 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|The coup {{de grace}} for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty {{occurred}} in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful Hittite Empire, thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia. However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did <b>not</b> <b>remain,</b> turning over Babylon to their Kassite allies, a people speaking a language isolate, from the Zagros mountains region. This Kassite Dynasty was to rule Babylon for over 400 years, adopting parts of the Babylonian culture, including Hammurabi's code of laws.|$|E

5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> on good terms afterwards.|$|E

When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could <b>not</b> <b>remain</b> in all of the places they had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.|$|E
