Your calculations can stop here. A <b>normal</b> anion <b>gap</b> acidosis (NAGMA) {{has more to do with}} a change in Cl¯) or HCO3¯ concentrations. So the AG doesn’t change; but to maintain electrical equilibrium, if Cl¯ goes up, HCO3¯ must come down. Hence, hyperchloremia always causes a metabolic acidosis as HCO3¯ must fall; alternatively, if the HCO3¯ rises, the Cl¯ must fall. For a list of the common causes of this change in bicarbonate or chloride, see <b>normal</b> anion <b>gap</b> acidosis.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of January 23, 1996, Sherry Sherret found her four-month-old son Joshua lying in his bed not breathing. He {{was rushed to the}} {{hospital}} where he was pronounced dead. Three and a half years later she was given the option to accept a plea of infanticide. She was convicted of infanticide without offering a defence (but offering no admission of guilt) in a plea (the delay was primarily attributable to Smith's unavailability to testify). Sherret was jailed on the basis of Smith's opinion that her four-month-old son Joshua had a skull fracture, and that he had been smothered. She was released on bail in 1996 and remained on bail until the conviction. Sherret's sentence was 1 year in jail and 2 years probation. Sherret served eight months in total, and was entered into the child abuse registry. Her older child was removed by Children's Aid, and in order to get him out of foster care, she agreed to give him up for adoption and have no physical contact with him until he was 18. Later exhumation of the child and examination of the skull have shown that there was no skull fracture. It is thought Dr. Smith confused the <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> between the baby's skull plates for an injury. [...] On Dec. 7, 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal exonerated Sherret, stating that it was [...] "profoundly regrettable that due to flaws in pathological evidence" [...] she was wrongfully convicted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Adopting {{the finite}} element {{software}} ANSYS, this paper calculates {{the temperature and}} stress fields of the combined piston under the conditions of cooling and no cooling. The analytical {{results show that the}} piston under no cooling condition has higher thermal load and integrative stress than the condition of cooling, because the piston head can’t get better cooling. Moreover, the high thermal load causes the piston head creating great deformation, which has exceeded the <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> between the piston and the liner, so the piston abrasion may worsen...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Four {{subjects}} {{all made}} {{large numbers of}} Express accades in the <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> task were instructed to make saccades in the direction opposite to the side where a visual stimulus appeared ("anti " task). Gap and overlap trials were used. Saccadic reaction time (SRT), velocity and amplitude of the corresponding eye move-ments were analysed and compared to those of saccades made in the normal task. The velocity of "anti saccades" {{was found to be}} slightly (up to 15 %) but significantly slower in two subjects. The distributions of SRTs in <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> tasks show a small group of anticipatory saccades (with SRT below 80 ms and slower velocities) followed by a group of saccades with fast reaction times between 80 ms and 120 ms (Express accades) followed by another large group ranging up to 180 ms (regular sacca-des). In the gap anti task there are anticipatory saccades and saccades with SRTs above 100 ms; Express saccades are missing. The distribution of SRTs obtained in the overlap anti task was unimodal with a mean value of 231 ms as compared to 216 ms in the normal task. The introduction of the gap therefore clearly decreases the reaction times of the anti saccades. Control experiments show that the delay of anti saccades is not due to an interhemispheric transfer time but must be attributed to the saccade generating system taking more time to pro-gram a saccade to a position where no visual stimulus appears. These data are discussed as providing further evidence for the existence of a reflex-like pathway connec-ting the retina to the oculomotor nuclei mediating the Express saccade. Key words: Anti saccades- Saccadic reaction time...|$|E

40|$|Conversation-analytic {{research}} {{has argued that}} the timing and construction of preferred responding actions (e. g., acceptances) differ from that of dispreferred responding actions (e. g., rejections), potentially enabling early response prediction by recipients. We examined 195 preferred and dispreferred responding actions in telephone corpora and found that the timing of the most frequent cases of each type did not differ systematically. Only for turn transitions of 700 ms or more was the proportion of dispreferred responding actions clearly greater than that of preferreds. In contrast, an analysis of the timing that included turn formats (i. e., those with or without qualification) revealed clearer differences. Small departures from a <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> duration decrease the likelihood of a preferred action in a preferred turn format (e. g., a simple “yes”). We propose that the timing of a response is best understood as a turn-constructional feature, the first virtual component of a preferred or dispreferred turn format...|$|E
40|$|A coupled {{cohesive}} zone model {{based on an}} analogy between fracture and contact mechanics is proposed to investigate debonding phenomena at imperfect interfaces due to thermomechanical loading and thermal fields in bodies with cohesive cracks. Traction-displacement and heat flux-temperature relations are theoretically derived and numerically implemented in the finite element method. In the proposed formulation, the interface conductivity {{is a function of}} the <b>normal</b> <b>gap,</b> generalizing the Kapitza constant resistance model to partial decohesion effects. The case of a centered interface in a bimaterial component subjected to thermal loads is used as a test problem. The analysis focuses on the time evolution of the displacement and temperature fields during the transient regime before debonding, an issue not yet investigated in the literature. The solution of the nonlinear numerical problem is gained via an implicit scheme both in space and in time. The proposed model is finally applied to a case study in photovoltaics where the evolution of the thermoelastic fields inside a defective solar cell is predicted.

40|$|Ichnoviruses {{belong to}} the virus family Polydnaviridae, whose members are obligately {{associated}} with certain endoparasitoid wasps. Expression of ichnovirus genes in parasitized lepidopteran hosts leads to immune suppression and is essential for successful parasitization. To date, the role of specific ichnovirus genes in alteration of host physiology has been unclear, and no cellular homologues have been described. Here, we describe the isolation of a gene family from two ichnoviruses that is homologous to the innexin gene family, which encodes gap junctions in invertebrates. Campoletis sonorensis ichnovirus (CsIV) innexins are expressed in multiple tissues in infected lepidopterans, including haemocytes, the primary immunocytes of the host. Two of the CsIV proteins have been expressed and shown to form functional gap junctions in Xenopus oocytes. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} study to describe gap junction genes in any virus. We hypothesize that the virus innexins disrupt cellular immunity in infected insects by altering <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> junctional intercellular communication. This would represent a novel mechanism of viral alteration of host physiology, and suggests that gap junctions {{play a crucial role in}} coordinating cellular immune responses...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for {{the numerical}} simulation of linear structural dynamics problems under unilateral elastic constraints, i. e., constraints with a linear force/displacement characteristic whenever active. The presented procedure relies on an event-driven {{strategy for the}} handling of the contact constraints, in combination with one-step schemes dedicated to the time integration of the second-order equations of motion. Efficiency of the procedure follows from the use of cubic Hermite interpolation to continuously extend the <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> functions that reflect the openings of the contact interfaces. Robustness follows from the proper handling of complex numerical situations, e. g., numerical grazing or discontinuity sticking, through appropriate algorithm structure and numerical implementation. And, integration stability is guaranteed by {{the very nature of the}} algorithm and that of the one-step integration scheme. Following a detailed coverage of the integration procedure and the countermeasures to the expected numerical difficulties, three application examples are treated for illustration purposes. A MATLAB implementation of the procedure is provided online; download and usage information are given in the Appendix. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This work investigates mortar-based {{frictionless}} {{contact in}} the context of NURBS discretizations that are subjected to local hierarchical refinement. The investigations emphasize three sets of choices which lead to different contact algorithms that have distinct advantages and disadvantages. First, on the optimization side, both exterior and interior point methods are applied, thus spanning inexact constraint enforcement algorithms of the penalty or barrier type as well as exact ones of the primal-dual type. Second, on the discretization side, the hierarchical basis set of the mortar variables is inherited either directly from the discretization of the slave surface or after an intermediate normalization step to satisfy the partition of unity. Third, in interaction with both optimization and discretization, the kinematic mortar variable is recovered from the actual <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> through the full or lumped solution of a linear system of equations. The implications of different choices are highlighted through benchmark problems which monitor the solution quality at the global level through the structural force evolution and at the local level through the contact pressure distribution. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{an ideal}} InAs/GaSb bilayer of {{appropriate}} dimension in-plane electron and hole bands overlap and hybridize, and a topologically non-trivial, or quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator, phase {{is predicted to}} exist. The in-plane dispersion's potential landscape, however, is subject to microscopic perturbations originating from material imperfections. In this work, the effect of disorder on the electronic structure of InAs/GaSb bilayers was studied by the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resistance of a dual-gated heterostructures gate-tuned through the inverted to <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> regimes. Conduction in the inverted (predicted topological) regime was qualitatively similar to behavior in a disordered two-dimensional system. The impact of charged impurities and interface roughness on the formation of topologically protected edge states and an insulating bulk was estimated. The experimental evidence and estimates of disorder in the potential landscape indicated the potential fluctuations in state-of-the-art films are sufficiently strong such that conduction in the predicted topological insulator (TI) regime was dominated by a symplectic metal phase rather than a TI phase. The implications are that future efforts must address disorder in this system and focus must {{be placed on the}} reduction of defects and disorder in these heterostructures if a TI regime is to be achieved.

40|$|In Contact Mechanics and Tribology, {{adhesion}} is {{the conservative}} reversible normal relation (contiguity) and attractive interaction (tension) at {{the interface between}} two materials in contact. ”Deadhesion ” or rather decohesion, {{is the loss of}} adhesion. In Fracture Mechanics and Rheology, debonding is usually interpreted as a crack propagating along the material pair interface at the microscale and as damage at the macroscale. This study is motivated by the fibre-matrix debonding which occurs in glass fibre reinforced epoxy matrix composites and decreases their strength. In this note, we focus our attention on the identification of the adhesive properties between glass and epoxy. The basic adhesive property, entering a normal adhesion-decohesion law relating the normal tensile stress pn to the <b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> gn at an interface, is the surface energy of adhesion (per unit area) ω (of Dupré). It represents the local work dissipated during the decohesion process (i. e. at the particle pair or con-tinuum elementary area microscale).

40|$|The longstanding {{quest for}} the {{anatomical}} basis of the Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome has left many unanswered questions. The ultrastructural morphology of the myocytes comprising accessory atrioventricular pathways, which are capable of rapid and variable conduction, is central to understanding the development and behaviour of this congenital anomaly, but remains unknown. Examination of three surgically resected pathways was performed to determine their underlying cellular morphology and the pattern of intercellular coupling, by correlative light microscopy, electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy combined with immunohistochemical localization of the cardiac gap-junctional protein, connexin 43. Two left-sided pathways were composed of myocardium of 'normal working ventricular ' type. The right-sided pathway was composed almost entirely of highly abnormal myocytes characterized by aberrant myofibril organisation, with a lack ofA-band material and abnormal mitochondria, but normal intact intercalated disks no different from those seen in left-sided pathways. The gap junctions of all pathways were composed of connexin 43 distributed as in ventricular myocardium, and not as found in atrial or atrioventricular nodal tissues.

40|$|Background. There {{have been}} few reports of {{nucleotide}} analogue-related renal tubular dysfunction (RTD) in CHB patients. We assessed the prevalence and presentation of nucleotide analogue-related proximal RTD. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed in CHB patients taking nucleotide analogues. Inclusion criteria were patients who were on adefovir or tenofovir as mono- or add-on therapy with lamivudine (LAM) > 1 year. Serum and urine were collected. Fractional excretion of phosphate (FEPO 4), uric acid (FEUA), and potassium was calculated. Renal losses were defined based on the criteria: protein (24 -hour urine protein > 150 [*]mg), glucose (glycosuria with normoglycemia), phosphate (FEPO 4 > 18 %), uric acid (FEUA > 15 %), potassium (renal potassium losses with hypokalemia), and bicarbonate (<b>normal</b> <b>gap</b> acidosis). Subclinical and overt proximal RTD were defined when 2 and ≥ 3 criteria presented. Results. Ninety-two patients were enrolled.
