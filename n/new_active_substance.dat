Rhodanine (2 -thioxo- 1, 3 -thiazolidin- 4 -one) represents a structural motif {{that has not yet}} been applied in any antimicrobial drug. Rhodanine derivatives have already been described as substances possessing a wide spectrum of biological activity. Within this diploma thesis, condensation products of rhodanine and 3 -(2 - hydroxyethyl) -rhodanine with ortho-, meta- and para-substituted nitro- benzaldehydes have been prepared. The reaction was carried out in water- alcoholic medium using NH 4 OH/NH 4 Cl as a catalyst. The antifungal and antimycobacterial properties of these derivatives and their inhibitory activity on photosynthetic processes were then evaluated. A medium antifungal activity against C. albicans, T. asahii, T. mentagrophytes and A. fumigatus have been observed with the N-unsubstituted derivatives, while the N-substituted derivatives were inactive.

Solanum was the most frequent genus. Two hundred and twenty four species could be considered potentially toxic or potentially interact with other drugs/medicines. Eighteen species are referred as "not for use during pregnancy", and 3 "not for use while nursing". These results are a source of concern since in Brazil, as it is worldwide, there is the notion that plants can never be harmful.

Part of the thesis is a theoretical analysis of the use laboratory animals in experiments and ethical aspects related to the use of laboratory animals.

The QT interval is the main indicator of cardiotoxicity and is considered to be the gold standard in evaluating the effect of the drug. In the practical part the ECG records obtained at the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University in Brno are processed. These records are dimmed manually and automatically. The manual dimming was consulted with a specialist in cardiography and statistically processed. Statistical processing served to compare with the results of the automatic ECG measurement.

The inclusion of both chemical and physical UV-filters in these products, however, increases the possibility for both photolytic and photocatalytic reactions to occur. This study investigated the effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) particle size on the photostability of the chemical UV-filters butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane (BMDM) and octocrylene (OC) formulated in a microemulsion. The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline Q 1 B for photostability testing of <b>new</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and medicinal products was applied. BMDM and OC in the microemulsion were irradiated with simulated sunlight in the presence of nano- (< 25 nm) and micro-TiO 2 (~ 0. 6 μm) and their concentrations determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. For the combination of BMDM and OC, the photodegradation for BMDM was found to be 12 % higher in the presence of nano-TiO 2 as compared to that of the micro-TiO 2. This enhanced photodegradation is attributed to the larger surface area of the nano-TiO 2 and the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because of these findings, sunscreen products containing chemical UV-filters and nano-TiO 2 should be regarded with caution, due to the potential loss of photoprotection...|$|R

Regulatory review times—including submission and application dates for <b>new</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> (NASs) and existing <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> (EASs) using a standardized template for the period of 2006 to 2010 —were collected directly from the GCC office located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 413 products (96 NASs and 317 EASs) were approved during the period, with an overall significant increase in the EASs (P <. 001). The median approval times increased from 107 calendar days in 2006 to 265 in 2010 (P <. 001). The lowest approval time was for EASs submitted by the Gulf companies (134 days) and the longest for NASs submitted by international companies (346 days) (P <. 001). These data were also analyzed according to therapeutic classes and dosage forms. The results also showed that the lowest number (n 16) approved during the period was in 2010, and this was due to a major regulatory change implementing the International Conference on Harmonisation product stability guideline for the region. The findings indicate that the delay and the wide range in approval times could be reduced by utilizing a standard assessment template for product review and the implementation of a clock stop system for company responses to questions from the GCC central registration committee.
