5000|$|Of extreme {{importance}} {{will be the}} woman's {{decision whether}} the entire breast is to be removed, or {{only a part of}} it - and that is usually much more a personal choice than a medical assessment. The medical viewpoint stresses the statistical fact of much stronger chances for cure and survival when the breast is removed completely, even when the size of the cancer is small. From the personal viewpoint, the perspective of not having the breast is very painful and difficult to accept. At this point the support of the family and of good friends can make {{the difference between life and}} death, since it is easier for friends to present the after-the-surgery future in the [...] "matter of fact" [...] way, thus facilitating the reasonable decision. The dilemma of the vital importance will be weighing the aesthetics and pride, against the chances of curing and surviving, which are much better when the breast is removed 100% completely. During these considerations, very painful indeed, one needs to realize that a woman's flat chest without breasts, even without nipples, does <b>not</b> look <b>bad</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> nothing to feel embarrassed of, or to be ashamed by; it looks just neutral - much better than a partly removed, disfigured breast. Since the surgery is unavoidable, for people open to see the problem in this way, the choice becomes easier.|$|R
40|$|The Christian {{opinions}} {{regarding the}} nature of the early church councils differed whether they were an instrument of the Christian propaganda or they were the platforms for political conflicts. This paper, having taken the council of Nicaea as a case study, seeks to redress the balance between these two entirely different perceptions. The approach here is an attempt to understand the degree of the politicization of a church meeting from the aspects of convocation, the way the Church Fathers handled the business, the imperial attitudes and expectations. I have four main concerns here; the reasons behind the re-location of council from Ankyra to Nikaia, the contribution of the imperial bureau to politicization and controversies on the creeds and canons. My answers to the above problems are mainly these. The change of the site of the council was completely a political enterprise of Eusebius of Nicomedia, as he discerned the disaster the Arians would have come across. The imperial authority did not directly get involved the religious controversies, the emperor only wanted to unite the church. The early church fathers tried every method to produce a text which would test or excommunicate their rivals. However the church councils were <b>not</b> that <b>bad</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> as they were also concerned the moral and religious problems of their congregations and it was through the church councils that the identity of catholic or orthodox emerged out of shadow.

40|$|The article {{studies the}} {{function}} of Russian folk speech and its evangelical implication in Nikolai Gogol's poetics. Folk proverbs and parables is the key source of national identity in Gogol‚Äôs aesthetics, which should inspire all Russian poets. The paper asserts that the proverbial method of generalization {{is one of the}} most significant principles of typification in Gogol's novel Dead Souls. The author expresses the essence of this or that phenomenon, a situation or a human type using imaginative pictures and traits of characters. The more generalized form they take, the more they resemble the traditional folk and poetic formulas. The article also reveals the hidden message of a Russian proverb Russians are good at thinking in hindsight (‚ÄúRusskiy chelovek zadnim umom krepok‚Äù). This characteristic of the Russian mind is the one with which Gogol connects the great destiny of Russia. At the end of his first volume the author resorts to the allegorical form of a parable that plays a key role in the perception of the novel. Transforming into the generalized symbol, its characters accumulate the most significant generic features and qualities of Dead Souls‚Äô characters. The grotesque images of Kifa Mokiyevich and Mokiy Kifovich help to look at the characters of the novel from every possible side, not from one side only that shows them as small-minded and worthles people. Gogol‚Äôs characters do not possess definitely disgusting and ugly qualities, which should be eliminated for the sake of people's improvement. Sobakevich's powerful physique and pragmatism, Plushkin's thrift, Manilov's meditativeness and cordiality, as well as Nozdryov's valor and energy are <b>not</b> <b>bad</b> qualities <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and do not deserve condemnation. However, all of them as Gogol used to say are carried to extremes and take perverse and exaggerated forms...|$|R
