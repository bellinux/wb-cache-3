50|$|In May 2014, {{researchers}} {{announced that}} they had successfully introduced two new artificial <b>nucleotides</b> into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring <b>nucleotides,</b> and by including individual artificial <b>nucleotides</b> in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins {{able to use the}} artificial <b>nucleotides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nasuia deltocephalinicola was {{recently}} discovered {{to have the}} smallest genome of all bacteria, with 112,091 <b>nucleotides.</b> For comparison, the human genome has 3.2 billion <b>nucleotides.</b> The second smallest genome, from bacteria Tremblaya princeps, has 139,000 <b>nucleotides.</b> While Nasuia deltocephalinicola has the smallest number of <b>nucleotides</b> it has more protein-coding genes than some bacteria, with 137 protein-coding genes.|$|R
5|$|The archive is {{composed}} of three main databases: the Sequence Read Archive, the Trace Archive and the EMBL <b>Nucleotide</b> Sequence Database (also known as EMBL-bank).

5|$|There are two types: <b>nucleotide</b> {{excision}} repair and base {{excision repair}}.|$|E
5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand {{can be used as a}} {{template}} to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged <b>nucleotide</b> and replace it with an undamaged <b>nucleotide</b> complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.|$|E
30|$|Sequences {{consisting}} of exactly the typical number of <b>nucleotides,</b> for each genotype, {{were classified as}} “Complete” full-length sequences. Sequences {{consisting of}} fewer than the typical number of <b>nucleotides,</b> for each genotype, were classified as “Subgenomic” and were at least 200 <b>nucleotides</b> in length. Sequences exceeding the typical number of <b>nucleotides</b> (overlength sequences), for each genotype, {{were excluded from the}} study.|$|R

5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing <b>nucleotide</b> diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing <b>nucleotide</b> monophosphates.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E
5|$|Genome-scale RNAi {{research}} {{relies on}} high-throughput screening (HTS) technology. RNAi HTS technology allows genome-wide loss-of-function screening and is broadly {{used in the}} identification of genes associated with specific phenotypes. This technology has been hailed as the second genomics wave, following the first genomics wave of gene expression microarray and single <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphism discovery platforms.|$|E

5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} has very high genetic variability. This {{diversity}} {{is a result of}} its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10−5 per <b>nucleotide</b> base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} a system for giving codes to {{identify}} amino acids and <b>nucleotide</b> bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This would allow for these sequences to be compared {{to try to find}} homologies. These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the <b>nucleotide</b> G and another with the <b>nucleotide</b> A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{announce}} that they successfully introduced two artificial <b>nucleotides,</b> Unnatural Base Pairs (UBRs), into bacterial DNA, and by including the individual artificial <b>nucleotides</b> {{in the culture}} media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins {{able to use the}} artificial <b>nucleotides.</b> The artificial <b>nucleotides</b> featured two fused aromatic rings which formed a complex mimicking the natural (dG–dC) base pair.|$|R
40|$|According to {{the three}} classifications of <b>nucleotides,</b> we divided the sixteen {{neighboring}} dual <b>nucleotides</b> into four classes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} more {{detailed}} modeling of {{the interface between}} stem and loop in non-coding RNA hairpin structures on efficacy of covariance-model-based non-coding RNA gene search is examined. Currently, the prior probabilities of the two stem <b>nucleotides</b> and two loop-end <b>nucleotides</b> at the interface are treated the same as any other stem and loop <b>nucleotides</b> respectively. Laboratory thermodynamic studies show that hairpin stability {{is dependent on the}} identities of these four <b>nucleotides,</b> but this is not taken into account in current covariance models. It is shown that separate estimation of emission priors for these <b>nucleotides</b> and joint treatment of substitution probabilities for the two loop-end <b>nucleotides</b> leads to improved non-coding RNA gene search...|$|R
5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The <b>nucleotide</b> contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a <b>nucleotide.</b> A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{in living}} cells, the storage {{can be turned}} active by enzymes. Light-gated protein domains fused to DNA {{processing}} enzymes are suitable for that task in vitro. Fluorescent exonucleases can transmit the output according to the <b>nucleotide</b> they have read.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD) is a coenzyme {{found in}} all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One <b>nucleotide</b> contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD and NADH respectively.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAdenine, {{cytidine}} and guanosine <b>nucleotides</b> were {{supplied to}} cultures of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata under aerobic heterotrophic and phototrophic growth conditions. Aerobic growth is {{not affected by}} exogenous <b>nucleotides</b> (up to 10 mM) whereas phototrophic growth is strongly inhibited by adenine but not by guanosine or cytidine <b>nucleotides.</b> During phototrophic growth there is an inverse relationship between the concentration of exogenous adenine <b>nucleotides</b> and photopigment synthesis.
