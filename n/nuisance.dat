5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private <b>nuisance,</b> the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in <b>nuisance</b> is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a <b>nuisance,</b> the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a <b>nuisance.</b> The test {{is whether or not the}} <b>nuisance</b> was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Other dipterans are a <b>nuisance</b> to humans, {{especially}} when present in large numbers; these include houseflies, which contaminate food and spread food-borne illnesses; the biting midges and sandflies (Ceratopogonidae) and the houseflies and stable flies (Muscidae). In tropical regions, eye flies (Chloropidae) which visit the eye {{in search of}} fluids can be a <b>nuisance</b> in some seasons.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified <b>nuisance</b> and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate <b>nuisance</b> parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{fire alarms}} {{are based on}} smoke detection. Nevertheless, in some fire {{scenarios}} volatiles are released before smoke. Fire detectors based only on chemical sensors have already been proposed as they may provide faster response, {{but they are still}} prone to false alarms in the presence of <b>nuisances.</b> These systems rely heavily on pattern recognition techniques to discriminate fires from <b>nuisances.</b> In this context, it is important to test the systems according to international standards for fires and testing the system against a diversity of <b>nuisances.</b> In this work, we investigate the behavior of a gas sensor array coupled to sensor fusion algorithms forfire detection when exposed to standardized fires and several <b>nuisances.</b> Results confirmed the ability to detect fires (97 % Sensitivity), although the system still produces a significant rate of false alarms (35 %) for <b>nuisances</b> not presented in the training set.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{scattered}} complaints {{in some communities}} that the LinkNYC towers themselves are a <b>nuisance.</b> These complaints mainly {{have to do with}} loitering, browser access, and kiosk volume, the latter two of which the city has resolved. However, these <b>nuisance</b> complaints are rare citywide; of the 920 kiosks installed citywide by then, there had been only one complaint relating to the kiosk design itself.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a <b>nuisance,</b> as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the <b>nuisance</b> is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the <b>nuisance</b> existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years or so, some historians have turned their {{attention}} to the human senses other than sight. This paper discusses briefly the noises and smells pervading Valletta during the final years of the 19 th and the opening decades of the 20 th century. In doing so, it stresses the importance of those who caused such <b>nuisances</b> and those who complained against them. It results that the growing sense of intolerance towards such <b>nuisances</b> was class-bound. The final part proposes to envision these <b>nuisances</b> as an element of what Ranajit Guha calls ‘the politics of the people’. peer-reviewe...|$|R

5|$|In 2007, then Florida lawyer Jack Thompson, who had {{previously}} campaigned against other games from Rockstar, stated {{that he would take}} measures to prevent the sale of Grand Theft Auto IV to minors. On 14 March 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive filed a lawsuit against Thompson in an attempt to preemptively restrict him from his attempts to declare Rockstar's games as a <b>nuisance.</b> Games declared to be a <b>nuisance</b> are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of First Amendment rights. Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} range, emerald ash borer {{is only a}} <b>nuisance</b> pest on native trees, as {{population}} densities typically do not reach levels lethal to healthy trees. In China, it infests native F. chinensis, F. mandshurica, and F. rhynchophylla; in Japan it also infests F. japonica and F. lanuginosa.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company {{brought a}} case against Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting £1 million in damages {{for the cost of}} finding a new {{borehole}} and an unsuccessful attempt to decontaminate the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE. They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in negligence, second, in <b>nuisance,</b> and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher. The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of negligence, he held that the damage had to be reasonably foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under <b>nuisance.</b> Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable, and both actions under <b>nuisance</b> and negligence must fail.|$|E

Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis.

5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a <b>nuisance</b> and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. One of the reasons for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E

5|$|Killer whales {{have helped}} humans hunting other whales. One {{well-known}} example was the killer whales of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom.

Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food.
