5000|$|The {{terminology}} surrounding virtual reference {{services may}} involve multiple terms {{used for the}} same definition. The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is [...] "virtual reference", with the secondary <b>non-preferred</b> <b>term</b> [...] "digital reference" [...] having gone out of use in recent years. [...] "Chat reference" [...] is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents {{only one aspect of}} virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, [...] "synchronous virtual reference" [...] refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.|$|E
5000|$|The current version, version 2, was {{released}} in April 2006. It is much bigger, with 3080 preferred <b>terms</b> and 4843 <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms</b> and covers internal-facing as well as public-oriented topics. The Internal Vocabulary {{was released}} as a separate subset containing 756 preferred <b>terms</b> and 1333 <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms.</b> An abridged version of the IPSV was also released containing 549 preferred <b>terms</b> and 1472 <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms</b> and remains compliant with the e-GMS.|$|R

Google Analytics service is now used for gaining search queries used by users. Within the data analysis, users queries are divided into seven categories that contain {{the title of the}} document, person, subject, action, institution, geographical terms and others. Then the candidates for new preferred <b>terms</b> and <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms</b> are identified in the subject category.|$|R
40|$|The AGROVOC is a {{multilingual}} structured thesaurus in {{the agricultural}} domain. It has already been mapped with several vocabularies, for example AGROVOC-CAT, AGROVOC-NALT, AGROVOC-SWD. Although these vocabularies already contained {{a good portion of}} <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms,</b> the terms are collected under the literary warrant and institutional warrant principles; which means vocabularies were collected based on the documents and publications rather than user‟s queries. It is still very common that end users would use different terms to express the same concept. In light of above discussion, we need to bridge these vocabularies and the users‟ terms Backgroun...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} the Chinese Classified Thesaurus (CCT) into a machine-processable format and provide CCT-based Web services, a pilot study has been conducted in which a variety of selected CCT classes and mapped thesaurus entries are encoded with SKOS. OWL and RDFS are also used to encode the same contents {{for the purposes of}} feasibility and cost-benefit comparison. CCT is a collected effort led by the National Library of China. It is an integration of the national standards Chinese Library Classification (CLC) 4 th edition and Chinese Thesaurus (CT). As a manually created mapping product, CCT provides for each of the classes the corresponding thesaurus terms, and vice versa. The coverage of CCT includes four major clusters: philosophy, social sciences and humanities, natural sciences and technologies, and general works. There are 22 main-classes, 52, 992 sub-classes and divisions, 110, 837 preferred thesaurus terms, 35, 690 entry <b>terms</b> (<b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms),</b> and 59, 738 pre-coordinated headings (Chinese Classified Thesaurus, 2005) Major challenges of encoding this large vocabulary comes from its integrated structure. CCT {{is a result of the}} combination of two structures (illustrated in Figure 1) : a thesaurus that uses ISO- 2788 standardized structure and a classification scheme that is basically enumerative, but provides some flexibility for several kinds of synthetic mechanism...|$|R

Therefore, we aimed to identify the most efficient method for searching in both MEDLINE (through PubMed) and EMBASE, covering search terms with variant spellings, direct and indirect orders, and associations with MeSH and EMTREE terms (or lack thereof). DESIGN AND SETTING: Experimental study. UNESP, Brazil. METHODS: We selected and analyzed 37 search strategies that had specifically been developed for the field of anesthesiology. These search strategies were adapted in order to cover all potentially relevant search terms, with regard to variant spellings and direct and indirect orders, in the most efficient manner. RESULTS: When the strategies included variant spellings and direct and indirect orders, these adapted versions of the search strategies selected retrieved {{the same number of}} search results in MEDLINE (mean of 61. 3 %) and a higher number in EMBASE (mean of 63. 9 %) in the sample analyzed. The numbers of results retrieved through the searches analyzed here were not identical with and without associated use of MeSH and EMTREE terms. However, association of these terms from both controlled vocabularies retrieved a larger number of records than did the use of either one of them. CONCLUSIONS: In view of these results, we recommend that the search terms used should include both preferred and <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms</b> (i. e. variant spellings and direct/indirect order of the same term) and associated MeSH and EMTREE terms, in order to develop highly-sensitive search strategies for systematic reviews...|$|R
40|$|Research Objective: Feasibility {{study of}} the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus {{considering}} the expansion of information {{in the field of}} women and family studies, as well as the wide span of related vocabulary and the development of vocabulary lists and bibliographies, the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus can be a professional tool for indexing and retrieval of women’s information in databases, library collections, archives and documentation centers as well as the Internet. Using this thesaurus, an indexing system will be developed which can be used for indexing, storage and retrieval of family and women’s databases. Methodology: The research method used in this study is documentary-based and the data gathering method was through library search in printed and electronic resources as well as interviewing professionals in the field of family and Women’s Studies. Through building a concept network between the terms, first the main structure of the thesaurus was determined using the inductive method and then the detailed structure was developed. Using this concept network, terms of the field were determined in a specific system and their interrelations were clarified. Findings: By studying resources including books, theses and articles in the field of women and family studies, and using ISO 25964 - 1 standard, the following 13 major categories were determined for the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus : 1. Religion; 2. Health and Hygiene; 3. Politics; 4. Economics; 5. Social Sciences; 6. Education; 7. Psychology; 8. History; 9. Culture and Literature; 10. International Relations; 11. Law; 12. Science and Technology; 13. Sports. There exists a rich vocabulary pool in the above categories; in fact around 6000 terms were identified. Conclusion: Based upon the collected vocabulary and after building the references and scope notes, 243 keywords including 160 preferred terms, 124 related terms, 83 scope notes and 82 <b>non-preferred</b> <b>terms</b> were identified and entered into the Thesaurus Builder software. The alphabetical index, tree index, rotated index and the English-Persian index were developed {{as a model for the}} main thesaurus. As a result, the Family and Women’s Studies Thesaurus can be developed based upon the vocabulary and the model at hand...|$|R
