40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{seeks to}} investigate perceptions of student teachers on <b>nurseries</b> and housemaids on Early Childhood Development (ECD). Six factors were extracted on <b>nurseries</b> and five were extracted for housemaids accounting for almost {{the same amount of}} variance. The main factor for <b>nurseries</b> functionary importance in ECD was stimulation of the mental and social emphasis of the children; and for housemaids it was on the moral development of the children and their complimentary role to <b>nurseries.</b> Housemaids were more paramount in ECD in terms of their ability to fill in for time-poor parents unlike <b>nurseries</b> due to the varying financial requirements, they were also more flexible on the space requirements for children’s development. Overall, factor analysis was more pronounced for the perceptions on housemaids than <b>nurseries</b> on ECD, which suggest the presence of extraneous variables especially economic ones that influence more the latter’s viability than the former...|$|R

5|$|Construction on the Commonwealth <b>nursery</b> and Westbourne Woods {{arboretum}} {{was started}} in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation {{of more than two}} million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park.

30|$|The {{establishment}} of kindergartens and day <b>nurseries</b> {{dates back to}} the late 19 th century in Japan, but it was not before the Second World War that they began developing in earnest. Under the Child Welfare Law of 1947, day <b>nurseries</b> were officially institutionalized and only working parents could keep their children at <b>nurseries.</b> There were other conditions, including the ones that children should have no one {{to take care of them}} at home and they could not stay at <b>nurseries</b> for more than 8 hours. The number of day <b>nurseries</b> has been gradually increasing under the circumstance where the Japanese economy has required a female workforce with children. The total number of licensed <b>nurseries</b> stood at 22, 624 as of 2005 and it is continuously on the rise. Meanwhile, kindergartens have developed as a part of school systems under the School Education Law of 1947. As of 2005, there were 13, 949 kindergartens in Japan and the number remains stable.|$|R

40|$|Fusarium circinatum is {{the causal}} agent {{of a serious}} disease of {{seedlings}} in South African pine <b>nurseries.</b> Insects, especially fungus gnats (Diptera: Sciaridae, Mycetophlidae), are suspected of transmitting this fungus in <b>nurseries.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain which species of gnats are present in South African pine <b>nurseries,</b> and to consider whether these and other Diptera carry F. circinatum. Dipteran fauna were surveyed in four major forestry <b>nurseries</b> between 2000 and 2001. Fungi were isolated from these flies and the resulting Fusarium species were identified.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify {{characteristics}} and shifts of discussions on the relationship between kindergartens and day <b>nurseries</b> in occupied Japan. To achieve this goal, this study analyzed articles of “Youji no Kyoiku (Early Childhood Care and Education) ”. The result indicated that discussions can be classified into four stages: (1) From 1946 to the mid- 1947, various groups of the society discussed actively about the relationship and unification of kindergartens and day <b>nurseries.</b> (2) From mid- 1947 to 1948, as a result of the enactment of the School Education Law and Child Welfare Act, the ECCE system was divided into two distinct forms of institutions: kindergartens and day <b>nurseries,</b> but it was argued at the same time that educational contents of kindergartens and day <b>nurseries</b> should be similar. (3) In 1949, ministry officials reemphasized fundamental differences between kindergartens and day <b>nurseries.</b> (4) Likewise, after 1950, educators and experts started also look at some differences between kindergartens and day <b>nurseries.</b> In conclusion, this study revealed that debates on the relationship between kindergartens and day <b>nurseries</b> in occupied Japan varied over time and varied depending on the status and influence of social groups involved...|$|R

5|$|SR666 {{begins at}} a traffic signal with SR60 and SR146, on the {{northeast}} side of Zanesville. The route heads east as a two-lane highway, before curving northeast. While passing through Zanesville the route passes woodland, with some commercial businesses. The highway makes a sharp curve due west, before another sharp curve northeast. After the second curve the route leaves Zanesville, running parallel to the Muskingum River and an Ohio Central Railroad track. The road makes a sharp curve northwest and passes under the Ohio Central Railroad track. After passing under the railroad track the route curves north-northeast and the railroad track curves due east. The roadway passes through the Zanesville State Forest <b>Nursery,</b> followed by a curve northwest, passing through the state forest <b>nursery</b> again. After leaving the state forest <b>nursery,</b> the highway passes through farmland heading due north. The route curves northeast passing through the state forest <b>nursery</b> {{for the last time}} and the highway has an intersection with County Road 40 (CR40), in rural Jefferson Township. Following this intersection, SR666 turns due west, before curving towards the north. This section of roadway passes mostly through farmland, with wooded areas when the route is close to the river. SR666 ends at an intersection with SR208 near Dresden, on the east bank of the Muskingum River.|$|E
