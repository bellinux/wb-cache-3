5|$|Tactile sensory {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{buoyancy}} of a diving cylinder during the dive {{can be more}} problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may {{be separated from the}} diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E
5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
25|$|To remain {{neutrally}} buoyant, gas {{is added}} to the BC when the diver is negative (too heavy), or vented from the BC when the diver is too buoyant (too light).

5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} forms shoals or schools {{that tend to}} be larger during the winter and spring. Though fairly active, its {{swimming}} muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of creatine phosphokinase compared to the shallow-water spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed. The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy.</b> Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} deep-sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host. Other known parasites of this species include the fluke Otodistomum cestoides, the copepods Neoalbionella fabricii and Neoalbionella centroscyllii, and the protozoans Haemogregarina delagei and Trypanosoma rajae.|$|E
5|$|Relatively common {{where it}} occurs, kitefin sharks are usually solitary in nature but may form small groups. It {{is a slow}} swimmer with a large liver filled with squalene, a lipid less dense than water, {{allowing}} it to maintain <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and hover above the bottom with little effort. Studies {{off the coast of}} North Africa and in the Gulf of Genoa have found males outnumbering females by 2:1 and 5:1 respectively; this imbalanced sex ratio has not been observed off South Africa and may reflect sampling bias. The kitefin shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks, as well as by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Parasite data on this species is limited; an examination of two sharks caught off Ireland found three nematodes in the stomach lumen. One could be identified as Anisakis simplex L3, while another may have been a larval Raphidascaris.|$|E
50|$|Cratons have thick lithospheric roots. Mantle {{tomography}} {{shows that}} cratons are underlain by anomalously cold mantle corresponding to lithosphere {{more than twice}} the typical 100 km thickness of mature oceanic or non-cratonic, continental lithosphere. At that depth, craton roots extend into the asthenosphere. Craton lithosphere is distinctly different from oceanic lithosphere because cratons have a <b>neutral</b> or positive <b>buoyancy,</b> and a low intrinsic isopycnic density. This low density offsets density increases due to geothermal contraction and prevents the craton from sinking into the deep mantle. Cratonic lithosphere is much older than oceanic lithosphere - up to 4 billion years versus 180 million years.|$|R
40|$|In stably {{stratified}} flows {{vertical movement}} of eddies {{is limited by}} the fact that kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, leading to a buoyancy displacement scale z B. Our new mixing-length concept for turbulent transport in the stable boundary layer follows a rigid-wall analogy, {{in the sense that we}} assume that the buoyancy length scale is similar to neutral length scaling. This implies that the buoyancy length scale is: ? B = ? B z B, with ? B ? ?, the von Karman constant. With this concept it is shown that the physical relevance of the local scaling parameter z/? naturally appears, and that the ? coefficient of the log-linear similarity functions is equal to c/? 2, where c is a constant close to unity. The predicted value ? ? 1 /? 2 = 6. 25 lies within the range found in observational studies. Finally, it is shown that the traditionally used inverse linear interpolation between the mixing length in the <b>neutral</b> and <b>buoyancy</b> limits is inconsistent with the classical log-linear stability functions. As an alternative, a log-linear consistent interpolation method is proposed. Department of Multi-Scale PhysicsApplied Science...|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} view of cephalopod evolution {{holds that}} they {{evolved in the}} Late Cambrian from a monoplacophoran-like ancestor with a curved, tapering shell, which was {{closely related to the}} gastropods (snails). The similarity of the early shelled cephalopod Plectronoceras to some gastropods was used in support of this view. The development of a siphuncle would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become gas-filled (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled along the floor, and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as Knightoconus, which lacked a siphuncle. <b>Neutral</b> or positive <b>buoyancy</b> (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the Plectronocerida and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods.|$|R
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> is not {{identical}} to weightlessness.

40|$|Colloidal {{suspensions}} of <b>buoyancy</b> <b>neutral</b> particles {{flowing in}} circular pipes focus into narrow distributions near the wall due to lateral migration effects associated with fluid inertia. In curving flows, these distributions are altered by Dean currents and {{the interplay between}} Reynolds and Dean numbers is used to predict equilibrium positions. Here, we propose a new description of inertial lateral migration in curving flows that expands current understanding of both focusing dynamics and equilibrium distributions. We find that at low Reynolds numbers, the ratio 3 ̆b 4 between lateral inertial migration and Dean forces scales simply with the particle radius, coil curvature and pipe radius as R 3 R/a 4. A critical value 3 ̆b 4 c = 0. 148 of this parameter is identified along with two related inertial focusing mechanisms. In the regime below 3 ̆b 4 c, coined subcritical, Dean forces generate permanently circulating, twinned annuli, each with intricate equilibrium particle distributions including eyes and trailing arms. At 3 ̆b 4 > 3 ̆b 4 c (supercritical regime) inertial lateral migration forces are dominant and particles focus to a single stable equilibrium position. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|This {{cumulative}} work summarizes seven manuscripts published between 2007 and 2012. These studies use {{marine and}} on-shore tephrostratigraphy {{as a tool}} to quantify and identify the timing, extent, and causes of geological processes taken place at subductions zones. In many subduction-related regions on Earth, highly explosive plinian volcanic eruptions generate buoyant, tephra bearing eruption columns capable of penetrating up to 40 km into the stratosphere, where they reach a <b>neutral</b> level of <b>buoyancy</b> and spread laterally. Such eruption clouds drift with the prevailing wind over nearby oceans, gradually dropping their ash load over areas that sometimes can be larger than 106 km 2. The resulting ash layers are best preserved in non-erosive marine environments and thus provide the most complete record of volcanic activity. Wide aerial distribution across sedimentary facies boundaries, near-instantaneous emplacement, correlative chemical signatures, and the presence of minerals suitable for radiometric dating make ash layers an excellent stratigraphic marker in marine sediments and provide constraints on the temporal evolution of both, the volcanic source region and the ash-containing sediment facies. On-shore stratigraphic successions of tephra layers are generally based on the distinct composition of tephras. In west-central Nicaragua for example (section 2. 1), late Pleistocene to Holocene tephras were emplaced by highly explosive eruptions, with a combined erupted mass of 184 Gt (DRE), that are distributed into 9 dacitic to rhyolitic eruptions (84...|$|R
40|$|The {{number and}} {{complexity}} of extravehicular activities (EVAs) required for the completion and maintenance of the International Space Station (ISS) is unprecedented. The training required to successfully complete this magnitude of space walks presents a real risk of overuse musculoskeletal injuries to the EVA crew population. There was mounting evidence raised by crewmembers, trainers, and physicians at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) between 1999 and 2002 that suggested a link between training in the <b>Neutral</b> - <b>Buoyancy</b> Lab (NBL) and the several reported cases of shoulder injuries. The short- and long-term health consequences of shoulder injury to astronauts in training {{as well as the}} potential mission impact associated with surgical intervention to assigned EVA crew point to this as a critical problem that must be mitigated. Thus, a multi-directorate tiger team was formed in December of 2002 led by the EVA Office and Astronaut Office at the JSC. The primary objectives of this Tiger Team were to evaluate the prevalence of these injuries and substantiate the relationship to training in the NBL with the crew person operating in the EVA Mobility Unit (EMU). Between December 2002 and June of 2003 the team collected data, surveyed crewmembers, consulted with a variety of physicians, and performed tests. The results of this effort were combined with the vast knowledge and experience of the Tiger Team members to formulate several findings and over fifty recommendations. This paper summarizes those findings and recommendations as well as the process by which these were determined. The Tiger Team concluded that training in the NBL was directly linked to several major and minor shoulder injuries that had occurred. With the assistance of JSC flight surgeons, outside consultants, and the lead crewmember/physician on the team, the mechanisms of injury were determined. These mechanisms were then linked to specific aspects of the hardware design, operational techniques, and the training environment. During the 1999 to 2003 time frame many variables converged to make it impossible to determine with any accuracy which one or two root causes were primarily involved. Therefore a broad range of recommendations was established to prevent future injury to crewmembers training in the NBL in the near term. Many of these recommendations are lessons learned that are essentially timeless and therefore should be passed on to future EVA endeavors to ensure that hardware designs and operational techniques utilized in the future consider the demands of training on the human body here on earth...|$|R
