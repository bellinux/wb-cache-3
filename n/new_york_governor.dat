5|$|A {{number of}} Republican politicians, such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, tested the waters {{for a run}} but chose to stay out. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Governor</b> Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against {{corporate}} corruption.

5|$|New York's 20th congressional {{district}} {{has historically been}} conservative, and early polls favored Tedisco, but by February 2009 the race was considered a toss-up. The Republican Party considered the election to be a referendum on President Obama's economic policy and as such, injected significant funding into Tedisco's campaign, using well-known Republicans such as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Congressional Minority Leader John Boehner, and former <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Governor</b> George Pataki for support. Democrats used Senator Gillibrand, Vice President Joe Biden, and an endorsement from President Barack Obama to support the Murphy campaign.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, Ford {{nominated}} former <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Governor</b> Nelson Rockefeller to {{fill the}} vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H.

Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him.|$|E

Since the fort was located near several trails (including the Great Indian Warpath), its position—on a bend at a shallow portion of the Mohawk River—made it an important fording point. The Mohawk called the bend Unundadages ("around the hill"), and the Mohawk word appears on the city's seal.|$|E

5|$|The longest-serving {{governor}} was the first, George Clinton, who first took office on July 30, 1777, and served seven terms {{in two different}} periods, totaling just under 21 years in office. (As 18 of those years were consecutive, Clinton also served the longest consecutive period in office for a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>governor.)</b> Charles Poletti had the shortest term, serving 29 days following {{the resignation of the}} previous governor in 1942. The current governor is Andrew Cuomo, who took office on January 1, 2011.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>governor</b> Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

5|$|During Brown's {{tenure in}} the New York State Senate his Democratic Party {{was in the}} minority. He {{was part of the}} {{majority}} that backed <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Governor</b> George Pataki's 2001 plan to build up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The legislation was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with debit cards. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to apportion the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Cooper again won {{re-election}} over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, {{breaking his}} own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying {{the vote of}} 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Governor</b> Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nomination– and eventually, the presidency– went to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>governor</b> Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E
