In the coordination process, the current two <b>national</b> <b>curriculums</b> in Korea, <b>National</b> Kindergarten <b>Curriculum</b> and <b>National</b> Childcare <b>Curriculum</b> need to be adapted {{to each other as}} an integrated curricular. In practices, individual kindergartens and childcare centers may modify specifics while they follow the general guidelines of the integrated curriculum. A more ‘educational’ curriculum for children aged three to five must be developed within the integrated curriculum by mutually complementing the standard childcare program and the <b>national</b> kindergarten <b>curriculum.</b> The standard childcare program for children at age zero to two must be aligned with the integrated curriculum for older children.|$|R

It verifies that the <b>National</b> Common <b>Curriculum</b> Basis identifies the physical education in the language field and it affiliates to an eclecticism regarding to their conception and specific body of knowledge, generating inconsistency in content and the formative processes of this knowledge field. It concludes that the manuscript materializes an alliance between education and capital, defending the central hierarchical groups’ interests, transforming the right to education in marketing service...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} and evaluates English in the First to the Seventh <b>national</b> school <b>curriculum</b> (1954 –present) in South Korea {{in order to}} suggest directions for future English curriculum development. First, a sociolinguistic profile of English in South Korea is described to provide {{a better understanding of}} English in the <b>national</b> school <b>curriculum.</b> The profile includes a brief description of South Korea, the history of English in South Korea, functional uses of English, general presence and availability of English, the cline of bilingualism in South Korea, English language policy and planning, and attitudes toward English. Second, English in the First to the Seventh <b>national</b> school <b>curriculum</b> is described through the curriculum framework provided by Tyler (1969) : goals, content, organization, and evaluation. Third, the recurring theme of English throughout the history of the <b>national</b> school <b>curriculum</b> is evaluated and discussed through information and implications obtained from the sociolinguistic profile. Finally, this study suggests that the recurring theme is not a desirable direction for English in the future <b>national</b> school <b>curriculum</b> because it does not reflect the sociolinguistic reality of English in South Korea. More importantly, it does not serve the needs of the general population in South Korea; as a result, these findings call for a new direction for English in the future <b>national</b> school <b>curriculum.</b> ...|$|R

In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E

5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK <b>National</b> <b>Curriculum</b> for primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E

However, the Ministry does not implement the regulations and guidelines; instead this is the responsibility of the local authority, who fund and administer playschools. In addition, the local authority employs representatives who supervise the playschools’ operation.|$|E

5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the <b>National</b> <b>Curriculum</b> is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (girls could wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers.
