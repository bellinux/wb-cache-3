Aggression thus predicted only externalising outcomes, and withdrawal only internalising outcomes. <b>No</b> <b>significant</b> <b>interaction</b> was found between the two forms of unpopularity, suggesting that relatively [...] "pure" [...] samples of aggressive and withdrawn children had indeed been isolated. Social competence, meanwhile, was predictive of substance use (and of felt peer-group insecurity, though to a lesser extent than withdrawal).

5000|$|In one study, {{a sample}} of {{individuals}} was gathered and divided into groups based on whether they had a fragmentary blackout {{within the last year}} or not.

After 30 minutes, breathalyzer samples were recorded and recorded every 30 minutes thereafter. In the test for narrative recall those who received alcohol and FB+(those who admitted to having a fragmentary blackout within the last year) recalled fewer narrative details after a 30-minute delay, but there were <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>interaction</b> effects.
