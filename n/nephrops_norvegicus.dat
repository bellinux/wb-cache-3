5|$|The three clawed lobster species Homarus gammarus, H.americanus and <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> are hosts to {{the three}} known species of the animal phylum Cycliophora; the species on H.gammarus has not been described.|$|E
25|$|Symbiotic {{animals of}} the genus Symbion, {{the only member of}} the phylum Cycliophora, live {{exclusively}} on lobster gills and mouthparts. Different species of Symbion have been found on the three commercially important lobsters of the North Atlantic Ocean – <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> Homarus gammarus, and Homarus americanus.|$|E
25|$|Fishery {{data for}} the Atlantic sawtail {{catshark}} is inadequate as it is still recorded as G. melastomus by observers. This species is caught incidentally on deepwater longlines and bottom trawls targeting other species, including wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), conger eel (Conger conger), Norway lobster (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus),</b> and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus). Most landed sharks are discarded and likely suffer high mortality due to damage sustained during capture; the larger specimens are marketed for human consumption. Given the small extent of its range and the ubiquitous heavy fishing pressure within, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this shark as Near Threatened.|$|E
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E
500|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of little {{economic}} value, the blackmouth catshark is caught incidentally {{in large numbers}} by commercial bottom trawl and longline fisheries. In particular, it {{is among the most}} commonly bycaught sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> , Aristeus antennatus, and Aristaeomorpha folicea), operating off Portugal and in the Mediterranean. Most captured sharks are discarded, probably with heavy mortality. Some fisheries, such as those off Portugal and Italy, retain and utilize a small subset of the largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted, and for leather; the fishing fleet of Viareggio, Tuscany reported landing [...] in 2005. In the northeastern Atlantic, this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following the decline of other deepwater shark species.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} {{transferred}} to a new genus, Metanephrops (along with every other extant species then in Nephrops, except its type species, <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus)</b> by Richard Jenkins of the University of Adelaide in 1972. Jenkins placed M.challengeri among the [...] "thomsoni group" [...] within the genus Metanephrops, alongside M.thomsoni, M.sibogae, M.boschmai and M.sinensis. Jenkins inferred that this group of species had originated off northern Australia or in Indonesia, and that M.challengeri had reached New Zealand in the late Tertiary and displaced M.motunauensis, which formerly lived there. More recently, findings from molecular phylogenetics suggest that M.challengeri has a basal position in the genus, possibly linked to M.neptunus, and that the genus may have originated at high latitudes in the South Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Metanephrops challengeri reaches sexual {{maturity}} {{at the age}} of 3–4 years, and may live up to 15 years in total. Females produce very large eggs in small numbers; they are typically around [...] in diameter, and are blue in colour. The larvae hatch at the zoea stage (equivalent to the third zoea of the Northern Hemisphere species <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus).</b> The zoea larvae are [...] long, and possess all the appendages of the cephalothorax, including the pereiopods, which are used for swimming, but no pleopods (appendages of the abdomen). This larval stage lasts less than four days, before the young moult into the post-larval stage. The post-larva swims using its pleopods. The post-larva later moults into the adult form. Larvae are rarely seen in the wild, confirming that the development to the bottom-dwelling post-larva is rapid.|$|E

50|$|About 122,000 t of {{lobsters}} {{are caught}} in the north Atlantic Ocean (FAO Fishing Areas 21 and 27), where the dominant species are Homarus americanus and <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Symbion was {{discovered}} in 1995 by Reinhardt Kristensen and Peter Funch on the mouthparts of the Norway lobster (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus),</b> and other, related, species have since been discovered on: ...|$|E
5000|$|The name is used loosely both in Italy and {{elsewhere}} {{to refer to}} other similar species, though some food labelling laws (in Britain, for example) define [...] "scampi" [...] as <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Scampi {{includes}} various culinary preparations {{of certain}} crustaceans, commonly <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> (the Norway lobster, {{also known as}} [...] "Langoustine" [...] or [...] "Dublin Bay Prawns" [...] and sometimes itself called [...] "scampi"), or a similar lobster such as Metanephrops, as well as shrimp or prawns. Scampi preparation styles vary regionally. While the United Kingdom legally defines scampi specifically as <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> other similar lobsters are considered scampi worldwide. Monkfish tail was sometimes illegally used and sold as scampi in the United Kingdom in the past [...] contravening the Fish Labelling (Amendment) England Regulation 2005 and Schedule 1 of the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.|$|E

50|$|Trawling is {{the main}} method used for the Norway lobster or Dublin Bay prawn, <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> and for those slipper {{lobsters}} that prefer soft substrates, such as Thenus and Ibacus. It has also become more frequently used in the fishery for Homarus americanus.|$|E
50|$|Symbiotic {{animals of}} the genus Symbion, {{the only member of}} the phylum Cycliophora, live {{exclusively}} on lobster gills and mouthparts.

50|$|Stichocotylidae is a monospecific genus of flatworms {{comprising}} the single species Stichocotyle nephropis, {{which is an}} internal parasite of elasmobranch fish, originally described from the Norway lobster, <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> by J. T. Cunningham in 1884. This flatworm is distinguished by a single ventral row of well separated suckers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> is a {{scavenger}} and predator {{that makes}} short foraging excursions, mainly {{during periods of}} subdued light. They feed on active prey, including worms and fish, which they capture with their chelipeds and walking legs, and food is conveyed to the mouth using the anterior walking legs, assisted by the maxillipeds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> is {{the host}} {{to a number of}} parasites and symbionts. A number of sessile organisms attach to the {{exoskeleton}} of N. norvegicus, including the barnacle Balanus crenatus and the foraminiferan Cyclogyra, but overall Nephrops suffers fewer infestations of such epibionts than other decapod crustaceans do. In December 1995, the commensal Symbion pandora was discovered attached to the mouthparts of <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> and was found to be the first member of a new phylum, Cycliophora, a finding described by Simon Conway Morris as [...] "the zoological highlight of the decade". S. pandora has been found in many populations of N. norvegicus, both in the north Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea. Individuals may be found on most segments of the lobster's mouthparts, but are generally concentrated on the central parts of the larger mouthparts, from the mandible to the third maxilliped.|$|E
50|$|Langoustines or Norway {{lobsters}} - <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> - {{are roughly}} {{the size of a large}} crayfish and fished from silty bottom regions of the open Atlantic Ocean, and parts of the Mediterranean. The fleshy tail of the Norway lobster is closer in both taste and texture to lobster and crayfish than prawn or shrimp.|$|E
50|$|This species inhabits muddy {{habitats}} {{similar to}} those favoured by the Norway lobster and burrows into inshore muddy sand. Its burrows often interconnect in complex patterns with those inhabited by other species of burrowing megafauna such as Callianassa subterranea, Cepola macrophthalma, Lesueurigobius friesii, and <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus.</b> These multi-species burrow complexes are very common in some localities.|$|E
5000|$|Scampi is the Italian plural of scampo, <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus.</b> In English, scampi {{is used as}} singular, plural, or uncountable. The Italian word may {{be derived}} from the Greek κάμπη kampē ("bending" [...] or [...] "winding").Years after scampi became scarce. Due to scarcity, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom and Spain would often {{substitute}} shrimp in scampi when required.|$|E
5000|$|The {{curled octopus}} feeds on crabs {{and other large}} crustaceans, as well as fish. Serological {{analysis}} of the crop of specimens sampled in the Moray Firth and Sound of Jura revealed the main prey to be Liocarcinus spp, <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> Cancer pagurus , Crangon crangon and Carcinus maenas, although {{a large proportion of}} the samples analysed did not react in the tests suggesting they had consumed alternative prey. [...] It is cited as a significant predator of such commercially important species as Homarus gammarus (European lobster), <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> (Norway lobster), and Cancer pagurus (edible crab) from traps. When preying on crabs, it immobilises the crab by injecting toxins into the body of the crab through a hole created in its shell using the octopus's radula. [...] The octopus then injects saliva into the crab and the digestive enzymes contained in that saliva break down the crab's internal attachments to it shell, allowing the octopus to easily remove the carapace.|$|E
50|$|Hematodinium is a genus of dinoflagellates. Species in this genus, such as Hematodinium perezi, {{the type}} species, are {{internal}} parasites of the hemolymph of crustaceans {{such as the}} Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) and Norway lobster (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus).</b> Species in the genus are economically damaging to commercial crab fisheries, including causing bitter crab disease in the large Tanner or snow crab fisheries of the Bering Sea.|$|E
50|$|The muscular tail of <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> is {{frequently}} eaten, and its meat {{is known as}} scampi. The N. norvegicus is eaten only on special occasions in Spain and Portugal, where it is less expensive than the common lobster, Homarus gammarus. N. norvegicus is an important species for fisheries, being caught mostly by trawling. Around 60,000 tonnes are caught annually, half {{of it in the}} United Kingdom's waters.|$|E
50|$|While {{analyses}} of morphology suggest {{a close relationship}} between Homarinus and Homarus, molecular analyses using mitochondrial DNA reveal {{that they are not}} sister taxa. Both genera lack ornamentation such as spines and carinae, but are thought to have reached that state independently, through convergent evolution. The closest living relative of Homarus is <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus,</b> while the closest relatives of Homarinus are Thymops and Thymopides.|$|E
5000|$|Metanephrops is a genus of lobsters, {{commonly}} known as scampi. Important species for fishery include Metanephrops australiensis (Australian scampi) and Metanephrops challengeri (New Zealand scampi). It differs from other lobsters such as Homarus and <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> in that its two main claws are of equal size, rather than being differentiated into a crusher and a pincher. There are 18 extant species recognised in the genus: ...|$|E
5000|$|Nephrops is a genus of {{lobsters}} comprising {{a single}} extant species, <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> (the Norway lobster or Dublin Bay prawn), and several fossil species. It was erected by William Elford Leach in 1814, to accommodate N. norvegicus alone, which {{had previously been}} placed in genera such as Cancer, Astacus or Homarus. Nephrops means [...] "kidney eye" [...] and refers {{to the shape of}} the animal's compound eye.|$|E
50|$|Fries's goby (Lesueurigobius friesii) is {{a species}} of goby native to the Eastern Atlantic Ocean along the coasts of Europe and {{northern}} Africa {{as well as the}} Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Marmara. This species burrows into muddy or muddy sand substrates at depths of from 10 to 130 m and is frequently found in association with the lobster <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus.</b> This species can reach a length of 13 cm TL.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus</b> adults {{prefer to}} inhabit muddy seabed sediments, {{with more than}} 40 percent silt and clay. Their burrows are semi-permanent, and vary in {{structure}} and size. Typical burrows are 20 to 30 cm deep, with a distance of 50 to 80 cm between {{the front and back}} entrances. Norway lobsters {{spend most of their time}} either lying in their burrows or by the entrance, only leaving their shelters to forage or mate.|$|E
50|$|Nephropsis atlantica {{is found}} on muddy {{substrates}} in deep {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean, from the Faroe Islands to Namibia. It has been recorded at depths of 470 - 1804 m, but is most frequent at 900 - 1000 m. It {{is one of only}} three clawed lobsters in the north-east Atlantic Ocean (the others being Homarus gammarus and <b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus),</b> and the only one which is not the subject of commercial fishery.|$|E
50|$|In the Clyde sea fishery for scampi (<b>Nephrops</b> <b>norvegicus)</b> in Scotland, the {{unwanted}} invertebrates that {{get caught up}} in the trawl include O. ophiura, as well as the starfish Asterias rubens. A study undertaken to discover the survival rate of these animals when discarded and returned to the water found that uninjured A. rubens had a mortality rate of 4%, whereas virtually all the O. ophiura died within 14 days, even when they were returned to the sea immediately after being caught.|$|E
