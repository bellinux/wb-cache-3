40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{can participate in}} the Kyoto Protocol to <b>limit</b> greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> by adopting <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>limits.</b> Such limits could offer economic gains to developing countries, cost savings to industrialized countries, and environmental benefits. They could also address concerns of the U. S. Senate.

To manage risks arising from <b>emissions</b> <b>limits,</b> developing countries should index any <b>emissions</b> <b>limits</b> to variables that predict emissions in the absence of limits. This paper presents such an index-similar to one recently adopted by Argentina-and develops estimates showing that it could lower the risk of economic losses to developing countries from about 40 percent to about 35 percent. ...|$|R
50|$|COPERT is an MS Windows {{software}} program aiming at {{the calculation of}} air pollutant emissions from road transport. The technical development of COPERT is financed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), {{in the framework of}} the activities of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. The COPERT methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. The Guidebook, developed by the UNECE Task Force on Emissions Inventories and Projections, is intended to support reporting under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU directive on <b>national</b> <b>emission</b> <b>limits.</b> The COPERT methodology is fully consistent with the Road Transport chapter of the Guidebook. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions allows for a transparent and standardized, hence consistent and comparable data collecting and emissions reporting procedure, in accordance with the requirements of international conventions and protocols and EU legislation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarGlobal {{emissions}} of CO 2, CO, NOx, total VOC, CH 4, SO 2 and H 2 O from civil and military aircraft are reviewed. The major contribution of emissions by aircraft stems {{not from the}} Landing and Take-Off cycle, to which most <b>national</b> <b>emission</b> estimates are <b>limited,</b> but from the cruise flight. Subsonic aircraft appear to spend roughly about 20 % of the fuel consumption in the tropopause or in the stratosphere. Estimates are presented of value and uncertainty of global emission factors and of the global annual fuel consumption for civil and military air traffic (1990), as well as emission inventories made for the Netherlands (1988) and for Germany (1984). The fuel consumption by aircraft in 1990 {{is estimated to be}} about 7. 61 EJ of 175 Mton, of which 28 % is accounted for as bunker fuel; the share of military aircraft is estimated to be about 21 %. The uncertainty range in the emission estimates of NOx, CO and VOC/methane is reported to be of the carbondioxide of 2. <b>National</b> <b>emission</b> budgets appear to depend considerable on the definition used for accounting "national" aircraft emissions...|$|R

In the following section an overview of <b>national</b> and European <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> and <b>emission</b> guidelines on particulate and heavy metal emissions from stationary sources is given. The state of implementation of measures for the reduction of heavy metals emissions is described for each relevant industrial sector, excluding combustion processes and fugitive emissions, which occur across sectors, and which are thus dealt with in separate chapters.

40|$|Background {{and aims}}   Today, the {{environmental}} pollution caused by fire-proof break producing factories {{is one of}} the critical and challenging issues in our country. Aerosols emission concentration of the factory stacks and determining of bag filters efficiency were aims of this study   Methods   In this research, the concentration of emitting dust from 6 stacks related to Kaolin preparation, Calcinatory, Shamout, Specific mass, Extrude Furnace and Shuttle Furnace units were measured during 2006 - 2008. Also, the efficiency of bag filters of Kaolin preparation, Calcinatory, Shamut, Specific mass units were determined in 2008.   Devices M 9096 Particulate Sampling Train and DURAG model (D-RC 80) were used in this research.     Results   the rates of dust concentrations in years 2006 - 9 in Kaolin unit were; 284, 112 and 12. 5 mg/m 3, in Shamout unit were; 120, 140 and 73 mg/m 3, in Calcinatory were; 178, 179 and 173 mg/m 3, in Specific Mass were; 291, 283 and 60 mg/m 3, in Shuttle Furnace were; 14. 7, 14. 3 and 14. 8 and in Extrude Furnace were; 12. 6, 13. 7 and 12. 7 mg/m³. Efficiency of bag filters was 99. 896 % for Kaolin unit, 96. 499 % for Shamout unit, 92. 348 % for Calcinatory and 99. 782 % for Specific Mass unit.     Conclusion     During 2006 and 2007 the rate of dust emission in Kaolin preparation, Calcinatory and Specific mass have exceeded than the <b>national</b> <b>emission</b> standard but in 2008, the rate of dust emission from Kaolin Preparation and Specific Mass units were extensively reduced to the level lower than <b>national</b> <b>emission</b> standard <b>limit</b> due to proper maintenance and replacing of damaged parts in appropriate time.   Efficiency of bag filters has been ideal in Kaolin and Specific Mass units but it was low in Shamout and Calcinatory units...|$|R

On March 16, 2011 EPA proposes Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, the first nationwide limits on coal-fired power plant emissions of mercury. Specifically, the proposal aims to reduce emissions from new and existing coal and oil-fired EGUs by 91% from current levels through <b>national</b> quantity-based, numerical <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> on mercury releases.

According to the EPA, the Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards are expected to have broad health benefits (due to reductions in several pollutants, not just mercury), including the prevention in the year 2016 of between 6,800 and 17,000 premature deaths and 11,000 non-fatal heart attacks.

40|$|Ecology and {{preservation}} of human environment have become a newly {{one of the most}} important parts of scientific advancement research. Since they are primarily resolve issues of pollution from the land, today more and more demanding paying attention to pollution from the ships. Air pollution is a serious problem for both human health and the overall ecosystem. Emissions from ships include air pollutants, greenhouse gases and substances that destroy the ozone layer with the consequence of endangering human health and the environment. Emissions of sulfur (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) cause acidification. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from tankers, combined with nitrous oxide, participate in the formation of ground-level ozone, which adversely affects the health and the environment. The reason for intense need for a solution to this problem is the growing increase in air pollution emissions and this boat because the emissions of stationary plants significantly reduced the adoption of various environmental laws. This problem has become so primary, so join the international and <b>national</b> regulations on <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> from ships in some countries, especially those which are exposed to more emissions from ships, which are closer to the sea waterway...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{accurate}} harmonic allocation methods is developed to improve the current <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> of IEEE Std. 519. IEC 61000 - 3 - 6 and IEEE Std. 519 have by now been accepted as two well known standards for interconnecting the MV and HV-EHV customers to utility systems and widely adopted as standards to many power utilities. It {{is worth noting that}} the harmonic current <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> of both standards have not been compared and justified with analytical proofs because there is still no explanation that discusses the origin of the <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> in IEEE Std. 519, or the complex feature of IEC 61000 - 3 - 6. Two new novel methods of allocating the harmonic current <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> for MV customers and HV-EHV customers have been proposed. Both methods have been developed in accordance with the principles of IEC 61000 - 3 - 6. Task II has compared and investgated the <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> of both IEC 61000 - 3 - 6 and IEEE Std. 519.

The proposed methods strongly support IEC 61000 - 3 - 6 and IEEE Std. 519, and add to their value; these methods could also help utilities allocate fairly and accurately harmonic <b>emission</b> <b>limits</b> to their MV and HV-EHV customers.
