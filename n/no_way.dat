5|$|In late 2009, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) held a poll {{on their}} {{official}} website to allow fans {{to choose a}} name for their February pay-per-view. The choices included Elimination Chamber, Heavy Metal, Battle Chamber, Chamber of Conflict and <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, which had been {{the name of the}} preceding Elimination Chamber-based event. The name Elimination Chamber won, but the event was still promoted as <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out in Germany.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out (2004) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on February 15, 2004, at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California. It was presented by THQ's MX Unleashed. It was the sixth event produced under the <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out name and starred wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out is a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced by WWE, {{a professional}} wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 1998 as an In Your House event in February of that year and in 2000 was made an annual pay-per-view event for WWE. After the brand extension, the event was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand in 2004, being produced every February. In April 2007, following WrestleMania 23, brand-exclusive pay-per-view events ceased being held, {{with the last of}} which being the SmackDown-exclusive <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out 2007. After the event included two Elimination Chamber matches in 2008 and 2009, <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out was replaced by WWE Elimination Chamber the following year. The name was revived for the June 2012 pay-per-view event.|$|E
5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out. In the weeks preceding <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Following the Royal Rumble, Randy Orton and Kurt Angle began feuding with The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels, respectively. The Big Show faced JBL in {{the first}} ever barbed wire steel cage match for the title at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, which JBL won to retain the title. Orton briefly feuded with Christian {{before moving on to}} feud with The Undertaker, which spanned nine months. After losing his title match at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, The Big Show faced Akebono in a sumo match at WrestleMania, and he briefly feuded with Carlito afterwards.|$|E

According to Sigismondo de' Conti, papal secretary and chronicler, the vote was unanimous on the fourth ballot, taken early in the morning on 11 August although Borja had only 15 votes prior to the accessus; other accounts say Borja received all the votes except for his own, which he gave to Carafa.|$|E

5|$|After {{missing a}} few weeks, Mercury {{returned}} wearing a protective face mask and his injury was worked into the angle, with {{both he and}} Nitro attempting to injure the Hardys in various ways for revenge. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out pay-per-view in February which concluded the feud. He also wrestled in singles competition on SmackDown! until {{he was released from}} his WWE contract on March 26, 2007.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} 15-man battle royal (a match in which {{participants}} are eliminated until one person remains as the winner) on the January 29, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, Eddie Guerrero {{earned the right to}} challenge for the WWE Championship at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out against the champion, Brock Lesnar in a standard wrestling match, also known as a singles match. Outside the storyline with Guerrero, Lesnar was involved in a staged rivalry with Goldberg, a member of the Raw program. The feud between Lesnar and Goldberg began at the Royal Rumble, WWE's previous pay-per-view event which involved both brands. Lesnar interfered in the Royal Rumble match, a 30-man battle royal, attacking and eliminating Goldberg from the match. On the week of January 26, 2004, Lesnar and Goldberg conducted promotional in-ring segments on respective episodes of Raw and SmackDown!, in which they insulted each other. The following week on an episode of Raw, {{as a result of the}} rivalry extending between the two programs, General Manager Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out by giving him a front-row ticket. That Thursday on SmackDown!, the storyline between Guerrero and Lesnar was enhanced when they began a brawl after an in-ring interview segment.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E
5|$|Cena made a {{surprise}} return {{as the final}} participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him not getting the championship. The night after <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match, making it a triple threat match also involving Triple H, during which he was pinned by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, {{in which he was}} pinned by Orton. Triple H won the title during that match, during which Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day and then at One Night Stand in a First Blood match. JBL, however, defeated him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.|$|E
5|$|Cena {{made his}} in-ring return at the November {{pay-per-view}} event, Survivor Series, defeating Chris Jericho {{to win his}} first World Heavyweight Championship. The two continued their rivalry up to Armageddon, where Cena retained his championship. After defeating JBL at the Royal Rumble, Cena lost the championship at <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> Out to Edge, after Kofi Kingston was attacked by Edge, who took {{his place in the}} Elimination Chamber match. Cena was given an opportunity to regain the title at WrestleMania XXV in a triple threat match also involving Big Show, which Cena won.|$|E
