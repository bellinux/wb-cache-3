50|$|The {{southern}} white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), {{sometimes referred}} to as white-bellied hedgehog or white-chested hedgehog, is very similar in lifestyle and appearance to the European hedgehog, but the former has a white spot on its chest. For a long time these two species were considered to be one. The <b>northern</b> white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> was formerly recognized as a subspecies of the Southern white-breasted hedgehog but newer investigations see both as different species. The Southern white-breasted hedgehog and European hedgehog can hybridize.|$|R
50|$|E. europaeus {{is unlike}} any other {{creature}} across most of its range. Where it co-exists with the <b>Northern</b> white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> (Erinaceus roumanicus), the two species are difficult to distinguish in the field, the latter having a white spot on its chest. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, E. europaeus is probably the largest species of hedgehog and is possibly the heaviest member of the Erinaceomorpha order, although the moonrat (Echinosorex gymnura), similar in average mass if not known to equal to the hedgehog's maximum weight, can attain a considerably greater length.|$|R
40|$|Three {{cases of}} carrion-feeding with remains of {{artiodactyls}} (0. 3 %, n= 1104 samples with food remains) {{have been documented}} {{in a long term}} diet study of Eurasian Eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) in 53 localities at Southeastern Bulgaria. Bone pieces of a sheep/goat (Ovis aries/Carpa hircus), a Fallow Deer (Dama dama) and a Domestic Pig (Sus scrofa dom.) in three Eurasian Eagle-owl breeding localities (5. 7 %) prove extremely rare feeding on carrion. <b>Northern</b> White-breasted <b>Hedgehog</b> (Erinaceus roumanicus), rats (Rattus sp.), waterbirds and gallinaceous birds (total 59. 5 - 72. 6 % by biomass) constituted the main portion of the diets with carrion remains. The comparisons between food niche breadths, diet composition, average prey biomass and values of superpredation of the annual diets in the three localities have not supported the carrion-feeding of the Eurasian Eagle-owl as a result of food shortages...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{large-scale}} molecular investigation of fleas from a geographically widespread and highly urbanized species, the <b>northern</b> white-breasted <b>hedgehog.</b> In this study, 759 fleas (the majority were Archaeopsylla erinacei) collected from 134 hedgehogs were molecularly analyzed individually or in pools {{for the presence of}} three groups of vector-borne pathogens. All flea samples were positive for rickettsiae: In two samples (1. 5 %) Rickettsia helvetica and in 10 % of the others a novel rickettsia genotype were identified. Additionally, Bartonella henselae (the causative agent of cat scratch disease in humans) was demonstrated in one flea (0. 7 %), and hemoplasmas of the hemofelis group were identified in seven other samples (5. 2 %). The findings of vector-borne agents not detected before in A. erinacei fleas broaden the range of those diseases of veterinary-medical importance, of which hedgehogs {{may play a role in}} the epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|Biological invasions are a serious problem worldwide. Besides {{the natural}} colonizations {{mediated}} by tectonic movements or formation of a land bridge connection, {{there are also}} the artificial ones. Humans can deliberately or undeliberately translocate species across ecosystems. Recently, {{mainly because of the}} buisness and tourism there is a dramatical increase in human-mediated biological invasions. Many authors, who discussed invasions in the past, were focused on rodents. Despite its severe impact on the ecosystems the topic of insectivorous mammals remains relatively untouched by scientists so far. Practical part of this thesis is focused on the <b>Northern</b> white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> (Erinaceus roumanicus) and his dispersal in the Mediterranean area. Mitochondrial control region sequences of 28 samples were analyzed and compared to already published data from GenBank. Discussion was made through phylogenetical analysis. Main topics of discussion were focused on a possible contemporaneity and a course of transfer of the gene flow. Most of the samples showed haplotype similarity with individuals occupying the closest mainland. On the other hand samples from Skyros did not go with the trend. They matched with haplotype from Crete...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{describe}} the spatial distribution of genetic variability of the <b>northern</b> white-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> (E. roumanicus), mainly within the Balkan Peninsula and Central Europe, as these areas are crucial for understanding the effects of Pleistocene climate oscillations on the genetic architecture of the species. Based on this spatial distribution, hypotheses about the possible structuring of the Balkan refugia were formulated. A total of 260 individuals and 9 microsatellite loci {{were used for the}} analysis. Using the approach of landscape and population genetics several possible isolated subpopulations within the area surveyed were identified. Unique status was proved for a population originating from Crete, probably influenced by mechanisms of island evolution. Differences {{from the rest of the}} range were ascertained also in population from the Czech Republic, located in a secondary contact zone with the E. europeaus. The role of interspecific interactions and possible introgression should be considered in this case. In the area of Romania and the area south of the Balkan Peninsula the highest genetic distances between individuals were identified, probably associated with the occurrence of geographical barriers and the possible presence of glacial subrefugia. Other identified [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Between April and November 2009, {{infestation}} by Ixodes hexagonus and I. ricinus ticks on the <b>northern</b> white-breasted <b>hedgehog,</b> Erinaceus roumanicus, {{was investigated}} in urban environments {{of the city of}} Poznań. In total, 49 hedgehogs were trapped, 36 (73. 5 %) of which hosted 1, 519 ixodid ticks, with a mean intensity of 42. 2 ticks per infested animal. The most abundant tick species, I. hexagonus, constituted 67 % (1, 019) of all ticks recorded and infested 71. 4 % of the hosts. I. ricinus accounted for 33 % (500) of all ticks recorded, and was identified on 51 % of the hedgehogs. Mean intensities of ticks were higher for I. hexagonus than for I. ricinus (29. 1 and 20. 0, respectively). The proportion of the two tick species differed by life stage. I. hexagonus larvae (n = 744) strongly dominated over nymphs (n = 204) and females (n = 71). In contrast, similar proportions of three stages of I. ricinus were recorded (168 larvae, 194 nymphs, 138 females). Both tick species parasitizing hedgehogs showed seasonal differences in tick burdens and prevalences. The data obtained in this survey demonstrate that E. roumanicus hedgehogs hosting all developmental stages of Ixodes, contribute to the local amplifying and maintenance of tick populations within urban environments...|$|R
40|$|Although {{hedgehogs}} are well-known {{examples of}} postglacial recolonisation, the specific processes that shape their population structures {{have not been}} examined by detailed sampling and fast-evolving genetic markers in combination with model based clustering methods. This study aims to analyse the impacts of isolation within glacial refugia and of postglacial expansion on the population structure of the <b>Northern</b> White-breasted <b>hedgehog</b> (Erinaceus roumanicus). It also discusses {{the role of the}} processes at edges of species distribution in its evolutionary history. The maternally inherited mitochondrial control region and the bi-parentally inherited nuclear microsatellites were used to examine samples within the Central Europe, Balkan Peninsula and adjacent islands. Bayesian coalescent inference and neutrality tests proposed a recent increase in the population size. The most pronounced pattern of population structure involved differentiation of the insular populations in the Mediterranean Sea and the population within the contact zone with E. europaeus in Central Europe. An interspecies hybrid was detected {{for the first time in}} Central Europe. A low genetic diversity was observed in Crete, while the highest genetic distances among individuals were found in Romania. The recent population in the post-refugial area related to the Balkan Peninsula shows a complex pattern with pronounced subpopulations located mainly in the Pannonian Basin and at the Adriatic and Pontic coasts. Detailed analyses indicate that parapatry and peripatry may not be the only factors that limit range expansion, but also strong microevolutionary forces that may change the genetic structure of the species. Here we present evidence showing that population differentiation may occur not only during the glacial restriction of the range into the refugia, but also during the interglacial range expansion. Population differentiation at the Balkan Peninsula and adjacent regions could be ascribed to diversification in steppe/forest biomes and complicated geomorphology, including pronounced geographic barriers as Carpathians...|$|R
