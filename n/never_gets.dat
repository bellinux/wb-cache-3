5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well. Pam receives good news {{at the end of the}} 1986–1987 season finale: she is finally able to conceive a baby, after confirming that there would be no health risks involved. However, she <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> that chance. While calling her husband to tell him the good news, she is in a massive auto accident where she hits an oil tanker and is severely burned in a subsequent fire. While recovering from her burns, she decides to get away from the Ewings and everyone else, including her son, disappear and divorce Bobby for a second time.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

25|$|While the {{two forms}} of the {{recurrence}} formula are clearly mathematically equivalent, the first subtracts 1 from a number extremely close to 1, leading to an increasingly problematic loss of significant digits. As the recurrence is applied repeatedly, the accuracy improves at first, but then it deteriorates. It <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> better than about 8 digits, even though 53-bit arithmetic should be capable of about 16 digits of precision. When the second form of the recurrence is used, the value converges to 15 digits of precision.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{sought to}} reflect the Rhino's simplistic {{thinking}} style in his voice. He believes [...] "the quintessential 'thug' was played by William Bendix in The Glass Key. The simpler the character, the simpler the thought process. That means Rhino's 'motivation' is never too complicated he's very elemental. He's mad or happy or angry or sad or hungry or whatever. And it <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> beyond his appetites or ego." [...] Brown considers that Bendix's performance perfectly portrayed this type of character.|$|E

500|$|Bowskill {{found the}} mood of the game to be hilarious, and said that the game <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> stale; he {{attributed}} this to the diversity of the game's characters. Gouskos called the game's characters cohesive, over-the-top, and quirky. Harris called the story interesting and well written, citing the characters, situations, and dialogue. Cole was impressed by the mysteries and their resolutions, calling them [...] "novel, unpredictable and plausible". He also appreciated the character development arcs through the game, which he felt provided pacing and made the cases cohesive. He called the English localization [...] "top-notch", and appreciated its humor.|$|E
