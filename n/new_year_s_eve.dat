40|$|Dubrovački vlastelin Mato Franov Zamagna (1800 - 1870), još kao sedamnaestogodišnjak pisao je kolende. Riječ je o šaljivim pjesmama koje je s družinom pjevao o blagdanima (uoči Sv. Mihajla, Sv. Martina, Sv. Andrije, Sv. Tome, Sv. Šimuna i Jude, Sv. Frana, Sv. Nikole, na Badnju večer i na Staru godinu), namjenjujući ih najbližim srodnicima, prijateljima i stanovnicima Rijeke dubrovačke. Njegove kolende daleko su od poetske i versifikacijske razine “poe zi je predaka”, a u obilju prigodničarske poezije 19. stoljeća izdvajaju se sač uvanim etnografskim sadržajima, osobito običaja kolendavanja među pukom i vlastelom. Mato Zamagna (1800 - 1870), nobleman of Ragusa, {{wrote his}} first kolende {{at the age}} of seventeen. These {{traditional}} carols he sang accompanied by other singers to mark the eve of various feasts, such as Michaelmas, St. Martin 2 ̆ 7 s Day, but also of St. Andrew, St. Thomas, St. Simon and Judas, St. Francis, St. Nicholas, Mother 2 ̆ 7 s and Father 2 ̆ 7 s Days in Advent, Christmas Eve and <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Eve,</b> dedicated to the next of kin, friends and inhabitants of Rijeka dubrovačka, and compiled in the collection Kolende od godisctaa 1817., 1818., 1819. u Riezi. Zamagna 2 ̆ 7 s kolende were written {{after the fall of the}} Dubrovnik Republic, when jocular verse was primarily an expression of idleness, and as such are far from the poetic and metric achievements of the 2 ̆ 7 poetry of the ancestors 2 ̆ 7. Yet in the wealth of nineteenth-century occasional verse, Zamagna 2 ̆ 7 s poetry is valuable for its ethnographic descriptions which, from the ethnological, folklore and anthropological aspect, provide an insight into the broader kolende tradition, culture and popular customs upheld by both nobles and non-nobles, some of which, especially the tradition of singing kolende on Christmas Eve and <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Eve,</b> have survived to the present day. The verses of kolende have confirmed the continuous process of the interplay between 2 ̆ 7 high and low 2 ̆ 7 culture—that is, between the customs of the urban and rural, noble and popular traditional heritage. It is noteworthy that the found collection compiles and saves from oblivion the repertoires of kolende that were composed to serve a single occasion and were rarely preserved by the authors. The manuscript collection Kolende od godisctaa 1817., 1818., 1819. u Riezi contains 25 kolende and a prose piece entitled Testamenat jednogha Subatza, donesen i prolegan na tarpesi u G.

New times demand new paradigms; it is much more than a calendar change that occasions a reconsideration of the status and meaning of environmental law.

Indeed, the word “industry” itself [...] which for two centuries raised in the mind images of soot, grime, excessive noise, and harmful vibrations [...] today has a connotation that is much cleaner and friendlier to human and nonhuman nature. Moreover, the command-and-control provisions of American environmental law have yielded the battlefield to kinder and gentler, incentive-based regulation. New paradigms demand new slogans, particularly in a polity driven and shaped by sound bites.
