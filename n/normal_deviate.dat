This study designed a 2 -equation simultaneous system with a specified covariance matrix and examined the correlation between the pairs of <b>normal</b> <b>deviates</b> generated and the implied covariance matrix. The result showed that the random disturbances generated from <b>normal</b> <b>deviates</b> with feeble correlation coefficient (negative or positive) reproduced the specified variance-covariance matrix while others failed.

50|$|In the {{computer}} generation of a pseudorandom number sequence, the aim {{may be to}} generate random numbers having a normal distribution: these {{can be obtained from}} standard <b>normal</b> <b>deviates</b> (themselves the output of a pseudorandom number sequence) by multiplying by the scale parameter and adding the location parameter. More generally, the generation of pseudorandom number sequence having other marginal distributions may involve manipulating sequences of standard normal deviates: an example here is the chi-squared distribution, random values of which can be obtained by adding the squares of standard <b>normal</b> <b>deviates</b> (although this would seldom be the fastest method of generating such values).|$|R
