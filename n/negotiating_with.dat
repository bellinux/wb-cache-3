5|$|Although {{there was}} talk of making a film about the Maharishi in {{co-operation}} with Apple Films, it was discovered that he was independently <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> ABC in the US to create a TV special featuring the band. Two visits by business manager Peter Brown to the Maharishi—who was lecturing in Malmö, Sweden—and one by Harrison and McCartney, failed to stop him proclaiming that he could deliver the band for a TV show.|$|E
5|$|DeGeneres began <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When {{word of the}} {{negotiations}} got out, DeGeneres found herself {{at the center of}} intense speculation about when she or her character, or both, would come out. With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E

Although Sveinke reduced piracy in Viken, he was forced into exile for three years after <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> Magnus' men. Since piracy increased soon after Sveinke's departure (possibly encouraged by Sveinke himself), Magnus met him in the Danish province of Halland to request his return to Norway. They reconciled; Sveinke became a loyal supporter of Magnus, now the undisputed king of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Michael began <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> the Emperor {{over his}} {{official}} position in Transylvania. The latter wanted the principality under direct Imperial rule with Michael acting as governor. The Wallachian voivode, {{on the other}} hand, wanted the title of Prince of Transylvania for himself and equally claimed the Partium region. Michael was, nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.|$|E

This further encouraged the committee, after the invasion of Hungary, to try <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> the SS.|$|E

5|$|While the Beatles were there, the Maharishi was <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> the Indian {{government}} {{to use some}} nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane {{which he had been}} given; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to as they had been denied the use of the land for farming.

5|$|A {{country that}} had been {{reported}} to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35, the country was <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{whether a}} {{government}} party always prefers to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> another compact party {{rather than with}} many different parties in a legislature. We claim that the interaction between ideological polarization and number of parties {{plays an important role}} in this decision. We start by modeling two types of legislatures: The 2 -parties legislature, in which the government party <b>negotiates</b> <b>with</b> another compact party; and the m+ 1 -parties legislature, in which it <b>negotiates</b> <b>with</b> m> 2 parties. Parties negotiate on both a public (ideological) and a distributive (private) policy. Our main result shows that the government party does not always prefer to negotiate in a bilateral situation. If the level of ideological polarization in the 2 -parties legislature is high enough, it prefers to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> m less polarized parties. We also find that if there are two legislatures with the same number of parties, the government party prefers to <b>negotiate</b> in that <b>with</b> the smallest level of ideological polarization. number of parties, bargaining, legislature...|$|R

5|$|After the war, Nasser {{returned}} to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent {{as a member of}} the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> the Arabs in March.|$|E

The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E
