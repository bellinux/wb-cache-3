40|$|The {{separation}} of tantalum and niobium compounds {{has been of}} interest for many years, with few new developments. Classically separation is achieved by liquid–liquid extraction and most research focuses on optimising this process. A separation method that bypasses the need for liquid–liquid extraction is reported here. The process uses dry fluorination to convert tantalum and <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxides</b> into metal oxyfluorides. The thermal behaviour of these species is sufficiently different for separation to be achieved by preferential volatilisation.

50|$|Antimony pentoxide has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the B form of <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and {{can be derived from}} the rutile structure, with antimony coordinated by six oxygens in a distorted octahedral arrangement. The SbO6 octahedra are corner- and edge-sharing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Nb2O5. It is a colourless insoluble solid that is fairly unreactive. It {{is the main}} precursor to all materials made of niobium, the dominant application being alloys, but other specialized applications include capacitors, lithium niobate, and optical glasses.|$|E
50|$|In the laboratory, niobium pentachloride {{is often}} {{prepared}} from Nb2O5, {{the main problem}} being incomplete reaction to give the oxyhalides.

50|$|A niobium {{electrolytic}} capacitor is a polarized capacitor whose anode electrode (+) {{is made of}} passivated niobium metal or niobium monoxide on which an insulating <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> layer acts as the dielectric of the niobium capacitor.

50|$|A rare {{failure in}} solid {{electrolytic}} capacitors is {{breakdown of the}} dielectric caused by faults or impurities. In niobium electrolytic capacitors the dielectric is <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Nb2O5). Besides this pentoxide there is an additional niobium suboxide, niobium dioxde (NbO2). The NbO2 is a semi-conducting material with a higher conductivity than Nb2O5 but much lower than a short. In case of faults or impurities in the dielectric which evokes a partial dielectric breakdown the conducting channel. would be effectively isolated by oxidation of Nb2O5 into high ohmic NbO2 if energy is limited.|$|E
50|$|Nanoparticles of {{lithium niobate}} and <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> can be {{produced}} at low temperature. The complete protocol implies a LiH induced reduction of NbCl5 followed by in situ spontaneous oxidation into low-valence niobium nano-oxides. These niobium oxides are exposed to air atmosphere resulting in pure Nb2O5. Finally, the stable Nb2O5 is converted into lithium niobate LiNbO3 nanoparticles during the controlled hydrolysis of the LiH excess. Spherical nanoparticles of lithium niobate with a diameter of approximately 10 nm can be prepared by impregnating a mesoporous silica matrix {{with a mixture of}} an aqueous solution of LiNO3 and NH4NbO(C2O4)2 followed by 10 min heating in an IR furnace.|$|E
5000|$|Ferroniobium is an {{important}} iron niobium alloy, with a niobium content of 60-70%. It is the main source for niobium alloying of HSLA steel and covers more than 80% of the worldwide niobium production. The niobium is mined from pyrochlore deposits and is subsequently transformed into the <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> Nb2O5. This oxide is mixed with iron oxide and aluminium and is reduced in an aluminothermic reaction to niobium and iron. The component metals can be purified in an electron beam furnace or the alloy {{can be used as}} it is. For alloying with steel the ferroniobium is added to molten steel before casting.

50|$|Niobium {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{can be made}} with high purity niobium as the anode but the diffusion of oxygen from the dielectric (Nb2O5) into the niobium anode metal is very high, resulting in leakage current instability or even capacitor failures. There are two possible ways to reduce oxygen diffusion and improve leakage current stability - either by doping metallic niobium powders with nitride into passivated niobium nitride or using niobium oxide (NbO) as anode material. Niobium oxide is a hard ceramic material characterized by high metallic conductivity. Niobium oxide powder can be prepared in a similar structure to that of tantalum powder and can be processed in a similar way to produce capacitors. It also can be oxidized by anodic oxidation (anodizing, forming) to generate the insulating dielectric layer. Thus two types of niobium {{electrolytic capacitors}} are marketed, those using a passivated niobium anode and those using a niobium oxide anode. Both types use <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Nb2O5) as the dielectric layer.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to asses in vitro the {{potential}} of methacrylate-based adhesive resins containing <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Nb 2 O 5) for stimulating phosphate deposition. Adhesive resins were obtained by mixing 50  wt% BisGMA, 25  wt% TEGDMA and 25  wt% HEMA, and Nb 2 O 5 was added on 2.5 or 5  wt% to the resin. Discs 6.5  mm in diameter and 1.5  mm in height of the resin without Nb 2 O 5 and of the resins presenting the oxide were obtained by inserting the resin into a silicon matrix, followed by photo activation. Discs were immersed in simulated body fluid at 36 °C for 1, 7 and 28  days, and then their surfaces were examined by Raman spectroscopy. Changes of intensity of the 962  cm− 1 peak, related to phosphate bond, over the samples’ surfaces were used to assess the potential of adhesive resins to stimulate phosphate deposition. Experimental groups containing 2.5 and 5  wt% <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> presented a phosphate-rich layer deposition over their surfaces after 7 and 28  days of SBF immersion, and this deposition increased over time. Incorporation of 2.5 or 5  wt% <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> provides the potential to promote phosphate deposition on methacrylate-based adhesive resins.|$|E
40|$|The carbothermic {{reduction}} of pyrochlore and <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> was studied, {{with and without}} the addition of iron as a solvent, in an argon transferred-arc plasma with a single stationary pellet reactor system.

The experimental results confirmed {{the applicability of the}} model. The carbothermic {{reduction of}} pyrochlore and <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> were studied in the temperature range 1530 - 2440 and 1625 - 2855 K, respectively. The rate was independent of particle size but was influenced by the separation between the oxide and carbon particles. The rate was lower than the model predictions above a certain conversion, the level of which increased with temperature and carbon concentration. The carbothermic reduction of pyrochlore and <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> with iron addition were studied in the temperature range 1430 - 2125 and 1575 - 2440 K, respectively. The rates were independent of particle size but was enhanced by the presence of iron. Deviation from the model was observed to be less at high conversion levels. Preliminary investigation of the conversion rate for the carbothermic reduction of a pyrochlore and ferric oxide mixture was done to simulate the type of reactants that would be used in a commercial process. The rate was improved by the addition of iron oxide...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} surpass this problem, one option {{would be to}} develop an {{adhesive}} system that would induce the release of ions {{with the goal of}} filling this exposed collagen fiber region with mineral formation [7]–[11]. <b>Niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Nb 2 O 5) has shown mineralization induction through mineral deposition in previous studies [12]–[14], demonstrating promising proprieties. Nb 2 O 5 was also evaluated as a filler for adhesive resins and methacrylate-based endodontic cements and enhances the Knoop microhardness and radiopacity of these materials [15],[16]. Besides, Nb 2 O 5 presents the ability to diffuse into the hybrid layer when inserted into an adhesive resin applied following the etching and primer application in a 3 -step etch-and-rinse adhesive system [16].

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{adhesive}} resin with incorporation of <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and evaluate its properties. MethodsNiobium pentoxide was characterised by X-ray diffraction, surface area, particle size, micro-Raman, scanning electron microscopy and the effectiveness of silanisation process by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). An experimental adhesive resin was formulated with 0, 5, 10 and 20 wt% Nb 2 O 5. The formulated adhesive resins were evaluated based on microhardness, degree of conversion, radiopacity and interface (resin/dentine) characterisation by micro-Raman. ResultsThe particles used in this study presented a monoclinic crystalline phase with typical chemical groups and micrometre mean size. Microhardness and radiopacity increased with higher amounts of Nb 2 O 5, and the particles were able to penetrate into the hybrid layers. ConclusionsTherefore, Nb 2 O 5 may be an alternative for polymer-based biomaterials.

40|$|A {{control system}} for {{stabilizing}} the reactive magnetron-sputter process is applied {{that is based}} on a combination of a short-term stabilization of the plasma and a long-term stabilization employing an in situ spectroscopic ellipsometer. For the formation of <b>niobium</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> a measurement of the reactive gas partial pressure with a lambda -probe measurement was employed.
