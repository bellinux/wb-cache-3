500|$|Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy {{was brought}} in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an {{interest}} for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in [...] "he-men roles – rough, tough and realistic". Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste (1939), he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty (1940) and The Glass Key (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass his career was in decline, however. Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass {{is very different from}} that of Reginald Tate in the television version and was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind”. Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, [...] "Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality". By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that [...] "Brian was all right, <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> once you kept him sober". He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, Quatermass and the Pit (1967).|$|E

The best algorithms use only integers of size O(n) to generate binary trees on n nodes. 1 Introduction Binary trees are essential in various branches of computer science [7]. In time to time, {{there is a}} need to generate random binary trees. For example, when writing a program to manipulate binary trees, it is advantageous to have an efficient method to genarate random binary trees with some fixed number n of nodes in order to test the program. Mathematically, there are <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in generating random binary trees. Namely, there exist algorithms to enumerate binary trees. Simply choose a random natural number i from the interval [1 ::B n], where the nth Catalan number B n = / 2 n n ! 1 n + 1 (1) gives the number of binary trees with n nodes, and output the ith binary tree from the enumeration. Computationally the problem is more complicated. As Martin a [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Hesitation (break in tempo) during bidding and play. Players are {{supposed}} to make their bids and plays in a tempo as even as possible; an experienced player will often make a slight pause even when there is <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> {{in order to maintain}} the same tempo if a problem occurs. However, when a player has a bidding or play problem, his hesitation often tells much about his holding. For example, a long contemplation over a double of opponents' contract indicates uncertainty whether the contract would be beaten, and [...] "invites" [...] the partner to bid on ("pull the double") without defensive values; a hesitation which card to play when the declarer plays towards dummy's king suggests possession of an ace, etc.|$|E

In other words, the mark puts down money on the right card, at which point a shill will immediately place a double bet on top of the card, thereby winning the [...] "right" [...] to play that round. Of course, if the mark picks the wrong card, the dealer takes the bid and the money. The dealer will never accept a winning bid from a mark.|$|E
50|$|Statistics {{and popular}} {{representations}} of the elderly portray them as digital immigrants. For example, Canada in 2010 found that 29% of its citizens 75 {{years of age and}} older, and 60% of its citizens between the ages of 65-74 had browsed the internet in the past month. Conversely, internet activity reached almost 100% among its 15 through 24-year-old citizens. Eugene Loos identifies the most common assumptions about digital technologies and the elderly, all of which contribute to portray them as digital immigrants and to perpetuate digital ageism. Senior citizens may be regarded as a homogenous group, however, this group does not want or is not able to make use of digital information sources.

50|$|There are two {{different}} types of vaccine for Polio. One is an inactivated form of the virus (IPV) which is given as a shot. This is the only form that is used in the United States. The other form is given orally (OPV) and is used all over the world. OPV has a risk of causing vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) which occurred in one child out of every 2.4 million. But it does have advantages over IPV in that it provides intestinal immunity and provides secondary spread of the vaccine to unprotected people that come in contact with the vaccinated person. A person is considered to be fully immunized if they have received a primary series of at least three doses of IPV, OPV, or four doses of any combination of IPV and OPV. These doses are given at 2, and 4 months of age, again between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster is given between 4 and 6 years. Some people who get IPV may have soreness at the injection site, but the vaccine as it is today is not known to cause any serious problems and most people have <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R
