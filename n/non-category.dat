5000|$|Studies {{have found}} that women have a non-category-specific genital {{response}} pattern of sexual arousal, meaning their genital responses are only modestly related to their preferred category. On the other hand, female subjective responses are category-specific, because they typically report their highest level of arousal to their preferred stimulus, although the reported difference in levels of arousal is typically much smaller than those in men. A {{possible explanation for the}} <b>non-category</b> specific genital arousal in women, which also accounts for their high individual variation, is the [...] "preparation hypothesis". This hypothesis suggests that, provided there is enough of an increase in vaginal blood flow for vaginal lubrication to occur in a sexual context, the magnitude of arousal need not be consistent. That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is non-consensual.|$|E
50|$|Most work {{on animal}} {{concepts}} {{has been done}} with visual stimuli, which can easily be constructed and presented in great variety, but auditory and other stimuli {{have been used as}} well. Pigeons have been widely used, for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets; other birds {{and a number of other}} animals have been studied as well.In a typical experiment, a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one, and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for <b>non-category</b> items. Alternatively, a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures. Many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before; successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus-response associations. A related method, sometimes used to study relational concepts, is matching-to-sample. In this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives, one of which is the same as the first; the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{comparative}} study of two frequently used methods for prediction and classification in data mining. These methods are decision trees and neural networks. Decision trees with J 48 and ID 3 algorithms are used to solve common classification problems where the data sets have several <b>non-category</b> attributes and one category attribute. In this case we need to predict category attribute which depends on the others. Neural networks have wide utilization including function approximation, data processing, prediction, classification etc. Technical neural networks offer profoundly different approach to solve problems in comparison with other methods.

As models of the form for P a poset resemble the Kripke models familiar from intuitionistic logic, they are relatively easy for <b>non-category</b> theorists to understand.

40|$|Note:Bilinguals' free {{recall of}} unilingual lists {{in each of}} their two {{languages}} and of bilingual lists was investigated. Previous research had suggested that differences between the stronger and weaker language of a bilingual are revealed {{when he has to}} process words that form logical categories but not when he is presented <b>non-category</b> lists of words to recall. The results of this study confirmed this hypothesis. The recall of category lists was further investigated by isolating the steps bilinguals take in detecting the nature of the categories and in reshuffling the words into their categories. Aid in detecting the categories did not improve performance significantly whereas presenting the words grouped by eategories did. However blocking the lists in this fashion improved recall in all three language conditions by the same amount. Therefore, it was argued that the inferior recall of category lists in a weaker language was not due to greater difficulty in reshuffling the words during list presentation, but rather to problems involved in decoding the words...|$|E
40|$|Abstract What effect does {{labeling}} {{an object}} {{as a member}} of a familiar category have on memory for that object? Recent studies suggest that recognition memory can be negatively impacted by categorizing objects during encoding. This paper examines the ‘‘representational shift hypothesis’ ’ which argues that categorizing an object impairs recognition memory by altering the trace of the encoded memory to be more similar to the category prototype. Previous evidence for this idea comes from experiments in which a basic-level category labeling task was compared to a <b>non-category</b> labeling incidental encoding task, usually a preference judgment (e. g., ‘‘Do you like this item?’’). In two experiments, we examine alternative tasks that attempt to control for processing demands and the degree to which category information is explicitly recruited at the time of study. Contrary to the predictions of the representational shift hypothesis, we find no evidence that memory is selectively impaired by category labeling. Overall, the pattern of results across both studies appears consistent with well-established variables known to influence memory such as encoding specificity and distinctiveness effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a key bottleneck {{in the use}} of the 3 D medial axis (MA) representation, namely, how the complex MA structure can be regularized so that similar, withincategory 3 D shapes yield similar 3 D MA that are distinct from the <b>non-category</b> shapes. We rely on previous work which (i) constructs a hierarchical MA hypergraph, the medial scaffold (MS), and (ii) the theoretical classification of the instabilities of this structure, or transitions (sudden topological changes due to a small perturbation). The shapes at transition point are degenerate. Our approach is to recognize the transitions which are close-by to a given shape and transform the shape to this transition point, and repeat until no close-by transitions exists. This move towards degeneracy is the basis of simplification of shape. We derive 11 transforms from 7 transitions and follow a greedy scheme in applying the transform. The results show that the simplified MA preserves with-in-category similarity, thus indicating its potential use in various applications including shape analysis, manipulation, and matching. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: So far 11 therapy {{studies have}} been {{reported}} which aimed to re-teach semantic knowledge in brain-damaged patients presenting with a semantic deficit consecutive to stroke, herpes encephalitis, or semantic dementia. All these semantic therapy studies but one recorded a significant improvement in the patients' performance on tasks requiring semantic processing. The exception to this pattern was the semantic therapy study by Sartori, Miozzo, and Job (1994), which yielded negative results. Because the study concerned two patients with anterograde amnesia associated with the semantic deficit, Sartori et at. concluded that reacquiring semantic knowledge was not possible when such association of deficits was present. Aims: Sartori et al. 's study, {{like all the other}} semantic therapy studies, applied an errorful learning procedure during the therapy. However, the question can be raised of whether such procedure is appropriate when amnesia is associated with the semantic deficit. Because error elimination is likely a function of explicit memory, which is impaired in amnesic patients, wrong stimulus-response associations would be repeatedly retrieved and strengthened in (spared) implicit memory, thus preventing the patient from learning novel semantic knowledge. In the present single-case study we addressed this issue by using an errorless learning procedure during semantic therapy in a post-encephalitis patient (DL) who suffered both a semantic deficit and anterograde amnesia. Methods & Procedures: The therapy aimed at re-teaching semantic attributes of 16 items. The design included, further to these 16 target items, 16 contrast and 16 control items, which were semantic coordinates of the target items. Both shared (category) and distinctive (<b>non-category)</b> attributes were included in the learning set. Learning was based on an attribute classification task in which the properties of the target items had to be contrasted with those of coordinate items, within a paradigm that greatly reduced the chance of making errors. A pre- and post-therapy picture naming and an attribute verification task allowed us to assess the therapy effects at the end of therapy and 1 year later. Outcomes & Results: Significant therapy effects were observed in the attribute verification task and were still present 1 year afterwards. Thus, the patient's performance significantly improved for the category (i. e., shared) attributes of the target, contrast, and control items, and for the <b>non-category</b> (i. e., distinctive) attributes of the target items. Conclusions: This finding showed that, contrary to Sartori et al. 's claim, re-acquiring semantic knowledge was possible in a patient with anterograde amnesia associated with her semantic deficit...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{tendency}} to buy store brand is category specific, or an enduring consumer trait. We develop a multicategory brand-choice model with a factor-analytic structure on the covariance matrix of the coefficients. The methodology allows us to elicit the basic latent tendency for a household to buy store brands, while controlling for other causes such as price sensitivity. The model is applied {{to a set of}} ten food and nonfood product categories. We find strong evidence of correlations in household preferences for store brands across categories. Using a two-dimensional factor structure, we find that one of the factors explains a substantial amount of variation in store-brand preference, while the other factor explains price sensitivity—. The presence of these factors in all categories indicates that there are unobservable household-level traits that are <b>non-category</b> specific, i. e., stable across product categories. Using data from five holdout categories, we find that household estimates of these latent factors are very useful in predicting demand for store brands in new categories. Other potential applications for store managers are discussed. store brands, multicategory choice models, heterogeneity, frequent-shopper data...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the report by Anne Tomiche on the frequent overlap between comparative literature and European literature, this paper aims {{to deal with some}} of the questions asked by Tomiche without any claim to reach definitive answers, but rather to highlight new questions and new considerations about the role of comparative literature today. Essential to the achievement of a "new humanism", as a compass needed to guide us in a concert of discordant voices, in a time when new frontiers are being established, comparative literature at this time requires an epistemological shift. In contrast to the universalist ideology, the role of the comparatist must now be reconsidered on an ethical level, aimed at overcoming certain forms of exclusion and marginalization that too often the concept of culture generates. The comparative literature, should be understood as a <b>non-category</b> literature, a literature of expatriation, landless, that refuses language barriers and/or cultural borders, open to all literatures of the world, in a constant exchange that can lead {{to the creation of a}} comprehensive system of interactions, which must not be identified with a theory, but should opt for a space, a desert where the theoretical reflection becomes objective and universalizes in differentiation. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a series of}} recognition experiments that assessed whether visual short-term memory (VSTM) is sensitive to shared category membership of to-be-remembered (tbr) images of common objects. In Experiment 1 some of the tbr items shared the same basic level category (e. g., hand axe) : Such items were no better retained than others. In the remaining experiments, displays contained different images of items from the same higher-level category (e. g., food: a bagel, a sandwich, a pizza). Evidence from the later experiments did suggest that participants were sensitive to the categorical relations present in the displays. However, when separate measures of sensitivity and bias were computed, the data revealed no effects on sensitivity, but a greater tendency to respond positively to <b>non-category</b> items relative to items from the depicted category. Across all experiments, {{there was no evidence that}} items from a common category were better remembered than unique items. Previous work has shown that principles of perceptual organization do affect the storage and maintenance of tbr items. The present work shows that there are no corresponding conceptual principles of organization in VSTM. It is concluded that the sort of VSTM tapped by single probe recognition methods is pre-categorical in nature...|$|E

Department of Energy (DOE) {{announced}} its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) on {{the disposition of}} the nations weapon-usable surplus plutonium. This EIS is tiered from the Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Material Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement issued in December 1996,and the associated Record of Decision issued on January, 1997. The EIS will examine reasonable alternatives and potential environmental impacts for the proposed siting, construction, and operation of three types of facilities for plutonium disposition. The three types of facilities are: a pit disassembly and conversion facility, a facility to immobilize surplus plutonium in a glass or ceramic form for disposition, and a facility to fabricate plutonium oxide into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel.

Machine learning techniques are the current methods to model patterns of static features and dynamic behaviors of Android malware. Whereas the accuracy rates of the classifiers increase with increasing {{the quality of the}} features, we relate between the apps 2 ̆ 7 features and the features that are needed to deliver the category 2 ̆ 7 s functionality. Differently, our classification approach defines legitimate static features for benign apps under a specific category as opposite to identifying malicious patterns. We utilize the features of the top rated apps in a specific category to learn a malware detection classifier for the given category. Android apps stores organize apps into different categories; For example, Google play store organizes apps into 26 categories such as: Health and Fitness, News and Magazine, Music and Audio, etc. Each category has its distinct functionality which means the apps under a specific category are similar in their static and dynamic features. In general, benign apps under a certain category tend to share a common set of features. On the contrary, malicious apps tend to request abnormal features, less or more than what are common for the category that they belong to. This study proposes category-based machine learning classifiers to enhance the performance of classification models at detecting malicious apps under a certain category.

We identified 145 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB (cases) and 145 patients with drug-sensitive pulmonary TB (controls). Multivariate analysis identified the independent risk factors for MDR-TB as follows: (1) ≥ 2 episodes of prior pulmonary TB (odds ratio [OR] 39. 72, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 7. 86 - 200. 66), (2) duration of illness > 60 days (OR 3. 08, 95 % CI 1. 52 - 6. 22), (3) sputum acid fast bacilli smear 3 + (OR 13. 09, 95 % CI 4. 64 - 36. 91), (4) presence of lung cavities (OR 3. 82, 95 % CI 1. 89 - 7. 73), and (5) presence of pleural effusion (OR 2. 75, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 7. 16). Prior pulmonary TB management with a <b>non-category</b> I regimen (P = 0. 012) and having treatment failure or default as treatment outcomes (P = 0. 036) were observed in a higher proportion among patients with MDR-TB. Particular characteristics of lung cavities, including the maximum diameter ≥ 30 mm (P < 0. 001), the number of cavities ≥ 3 (P = 0. 001), bilateral involvement (P < 0. 001), and ≥ 2 lung zones involved (P = 0. 001) were more commonly observed in patients with MDR-TB. In conclusion, these clinical factors and chest radiographic findings associated with MDR-TB among patients with pulmonary TB may help physicians to provide proper management of cases for prevention of the development and spread of MDR-TB in future...|$|E
40|$|The Biosemantics group (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam) {{participated in}} the text {{categorization}} task of the Genomics Track. We followed a thesaurus-based approach, using the Collexis indexing system, in combination with a simple classification algorithm to assign a document {{to one of the}} four categories. Our thesaurus consisted of a combination of MeSH, Gene Ontology, and a thesaurus with gene and protein symbols and names extracted from the Mouse Genome Database, Swiss-Prot and Entrez Gene. To increase the coverage of the gene thesaurus, several rewrite rules were applied to take possible spelling variations into account. Each document in the training set was indexed and the found concepts were ranked on term frequency, resulting in one concept vector per document. No particular care was taken to resolve ambiguous terms. For each of the four categories, two average concept vectors were computed, one by averaging the concept vectors of the documents in that category and the other by averaging all remaining concept vectors. The latter vector was then subtracted from the first, yielding a final category concept vector. The subtraction served to emphasize distinguishing concepts: high-ranked concepts in the final concept vector should, on average, occur relatively frequently in documents belonging to the category, while occurring infrequently or not at all in documents not belonging to the category. For all documents in the training set, a matching score between the concept vector of a document and each of the category concept vectors was computed. A score threshold to discriminate between category and <b>non-category</b> documents was then determined per category by optimizing the performance measure (normalized utility). Different matching algorithms and different cutoffs for the number of concepts in the category vectors were evaluated. A standard cosine similarity score and a category vector with the 40 highest-ranking concepts proved to perform best on the training set. These settings and the score thresholds were subsequently used to categorize all documents in the test set. Two runs were submitted: one based on the full text without any special treatment of particular sections, and one based on the Medline abstract, including the title and the MeSH headings. In addition two runs were submitted by TNO for the ad-hoc search task.

It was almost 50 % before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy in the last decade, and was still at 28 % in 2008, despite expanding access to antiretroviral therapy. Reviewing the causes of death may lead to further understanding of the timeline and natural history of TB-HIV coinfection, {{and in so doing}} help to devise an effective prevention strategy in Chiang Rai. In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution of confirmed causes of death in patients coinfected with TB and HIV in Chiang Rai, describe the causes of such deaths along the timeline of TB treatment, and identify predictors of each cause of death. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the causes of death for 331 patients who died of TB-HIV coinfection at Chiang Rai Prachanukroh Hospital from 2005 to 2008. Causes of death were confirmed by reviewing medical records, vital registration, and the TB register in the province, as well as obtaining reconfirmation by two experienced HIV physicians. Results: The confirmed causes of death were TB (39 %), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related opportunistic infections other than TB (AOI) (29 %), and other systemic diseases which were neither TB nor AIDS-related opportunistic infections (nonTB-nonAOI) (16 %). The definitive cause could not be confirmed in the remaining 16 % of deaths. After starting the TB treatment, deaths caused by TB occurred earlier compared with deaths caused by AOI, which occurred steadily throughout the course of TB treatment, whilst deaths caused by non-TB-nonAOI increased gradually in later months. Further analysis by multivariate multinomial regression analysis showed that deaths in the first month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4. 64, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 49 &ndash; 8. 63), CD 4 count &ge; 200 cells/mm 3 (aOR 5. 33, CI 1. 05 &ndash; 26. 10), <b>non-category</b> 1 TB treatment regimens (aOR 5. 23, CI 1. 04 &ndash; 9. 77), and TB meningitis (aOR 3. 27, CI 1. 37 &ndash; 7. 82) were significant predictors of confirmed TB deaths. Moreover, age over 45 years (aOR 3, CI 1. 32 &ndash; 6. 84) and admission as an inpatient were predictors of death caused by neither TB nor AIDS-related opportunistic infections (aOR 3. 08, CI 1. 39 &ndash; 6. 80). Additional analysis showed that non-Thai patients (aOR 0. 35, CI 0. 12 &ndash; 0. 99), those with an unknown CD 4 count at TB diagnosis (aOR 0. 16, CI 0. 08 &ndash; 0. 33), and those without an HIV diagnosis before TB treatment (aOR 0. 32, CI 0. 18 &ndash; 0. 59) were less able to access antiretroviral therapy.
