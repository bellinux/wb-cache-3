40|$|AbstractBecause {{unpleasant}} hospital odors {{affect the}} nursing environment, we investigated nurses' {{perceptions of the}} odors of various hospital settings: hospital rooms, <b>nurse</b> <b>stations,</b> and human waste disposal rooms to discard the urine, stools and diapers. A questionnaire based on the Japanese Ministry of the Environment's guidelines on odor index regulation {{was used to assess}} nurses' perceptions of odor intensity, comfort, tolerability, and description in the aforementioned settings. Questionnaires were distributed to nursing department directors at three Japanese hospitals, who then disseminated the questionnaires to nursing staff. Of the 1, 151 questionnaires distributed, 496 nurses participated. Human waste disposal rooms had greater odor intensity and were perceived as more uncomfortable than the other settings. Unpleasant odors in disposal rooms, hospital rooms, and <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> were rated as slightly intolerable in comparison. Hospital and disposal rooms were mainly described as having a “pungent odor such as of urine and stool. ” In contrast, <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> were described as having other unpleasant odors, such as chemical, human-body-related, or sewage-like odors. Given that nurses spend much of their time in hospital rooms and <b>nurse</b> <b>stations,</b> odor management in these two settings would likely improve nurses' working conditions at hospitals. Improving odors at <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> is feasible. Such improvements could have indirect effects on nurse turnover and burnout...|$|R

40|$|Heparin {{administration}} errors {{can have}} severe consequences for patients. Despite a previous attempt to standardize the heparin administration process {{through the use}} of a computerized protocol at a large Midwestern hospital, errors still occurred at unacceptably high rates. A Heparin Error Reduction Workgroup (HERW) —consisting of staff nurses, pharmacists, and a cardiologist—was convened in 2002 to address the issue. The HERW asked human factors consultants to conduct a human factors process analysis of the nursing staff’s heparin administration procedures. The consultants observed the work process involving heparin administration in several <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> and conducted interview sessions with (1) the physician and pharmacist who developed the heparin protocols; (2) staff pharmacists; (3) nursing administrators; (4) nurse educators; and (5) nurses from cardiovascular <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> where heparin is administered extensively, and medical/surgical <b>nursing</b> <b>stations</b> where it is used less frequently.

40|$|Objectives: To {{conduct an}} {{assessment}} of sound, dB(A) levels, in two areas of the hospital: patient rooms and <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> using sound meters (SMs). Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends sound levels of 35 dB(A) {{during the day and}} 30 dB(A) during the night; however, many hospitals exceed these recommended levels. Assessing post-occupancy sound levels enables hospital administrators and healthcare workers to identify whether inter-ventions to improve sound levels are needed. Methods: Sound assessments were conducted at three healthcare facilities in both patient rooms and <b>nursing</b> <b>stations,</b> and we include information on facility characteristics. An Amprobe SM- 20 A Sound Level Meter was placed for a 24 -hr period and recorded decibel levels every 8 min. These sound levels were averaged for each hour for reporting purposes. Averages as well as highest and lowest readings are reported for both daytime (8 a. m. – 10 p. m.) and nighttime (10 p. m. – 8 a. m.) for each facility. Results: All three sites are considered urban and are classified with the highest complexity level (1 a). Average daytime measurements for patient rooms and their corresponding <b>nurses</b> <b>stations</b> were as follows: Site A— 63 dB(A) / 56 dB(A), Site B— 52 dB(A) / 55 dB(A), and Site C— 42 dB(A) / 59 dB(A).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the actual conditions of patients with pressure ulcer in Toyama Prefecture, we conducted a questionnaire survey of 28 institutions (general hospitals, combined convalescent and assisted care hospitals, geriatric health service facilities, visiting <b>nurse</b> <b>stations).</b> The results show the prevalences were general hospitals 2. 7 ％, convalescent / Assisted care hospitals 4. 9 ％, geriatric health service facilities 3. 2 ％, visiting <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> 5. 0 ％, and, the background of the patient, such as age or daily activities, was reflected in the characteristic of each institution. There was comparatively frequent use of urethane mattresss in all institutions, which was inappropriate {{in the case of a}} pressure ulcer. We perform risk assessment, and found that it is necessary expeditiously implement pressure ulcer prevention according to the characteristics of each institution and by changing overall condition of the patient. Visiting <b>nurse</b> <b>stations</b> saw 86. 7 ％ of patients with pressure ulcer in their homes. Therefore, pressure ulcer prevention at home is important, and can be achieved by arousing awareness in the home caregiver, and introducing services to empower and support the caregiver. 褥瘡患者管理加算の新設を機に褥瘡予防は益々注目され，褥瘡に関する研究は増えている．今回，富山県下での療養場所別の褥瘡患者の特徴を明らかにすることを目的に，郵送による質問紙法にて調査を行った．結果，有病率は一般病院 2. 7 ％，療養病床併設病院 4. 9 ％，老人保健施設 3. 2 ％，訪問看護ステーション 5. 0 ％で，年齢や日常生活自立度等，患者の背景は各施設の特性が反映されていた．いずれの施設でもウレタンマットレスの使用が比較的多かったが褥瘡の状態に応じた使用とはいえず，リスクアセスメントを行い，個々の状態や患者の変化，各施設の特性に応じて早急に褥瘡予防ケアを行うことが必要である．また，訪問看護ステーションでは在宅で褥瘡を発生した患者が 86. 7 ％と多く，在宅に携わる医療・介護職者への知識普及，介護者の生活パターンや介護力にあったサービスの紹介等，在宅での褥瘡予防が課題と示唆された...|$|R
