There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly.

Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested.

The design is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied.

50|$|The simple {{case of a}} fixed ratio {{discharge}} can {{be achieved}} by concentric bellows counterlungs, where the exhaled gas expands both the counterlungs, and while the larger volume outer bellows discharges back to the loop when the diver inhales the next breath, the inner bellows discharges its contents to the surroundings, using <b>non</b> <b>return</b> <b>valves</b> to ensure a one-directional flow.

50|$|Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low {{pressure}} generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped elastomeric valve (with {{low pressure}} loss) {{to allow a}} valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting {{in line with the}} supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery <b>non</b> <b>return</b> <b>valve.</b> The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A pressure vessel installed on a tee connected to the delivery port of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.|$|E

Forty nine (n= 49) Red Sokoto does were treated with fluorogestone acetate sponges (FGA- 30) for 15 days. At the end of progestagen treatment, does received i. m 200 IU equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) concurrent with progestagen removal.

40|$|Abstract Background Brief {{intervention}} programs for subacute {{low back pain}} (LBP) result in significant reduction of sick leave compared to treatment as usual. Although effective, a substantial proportion of the patients do not return to work. This study investigates predictors of return to work in LBP patients participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing a brief intervention program (BI) with BI and physical exercise. Methods Predictors for not returning to work was examined in 246 patients sick listed 8 - 12 weeks for low back pain. The patients had participated in a randomized controlled trial, with BI (n = 122) and BI + physical exercise (n = 124). There {{were no significant differences}} between the two intervention groups on return to work. The groups were therefore merged in the analyses of predictors. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for <b>non</b> <b>return</b> to work at 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up. Results At 3 months of follow-up, the strongest predictors for not returning to work were pain intensity while resting (OR = 5. 6; CI = 1. 7 - 19), the perception of constant back strain when working (OR = 4. 1; CI = 1. 5 - 12), negative expectations for return to work (OR = 4. 2; CI = 1. 7 - 10), and having been to a physiotherapist prior to participation in the trial (OR = 3. 3; CI = 1. 3 - 8. 3). At 12 months, perceived reduced ability to walk far due to the complaints (OR = 2. 6; CI = 1. 3 - 5. 4), pain during activities (OR = 2. 4; CI = 1. 1 - 5. 1), and having been to a physiotherapist prior to participation in the trial (OR = 2. 1; CI = 1. 1 - 4. 3) were the strongest predictors for <b>non</b> <b>return</b> to work. At 24 months age below 41 years (OR = 2. 9; CI = 1. 4 - 6. 0) was the only significant predictor for <b>non</b> <b>return</b> to work. Conclusion It appears that return to work is highly dependant on individual and cognitive factors. Patients not returning to work after the interventions were characterized by negative expectations, perceptions about pain and disability, and previous physiotherapy treatment. This is the first study reporting that previous treatment by physiotherapists is a risk factor for long-term sick leave. This has not been reported before and is an interesting finding that deserves more scrutiny. </p...|$|R
