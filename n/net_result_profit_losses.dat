40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{efficiency}} wage hypothesis and derives a tractable expression for the <b>profit</b> <b>loss</b> incurred by {{deviations from the}} efficiency wage. The extent of the wage deviation can be inferred from production function parameters. The <b>resulting</b> <b>profit</b> <b>loss</b> is shown to depend upon the curvature of the effort function and the employment and wage elasticities of output. If the <b>profit</b> <b>loss</b> is small then near rationality may be claimed even if the hypothesis of rationality is statistically rejected. An application to Indian manufacturing is presented, which suggests that rationality cannot be rejected and that the profit function is remarkably flat around the optimum. This is consistent with positive effort returns to increasing the wage beyond its efficient level. Keywords: efficiency wages, near-rationality, panel data, India...|$|R

Constraints on commercial space allocation are at the individual zonal level, as well as at the aggregate level of the overall area. The objective function for the corresponding mathematical program is then linearized, and the model programmed for implementation using a linear programming routine. The results of several simulations illustrate the dynamic impacts various urban development policies have on commercial activity location. In particular, periodic oscillations in zonal activity levels, as well as sudden changes in the spatial pattern of interzonal shopping travel, may appear for certain model parameter values. Several directions for future refinement of the model, including inclusion of economic variables and interaction with other urban activities, are discussed in conclusion. ...|$|R

The last situation can be presented as a statement of comprehensive income, including beside the <b>result</b> of <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account, the gains and losses directly recognized in equities without passing through the <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account. The development of increasingly complex activities emphasizes the utility, the necessity of the <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account in the financial reporting by increasing the interest in the enterprise performance, especially for the dynamic information that this situation can provide.

Here, cost-effectiveness was assessed by considering gross margin, <b>net</b> margin, <b>result</b> (financial <b>profit</b> or <b>loss),</b> cost-effectiveness, and profitability as indicators of financial efficiency. Data were analyzed using PASW 18. 0. A multiple linear regression model was used with the stepwise method to identify the managerial, technical, and other indexes that most affected profitability and cost-effectiveness. The production systems were categorized into three production levels: small (nine DUs), medium (nine DUs), or large (two DUs). The managerial and technical indexes differed according to the stages of production under study. The daily milk production for the three categories were below 151 kg, 151 to 400 kg, and above 400 kg, respectively. The best profitability and cost-effectiveness at the large production level resulted from selling livestock. This level showed greater animal/day productivity (kg of milk), the best cows/farm manpower ratio, and the best number of herd animals/farm manpower ratio, whereas the medium level showed a lower fixed cost/total cost relation. The small production level showed the best percentages of lactating cows, cows in the herd, and lactating cows in the herd, as well as the best productivity/ha/year and lactating cows/ha.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} hedging not perfectly replicable contingent claims by using a benchmark, the numerraire portfolio, as reference unit. The proposed concept of benchmarked risk minimization generalizes classical risk minimization, pioneered by Follmer, Sondermann and Schweizer. The latter relies on a quadratic criterion, requesting the square integrability of contingent claims {{and the existence of}} an equivalent risk neutral probability measure. The proposed concept of benchmarked risk minimization avoids these restrictive assumptions. It employs the real world probability measure as pricing measure and identifies the minimal possible price for the hedgable part of a contingent claim. Furthermore, the <b>resulting</b> benchmarked <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> is only driven by nontraded uncertainty and forms a martingale that starts at zero. Benchmarked <b>profit</b> and <b>losses,</b> when pooled and sufficiently independent, become in total negligible. This property is highly desirable from a risk management point of view. It is making a symptotically benchmarked risk minimization the least expensive method for pricing and hedging for an increasing number of not fully replicable benchmarked contingent claims. incomplete market; pricing; hedging; numeraire portfolio; risk minimization; benchmark approach...|$|R

50|$|Before {{banks were}} {{established}} in Rome there was little ability to mobilize large amounts of capital, leaving Romans to operate within {{the constraints of the}} wealth of their household. When household wealth was exhausted, the elites in Roman society would often extend loans amongst themselves. The value of these loans to the lender was not always derived from interest payments, but rather from the social obligations that were an implication of being a lender. The formation of societas allowed for the utilization of pooled capital. Societas were groups who could pool their resources to place a bid for a government contract and then share in the <b>resulting</b> <b>profit</b> or <b>loss.</b> The publicani (public contractors) were an early incarnation of societas who would bid for the right to collect taxes from the Roman provinces. Senators were not allowed to engage in trade, so it fell to the knights (equites) to bid on these contracts issued by the censors every five years. Banks {{were established in}} Rome that modeled their Greek counterparts and introduced formalized financial intermediation. Livy is the first to acknowledge the rise of formal Roman banks in 310 BCE. Ancient Roman banks operated under private law, which did not have clear guidance on how to decide cases concerning financial matters, which forced Roman banks to operate entirely on their word and character. Bankers congregated around the arch of Janus to conduct their business and despite their informal location, were clearly professional in their dealings.|$|R

The combination of industry secondary data collection and conducting telephone interviews are utilised as methodologies of this study. After all study methodologies and relevant analyses have been conducted, the author concluded that the underwriting cycle exists in Thai fire insurance industry with an average cycle length of six and a half years. This finding is strongly supported by empirical evidences derived from telephone interviews. The empirical finding shows that the most influential hypotheses regarding the causes of underwriting cycle in Thai fire insurance industry, which are partly consistent with academic findings, are capital or capacity constraint and market structure fluctuation or competitor-driven pricing hypotheses. In terms of solutions to the underwriting cycle, an empirical finding shows that a combination of riding the cycle and countercyclical strategies, which is consistent with the academic finding, seems to be the most influential way to manage the underwriting cycle...|$|R
