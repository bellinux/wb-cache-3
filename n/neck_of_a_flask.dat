50|$|The story {{hinges on}} two {{chemical}} facts. First, the victim Neufeld {{was in the}} habit of sniffing at the open <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>flask</b> in order to check that a reaction was occurring. Generally chemists must regard all chemicals as poison, but Neufeld's habit was common practice and would have been safe with the chemicals he intended to use. Substituting cyanide for acetate in the acidic solution produced hydrogen cyanide gas, which killed him. Second, valves on oxygen cylinders are never lubricated with oil, because oxygen under high pressure reacts with hydrocarbons to produce explosive ozonide compounds. Brade notices the oil on the valve in time to save his life. Doheny tricks Anson by pretending to turn on the oxygen in his presence, causing him to warn Doheny to stop, revealing that he knew about the oil. Brade, however, had already cleaned the valve to remove the oil.|$|E

A small, {{light green}} bowl is adorned with wheel-cut decoration consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> band <b>of</b> double-line inscription reading EYTYXI (Good Fortune) and <b>an</b> band <b>of</b> cross-hatching above; {{it can be}} dated around A. D. 300. <b>A</b> conical lamp <b>of</b> transparent, colourless glass, dating from the 4 th century A. D., was originally mounted on a polycandelon. An example of round window glass was manufactured by the so-called muff process. An unguentarium of green and black marbled glass was not blown but probably cast; the shape is similar to Isings’ type 28 b.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} role Leuconostoc citrovorum may play in carbon dioxide production in milk. The ability of L. citrovorum strains to produce gas was studied by two methods. A qualitative method used visual measurement <b>of</b> gas where <b>an</b> agar plug was forced up the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> volumetric <b>flask.</b> It demonstrated that 0. 25 percent yeast extract in a milk medium stimulated L. citrovorum to produce at least ten ml of gas at 30 °C. Studies using a Gilson Differential Respirometer revealed that L. citrovorum produced 500 - 900 μl of CO₂ in milk and 800 - 1500 μl of CO₂ in nonfat milk containing 0. 33 percent yeast extract. Cell extracts of Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus helveticus also enhanced gas production of L. citrovorum 20 to 70 percent. Autolysates of these bacteria present during ripening or aging of certain cheeses may stimulate L. citrovorum, a common organism in starter cultures, to produce gas causing, for example, the slit-open defect of Cheddar cheese. Yeast extract caused an increase in acid and gas production per cell, but did not cause an increase in growth as measured by counting the cells. Experiments indicated that one metabolic source of the carbon dioxide was the decarboxylation of pyruvate produced during catabolism of citric acid; yeast extract stimulated this reaction 16 percent...|$|R

Cell extracts of Streptococcus cremoris, S. lactis, Lactobacillus lactis, L. casei, and L. helveticus also enhanced gas production of L. citrovorum from 20 to 70 %.
