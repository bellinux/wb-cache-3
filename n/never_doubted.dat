5|$|Mold {{continued}} to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, {{it would have been}} a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and that not every delivery that he called was actually a throw.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E

25|$|Though Saddam Hussein had renounced {{the use of}} {{chemical}} weapons in 1989, many did not believe he would really honor that during a conflict with the United States and the broader coalition forces.

25|$|Among other behaviors, {{this means}} that {{men are more likely}} to favour {{chastity}} in a woman, as this way a male can be more certain that her offspring are his own. Such a strategy is seen in males, and maternity is <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> by the female, and so a chaste male is not highly valued by a women. However, for men, female chastity confirms paternity, causing the male to compromising his sexual strategies in order to select a chaste mate.|$|E

25|$|Thus Gregory VII, as a {{politician}} wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged {{the existence of the}} state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But at no period would he have dreamed of putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had <b>never</b> <b>doubted.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck {{produced}} three shorter works. The Pastures of Heaven, {{published in}} 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which {{was discovered by}} a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published The Red Pony, a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood. To a God Unknown, named after a Vedic hymn, follows {{the life of a}} homesteader and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works.

[...] In 2009, the teams met in the semi-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, which United won 4–1 on aggregate.

Her promotion drew further attention as Seo {{was one of only}} three principal dancers in the company to have been promoted from the ABT Studio Company. Julia Moon, the Ballet Director of Universal Ballet, said that [...] "Seo has an incredible talent, not just in dancing but also acting.

500|$|While South Carolina {{was known}} for legendary hard-knuckled {{political}} consultant Lee Atwater and rough elections, this had been more: Michael Graham, a native writer, radio host, and political operative, would say [...] "I have worked on hundreds of campaigns in South Carolina, and I've never seen anything as ugly as that campaign." [...] In subsequent years there would be persistent accounts trying to tie the anti-McCain smears {{to high levels of}} the Bush campaign: the 2003 book [...] would use it to build up their [...] "evil genius" [...] depiction of Bush chief strategist Karl Rove, while a 2008 PBS NOW program showed a local political consultant stating that Warren Tompkins, a Lee Atwater protégé and then Bush chief strategist for the state, was responsible. In contrast, in 2004 National Reviews Byron York would try to debunk many of the South Carolina smear reports as unfounded legend.

500|$|The opinion (written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite) {{first asked}} whether Minor was {{a citizen of}} the United States, and {{answered}} that she was, citing both the Fourteenth Amendment and earlier common law. [...] Exploring the common-law origins of citizenship, the court observed that [...] "new citizens may be born or they may be created by naturalization" [...] and that the Constitution [...] "does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens." [...] Under the common law, according to the court, [...] "it was <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. [...] These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners." [...] The court observed that some authorities [...] "include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents"—but since Minor was born in the United States and her parents were U.S. citizens, she was unquestionably a citizen herself, even under the narrowest possible definition, and the court thus noted that the subject {{did not need to be}} explored in any greater depth.|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the Blue Jackets sent Development Coach Tyler Wright to Russia {{to train}} with Filatov to assess his {{readiness}} {{for the upcoming}} season, and to communicate the team's desire to work with him. Blue Jackets Head Coach Scott Arniel {{was pleased to see}} Filatov arrive in Columbus six weeks ahead of the team's 2010–11 season, allowing him a chance to mend relationships with his teammates who may have been annoyed by Filatov's departure. Howson said the team <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> Filatov's skill: [...] "Nikita has the skill and the ability to play in a top-six role." [...] Arniel was optimistic about Filatov's return to the team, offering him a clean slate and a chance to earn a spot on one of the team's top two lines. After speaking with his friend Sergei Shirokov (who played for Arniel on the Manitoba Moose), Filatov was optimistic about working with Columbus's new head coach. Filatov started the season with the Blue Jackets at the NHL level and recorded seven assists in 23 games. In December 2010, Filatov was demoted to the AHL and spent the remainder of the season with the Springfield Falcons—Columbus's new AHL affiliate. With the Falcons, he played in 36 games, scoring nine goals and adding 11 assists.|$|E
500|$|Despite the suspension, Evra still {{featured}} with Manchester United in December as {{the club}} {{participated in the}} 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. He appeared in both matches the team contested as United came out as champions after defeating Ecuadorian club LDU Quito in the final. Evra temporarily returned to the team domestically for its home match, coincidentally, against Chelsea on 11 January 2009. In the match, Evra assisted on the second goal in a 3–0 victory. He was later forced to leave the match due to a foot injury, which was later discovered to be serious. Evra missed a month {{and returned to the}} line-up on 15 February in a 3–0 win over Fulham. Evra subsequently appeared in every remaining competitive match for United, excluding an April league match against Sunderland, as the club cruised to its third consecutive Premier League title, won the League Cup, and reached the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final after defeating league rivals Arsenal 4–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals. Following the second leg against Arsenal, Evra was asked his opinion of the team's 3–1 second leg victory, and declared, [...] "It was 11 men against 11 babies. We <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> ourselves." [...] The final marked Evra's third appearance in Champions League finals as Manchester United lost 2–0 to Barcelona. At the end of the season, Evra was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the second time.|$|E

500|$|Despite the acquittal, {{the broader}} public {{perception}} was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself. The Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who {{was critical of}} Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of unhappiness [...] about the result at the Old Bailey. [...] As far as most people are concerned, the trial ended with a big question mark over the case". Prevented by his party from a return to active politics, in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had <b>never</b> <b>doubted</b> the outcome. Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: [...] "If it happened now I think the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it... It offended their set of values." [...] Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.|$|E
