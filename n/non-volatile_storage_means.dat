40|$|Reducing Energy Consumption using a <b>Non-Volatile</b> <b>storage</b> cache We can {{outperform}} {{the most}} powerful disk spin-down algorithm available by using a small <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> write-only cache to temporarily store hard disk write requests while a disk is spun-down. In our experiments, we use a USB thumb drive device as our <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> cache. By redirecting writes to a flash memory while a disk is spun-down we avoid costly hard disk cycle start-stop operations, thus increasing hard disk reliability and reducing energy consumption. We also show that such a storage cache is necessary to provide feasible performance from a disk spin-down algorithm in a general purpose operating environment. The problem arises from typical general purpose operating system applications generating periodic disk activity while a system is not in use. By using small, cheap, and nonvolatile flash memory we can improve the energy savings of a highly adaptive machine learning disk spin-down algorithm by 36 %, and the 15 and 45 second fixed-timeout algorithm by 57 % and 46 %, respectively. We can also reduce the relative fraction of hard disk ”contact start-stop cycles” by 80 % for the DSA algorithm, and with the 15 and 45 second fixed-timeout algorithm 79 % and 73 %, respectively. 1...|$|R

40|$|Virtualization {{has been}} widely adopted in current {{computer}} systems. A key part of virtualization is a hypervisor, which virtualizes physical resources to be shared among multiple guest virtual machines (VMs). Configuration files and security policy files used by the hypervisor control VMs' behavior. If these critical files are tampered with, all the VMs that run on the same hypervisor will be affected. This paper presents hGuard, a framework to measure hypervisor critical files. Each time a critical file is updated, its hash is stored into a <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> of the trusted chip. When a critical file is loaded into memory, a measurement module computes its hash and a validation module checks its integrity by comparing this hash with that stored in the <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage.</b> Only if {{they are the same}} could the files be used and continuous operation will be allowed. The experiment shows that hGuard can detect illegal modification of hypervisor critical files. Virtualization {{has been widely}} adopted in current computer systems.

40|$|A {{number of}} spintronic {{junction}} transistors, that exploit the spin {{degree of freedom}} of an electron {{in addition to the}} charge degree of freedom, have been proposed to provide simultaneous <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage</b> and signal processing functionality. Here, we show that some of these transistors unfortunately may not have sufficient voltage and current gains for signal processing. This is primarily because of a large output ac conductance and poor isolation between input and output. The latter also hinders unidirectional propagation of logic signal from the input of a logic gate to the output. Other versions of these transistors appear to have better gain and isolation, but not better than those of a conventional transistor. Therefore, these devices may not improve state-of-the-art signal processing capability, although they may provide additional functionality by offering <b>non-volatile</b> <b>storage.</b> They may also have niche applications in non-linear circuits...|$|R
