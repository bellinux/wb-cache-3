5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement {{is involved in the}} trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia {{is one of the most}} notable sellers of slow loris parts.|$|E

5|$|Tassadar {{is a high}} templar {{who holds}} the rank of {{executor}} in the Khalai military. He appears in StarCraft and in several novels, most notably Queen of Blades. Tassadar is voiced by Michael Gough in StarCraft, with Michael Dorn playing the part in later appearances. Described as being fascinated with, if somewhat wary of, the dark templar, Tassadar is {{the commander of the}} fleet that made first contact with the Terrans by destroying their colony of Chau Sara to contain Zerg infestation. However, Tassadar eventually disregards his orders to continue destroying worlds with <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> for the Terrans, and instead engages the Zerg by conventional means. After tracking the Zerg to their homeworld of Char, he encounters the dark templar Zeratul and Jim Raynor, forging a friendship with the two and learning how to use his psionic powers in conjunction with the powers of the dark templar.|$|E
5|$|Members of the British mission {{occupied}} {{several key}} {{positions in the}} electromagnetic project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of}} the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for the electromagnetic project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending to policy questions such as whether to expand the electromagnetic plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to the electromagnetic project, both in Berkeley and at the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey.|$|E

25|$|A basic {{chemical}} hypothesis first {{emerged in}} Classical Greece {{with the theory}} of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything {{is formed as a}} combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things). Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> for chemical experiments.|$|E
25|$|As the Japanese {{forces in}} China were {{mainly on the}} {{offensive}} and suffered relatively few casualties, few Japanese soldiers surrendered to Chinese forces prior to August 1945.

The conditions these POWs were held in generally did not meet the standards required by international law. The Japanese government expressed <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> for these abuses, however, as it did not want IJA soldiers to even consider surrendering. The government was, however, concerned about reports that 300 POWs had joined the Chinese Communists and had been trained to spread anti-Japanese propaganda.|$|E

25|$|Mobutu was infamous for embezzling the {{equivalent}} of billions of US dollars from his country. According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$4–5billion from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$15billion. According to Mobutu's ex-son-in-law, Pierre Janssen—the ex-husband of Mobutu's daughter Yaki—Mobutu had <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> {{for the cost of}} the expensive gifts he gave away to his cronies. Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 wedding cake and a giant fireworks display. Yaki wore a US$70,000 wedding gown and US$3million worth of jewels. Janssen wrote a book describing Mobutu's daily routine—which included several daily bottles of wine, retainers flown in from overseas and lavish meals.|$|E
25|$|February 9 saw {{voting in}} Louisiana, Kansas and Washington state. Huckabee won an easy victory in Kansas, {{claiming}} all 36 of the state's {{delegates to the}} national convention. Only 14,016 votes were cast, and the McCain campaign expressed <b>no</b> <b>concern</b> over the lightly attended caucus. However, social conservatives had a strong presence in the Kansas Republican party, and the results served to highlight conservative dissatisfaction with the Senator. Louisiana was much closer, but Huckabee won there as well, beating McCain by less than one percentage point. McCain was declared {{the winner of the}} Washington caucuses, where 18 delegates were at stake. The February 19 primary would determine the other 19 delegates from the state. After the caucuses, Huckabee's campaign indicated that they would challenge the results.|$|E

Chanting began again, with PL fighting for their beliefs; however, it was basically over. “Although they controlled a third of the delegates at the final SDS convention,” the reality was that PL “had a presence in only a handful of the locations where SDS was active, and everyone knew it. It was over.”.|$|E
