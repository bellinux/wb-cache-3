5000|$|In 2006, at {{the request}} of Het Beschrijf, Weidenbaum collaborated on an artistic project [...] "Poëzie" [...] in the city of Brussels. Using the title 'Passing by,' Peter Weidenbaum {{develops}} a multifaceted symbolism that corresponds to his artistic expression. He describes his intervention as an infiltration in the Montgomery district and creates a walking route where his paintings of recognizable city scenes are showed in surprising locations. It demonstrates the picturfe of a dignitary in a <b>night</b> <b>shop</b> and a painting of an independent immigrant in the embassy. This provides food for thought for the inhabitants of the district. He publishes a newspaper where the painted cityscapes show in combination with a poem by Agnieszka Kuciak, a Polish poet and different interviews with local inhabitants. This congruence of systems of signs finalizes with a sculpture on Montgomery Square. He designs a very high lifeguard chair in stainless steel on a concrete slab in which one may read a poem of Kuciak. This is a symbolic gesture, where Weidenbaum invites the accidental passer-by to view the city from a bird's eye view, to reflect, to take distance, to integrate a moment of peace.|$|E
