40|$|With {{seasonal}} adjustment {{one has to}} decide whether to seasonal adjust an aggregate like GDP directly or to sum up its seasonally adjusted components. This choice is usually driven by subjective motives or practical convenience. In the case of {{seasonal adjustment}} with chain-linked data one might feel forced to use the direct approach as components do <b>not</b> even <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to aggregates before the adjustment. This paper presents a guide for practitioners, which recommends a more objective way of decision-making, based on several indicators. It proposes some of these criteria which can facilitate the decision between the direct and the indirect approach. For the case of chain-linked series, where the indirect approach seems not to be feasible because components are <b>not</b> <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> to an aggregate, the paper presents a method how the indirect approach of seasonal adjustment nevertheless can be applied. Finally it deals with a possible balancing process between the results of the direct and the indirect approach and a practical application example is given...|$|R

25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do <b>not</b> <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of}} the software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E

5000|$|From this view, {{biogeochemical}} cycles {{are driven}} by radiant energy. Odum expressed the balance between energy input and output as the ratio of production (P) to respiration (R): P-R.

However Golley notes that H.T.Odum attempted to go beyond the reporting of mere ratios, a move which resulted in the first serious disagreement in systems energetics.|$|R

40|$|An {{abundance}} of comparative survey research has established {{the presence of}} economic voting as a individual force in European elections. But the hypothesis of economic voting at the aggregate level, with macroeconomics influencing overall electoral outcomes, rests on shakier ground. Indeed, {{there might be a}} micrological fallacy at work, with the individual economic vote effect <b>not</b> <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> to a national electoral effect after all. We examine this possibility through rigorous analysis of a large time-series cross-sectional data-set of European nations. From these results, it becomes clear that the macroeconomy moves national election outcomes, with hard times punishing governing parties, and good times rewarding them. Then the question is whether this economy-election connection alters with economic crisis. We show that in general economic crisis, defined as negative growth, reinforces the national economic vote, especially in the hard-pressed nations of Southern Europe. In these nations under crisis, the ruling parties are held still more accountable at the ballot box, when compared to their Northern European counterparts. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The only extant near-contemporary {{source for}} BWV 565 is an undated copy by Johannes Ringk. A broad {{estimate}} is that the manuscript was written somewhere in the period from ten years before Bach's death in 1750 to ten years after it. Ringk produced his first copy of a Bach score in 1730 when he was 12. Taking into consideration the evolution of Ringk's handwriting, one can infer that his copy of BWV 565 was written soon after his first copy of a Bach composition, which would narrow the date of his BWV 565 manuscript to between 1730 and 1735, when Ringk was around 15. At the time Ringk was a student of Bach's former student Johann Peter Kellner at Gräfenroda, and probably faithfully copied what his teacher put before him. There are some errors in the score such as note values <b>not</b> <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> to fill a measure correctly: such defects show a carelessness deemed typical for Kellner, who left over 60 copies of works by Bach.|$|R
