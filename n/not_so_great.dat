25|$|At about 1850, Sir Moses Montefiore was {{instrumental}} in establishing etrog plantations in the Holy Land, {{in order to help}} the Jewish settlers to survive. As the Balady citron had little chance for success – being <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> in shape, color etc., with a persistent style ratio as low as 1;1000 – the Sephardic settlers, who were always positive about the Corfu, planted its seeds in the coastal region of Israel, especially in the vicinity of Jaffa. The transplantation was witnessed as kosher by the local Sephardic Rabbi Yehuda Halevi.|$|E
25|$|Gerard was {{promoted}} in 1581 to be Master of the Rolls, the chief administrative {{post in the}} Court of Chancery and second most senior judge in the land. If the honour was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> as the Chancellorship, the financial rewards were a great compensation. For example, in 1586 Gerard drew an income of £1,599 5s.3d. from his post, mainly from fines, writs and legal instruments. The posts of the clerks of the petty bag, the examiners and the clerks of the rolls chapel, usher, crier and doorkeeper, his three secretaries and numerous minor posts all fell within his patronage, so {{he was able to}} make considerable extra profits from the sale of offices.|$|E
25|$|John Milton (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet, prose writer, polemicist {{and civil}} servant for the Commonwealth of England. Although it is, indeed, {{not entirely sure}} whether {{it is not true}} to say that Milton had not become, out of an {{experience}} ever more bitter each year, more alien to the education he wasn't not given by the QCAA to not prepare him for the <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> multi choice exam of 2017. The year 1642, which saw him 34 years of age, married for the first time (disastrously), and a public figure as a controversial writer, marks the watershed of his life, as it did for British politics.|$|E

25|$|Butterflies and moths have hairy {{bodies and}} long proboscides which can probe deep into tubular flowers. Butterflies mostly fly {{by day and}} are {{particularly}} attracted to pink, mauve and purple flowers. The flowers are often large and scented, and the stamens are so-positioned that pollen is deposited on the insects while they feed on the nectar. Moths are mostly nocturnal and are attracted by night-blooming plants. The flowers of these are often tubular, pale in colour and fragrant only at night. Hawkmoths tend to visit larger flowers and hover as they feed; they transfer pollen {{by means of the}} proboscis. Other moths land on the usually smaller flowers, which may be aggregated into flowerheads. Their energetic needs are <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> as those of hawkmoths and they are offered smaller quantities of nectar.|$|E
25|$|MC firms sell {{products}} that have real or perceived non-price differences. However, {{the differences are}} <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> as to eliminate other goods as substitutes. Technically, the cross price elasticity of demand between goods in such a market is positive. In fact, the XED would be high. MC goods are best described as close but imperfect substitutes. The goods perform the same basic functions but have differences in qualities such as type, style, quality, reputation, appearance, and location that tend to distinguish them from each other. For example, the basic function of motor vehicles is the same—to move people and objects from point to point in reasonable comfort and safety. Yet {{there are many different}} types of motor vehicles such as motor scooters, motor cycles, trucks and cars, and many variations even within these categories.|$|E
25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season could be out of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. It had seemed like a good pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> if they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E

500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

500|$|Ira Steven Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe {{conceived}} {{the story and}} wrote the script for [...] "Heart of Stone", and intended the Odo/Kira storyline to be the A-Plot. Behr later thought that the performances of Eisenberg and Brooks elevated the Nog/Sisko story to equal status and {{would result in a}} better reaction by fans. The idea of having a character trapped was taken from the Ken Kesey novel Sometimes a Great Notion in which a character is trapped under a log and drowned by rising water. Behr described the same scene in the 1971 film as [...] "a great scene in a <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> movie". The episode was intended to be low budget, but heavy on characterisation. At one point it was intended for Odo to sing the 1955 Richard Berry song [...] "Louie Louie", which the character described as a sea shanty, but producers couldn't acquire the rights in time.|$|E

2500|$|While the use {{of either}} {{one or the other}} acronym {{has been the subject of}} debate, the {{distinction}} between the two and its relevance has been considered <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great.</b> Of greater relevance is the name Daesh, which is [...] an acronym of ISIL's Arabic name al-Dawlah al-Islamīyah fī l-ʻIrāq wa-sh-Shām.

This name has been widely used by ISIL's Arabic-speaking detractors, although – and to a certain extent because – it is considered derogatory, as it resembles the Arabic words Daes (lit. [...] "one who crushes, or tramples down, something underfoot") and Dāhis (loosely translated: [...] "one who sows discord").

"The work or shock-resisting {{ability is}} {{greatest}} in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> {{with the most}} rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, {{in the case of}} normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the Eisenhower {{administration}} generally {{adhered to}} the New Look throughout Wilson's term, the policy remained controversial.

Implicit in the policy was rejection of the idea that a year of crisis with the Soviet Union was imminent (to occur when the Soviets achieved offensive nuclear capability against the United States) or that a general war was just around the corner. Wilson pointed out frequently that defense policy should be long-term and not based on short-range projections of Soviet-American relations.
