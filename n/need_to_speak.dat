5|$|Melissa calls Scully {{and tells}} her she is coming over. After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls up in his car, telling her they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot the wrong person, the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner to pull his gun on her.|$|E
5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E
25|$|The {{social milieu}} {{was that of}} a few Austronesian men who settled on the {{outskirts}} of an East Trans-Fly group, intermarried, and whose children were either bilingual, or speakers of their mothers' language, with some knowledge of their fathers' language. The local people did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the traders' language, who in turn had to speak the local language. The children in turn would then speak the local language, with varying ability in the fathers' language, particularly in areas that were culturally important for the fathers.|$|E
50|$|Joe phones {{the police}} {{department}} and poses as a lawyer who <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Herc. He is transferred to Lieutenant Hoskin’s at the mayor’s security detail who tells him that Herc has been reassigned to the Major Crimes Unit.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Shefford {{realized}} that there was nothing strange in what was natural. A remnant of sophistication clung to him and that had <b>spoken.</b> He <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her in a way which in her simplicity she would understand.|$|R
50|$|Although many {{situations}} may exist, not all situations {{can be defined}} as rhetorical situations, because speech cannot rectify the problem. Bitzer especially focuses on the sense of timing (kairos) <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> about a situation in a way that can best remedy the exigence.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{their stay}} in America, Daoud {{remained}} {{involved in the}} Afghan American community, using her spare time volunteering for her community's cause. In 1996 she co-founded the Afghan Women Association of Southern California, and she still hosts {{a radio talk show}} on the 24-hour Voice of Afghanistan. However, Zohra maintained a low profile about her former beauty queen status until 11 September 2001 when Daoud grew weary of the media's treatment of Afghan women as illiterate, burqa-clad victims, and felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out.|$|E
25|$|When the Guardian {{arrives on}} Venus, the Exo Stranger {{describes}} the Vex as an evil so dark it despises other evil. She tells {{them about the}} Black Garden, a city where the Vex are born, and implores the Guardian to find it and rip out its heart, {{as it is the}} only way the Traveler will begin to heal. Ghost says that they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef and refuse to take sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves as she did not have time to explain things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy. After defeating Draksis, a Fallen Kell of the House of Winter, the Guardian confronts the Vex Gate Lord, claims its head, and returns to the Queen, who tells them to take its eye to the Meridian Bay on Mars, where it can be used to enter the Black Garden.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{has been}} a campaigner since her youth. Since {{becoming}} a public figure she has regularly voiced her views and been involved in many issues, prompting criticism that she is overly outspoken. In 2010, The Daily Telegraph asked: [...] "Emma Thompson: a national treasure or Britain's most annoying woman?" [...] She has justified her assertiveness by saying, [...] "what I feel is that we all <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> up {{and a woman who}} has got a louder voice needs to shout very loudly indeed." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2014 {{interview}} with GQ, Myers said, [...] "was {{the emphasis on}} the look on my face versus the fact that somebody spoke truth to power at a time when somebody <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak?</b> I'm very proud to have been next to him." ...|$|R
50|$|Cogman {{made his}} {{debut in the}} Last Knight, when he was told by Sir Edmund Burton to go to America and bring Cade Yeager with him which he is {{reluctant}} {{to carry out the}} order but is forced into it by Burton who tells him he is important and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him asap. Cogman flies out to the ruins of Chicago, which was destroyed during the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons in Dark of the Moon.|$|R
50|$|Clarkson and Wilman {{wanted to}} have a {{professional}} racing driver as part of the show's cast, but ran into difficulty finding a driver sufficiently adept at speaking on-camera. Clarkson then asked Wilman why the driver <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at all, and they decided that the Stig's role would be silent.|$|R
2500|$|The Senate also {{experimented with}} {{a rule that}} removed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{on the floor in}} order to {{filibuster}} (a [...] "talking filibuster"), thus allowing for [...] "virtual filibusters". [...] Another tactic, the post-cloture filibuster—which used points of order to delay legislation because they were not counted as part of the limited time allowed for debate—was rendered ineffective by a rule change in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, 2005, Taylor {{was named}} {{publicly}} as a [...] "person of interest" [...] by Miami-Dade County police {{in regard to}} a Miami assault case involving firearms, and was being sought for questioning. [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to him, we don't know if he's a victim, witness or suspect," [...] Miami-Dade police spokesman Mary Walters said. Taylor allegedly was present at, and possibly involved in, an incident on June 1 in which bullets allegedly were fired into a stolen vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|And in {{the same}} year, Gibb was seen around town with a Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: [...] "I'm not a Casanova and it's all most unfortunate. I've never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, 'Oh, we won't bother about Maurice because he's always got a steady girl'. Gibb {{recalled}} the first meeting with his future-in-laws, [...] "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, and I was told that Billy, who is younger than Lu, {{would be at the}} station to meet me. I got off the train and was walking along the platform when I saw him. I didn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you?', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met". The couple married on 18 February 1969 and divorced in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless, in 1973. [...] Gibb later stated they both drank: [...] "We didn't have any responsibilities, we'd just party." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Defense {{official}} Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi (Raad Rawi) at the airport.

5000|$|In 1821, Braille {{learned of}} a {{communication}} system devised by Captain Charles Barbier of the French Army.

50|$|In 1998 Rugby League {{historian}} Sean Fagan interviewed Smith who {{confirmed his}} suspicion that his Catholicism {{was the cause}} of the problem. Several members of the selection panel were Masons and at that time the touring captain often <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at Northern English clubs with Masonic links. The 1948 Kangaroos failed to win a Test in England.|$|R
2500|$|On Saturday, April 27, a man {{was arrested}} in Corpus Christi, Texas for trying to sell a {{saxophone}} to a music store. On Thursday, April 25, the thirty-year-old man walked into a music store without an instrument and asked the sales person {{if they wanted to}} buy an alto Bundy saxophone. The girl told him that she would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to her manager. The man replied, [...] "What do you have {{to talk to him about}} it for? You work here, don't you?" [...] The girl claimed that the man seemed nervous. Once the manager was summoned, the man fled. The store contacted the police. The man was arrested two days later at a waterfront hotel after purchasing a [...]45 revolver from a pawn shop. On Tuesday, April 30, the sales girl identified him as the same man who tried selling the saxophone. Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room. The man claimed that the blood was from a cut he had received on his forehead in a bar fight.|$|E

50|$|In 1981, {{he founded}} the Makati Business Club (MBC) to support or oppose {{policies}} which affected national life.

From 1983 to 1986, MBC would be the prime advocate of political change.|$|R
5000|$|... 31. When the {{brothers}} {{come out of}} compline they have no permission <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> openly except in an emergency. But let each go to his bed quietly and in silence, and if he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> his squire, he should say {{what he has to}} say softly and quietly. But if by chance, as they come out of compline, the knighthood or the house has a serious problem which must be solved before morning, we intend that the Master or a party of elder brothers who govern the Order under the Master, may speak appropriately. And for this reason we command that it should be done in such a manner.|$|R
25|$|During this period, {{a number}} of {{officers}} sympathetic to the rebels were admitted, including Gen. Mazaki, Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita, Gen.

60|$|I {{could explain}} this strange {{agitation}} in Steele {{in no other}} way except that realization had brought keen suffering as incomprehensible as it was painful. I could not tell if it came from suddenly divined love for Diane Sampson equally with a poignant conviction that his fate was to wreck her. But I did see that he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out the brutal truth.|$|R
50|$|Syfka, an aplomado, is {{the third}} in line of the {{hierarchy}} from the Dasi coven. When Araceli's son Sebastian was young she helped him flee the island and become Andreios. She has also proven herself to be helpful when she helped Kel and Andreios return to the avians and serpiente after Araceli abducted them. On top of that she gave Nicias the opportunities he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Darien {{and get out of}} the city with Hai. But the falcons never do anything that they will not gain from, and Syfka is no exception to this.|$|R

60|$|All {{about the}} Navajo then {{was dark and}} solemn disproof of her belief. He did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> His {{repetition}} of that savage, almost boastful blow on his breast added only to the dignity, {{and not to the}} denial, of a warrior.|$|E
