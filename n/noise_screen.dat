40|$|In this master thesis a software, MapMonit, {{that use}} real {{measurement}} data {{as a basis}} to calculate noise maps was studied. The project focus on noise from roads. Simulations in MapMonit based on measurements were compared with control measurements and simulations of existing noise computation software. The software used for comparison was CadnaA. The project started with measurements of road traffic noise with four microphone heights at four distances {{that would be used}} as input to the software called MapMonit. Since {{this was the first time}} the software ever got tested with real measurements, the first test site was chosen to be as simple as possible with a long, straight road and surrounding flat fields. The microphone distances from the road edge were 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 100 m with microphone heights 0. 4 m, 1. 5 m, 2 m and 4 m at each of the distances. A grid of control microphones were positioned in the vicinity from 10 m to 180 m from the road edge. At distances 5 m to 20 m for microphone heights 1. 5 m to 4 m, the results turned out to be very good. The difference between the A-weighted levels of MapMonit simulations and the control measurements was generally less than 1 dB for all control positions. Compared to CadnaA, the two simulated levels were very similar for propagation paths up to 100 m with differences below 1. 4 dB. At control distances over 170 m, the difference was very high, up to 5. 3 dB, with MapMonit simulating the highest values. A complicated test site in the vicinity of a <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> were also studied. The reference microphones for input to MapMonit were placed in front, above and behind the screen, and one behind a garage also on the quiet side. The control measurements were placed around the neighborhood at the quiet side of the <b>noise</b> <b>screen.</b> Due to a flaw with the MapMonit software implementation, the results were presented with flat topography. The reference microphone in front of and above the <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> gave satisfying results, with differences less than 2 dB at all control positions except for a position just behind a garage. Obstacles along the propagation path included both a <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> and buildings.

40|$|Sound {{propagation}} over {{a traditional}} <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> in downwind conditions is numerically investigated and {{compared with a}} graded index sonic crystal (GRIN SC) noise barrier. The latter type of noise barrier creates a shadow zone by upward refraction of waves propagating through. Upward refraction is here achieved by varying the cylinder radius with height hence creating a graded index medium which effective sound speed varies accordingly. Contrary to GRIN SC noise barriers, traditional noise screens aim at improving the sound environment by screening sound emanating from, e. g. traffic noise sources. It {{has been shown that}} in downwind propagating conditions traditional solid screens introduce large wind speed gradients above the barrier top, which may give rise to downward refraction of acoustic waves into the shadow zone. In two-dimensional space, wind speed profiles of a traditional screen and an acoustically equivalent GRIN SC noise barrier are numerically computed using computational fluid dynamics. The modeled background flow, treated as an effective sound speed, is then used as input parameter for acoustic propagation calculations. The acoustic performance of both structures including a non-uniform background flow has been evaluated for a simple outdoor setup assuming a hard reflecting ground surface and a single noise source...|$|E
40|$|Downwind sound {{propagation}} over a <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> is investigated by numerical computations and scale model experiments in a wind tunnel. For the computations, the parabolic equation method is used, with a range-dependent sound-speed profile based on wind-speed profiles {{measured in the}} wind tunnel and wind-speed profiles computed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is found that large screen-induced wind-speed gradients in the region behind the screen are responsible for a considerable reduction {{of the performance of}} the screen, for receivers near the boundary of the shadow region behind the screen. The screen-induced wind-speed gradients cause a considerable reduction {{of the size of the}} shadow region. If the screen-induced wind-speed gradients are taken into account, computed sound-pressure levels near the shadow boundary are in reasonable agreement with levels measured in the wind tunnel. In contrast, computed levels are considerably lower, up to 10 dB, if the screen-induced wind-speed gradients are ignored. This implies that the performance of a screen can be considerably improved if the screen-induced wind-speed gradients can be suppressed, e. g., by the use of 'vented' screens. The reduction of screen attenuation by RESWING (refraction by screen-induced wind speed gradients) for receivers is studied. The {{sound propagation}} over a screen in a refracting atmosphere is computed by parabolic equation method. The wind-speed profiles measured in the wind tunnel and wind-speed profiles are computed by computational fluid dynamics.

Next, <b>noise</b> level was measured in all the plants by TES- 1358 sound level meter and regular grid method. Data were analyzed using chi-square test and linear regression in SPSS version 16.. Result: The mean (SD) scores of sound pressure level and screening form were 86. 5 dBA (4. 5) and 64. 2 (9. 4) in 51 understudy plants, respectively. According to the results of sound measurement, sound level in 34 plants (66. 6 %) exceeded the permissible level and in 17 plants (33. 33 %) was below the limit. The results of screening forms showed that 47 plants (92. 16 %) had permissible level of noise while noise in 4 (7. 84 %) was not in permissible level.

40|$|International audienceSonic Crystals (SCs) are {{periodic}} {{structures of}} solid scatterers {{embedded in a}} fluid. Perhaps, the most celebrated property of SCs {{is the presence of}} ranges of frequencies, known as band gaps, where only evanescent modes are excited. As a consequence, in finite SCs the propagation of waves at these frequencies is attenuated. However the mere existence of these attenuation bands is not enough to design effective attenuation devices. In this work we report the theoretical and experimental design of multi-phenomena scatterers presenting resonances, absorption and scattering in the audible range. The design of the scatterers has been improved for its use outdoors. We use these scatterers to construct a periodic structure making use of the Bragg reflections, together with resonances and the absorption, in order to combine the three phenomena working independently in different ranges of frequencies. Thus the overall effect is a wideband of attenuated frequencies.

Most iron workers showed hearing loss at frequencies below 3000 Hz. Their sway speeds were significantly faster both with the eyes open (1. 05 (SD 0. 39) v 0. 91 (SD 0. 22) cm/s) and with eyes closed (1. 66 (SD 0. 82) v 1. 31 (SD 0. 51) cm/s) than those of histology technicians. Coefficients for sway speed with the eyes closed and hearing loss in the left ear were significantly correlated at 500 to 8000 Hz. They were also correlated with the sway speed, eyes open, at low and high Hz. It is concluded that the use of air impact power tools in an inordinately noisy work environment makes iron workers prematurely deaf and impairs their balance.

It is shown that depending on the distance between bubbles the resonance peak of a single bubble can either be broadened or narrowed due to multiple scattering and it shows an oscillatory behavior as the distance changes. Meanwhile, the peak scattering amplitude is also be either enhanced or reduced. The previously predicted strong enhancement, however, is not evident. For plane arrays, the usual resonant scattering of a single bubble in absence of other bubbles can be suppressed by multiple scattering when the distance between bubbles is sufficiently small. As the distance increases, the resonant scattering starts to appear, and the resonance peak position is alternately shifted towards higher and lower values. Moreover, it is predicted that wave propagation through a plane bubble array can be significantly inhibited in a range of frequencies slightly higher than the natural frequency of a single bubble, possibly a useful feature for <b>noise</b> <b>screening.</b> The ambiguities in the previous results are pointed out. 2...|$|R
