As a result, Di Justo writes, [...] "the public refused to trust a government-operated health program that killed old people and crippled young people."

2500|$|A {{native of}} New York City and {{attendee}} of Columbia University, Gehrig {{signed with the}} Yankees in 1923. He set several major league records during his career, including the most career grand slams (23) (since broken by Alex Rodriguez) and most consecutive games played (2,130), a record that stood for 56 years and was long considered unbreakable until surpassed by Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1995. Gehrig's consecutive game streak ended on May 2, 1939, when he voluntarily took {{himself out of the}} lineup to stunned players and fans after his performance on the field was hampered by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorder</b> now commonly referred to in North America as Lou Gehrig's disease. The disease forced him to retire at age 36 and was the cause of his death two years later.

2500|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is a somewhat controversial {{diagnosis of a}} <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorder</b> which {{is related to the}} sciatic nerve. [...] According to the terms of the syndrome, the sciatic nerve becomes compressed or otherwise irritated by the piriformis muscle causing pain, tingling and numbness in the hip/ buttocks and along the path of the sciatic nerve descending the lower thigh and into the leg. It {{is one of the few}} conditions which causes posterior hip pain. [...] The condition has no external signs. [...] Diagnosis is often difficult due to few validated and standardized diagnostic tests, but two tests have been well-described and clinically validated: one is electrophysiological, called the FAIR-test, which measures delay in sciatic nerve conductions when the piriformis muscle is stretched against it. The other is magnetic resonance neurography, a type of MRI that highlights inflammation and the nerves themselves. Some say that the most important criterion is the exclusion of sciatica resulting from compression/irritation of spinal nerve roots, as by a herniated disc. However, compression may be present, but not causal, in the setting of sciatica due to piriformis syndrome. [...] Recovery time ranges between a few days to six weeks or more for complete recovery.|$|E

40|$|Muscle {{ultrasound}} is {{a useful}} tool in the diagnosis of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorders,</b> as these disorders result in muscle atrophy and intramuscular fibrosis and fatty infiltration, which can be visualized with ultrasound. Several prospective studies have reported high sensitivities and specificities in the detection of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorders.</b> Although not investigated in large series of patients, different <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorders</b> tend to show specific changes on muscle ultrasound, which {{can be helpful in}} differential diagnosis. For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy results in a severe, homogeneous increase of muscle echo intensity with normal muscle thickness, whereas spinal muscular atrophy shows an inhomogeneous increase of echo intensity with severe atrophy. A major advantage of muscle ultrasound, compared to other imaging techniques, is its ability to visualize muscle movements, such as muscle contractions and fasciculations.

Patients with <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorders</b> typically have restrictive findings in pulmonary function tests due to poor control and function of respiratory muscles [1]. Lung function may be further compromised by progressive scoliosis, which produces lung compression and often a deformed chest cage, thus affecting chest compliance [1]. Pneumonia {{is one of the most}} common reasons for acute hospitalization among patients with CP and respiratory failure is the most common cause of mortality [2, 3, 4]. Scoliosis in <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>disorders</b> is progressive even after the growth period and severe scoliosis of ≥ 70 degrees, regardless of etiology, increases mortality because of respiratory failure [5, 6, 7].|$|R
