Two kinds of asymptotically perfect specular retroreflectors in two dimensions, <b>Notched</b> <b>angle</b> and Tube, are known at present.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris) using the notched and the un-notched specimen. Double v-notched bamboo and un-notched bamboo specimens were used {{to carry out the}} experiment. Notched- angles of 20, 30, 60, 80 and 90 º were made on each specimen. These were done to ascertain the effect of the notched-angle on {{the performance of}} the bamboo. Each specimen was placed in a Uniaxial Compression Machine and was crushed with respect to time. The results are plotted as crushing load against time. The results from the notched bamboo were compared with an un-notched bamboo to predict the effect of stress concentration. Microstructures of the bamboo were also analysed with the aid of an Electronic Microscope. It was observed that the variation in the notched angles had significant effect on the crushing strength of the bamboo. The higher the <b>notched</b> <b>angle</b> the lower the crushing loads. The variation in the notched angles also had significant effect on the crushing time. Therefore, the crushing time decreases with increases with the <b>notched</b> <b>angle.</b> Results also show that stress concentration had significant effect on the performance of bamboo. Results further show that a notched-angle of 20, 30, 60, 80 and 90 º gave a crushing load of 8. 0, 5. 55, 3. 33, 1. 33 and 0. 93 kN respectively and a crushing time of 42. 46, 35. 78, 21. 89, 18. 02 and 10. 30 s, respectively...|$|E

A compound sharp-crested weir consisting of two triangular parts with different <b>notch</b> <b>angles</b> was used. The lower triangular part of the weir handles the normal range of discharges while the upper part measures the higher peak flows.

40|$|AbstractThe {{stress field}} near {{the tip of}} a finite <b>angle</b> sharp <b>notch</b> is singular. However, unlike a crack, the order of the {{singularity}} at the notch tip is less than one-half. Under tensile loading, such a singularity is characterized by a generalized stress intensity factor which is analogous to the mode I stress intensity factor used in fracture mechanics, but which has order less than one-half. By using a cohesive zone model for a notional crack emanating from the notch tip, we relate the critical value of the generalized stress intensity factor to the fracture toughness. The results show that this relation depends not only on the <b>notch</b> <b>angle,</b> but also on the maximum stress of the cohesive zone model. As expected the dependence on that maximum stress vanishes as the <b>notch</b> <b>angle</b> approaches zero. The results of this analysis compare very well with a numerical (finite element) analysis in the literature. For mixed-mode loading the limits of applicability of using a mode I failure criterion are explored...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{failure of}} cracked {{components}} {{is governed by}} the stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the crack tip. The singular stress contribution is characterized by stress intensity factors. The stress intensity factors depend on the geometry of the component and on loading condition. This paper addresses the evaluation of stress intensity factors (SIFs) of opening, shearing and tearing modes for compact tension specimens for bonding homogeneous materials. The aim of this work is to find the optimal pre-cracked length, crack notch radius and crack <b>notch</b> <b>angle</b> in order to eliminate the effect of them on the SIF and then on the Fracture toughness. To achieve this goal, a three-dimension finite element analysis (FEA) model using ANSYS program is constructed for specimens made of homogeneous materials such as stainless steel bonding with epoxy as a filler material. The effects of <b>notch</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>notch</b> tip radius and pre-crack length on the stress intensity factors are studied for different fracture modes. The results for the stress intensity factors KI, KII and KIII are obtained using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approach...|$|R

Quartersawn boards of sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Carr.) and shioji (Japanese ash,Fraxinus spaethiana Lingelsh.) were used. Two types of specimen for the Iosipescu shear test were compared: a “standard specimen” whose <b>notch</b> <b>angle</b> is 90 ° and a “keyhole type specimen”, which is more easily prepared than the standard type. The shear modulus, yield shear stress, and failure shear stress of the keyhole-type specimen were compared to those of the standard specimen. Shear stress analysis was conducted using the finite element method (FEM). The results obtained were as follows: (1) The failure pattern obtained by the simplified Iosipescu shear test was similar to that seen with the standard Iosipescu shear test. (2) The shear modulus, yield stress, and failure stress obtained by the simplified Iosipescu shear test coincided with those by the standard Iosipescu shear test. (3) The principal strain angle and principal stress angle of the simplified Iosipescu shear test were about 45 °. (4) It is recognized that pure stress is applied to the strain-gauge regions in the simplified Iosipescu shear test, and it is expected that the shear properties are independent of the <b>notch</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor an {{infinite}} elastic plane {{with a sharp}} V-notch under the action of symmetrically loading at infinity, the length of crack initiation ahead of the V-notch’s tip is estimated according to a modified Griffith approach. Applying a new conservation integral to the perfectly plastic strip (Dugdale model) ahead of the V-notch’s tip, the relationship between notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) and notch tip opening displacement (NTOD) is presented. Also, the relationship between NSIF and perfectly plastic strip size (PPSS) is found. Since there are three fracture parameters (NSIF, NTOD, and PPSS) with changeable <b>notch</b> opening <b>angle</b> in two basic relationships, {{it is necessary to}} select one critical parameter with changeable <b>notch</b> opening <b>angle</b> or two independent critical parameters, respectively. With the help of a characteristic length, it is found by this new conservation integral that the NSIF, NTOD and energy release rate are equivalent in the case of small-scale yielding. Especially, the characteristic length possesses clear physical meaning and, for example, depends on both the critical NSIF and SIF or both the NTOD and CTOD, respectively, in which SIF and CTOD are from the tip of a crack degenerated from the sharp V-notch. The dependence of NSIF on NTOD and PPSS is presented according to the equivalence, and the critical NSIF depending on the critical NTOD with a <b>notch</b> opening <b>angle</b> is also predicted...|$|R
