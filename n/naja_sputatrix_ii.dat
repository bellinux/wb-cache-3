Studies of the action of venom and venom constituents on Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of honeybee venom (Apis mellifera), three snake venoms (<b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix,</b> Vipera russellii and Crotalus adamanteus) and the polypeptide melittin (a component of honeybee venom) was investigated against the gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined and action against proliferating and non-proliferating cells was in the order: Apis mellifera venom > melittin > <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> > Vipera russellii venom > Crotalus adamanteus venom. Cell lysis was determined by absorbancy changes and {{was caused by the}} more active venoms (Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix)</b> and melittin. Alteration of the permeability of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli cells harvested in mid-log phase was followed principally by measuring β-galactosidase release from cells. Venom activity decreased in the same order as MIC above. Phospholipases A₂ from Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venoms, melittin and polymixin B (polypeptide antibiotic) increased β-galactosidase release. No synergism between the phospholipases A₂ and melittin was seen under the conditions employed. Separation of Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venoms was carried out by gel filtration and electrophoresis. The action of venom components implies that the antibacterial activity of whole venom is not totally accounted for by that of the venom polypeptide toxins melittin or direct lytic factor (DLF). That the antibacterial activity of Apis mellifera and <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venoms and melittin is due at least in part to membrane disruption is supported by electron microscopy studies...|$|R

40|$|Cancer {{has become}} a global health problem arisen from {{exposure}} to benzo(a) pyrene. Interleukin- 2 is one of immune system components believed to play roles in eradicating cancer. Cobra venom has antitumor effect and also contain protease which could boost up immune system. This research was aimed at analyzing <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venoms effect to increase interleukin- 2 level in blood sera of mice induced by benzo(a) pyrene. Four group of Balb-C mice were used. The first group (control) and second group (treatment with <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom) consist of 5 mices. There are 6 mices used in group 3 and 4, both were injected intramuscularly by benzo(a) pyrene (0, 3 L/ 0, 01 mL oleum oil) at day 1, 8 and 15. Three months after, observation was carried out to see changes occured in their liver and lungs. <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom 0, 1 mL (diluted in saline 1 : 100) was given to group 2 and 4 for 30 days. Blood was collected from all groups and centrifuge to form sera. Level of interleukin- 2 in sera was measured by ELISA method. The results show that Group 2 has the highest mean level of interleukin- 2 (136, 837 pg/mL), and group 3 has the lowest (8, 996 pg/mL). Level of interleukin- 2 in group 4 is slightly higher than group 3 (10, 632 pg/mL). Kruskal-Wallis analysis result come with Sig. 0, 155; therefore shows no significance(p> 0, 05). It is therefore concluded that <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom do not increase interleukin- 2 level in blood sera of mice induced by benzo(a) pyren...|$|R

40|$|Mucuna pruriens Linn. (velvet bean) {{has been}} used by native Nigerians as a {{prophylactic}} for snakebite. Rats pretreated with M. pruriens seed extract (MPE) have been shown to protect against the lethal and cardiovascular depressant effects of <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> (Javan spitting cobra) venoms, and the protective effect involved immunological neutralization of the venom toxins. To investigate further the mechanism of the protective effect of MPE pretreatment against cobra venom toxicity, the actions of <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom on spontaneously beating rat atria and aortic rings isolated from both MPE pretreated and untreated rats were studied. Our results showed that the MPE pretreatment conferred protection against cobra venom-induced depression of atrial contractility and atrial rate in the isolated atrial preparations, but it had no effect on the venom-induced contractile response of aortic ring preparation. These observations suggested that the protective effect of MPE pretreatment against cobra venom toxicity involves a direct protective action of MPE on the heart function, in addition to the known immunological neutralization mechanism, and that the protective effect does not involve action on blood vessel contraction. The results also suggest that M. pruriens seed may contain novel cardioprotective agent with potential therapeutic value...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} specific regions/loops of cardiotoxin from <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom in mediating its cytolytic activity is evaluated {{using a new}} cytolytic assay. In this assay, the amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) that is released upon lysis of the cellular membranes by the cytotoxin has been measured as an index of cytolysis. This newly developed CAT system is more sensitive than the traditional haemolysis method utilizing red blood cells or the lactate dehydrogenase assay for cytolysis. Series of chimaeric toxin molecules have been constructed by swapping the loops between highly hydrophilic neurotoxin and highly hydrophobic cardiotoxin molecules from <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix,</b> which are known to exhibit structural similarity (three-finger conformation) but to have different functional properties. Comparison of the cytolytic activities of the recombinant chimaeric toxins demonstrated the possible involvement of all three loops of cardiotoxin in its cytolytic potency. However, the first two loops of the protein appear to make the major contribution to its lytic activity. cDNAs encoding cardiotoxin and the chimaeric toxins, when expressed in transfected cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, resulted in cell lysis, indicating that these cDNAs can be developed as useful cytolytic agents...|$|R

40|$|Naja sumatrana, the Equatorial {{spitting}} cobra, {{is listed}} {{as one of the}} medically important species in Southeast Asia and is the common spitting cobra in Peninsula Malaysia. The aims of this study are to investigate the toxinology, proteome and pharmacokinetic characteristics of N. sumatrana venom, which will contribute to management of cobra envenomation. The lethality and enzymatic activities of N. sumatrana were compared to venoms from two other regional spitting cobras: <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix,</b> <b>Naja</b> siamensis and a non-spitting cobra Naja kaouthia, which also occurs in Malaysia. Previously, the three spitting cobras were considered as belonging to one species, N. sputatrix. Results showed that the three spitting cobra venoms possess different venom composition, but all three contain basic phospholipases A 2 and high content of polypeptide cardiotoxins. The proteome of N. sumatrana venom was investigated using shotgun analysis, combination of multi-dimensional chromatography and 2 DE. Shotgun analysis revealed the presence of 50 individual proteins in the venom, with three finger toxins (both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins) and phospholipase A 2 constituted about 38...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} {{and organization of}} the genes encoding the long-chain neurotoxins and four other isoforms of weak neurotoxins in the venom of <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> are reported. The genes contained three exons interrupted by two introns, a structure similar to {{other members of the}} three-finger toxin family. The proteins encoded by these genes, however, show varied affinity towards nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes showed that the weak neurotoxin gene is confined to a distinct group. We also observe that specific mutations of the gene provide the diversity in function in these toxins while maintaining a common structural scaffold. This forms the first report where the molecular basis of evolution of postsynaptic neurotoxins from an ancestral gene can be demonstrated using the same species of snake...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} genomic structure, {{organization}} {{and the presence of}} multiple isoforms of the gene encoding cardiotoxins (CTX) of <b>Naja</b> <b>naja</b> <b>sputatrix.</b> The cardiotoxin gene consists of six CTX isoforms, each (2. 2 kb) having three exons and two introns. Two possible transcription initiation sites as well as consensus TATA boxes and transcription factor binding motifs, AP- 2, NFIL- 6 /C/EBP, NF-κB and PuF have been identified in the 5 ′-region of the gene. The CTX gene isoforms show nucleotide variations at specific segments in exon 2 and exon 3, which correspond to the functional domains in the three-finger loop structure of the cardiotoxin molecule. The diverse functions of cardiotoxins together with our findings suggest that the cardiotoxin gene isoforms may have evolved under adaptive pressure through a positive Darwinian selection process...|$|R

5000|$|The Indian cobra is {{classified}} under the genus Naja {{of the family}} Elapidae. The genus was first described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. The species Naja naja was first described by the Swedish physician, zoologist, and botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus Naja was split into several subgenera based on various factors, including morphology, diet, and habitat. Naja naja {{is part of the}} subgenus Naja, along with all the other species Asiatic cobras, including Naja kaouthia, <b>Naja</b> siamensis, <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix,</b> and the rest. Naja naja is considered to be the prototypical cobra species within the Naja subgenus, and within the entire Naja genus. All Asiatic species of Naja were considered conspecific with Naja naja until the 1990s, often as subspecies thereof. Many of the subspecies were later found to be artificial or composites. This causes much potential confusion when interpreting older literature.|$|R
40|$|Weak {{neurotoxins}} from {{snake venom}} are small proteins with five disulfide bonds, {{which have been}} shown to be poor binders of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. We report on the cloning and sequencing of four cDNAs encoding weak neurotoxins from <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom glands. The protein encoded by one of them, Wntx- 5, has been synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and characterized. The physicochemical properties of the synthetic toxin (sWntx- 5) agree with those anticipated for the natural toxin. We show that this toxin interacts with relatively low affinity (K(d) = 180 nm) with the muscular-type acetylcholine receptor of the electric organ of T. marmorata, and with an even weaker affinity (90 microm) with the neuronal alpha 7 receptor of chicken. Electrophysiological recordings using isolated mouse hemidiaphragm and frog cutaneous pectoris nerve-muscle preparations revealed no blocking activity of sWntx- 5 at microm concentrations. Our data confirm previous observations that natural weak neurotoxins from cobras have poor affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors...|$|R
50|$|The Javan {{spitting}} cobra {{is found}} mostly in tropical forests and wet forest, but the species adapts incredibly well {{to a wide}} variety of habitats across its range on the islands, including more arid regions, dry woodlands, and cultivated hill country. In the island of Komodo, it has been observed in a variety of habitats including dry savanna and deciduous monsoon forest. It has also been reported that specimens in the island of Komodo are reluctant to spit, but field observations and suggests the opposite. This species is easy prey for the Komodo dragon. <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> is very defensive and readily spits out venom when it feels threatened. It is a terrestrial snake that's nocturnal in nature. It preys predominantly on small mammals such as small rats and mice, but it will also feed on frogs, other snakes, and lizards. Herpetologist Shine Boeadi, in a study published in 1998, measured and dissected 80 Javan specimens of this species and found that most prey items were mammals.|$|R
40|$|The lethal and enzymatic {{activities}} of venom from Naja sumatrana (Equatorial spitting cobra) were determined and compared to venoms from three other Southeast Asian cobras (<b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix,</b> <b>Naja</b> siamensis and Naja kaouthia). All four venoms exhibited the common characteristic {{enzymatic activities}} of Asiatic cobra venoms: low protease, phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and L-amino acid oxidase activities, moderately high acetylcholinesterase and hyaluronidase activities and high phospholipase A 2. Fractionation of N. sumatrana venom by Resource® S cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA) yielded nine major protein peaks, with all except the acidic protein peak being lethal to mice. Most of the protein peaks exhibit enzymatic activities, and L-amino acid oxidase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, acetylcholinesterase, 5 '-nucleotidase and hyaluronidase exist in multiple forms. Comparison of the Resource® S chromatograms {{of the four}} cobra venoms clearly indicates that the protein composition of N. sumatrana venom is distinct from venoms {{of the other two}} spitting cobras, N. sputatrix (Javan spitting cobra) and N. siamensis (Indochinese spitting cobra). The results support the revised systematics of the Asiatic cobra based on multivariate analysis of morphological characters. The three spitting cobra venoms exhibit two common features: the presence of basic, potentially pharmacologically active phospholipases A 2 and a high content of polypeptide cardiotoxin, suggesting that the pathophysiological actions of the three spitting cobra venoms may be similar...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Phospholipase A 2 liberates free {{fatty acids}} and lysophospholipids upon {{hydrolysis}} of phospholipids and these products are often associated with detrimental effects such as inflammation and cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effect of neutral phospholipase from snake venom has been investigated. Results A neutral anticoagulant secretory phospholipase A 2 (nPLA) from the venom of <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> (Malayan spitting cobra) {{has been found to}} reduce infarct volume in rats subjected to focal transient cerebral ischemia and to alleviate the neuronal damage in organotypic hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Real-time PCR based gene expression analysis showed that anti-apoptotic and pro-survival genes have been up-regulated in both in vivo and in vitro models. Staurosporine or OGD mediated apoptotic cell death in astrocytoma cells has also been found to be reduced by nPLA with a corresponding reduction in caspase 3 activity. Conclusion We have found that a secretory phospholipase (nPLA) purified from snake venom could reduce infarct volume in rodent stroke model. nPLA, has also been found to reduce neuronal cell death, apoptosis and promote cell survival in vitro ischemic conditions. In all conditions, the protective effects could be seen at sub-lethal concentrations of the protein. </p...|$|R

In Nigeria, the seed is used as oral prophylactics for snakebite. Aim of the study To study the protective effects of Mucuna pruriens seed extract against the lethalities of various snake venoms. Materials and methods Rats were pre-treated with Mucuna pruriens seed extract and challenged with various snake venoms. The effectiveness of anti-Mucuna pruriens (anti-MPE) antibody to neutralize the lethalities of snake venoms was investigated by in vitro neutralization. Results In rats, MPE pre-treatment conferred effective protection against lethality of <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> venom and moderate protection against Calloselasma rhodostoma venom. Indirect ELISA and immunoblotting studies showed that there were extensive cross-reactions between anti-MPE IgG and venoms from many different genera of poisonous snakes, suggesting the involvement of immunological neutralization in the protective effect of MPE pre-treatment against snake venom poisoning. In vitro neutralization experiments showed that the anti-MPE antibodies effectively neutralized the lethalities of Asiatic cobra (Naja) venoms, but were not very effective against other venoms tested.

40|$|The NGF (nerve growth factor) from <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> {{has been}} {{purified}} by gel filtration followed by reversed-phase HPLC. The protein showed {{a very high}} ability to induce neurite formation in PC 12 cells relative to the mouse NGF. Two cDNAs encoding isoforms of NGF have been cloned and an active recombinant NGF, sputa NGF, has been produced in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged fusion protein. Sputa NGF {{has been found to}} be non-toxic under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. The induction of neurite outgrowth by this NGF has been found to involve the high-affinity trkA–p 75 NTR complex of receptors. The pro-survival mechanism of p 75 NTR has been mediated by the activation of nuclear factor κB gene by a corresponding down-regulation of inhibitory κB gene. Real-time PCR and protein profiling (by surface-enhanced laser-desorption–ionization time-of-flight) have confirmed that sputa NGF up-regulates the expression of the endogenous NGF in PC 12 cells. Preliminary microarray analysis has also shown that sputa NGF is capable of promoting additional beneficial effects such as the up-regulation of arginine vasopressin receptor 1 A, voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel. Hence, sputa NGF forms a new and useful NGF...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the species of birds, there is also wild groups of monkeys kra or also commonly called long-tailed monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). They live in groups up to a dozen tails consisting of several males and females. The main food is the young leaves and fruits of mangrove forests such as pidada (Sonneratia caseolaris). Long-tailed monkeys {{have an important role}} in the Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary, as they help spread the seeds of forest plants. The seeds that can not be digested will be removed again along with the feces.Another type of mammals that can be found in the sanctuary, but rarely seen, is the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea). Small carnivorous fish eaters and various aquatic animals are especially active at night (nocturnal).

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the venoms of the following eight species of snakes: Naja haje, Naja kaouthia, Naja melanoleuca, Naja mossambica, Naja nigricollis, <b>Naja</b> siamensis, <b>Naja</b> <b>sputatrix</b> and Pseudechis australis. The first seven species are cobras, from the genus Naja, and are found throughout Africa and Asia, while the king brown/mulga snake (P. australis) is native to Australia. Cobras (Naja spp.) are a medically important species of snake as {{they are one of}} the major contributors to the incidence of snakebite in Africa and Asia. In the current study, a pharmacological profile of the neurotoxic and coagulant activity of each of the seven snakes was established. The data indicated that the rank order neurotoxic potency (based on t 90 values), from most to least potent, was: N. kaouthia > N. sputatrix > N. melanoleuca > N. haje > N. mossambica > N. siamensis > N. nigricollis. Further studies also confirmed the presence of anticoagulant proteins in all seven Naja spp. venoms tested. Following from these preliminary findings, experiments examining the in vitro effectiveness of antivenoms were completed using Egyptian cobra (Naja haje) venom, as this snake has been documented to come in contact regularly with humans in northern Africa (i. e. it is the snake of choice for charmers and street performers). Antivenom cross-reactivity (also known as paraspecificity or cross-neutralisation) is when an antivenom raised against a distinct snake venom is effective in neutralising the venom from an unrelated species. In these experiments, native commercial antivenom (i. e. CSL Ltd) raised against the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus) effectively neutralised the neurotoxic activity of Egyptian cobra venom. Likewise, antivenom raised against the Egyptian cobra was able to neutralise the neurotoxic effect of tiger snake venom. This may be due to immunological and biochemical similarities within the elapid family of snakes. Subsequently, an α-neurotoxin (α-elapitoxin-Nh 1) was isolated from the Egyptian cobra venom and was pharmacologically characterised. α-Elapitoxin-Nh 1 abolished nerve-mediated twitches with a t 90 value of one third the time of the whole venom (i. e. ~ 12 min versus ~ 38 min). Moreover, α-elapitoxin-Nh 1 inhibited cumulative concentration-response curves to carbachol in the unstimulated chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation with a calculated pA 2 value of 8. 2, i. e. approximately 80 times more potent that d-tubocurarine. The molecular weight of α-elapitoxin-Nh 1 was 6812 Da, and partial amino acid sequencing showed a high sequence homology with other elapid toxins isolated from Naja spp. venoms, as well as toxins from Australian elapids such as α-scutoxin- 1 (O. s. scutellatus) and oxylepitoxin- 1 (O. microlepidotus). The clinical outcomes due to the presence of anticoagulant proteins in snake venoms can be significant after snakebite, yet the mechanism behind these effects is still not fully understood. To gain further insight into these toxins, an anticoagulant protein (Ac-Pa 1) was isolated from the venom of the king brown (mulga) snake (Pseudechis australis). Ac-Pa 1 had a molecular mass of 13, 128 Da with PLA₂ activity of 262 ± 6 U/ml. Ac-Pa 1 inhibited the effect of innovin, (lyophilised recombinant human tissue factor) on normal plasma and also prolonged aPTT. CSL black snake antivenom inhibited the anticoagulant effect of Ac-Pa 1. The full amino acid sequence of Ac-Pa 1 showed it to be highly homologous with previously isolated enzymes from the king brown snake, as well as toxins isolated from Notechis spp. and Naja spp. venoms, albeit with significant amino acid substitutions at key points central to the structure function relationship of this particular class of toxin. It is evident that amino acid substitutions in key locations within a protein sequence of a snake toxin have a marked impact on the biochemical and pharmacological activity of that toxin, and possibly the whole venom. This research is the first to pharmacologically compare seven (N. haje, N. kaouthia, N. melanoleuca, N. mossambica, N. nigricollis, N. siamensis and N. sputatrix) different cobra venoms from both spitting and non-spitting species, is important in the contribution of snakebite envenoming and treatment with appropriate antivenom, and further serves as a pathway for new drug discoveries and targets using snake venoms and toxins...|$|R
