40|$|A surface {{immunofluorescence}} assay (SIFA) using live spirochetes was analyzed and compared with Western blot (WB), fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS), microhemagglutination (MHA-TP), and Treponema pallidum immobilization (TPI) assays for detecting serum antibodies to T. pallidum {{in patients with}} syphilis, in disease controls, and in healthy subjects. SIFA and WB were 99 % sensitive (99 of 100 positive specimens) and specific (140 of 140 negative specimens); FTA-ABS showed a sensitivity and a specificity of 90 and 89 % (90 of 100 positive and 125 of 140 <b>negative</b> <b>specimens),</b> respectively. MHA-TP showed a sensitivity of 84 % (84 of 100 positive specimens) and a specificity of 98. 5 % (138 of 140 <b>negative</b> <b>specimens).</b> Finally, TPI had a sensitivity of 52 % (52 of 100 positive specimens) and a specificity of 100 % (140 of 140 <b>negative</b> <b>specimens).</b> The T. pallidum SIFA was therefore highly specific, showing no equivocal reactivities with control sera, and sensitive.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Microbiological {{investigations}} of vitreous fluid (VF) and aqueous humour (AH) specimens have often failed {{to detect the}} infecting agent in infectious endophthalmitis, resulting in a clinical dilemma regarding therapy. In this study, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was evaluated in the diagnosis of bacterial and Propionibacterium acnes endophthalmitis.  METHODS— 58 intraocular specimens (30  VF and 28  AH) from 55  cases of endophthalmitis and 20  specimens (14  VF and 6  AH) as controls from non-infective disorders were processed for microbiological investigations. Nested PCR directed at the 16 S rDNA using universal primers for eubacterial genome was done. PCR for P acnes was performed on specimens microbiologically negative by conventional techniques but eubacterial genome positive.  RESULTS—Of the 20  controls from non-infective cases, one (5 %) was positive using eubacterial primers and none with P acnes primers. PCR for eubacterial genome showed 100 % correlation with 20  (34. 5 %) bacteriologically positive specimens. Eubacterial genome, was detected in 17  (44. 7 %) of 38  bacteriologically <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> and nine (52. 9 %) out of the 17  were positive for P acnes genome. Among the 21  eubacterial PCR <b>negative</b> <b>specimens,</b> seven were fungus positive. By inclusion of PCR, microbiologically positive specimens increased from 46. 5 % to 75. 8 %. PCR on AH was as sensitive as that on VF {{for the detection of}} both eubacterial and the P acnes genome.  CONCLUSION—PCR performed on AH and VF is a reliable tool for the diagnosis of bacterial and P acnes endophthalmitis particularly in smear and culture <b>negative</b> <b>specimens.</b>    Keywords: polymerase chain reaction; bacterial endophthalmitis; infectious endophthalmiti...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel crack {{specimen}} {{has been}} designed to study brittle fracture in mode II loading. The test specimen is simulated using finite element analysis and the crack tip parameters KII and T are calculated. Both tensile and compressive loading {{can be applied to the}} specimen. For tensile loading where the specimen is subjected to positive shear, the T-stress is positive. Whereas T is negative for compressive loading, that is when the specimen is subjected to negative shear. Fracture tests are carried out on several specimens made of PMMA. The Mode II fracture toughness is determined for both tensile loading (positive T specimens) and compressive loading (<b>negative</b> T <b>specimens).</b> Experimental results show that mode II fracture toughness for <b>negative</b> T <b>specimens</b> are significantly larger than those for positive T specimens...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{laboratories}} performing indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) {{testing for}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 antibody and participating in the Centers for Disease Control Model Performance Evaluation Program in 1988 are presented. Approximately 90 % of all laboratories receiving specimen panels or questionnaires furnished results to the Centers for Disease Control. In September 1988, 111 reports were received from IIF laboratories from 34 states and nine countries; most of these laboratories did IIF testing {{in conjunction with other}} antibody tests. Hospital laboratories were {{the most common type of}} laboratory participating in the program. Laboratories that performed IIF employed fewer personnel and performed testing less frequently than did laboratories that performed enzyme immunoassays or Western blot (immunoblot) tests and were likely to use a commercial test kit. Most of the laboratories that referred specimens for IIF testing sent them to the state laboratory. The analytic specificity for the Model Performance Evaluation Program specimens was 98. 5 % when indeterminate results on a <b>negative</b> <b>specimen</b> were considered correct (negative) and 89. 6 % when indeterminate results on a <b>negative</b> <b>specimen</b> were considered incorrect; analytic sensitivity was 94. 8 % when indeterminate results on a positive specimen were correct (positive) and 91. 4 % when indeterminate results on a positive specimen were considered incorrect. When indeterminate results were considered correct, all types of laboratories (blood bank, state, hospital, independent, and other) had analytic specificities over 96 %, and all manufacturers had analytic specificities above 95 %. All types of laboratories had analytic sensitivities over 92 %, and analytic sensitivities were above 94 % for all manufacturers and reagent sources except Cellular Products. Comparison of percentages of correct responses between IIF and Western blot assays on those samples for which there was good agreement on the target interpretation revealed no significant differences. Both individual donor and diluted materials were included in the evaluations; the diluted donor material presented the greatest testing difficulty. Within-survey reproducibility was about 93 % overall and by specimen type. Between-survey reproducibility was about 81 % for <b>negative</b> and indeterminate <b>specimens</b> and 88. 5 % for positive specimens, for an overall between-survey reproducibility of 84. 3 %. Differences in performance were noted when results were compared by type of laboratory and test manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Drug {{resistance}} {{continues to}} threaten recent global progress toward tuberculosis (TB) control. Rapid and accurate detection of resistance is imperative for successful treatment outcomes and reduction in transmission of resistant strains. Methods: Global frequency {{and distribution of}} mutations associated with isoniazid resistance were characterized through an exhaustive systematic literature review. The diagnostic performance of a newly redesigned line probe assay (LPA) among both Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear positive and <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> was evaluated using cross-sectional data from a large multisite diagnostic study. Additionally, the association of clinical characteristics and valid test results (susceptible or resistant) was assessed using logistic regression. Individual probe results from two LPAs were compared to both sequencing data and phenotypic susceptibility results, and the relative contribution of absent wild type probe hybridization to the detection of phenotypic resistance was determined by comparing the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: Globally 64 % of isoniazid resistant specimens harbor the katG 315 mutation and 19 % harbor the inhA- 15 mutation, together these two mutations are associated with 80 % of isoniazid resistance. Sensitivity and specificity of the LPA for multidrug-resistant TB detection were 95. 1 % (95 %CI 92. 6, 96. 9) and 99. 1 % (95 %CI 97. 1, 100. 0) respectively, among both AFB smear positive and <b>negative</b> <b>specimens.</b> Sensitivity for isoniazid resistance was significantly lower among AFB smear <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> at 81. 6 % (95 %CI 65. 1, 91. 7) compared to 94. 9 % (95 %CI 92. 4, 96. 6) among AFB smear positive specimens. Additionally, AFB smear gradation {{was significantly associated with}} valid test results after controlling for HIV status, diabetic status, body mass index, and history of previous treatment. The inclusion of absent wild type probe hybridization in resistance classification for LPAs significantly improved detection of both rifampicin and flouroquinolone phenotypic resistance (P< 0. 001). Conclusions: Variation in mutation frequency justifies local monitoring of resistance associated mutations. The newly redesigned LPA performed well among both AFB smear positive and <b>negative</b> <b>specimens,</b> however, bacillary load influenced both the probability of obtaining an interpretable result and test sensitivity. The evaluation of individual LPA probe results demonstrated that current LPA resistance classification algorithms successfully differentiate between phenotypically susceptible and resistant specimen...|$|E
40|$|With the {{discovery}} that the coccidian parasite Cryptosporidium sp. can cause severe symptoms in humans, implementation of many diagnostic techniques rapidly followed. The infection is self-limiting in patients with normal immune systems but chronic in the immunosuppressed patient. With the eventual {{development and use of}} therapeutic agents, it will become very important to find Cryptosporidium sp., even in low numbers, in fecal specimens. Production of a highly specific and sensitive antibody by use of cloning techniques has provided another diagnostic tool. Formalinized positive human fecal specimens (n = 99) and <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> (n = 198), of which 115 contained yeastlike fungi and other organisms, were tested in blind trials by use of a monoclonal antibody. Sensitivity was 100 % with 3 - to 4 + fluorescence on all cryptosporidial oocysts, both in light and heavy infections. The organisms were round and easily visible (4 to 6 micron), showing apple-green to yellow fluorescence against a dark background free of nonspecific fluorescence. Specificity was also 100 % with all 99 positive Cryptosporidium sp. specimens exhibiting fluorescence and all 198 <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> showing no fluorescence. All positive and <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> were previously confirmed by the hot modified acid-fast technique. However, seven specimens previously considered negative by this acid-fast method were positive by the monoclonal antibody technique. These specimens were confirmed as positive, after extensive examination of additional smears prepared by the modified hot acid-fast method revealed rare organisms, emphasizing the increased sensitivity of the monoclonal antibody technique. Since acid-fast stains do not always consistently stain all oocysts, the increased sensitivity of the monoclonal reagent provides an excellent screening method...|$|E

Considering the high prevalence of culture-negative specimens, any method that identifies such specimens is of interest. The aim was to evaluate a new screening concept for flow cytometry analysis (FCA). The outcomes were evaluated against urine culture, uropathogen species and three conventional screening methods. A prospective, consecutive study examined 1, 312 urine specimens, collected during January and February 2012. The specimens were analyzed using the Sysmex UF 1000 i FCA. Based on the FCA data culture <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> were identified in a new model by use of linear discriminant analysis (FCA-LDA). In total 1, 312 patients were included. In- and outpatients represented 19. 6 % and 79. 4 %, respectively; 68. 3 % of the specimens originated from women. Of the 610 culture-positive specimens, Escherichia coli represented 64 %, enterococci 8 % and Klebsiella spp. 7 %. Screening with FCA-LDA at 95 % sensitivity identified 42 % (552 / 1312) as culture <b>negative</b> <b>specimens</b> when UTI was defined according to European guidelines. The proposed screening method was either superior or similar in comparison to the three conventional screening methods. In conclusion, the proposed/suggested and new FCA-LDA screening method was superior or similar to three conventional screening methods. We recommend the proposed screening method to be used in clinic to exclude culture <b>negative</b> <b>specimens,</b> to reduce workload, costs and the turnaround time. In addition, the FCA data may add information that enhance handling and support diagnosis of patients with suspected UTI pending urine culture.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the relative efficiency of three different culture media for isolating fungi in patients suspected of having noninvasive fungal sinusitis. Methods: A prospective study was performed of 209 operative samples of sinus "fungal-like" mucin from 134 patients on 171 occasions and processed for microscopy and fungal culture in Sabouraud's dextrose agar, potato dextrose agar, and broth media. Results: Ninety-three (69 %) of 134 patients had evidence of fungal infection. Two-thirds of patients had negative microscopy samples yet 56 % of these went on to positive cultures. Forty-five percent cultured Aspergillus genus. Discrepancy between the fungi cultured in different media and on different occasions was common. With a single culture medium up to 19 % of patients and 15 % of samples would have been falsely labeled fungal negative. Conclusion: Increasing the number and type of fungal culture media used increases the number and range of fungal isolates from mucin in patients with the features of fungal sinusitis. <b>Negative</b> <b>specimen</b> microscopy is unreliable.

40|$|AIMS: Human {{herpesvirus}} 8 (HHV- 8) is now {{acknowledged as}} the infective cofactor in {{the pathogenesis of}} Kaposi's sarcoma. The mode by which HHV- 8 causes Kaposi's sarcoma is unresolved and {{it is probable that}} it acts in conjunction with other factors including cytokines, anti-apoptosis proteins, and cell surface receptors. CD 40, a cell membrane receptor belonging to the tumour necrosis factor receptor super family, promotes B cell survival and is expressed constitutively on endothelial cells. It is upregulated on cytokine treatment and has been documented recently in Kaposi's sarcoma. Because the HHV- 8 genome contains cytokine homologues, this study investigated whether CD 40 expression in Kaposi's sarcoma correlated with HHV- 8 status, using a unique set of HHV- 8 positive and <b>negative</b> <b>specimens.</b> METHODS: Twenty one paraffin wax embedded samples of Kaposi's sarcoma were selected, of which 18 were screened for the presence of HHV- 8 using both conventional solution phase and TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

To {{determine the}} number of false positives reported by the use of screen-only (unconfirmed) results, 535 screen-positive meco-nium specimens were subjected to confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fifty-seven per-cent of the samples were confirmed positive for {{one or more of the}} drugs under investigation, showing that a false-positive rate as high as 43 % may exist when unconfirmed screening results are used.
