They made their first full-length feature Spiritual Warriors in 2005, written and executive produced by Garcia and John-Roger, starring Garcia, {{and based on}} John-Roger's book [...] "Spiritual Warrior: The Art of Spiritual Living."

5000|$|The lyrics, {{written by}} Masvidal, are poetic, philosophically and spiritually laden texts that take on {{subjects}} such as perceiving the world as whole, distinguishing reality and illusion, concentration and meditation. Many of the songs incorporate themes, titles or excerpts from other works: [...] "Veil of Maya" [...] takes its title from a George William Russell poem of the same name, while [...] "Sentiment" [...] quotes a prayer from Whispers From Eternity by Paramahansa Yogananda. Many influences from oriental mysticism and religions {{as well as some}} <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>themes</b> are present. The whole lyrical perspective is positive, humane and humble, all rather atypical qualities within the realm of death metal.|$|R
5000|$|The Books {{began working}} on The Way Out in late 2008. Zammuto spoke of the album's <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>themes</b> in an {{interview}} in April 2009, saying they took samples from self-help and hypnotherapy cassettes. When asked to describe the album, Zammuto said [...] "You're getting verrry sleepy." [...] On April 5, 2010, the duo announced that The Way Out would be released through Temporary Residence Limited in July. On April 27 Pitchfork Media began streaming the track [...] "Beautiful People", which Zammuto described as [...] "a three part christian harmony mixed with a sort of euro-disco-trash beat, an orchestra’s worth of sampled brass and lyrics about the twelfth root of two (my favorite irrational number), trigonometry and tangrams". The album was released on July 20.|$|R

5000|$|Following Hegel in 19th-century Germany, Nietzsche {{wrote his}} magnum opus, Thus Spoke Zarathustra that {{similarly}} touched upon this key {{figure of the}} Persian imagination. Nietzsche's book offers a radical critique, almost a total debunking, of the whole Western tradition of philosophy. It is no mere accident that Nietzsche chose to articulate his critical views {{in the name of}} Zarathustra. The end of the 19th century was not the only or the last time Zarathustra played a prominent role in shaping Western consciousness and philosophic discourse. In 1990s Persian influences on the millennial fever, and on other <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>themes,</b> were so strong that Harold Bloom, the eminent American critic, suggested that {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century should in truth be called [...] "a return to Zoroastrian origins." ...|$|R

[...] Lyrically, despite being a song about a trip to the unconscious, scholars have noticed subtexts within the song's meaning. Vicente noted that postmodernism and <b>new</b> <b>age</b> <b>themes</b> are prevalent within the lyrics, especially with regards to their incapability of articulating the concept of the truth, as well as the song's theme of meditation and relax. Islamic mystic and sexual themes have also been noted within the song's lyrics. Vicente further found that the cliché references to [...] "honey", [...] "longing and yearning", and the sexual connotations of being [...] "wet on the inside" [...] does not relate to [...] "secular" [...] love, but to [...] "ecstatic" [...] Sufi poetry. The lyrics allude to concepts of movement which are [...] "central" [...] to Sufi philosophy: [...] "It indicates achieving fana through sema (getting 'lost' and 'leaving logic and reason to the arms of unconsciousness')".|$|R
2500|$|During his 1904 {{retreat from}} Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical {{experience}} which suffused him with [...] "love for the whole world" [...] and convinced him that [...] "men at heart are divine." [...] This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the World Congress of Faiths (in imitation of the World Parliament of Religions). Younghusband published {{a number of books}} with what one might call <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>themes,</b> with titles like The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud. (1920); Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be) (1924); and Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole (1927). The latter drew the admiration of Lord Baden-Powell, the Boy Scouts founder. Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would {{come to be known as}} the Gaia hypothesis, pantheism, and a Christlike [...] "world leader" [...] living on the planet [...] "Altair" [...] (or [...] "Stellair"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.|$|R

Single Gun Theory reconvened in Vancouver, Canada in May 1991 to record their second album, Millions, Like Stars in My Hands, Daggers in My Heart, Wage War, which was issued in Australia in December. It peaked in the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it was [...] "a unique blend of lush, mellow dance grooves, ethnic sampling and fragile, beguiling female vocals." [...] AllMusic's Brendan Swift opined that it provided [...] "Flawlessly executed tracks brushed with Indian, Turkish, and South-East Asian sounds... one that ultimately fails to convey the depth suggested by the <b>new</b> <b>age</b> <b>themes</b> and multicultural music." [...] A single from the album, [...] "From a Million Miles" [...] (November 1991), {{was used in the}} pilot episode (April 1994) of Canadian TV series, Due South, and was issued on the series second soundtrack album, Due South, Volume II: The Original Television Soundtrack (1998). It was also used on the soundtrack of the Australian feature film, Reckless Kelly (1993). Another album track, [...] "Great Palaces of Immortal Splendour" [...] was used on The Heartbreak Kid (1993) soundtrack.|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{historian}} of religions Olav Hammer's doctoral dissertation on the epistemological {{strategies of the}} current European esoteric traditions is a remarkable contribution {{to the understanding of}} the historical continuum ranging from traditional Theosophy to <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> religion. Hammer's book brings together a number of different and relevant themes by discussing highly differentiated empirical material in the shape of religious texts. The main question, which the book seeks to explain, is how various religious phenomena are adapted to the conditions of the modern world? In order to answer the question, Hammer examines three discursive themes which are fundamental to the esotericism of Theosophy and subsequently <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> religion. These <b>themes</b> are: "Tradition", "Scientism", and "Experience"...|$|R

50|$|Water in Time and Space {{features}} a large variety of styles, such as march, orchestral, western and folk, influenced by Jungian, <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> and Andean <b>themes.</b> The album has no particular total concept, {{unlike most of}} Hirasawa's solo output. Free from the constraints of P-Model and the band's nervous energy, the album is comparatively light and brisk. Though created with heavy use of digital devices, {{it is one of}} Hirasawa's least electronic works, with prominent use of acoustic tones throughout. In the manner of P-Model's 1986 album One Pattern, Hirasawa also put emphasis on sampling, with such sounds as bird chirping and coin rolling being used as rhythmic backing.|$|R
5000|$|Fascinated by Christian eschatology and the {{perception}} of a coming <b>New</b> <b>Age,</b> a common <b>theme</b> among Kandinsky's first seven Compositions is the apocalypse (the end of the world as we know it). Writing of the [...] "artist as prophet" [...] in his book, Concerning the Spiritual In Art, Kandinsky created paintings in the years immediately preceding World War I showing a coming cataclysm which would alter individual and social reality. Having a fervent belief in Orthodox Christianity, Kandinsky drew upon the biblical stories of Noah's Ark, Jonah and the whale, Christ's resurrection, the four horsemen of the Apocalypse in the book of Revelation, Russian folktales and the common mythological experiences of death and rebirth. Never attempting to picture any one of these stories as a narrative, he used their veiled imagery as symbols of the archetypes of death-rebirth and destruction-creation he felt were imminent in the pre-World War I world.|$|R

Indigenous spiritual traditions have been appropriated to support relevant <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> theories.

It argues that the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> can achieve a sustaining, earth-based spiritual practice without resorting to the appropriation of Indigenous traditions. Neo-paganism holds many of the qualities that New Agers seek in Indigenous traditions and is a potential alternative avenue of spiritual solace to the appropriation of Indigenous culture. The embodiment of <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> goals can be understood {{within the context of}} environmental ethics philosophies. Alternative festivals that operate with a spiritual ethic are explored as evidence that the <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> can and in some areas, does operate in a positive, life-affirming manner.
