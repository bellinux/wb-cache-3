However, due to the increased use of concrete in almost all types of construction works, the demand of <b>natural</b> or river <b>sand</b> has been increased. To meet this demand of construction industry excessive quarrying of sand from river beds is taking place causing the depletion of sand resources.

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors have}} been {{studying}} the mechanical properties of granulated coal ash formed by the milling process {{with a small amount}} of cement added, with particles almost equivalent in size to sand or fine gravel. The use of granulated coal ash has many advantages, such as the suppression of leaching of heavy metals and the possibility of outdoor curing. In addition, since granulated coal ash is produced artificially, their particle strength can be understood easily. Another advantage is that it is possible to control the particle strength, something which cannot be performed in <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> The present research was carried out in order to investigate the possibility of putting such advantages to good use. Single particle crushing tests were carried out on various kinds of granulated coal ash to evaluate the crushing characteristics of each individual grain. Also, the characteristics of the individual particle, such as shape, were investigated. Next, one-dimensional compression tests were conducted to investigate their compression characteristics. Finally, drained monotonic triaxial compression tests were performed under different confining pressures. The effects of the confining pressure on the shear characteristics, as well as their relation to shear strength, were examined with the single particle crushing strength taken into account. Contrary to observations in <b>natural</b> <b>sands,</b> the single particle crushing strength of granulated coal ash did not depend on particle size. Regarding compression characteristics, granulated coal ash compressed very easily because the crushing strength of a single particle was low. Therefore, the yield stress of granulated coal ash was found to be smaller than that of <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> Moreover, the crushing strength affected the shear characteristics, i. e., as the crushing strength increased, the shear stiffness became higher and the compressive volumetric strain became smaller. Therefore, crushing strength can be a useful parameter in evaluating the shear characteristic of granulated coal ash...|$|E

Coagulatory contact predominates over the other three types of contact. The authors provide their findings in terms of morphological peculiarities attributable to genetic differences of quaternary sands. The authors have completed an experimental research to identify the fixed water content in sands and artificial mixtures that have a sand grain size, and they have also analyzed dimensions of the per-unit surface of samples of <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> and their fractions to identify correlation between morphological peculiarities of sands and their maximal molecular water-absorbing capacity. The authors have proven the presence of a correlation between the morphology of sand grains and their number in the test sample exposed to the research undertaking, as it determines the number of contacts between particles of sand. The experimental data has proven that the principal provisions of the physicochemical theory of effective stresses are applicable to sandy soils. <b>Natural</b> <b>sands</b> that have particles of different shapes and surface nature demonstrate different types of contacts that prevent compliance of analytical data with the results of experimental researches. Moreover, natural dimensions of coagulatory contact areas of "sandy" systems substantially exceed those identified analytically.

This is possible due to its paramagnetic influence on the relaxation times. In the context of mineral dissolution processes in natural sediments, {{the effect of the}} presence of dissolved iron(III) on the NMR relaxation times of the pore water was investigated. The decrease in the relaxation times T 1 and T 2 corresponding to an increase in the dissolved iron(III) concentration was quantified. This relation was used to monitor relative changes in the concentration of dissolved iron(III) -ions in <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> Experiments were conducted to calibrate the iron(III) concentration from the measured relaxation times. These were done in bulk water as well as in iron(III) -mineral bearing sands to take the effect of surface relaxation into account. It was shown that for relatively coarse-grained sand fractions the effect of iron(III) -ions in solution dominates. This allows the determination of the dissolved iron(III) concentration in <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> by NMR. The method also enables us to capture the changes in the iron(III) concentration with high temporal resolution. This was demonstrated in column experiments, in which an acid (hydrochloric or sulphuric acid) was applied from the top on the sands to dissolve the mineralogical bound iron(III) and were the dissolution of iron(III) can be captured with sufficient temporal resolution...|$|E

Manufactured sands which are a by-product of rock crushing operations offer a viable solution to the declining availability of <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> However {{there are a number of}} drawbacks to the use of manufactured sand, particularly the poor workability and finish obtained.

40|$|Particle {{shape is}} {{evaluated}} on three scales corresponding to form, roundness and roughness. Shape {{at each of}} these scales uniquely influences material behavior. The shape of sand grains is largely formed as magma cools. Subsequent cleavage and abrasion change the roundness and roughness of particles. Published results indicate that particle shape influences several aspects of granular systems behavior including stiffness, strength, the evolution of strength anisotropy, dilation, {{and the development of}} strain localization. The crushing of granite creates a particulate material with a unique angular shape. A wide range of experimental studies implemented as part of this research permit assembling a unique database of material parameters and comparing the behavior of several crushed and <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> In general, the low roundness of crushed sands leads to higher maximum void ratios, lower small strain stiffnesses, and higher critical state friction angles than more rounded <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> It also impacts mortar strength and workability. Previous studies have emphasized size-controlled segregation. New experimental results show that differences in particle shape can also lead to segregation in a binary granular material. Round or spherical particles are more mobile than angular or flat particles. Then, the greater motion of round or spherical particles in a binary mixture subjected to horizontal or vertical vibration results in their segregation from their angular or flat neighbors. Particle shape may change significantly with stress in the case of soft particles. Therefore, the presence of shape-deformable particles decreases the stiffness of binary rigid-soft particle mixtures. However, macro-scale measurements with rigid-soft mixtures show higher stiffness than would be expected by volume averaging techniques. A subsequent microscale study shows the formation of backbone chains made of the rigid particles, partially supported by the soft particles which prevent the buckling of the load-carrying chains. M.
