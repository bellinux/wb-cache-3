5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on the second floor of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When the <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was completed, the school built a temporary trellis from neighboring Benton Hall's second floor to the second floor of the <b>new</b> <b>building</b> in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, the <b>new</b> <b>building</b> also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed the <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was {{designed}} in 1853 by local architect Frederick Cumberland, {{who was also}} working {{on the design of}} University College, which was being built just north of the Observatory to replace King's College. The new observatory design called for a stone building, with an attached tower containing the theodolite. The <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was completed in 1855, and stood directly opposite the entrance of today's Convocation Hall.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} four {{separate}} buildings in which North has operated. The first housed just three grades when North opened in 1888. Three {{years later the}} first class graduated in 1891. The building grew to be {{too small for the}} school and a <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was built, opening in 1896 at a new location. On June 18, 1913 a fire burned down most of the building, forcing a <b>new</b> <b>building</b> to be rebuilt. A <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was built over the destroyed one and was completed in 1914. Later additions were added in 1921, 1923 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{hospitals}} {{shut down by}} damage related to the hurricane was the public hospital serving New Orleans, Charity Hospital, which was also the only trauma center serving that region.

5|$|Dr. Perry Nussbaum, Beth Israel's rabbi from 1954 to 1973, {{was active}} in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1967 the {{congregation}} moved to a new synagogue building, (its current one), and both the <b>new</b> <b>building</b> and Nussbaum's house were bombed by the Ku Klux Klan that year.|$|E

It is possible to view the meadow (and also the deer) from the path between <b>New</b> <b>Buildings</b> and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in <b>New</b> <b>Buildings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the <b>new</b> <b>building.</b> Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the <b>new</b> <b>building</b> should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1731, the {{government}} purchased houses {{at the site}} of the present building and construction of a <b>new</b> <b>building</b> started the next year. The Sabor first met in the <b>new</b> <b>building</b> on 6 May 1737. The building was originally designed to accommodate archives, the court and the office of the ban; however, {{the government}} of Zagreb County moved in as well in 1765. The ban's office, the court and the archives moved out of the building in 1807, when a building across St. Mark's Square was bought to accommodate them. Subsequently, the newly purchased building was named Banski dvori after its new primary purpose of housing the ban and his office. The Zagreb County government purchased buildings adjacent to the parliament in 1839 and commissioned a <b>new</b> <b>building</b> at the site. It was completed in 1849; in the meantime, the Sabor had to convene elsewhere; it met in a theatre building located on a corner of the square. The theatre building later became the Zagreb City Hall.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 the {{location}} of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners of the cemetery and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum {{on the site of}} an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the <b>new</b> <b>building,</b> capable of receiving about 600works of art, would attract up to 500,000visitors a year when it opened in 2012.|$|E

5|$|In May 1960, {{the then}} Oregon State College was {{advanced}} $19,000 {{by the federal}} government to plan for a new $2,170,000 building. The <b>new</b> <b>building</b> was designed by architects Hamlin & Martin, and the cost rose to $2.4 million by the time the school accepted bids on the project in April 1962. Ground was broken on the project on May 1, 1962, with Shields Construction Company as the general contractor for the project.

5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the College to design a <b>new</b> <b>building</b> near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's {{elaborate}} plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a <b>new</b> <b>building.</b> By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room {{on the site of the}} old Sugar House.|$|E
