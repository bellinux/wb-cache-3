25|$|The latter Greeks of {{the first}} {{millennium}} BC had a (still not very effective) cavalry arm, and the rocky terrain of the Greek mainland was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. Consequently, in historical Greece the chariot was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> any extent in war. Nevertheless, the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in epic poetry. Linear B tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form). Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the Olympic and Panathenaic Games and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in hippodromes and in contests called agons. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a paranymph, or friend of a bridegroom, went {{with him in a}} chariot to fetch the bride home.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} most {{commonly}} carved from wood, with various types used. The harvesting of this wood often falls under certain customs related to {{when and how}} the trees may be cut. The most common traditional wood is “zompantle” also called “palo bofo” or “colorín” (Erythrina coralloides) a plant of the legume family which yields a soft white wood often use for more artistic objects and {{has been associated with}} ritual since pre Hispanic times. It is <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> utilitarian items. Other common woods include red cedar and “ayacahuite” (Pinus ayacahuite), both favored for their ability to resist insect infestation. Red cedar masks are most commonly found in the Sierra de Puebla, Papantla area, Chiapa de Corzo and among the Zoques in Chiapas. Poplar wood is commonly used because it can be worked thin and does not splinter. Masks of this wood are most commonly found for the pascola dances of the Mayos and Yaquis. The hardest woods used for masks are mesquite and avocado. Mezquite masks are found in Hidalgo, Zacatecas and the northwest of the country, with avocado wood ones found in the State of Mexico. Copal wood in used mostly in Michoacán and Oaxaca but can be found in Sonora and other states.|$|E

25|$|In 1906 Union Minière du Haut Katanga {{was formed}} to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold favoured a railway route entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River. An Angolan railway from Lobito Bay to Katanga was also proposed, but in 1908, the BSAC agreed with Leopold to {{continuing}} the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full-scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga's copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network to Beira. Even after the Congo route was opened, up {{to a third of}} Katanga's copper went to Beira, and the mine's the supply of coal and coke mostly came from Wankie, the cheapest available source. This railway's revenue from Katanga enabled it to carry agricultural produce at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport was no problem as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line. The Beira route was well established and the BSAC wanted to prevent the Copperbelt companies taking advantage of other routes it did not control. The Benguela Railway to Angola, completed in 1931, provided the shortest, most direct route for copper from both Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, but it was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> full capacity because both the Congo and the Rhodesias restricted its traffic in favour of their own lines.|$|E

500|$|Drake was {{accustomed}} to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning.

500|$|The album artwork was {{designed}} by John Lorenzi, who contributed to the covers on Megadeth's two previous albums, Endgame and United Abominations (2007). The title was revealed as 13, with Mustaine commenting [...] "I started playing guitar at 13 and this is our 13th record and I was born on the 13th. As soon as I said I {{was going to call}} it '13', I started noticing 13 everywhere. They <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> have 13th floors in hotels but now they have them again." [...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13.

The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 18th and 19th centuries {{the belief in}} vampires was {{widespread}} in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts {{in the belief that}} the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term [...] "vampire" [...] was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe the dead. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or [...] "consumption" [...] as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations {{on the part of a}} dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.|$|E

500|$|Cora {{described}} Feri as the [...] "direct {{survival of}} old Stone Age religion", reflecting a trend within the Wiccan community for retaining {{faith in the}} witch-cult hypothesis long after it was academically discredited by historians. The Andersons believed that the Witchcraft religion had emerged in Africa and been spread throughout the world, believing that Feri Wicca was {{essentially the same as}} Sami indigenous religion, Voudou, and Santeria. She believed that the ritual tools of [...] "the Craft" [...] were [...] "very much alike throughout the world in both time and place". She listed the ritual tools as an athame [...] "to raise or focus power", a binding cord for use in [...] "ritual liberation and unbinding", as well as a scourge [...] "to raise power", although the latter was <b>never</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> whip human beings. A chalice is used in rituals, symbolizing [...] "the yoni female receptacle of the life force", with an accompanying stone or wax phallus which is sometimes dipped into the chalice during rituals.
