In Mr. Lindsay-Abaires America, success is purely a matter of luck, and virtue inheres solely in those who are luckless. So what if Mikey worked hard? Why should anybody deserve any credit for working hard? Hence the crude deck-stacking built into the script of Good People, in which Mikey is the callous villain who forgot where he came from and Margie the plucky Southie gal who may be the least little bit racist (though she never says anything nasty to Mikeys wife—that would be going too far!) but is otherwise a perfect heroine-victim." ...|$|E
40|$|A partir do texto de Filipenses 2, 5 - 11 este trabalho realiza uma exegese no texto conhecido como kenosis. Para isso, busca a identificação de traços existentes na herança ideológica da sociedade da época da redação deste documento para, em seguida, apontar para as possibilidades de estruturas míticas recorrentes. Faz uma primeira análise no mundo cultural, social e religioso do apóstolo Paulo e passa por uma breve abordagem da história da pesquisa. Oferece uma possibilidade de tradução do texto grego para o português e depois, quer visualizar em forma gráfica a estrutura e o movimento do hino cristológico. Apresenta o monomito e a análise do discurso como ferramentas metodológicas para a produção de duas novas leituras. Com o uso dessas metodologias, procura mostrar as semelhanças entre certas estruturas míticas recorrentes e o esvaziamento de Cristo na tradição paulina. Busca validar a proposta apresentando outras narrativas míticas que impregnavam a imagética da sociedade greco-romana. Ao final sugere alguns passos para uma leitura da kenosis como crítica social.

It offers a possibility of translation of the Greek text into Portuguese and then wants to view in graphic form the structure and movement of the "Christological hymn. " It displays the monomyth and the discourse s analysis as methodological tools for the production of two new readings. Using these methodologies, this work seeks to show the similarities between certain recurring mythic structures and emptying of Christ in the Pauline tradition. It seeks to validate the proposal of this work presenting other mythics <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> <b>permeated</b> the imagery of the Greco-Roman society. At the end suggests some steps to a reading of kenosis as social criticism...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} an overview of the current national legislation, policies, curriculum and practice relating to gifted education within Scotland. It begins by providing an overview of the national context and historical background that, to this day, underpin the egalitarian ethos <b>that</b> <b>permeates</b> Scottish education. We discuss how historical, philosophical and political <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> are firmly rooted in the belief that education is a right for all foreshadow Scotland 2 ̆ 7 s approach to "gifted education". The legislative shift within Scotland from a "needs-based" model to a "rights-based" model, coupled with our inclusive approach to education for all, has important implications and provides potential opportunities for gifted young people. The strengths and limitations of this approach are debated within the paper. Rhetoric and reality can, however, be unfamiliar strangers; the paper therefore also aims to demonstrate how legislative intention and pedagogical ideals have been put into practice within Scottish schools {{in order to meet the}} needs of gifted young Scots. We conclude by discussing the challenges that remain and the implications for the future, both within and beyond Scotland. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
