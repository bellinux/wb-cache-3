30|$|For the {{determination}} of organic substances, liquid chromatography coupled to a mass analyser (LC–MS) is {{the most frequently used}} analytical method. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a robust ionization technique for polar <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substances.</b> The MS/MS technique is used to reduce the chemical background thus leading to better signal-to-noise ratios.

Thus, the integrity and proper function of the BBB is crucial to homeostasis and physiological function of the CNS. A number of transport and carrier systems are expressed and polarized on the luminal or abluminal surface of the BBB to realize these discrete functions.

40|$|Background: Manganese (Mn) used as raw {{material}} for melting process in the ferrous foundry is considered as hazardous <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> because it accumulates in {{the central nervous system}} and may cause neurological disorders. The furnace-men and melting department workers are potentially exposed to manganese particles or fume in the workplace. The objective of the research has been to investigate the sources and levels of manganese exposure in the foundry by correlation of blood-manganese (B-Mn) and air-manganese (air-Mn) measurement. Material and Methods: Air-Mn and Mn of blood serum were measured involving workers who worked in a big-sized foundry during 1 year. The standard method of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ID- 121 was used for air and blood assessment and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was carried out for air and blood sample analysis. Results: The air sampling results have revealed that there is a high exposure to manganese (4. 5 mg/m 3) in the workplace as compared to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) time weighted average (the reference time-weighted average (TWA) = 1 mg/m 3). The average blood serum Mn concentration was 2. 745 μg/l for subjects working for shorter than 3 months and 274. 85 μg/l for subjects working 3 – 12 months. Conclusions: Against the research hypothesis there was no correlation between the air-Mn concentration and the B-Mn (serum) level of manganese in the serum of the exposed subjects. It may be due to short time of air sampling of manganese airborne particles, and a real-time monitoring of airborne manganese particles is suggested for any future study.

Even though some insecticides {{which are used}} to control pests in agriculture can interfere with feeding behavior of insects and other invertebrates, the link from chemical exposure via affected feeding activity to impaired life history traits, such as survival, has not received much attention in ecotoxicology. One of these insecticides is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, a <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> acting specifically on the insect nervous system. We show that imidacloprid {{has the potential to}} indirectly cause lethality in aquatic invertebrate populations at low, sublethal concentrations by impairing movements and thus feeding. We investigated feeding activity, lipid content, immobility, and survival of the aquatic arthropod Gammarus pulex under exposure to imidacloprid. We performed experiments with 14 and 21 days duration, both including two treatments with two high, one day pulses of imidacloprid and one treatment with a low, constant concentration. Feeding of G. pulex as well as lipid content were significantly reduced under exposure to the low, constant imidacloprid concentration (15 µg/L). Organisms were not able to move and feed [...] and this caused high mortality after 14 days of constant exposure. In contrast, feeding and lipid content were not affected by repeated imidacloprid pulses. In these treatments, animals were mostly immobilized during the chemical pulses but did recover relatively fast after transfer to clean water. We also performed a starvation experiment without exposure to imidacloprid which showed that starvation alone does not explain the mortality in the constant imidacloprid exposure.

40|$|Because {{there are}} no direct {{biological}} markers for the substances implicated in indoor air exposure, {{it is impossible to}} directly measure if an individual or group of individuals has been exposed to a potentially <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> in the workplace. Behavioral changes may be the eariest and only manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) effects and are often too subtle to be revealed by routine physical or neurological examination. Neuropsychological techniques are sensitive to subtle behavioral/cognitive changes that can result from exposure to neurotoxins. These techniques consist of oral and written tests that are administered by a trained examiner on a one-to-one basis. In general, a wide variety of cognitive domains are evaluated. The typical battery generally includes assessing orientation, attention, intelligence, language, visual memory, verbal memory, perception, visuoconstruction, simple motor speed, psychomotor speed, and mood. As with most assessment techniques, the neuropsychological methods have limitations. One major drawback is the availability of appropriate norms that are used to compare the results ofa specific individual. Because these tasks are greatly affected by age, intellgence, and in some instances sex, the availabifity of appropriate norms is mandatory to determine if the CNS has been effected. Although neuropsychological tests are sensitive to the presence of CNS involvement, they are not specific. Patterns of performance seen with specific instances of neurotoxic exposure may also be seen with a number ofother diseases of the CNS such as dementia, cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, or normnd aging. In addition, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and/or depression areoe manifestedascognitive dificlies that will mbric the cognitive dysfunction seen with toxicity of the CNS. Some of the more sensitive neuropsychological tests are presented. Interpretations of test performance as they relate to toxic effects on the CNS are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, PET is used {{to study}} the role of blood-brain barrier (BBB) {{dysfunction}} and neuroinflammation as possible contributory factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The {{first part of the}} thesis focuses on the involvement of BBB P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp) function in PD pathogenesis using ["C]-verapamil PET. Protective function of the BBB may be an important factor linking <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The second part of this thesis focuses on the role of neuroinflammation in the progression of PD. The use of [11 C]-PKI 1195 as a tracer for neuroinflammation was investigated in an animal PD model as well as in PD patients. Furthermore, the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment with a selective cyclo-oxygenase- 2 inhibitor was studied in vivo with PET. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{function of the}} cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes has been studied {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Acetylcholinesterase plays a key role in the modulation of neuromuscular impulse transmission in vertebrates, while in invertebrates pseudo cholinesterases are preeminently represented. During the last 40 years, awareness of the role of ChEs role in regulating non-neuromuscular cell-to-cell interactions has been increasing such as the ones occurring during gamete interaction and embryonic development. Moreover, ChE activities are responsible for other relevant biological events, including regulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death, as well as the modulation of cell adhesion and cell migration. Understanding the mechanisms of the regulation of these events can help us foresee the possible impact of <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> on the environmental and human health...|$|R
40|$|Perinatal {{asphyxia}} is {{a substantial}} worldwide contributor to mortality and morbidity. Interventional strategies are scarce, and apart from therapeutic hypothermia the care for these neonates is mainly supportive. There is an ongoing search for interventional strategies; and for the best practice of resuscitation. Nicotine {{has been found to}} have neuroprotective abilities in adult animal models, and this thesis investigates the neuroprotective effects of nicotine administration in a neonatal model of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. In this work the administration of nicotine lead to increase in tolerance towards hypoxia; decrease in the potentially <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> glutamate and Non-Protein Bound Iron (NPBI); and increase in the neuroprotective Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). – showing that the findings of neuroprotective abilities in adult models can be reproduced in a neonatal model: This leads to speculations that nicotine could be a possible interventional strategy in asphyxiated neonates...|$|R
