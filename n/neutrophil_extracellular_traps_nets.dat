50|$|Neutrophils {{are some}} of the first immune cells to travel to sites of {{infection}} that aid in fighting infection by ingesting microorganisms and providing the enzymes to kill them. This process characterizes neutrophils as a type of phagocyte. Neutrophils contain <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>traps</b> (<b>NETs),</b> composed of granule and nuclear constituents, which play a role in breaking up and killing bacteria that has invaded the immune system.

Co-culture of activated EC with <b>neutrophils</b> induced <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> formation, which was partially dependent on production of IL- 8 by activated EC. Extended neutophil/EC co-culture resulted in EC damage, which could be abrogated by inclusion of either diphenyleneiodonium to inhibit the NAPDH oxidase pathway required for NETosis, or DNAse to disrupt NETs. These findings offer new insight into mechanisms whereby NETs trigger damage to the endothelium in sepsis, small vessel vasculitis and possibly the villous trophoblast in preeclampsia...|$|R

Our studies demonstrate that human neutrophils rapidly adhered to SLA surfaces, which triggered histone citrullination and NET release. Further studies showed that albumin or acetylsalicylic acid had no significant effects on the inflammatory response to SLA surfaces. In contrast to bioinert materials, which do not osseointegrate, the bioactivity of SLA surfaces is coupled {{with the ability to}} release NETs.

50|$|<b>Neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>traps</b> (<b>NETs)</b> are {{networks}} of extracellular fibers, primarily composed of DNA from neutrophils, which bind pathogens. Neutrophils are the immune system's first-line {{of defense against}} infection and have conventionally been thought to kill invading pathogens through two strategies: engulfment of microbes and secretion of anti-microbials. In 2004, a novel third function was identified: formation of NETs. NETs allow neutrophils to kill extracellular pathogens while minimizing damage to the host cells. Upon in vitro activation with the pharmacological agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), Interleukin 8 (IL-8) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), neutrophils release granule proteins and chromatin to form an extracellular fibril matrix known as NETs through an active process.|$|E

As a neutrophil serine protease, was first identified as degradative enzyme that acts intracellularly to degrade ingested host pathogens and extracellularly in the breakdown of ECM components at inflammatory sites. It localizes to <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>traps</b> (<b>NETs),</b> via its high affinity for DNA, an unusual property for serine proteases. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyadenylation signals exist for this gene. Cathepsin G was also found to exert broad-spectrum antibacterial action against Gram-negative and -positive bacteria independent of the function mentioned above. Other functions of cathepsin G have been reported, including cleavage of receptors, conversion of angiotensin Ⅰ to angiotensin Ⅱ, platelet activation, and induction of airway submucosal gland secretion. Potential implications of the enzyme in blood-brain barrier breakdown was also found.|$|E
5000|$|Neutrophils {{have two}} types of {{granules}}; primary (azurophilic) granules (found in young cells) and secondary (specific) granules (which are found in more mature cells). Primary granules contain cationic proteins and defensens {{that are used to}} kill bacteria, proteolytic enzymes and cathepsin G to break down (bacterial) proteins, lysozyme to break down bacterial cell walls, and myeloperoxidase (used to generate toxic bacteria-killing substances). In addition, secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of IgG antibody-coated bacteria. The secondary granules contain compounds that are involved in the formation of toxic oxygen compounds, lysozyme, and lactoferrin (used to take essential iron from bacteria). [...] <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>traps</b> (<b>NETs)</b> comprise a web of fibers composed of chromatin and serine proteases that trap and kill microbes extracellularly.

40|$|The Gram-positive human {{pathogen}} Staphylococcus aureus causes {{a variety of}} human diseases such as skin infections, pneumonia, and endocarditis. The micrococcal nuclease Nuc 1 {{is one of the}} major S. aureus virulence factors and allows the bacterium to avoid <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> -mediated killing. We found that addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor clindamycin to S. aureus LAC cultures decreased nuc 1 transcription and subsequently blunted nuclease activity in a molecular beacon-based fluorescence assay. We also observed reduced NET degradation through Nuc 1 inhibition translating into increased NET-mediated clearance. Similarly, pooled human immunoglobulin specifically inhibited nuclease activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of nuclease activity by clindamycin and immunoglobulin enhanced S. aureus clearance and should be considered in the treatment of S. aureus infection...|$|R
40|$|Shigella flexneri is an enteric {{pathogen}} that causes massive inflammation {{and destruction of}} the human intestinal epithelium. Neutrophils are the first cells of the innate immune system recruited {{to the site of}} infection. These cells can attack microbes by phagocytosis, <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>Extracellular</b> <b>Trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> formation and degranulation. Here, we investigated how neutrophil degranulation affects virulence and show that exposure of Shigella to granular proteins enhances infection of epithelial cells. During this process, cationic granular proteins bind to the Shigella surface causing increased adhesion which ultimately leads to hyperinvasion. This effect is mediated by changes in the surface charge, since a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant with a negative surface shows enhanced hyperinvasion compared with wild-type Shigella. We propose that Shigella evolved to use host defence molecules to enhance its virulence and subvert the innate immune system...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Brinkmann {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a striking observation that activation of neutrophils causes {{the release of}} web-like structures of DNA; this represents a third mechanism for killing bacteria. These <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>traps</b> (<b>NETs)</b> comprise a web of fibers composed of chromatin and serine proteases [...] that trap and kill extracellular microbes. It is suggested that NETs provide a high local concentration of antimicrobial components and bind, disarm, and kill microbes independent of phagocytic uptake. In addition to their possible antimicrobial properties, NETs {{may serve as a}} physical barrier that prevents further spread of pathogens. Trapping of bacteria may be a particularly important role for NETs in sepsis, where NETs are formed within blood vessels. Recently, NETs have been shown {{to play a role in}} inflammatory diseases, as NETs could be detected in preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related inflammatory disorder in which neutrophils are known to be activated.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{identified}} and characterized the potential of a high ratio of bicarbonate to CO 2 and a moderately alkaline pH to render neutrophils prone to undergo <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> formation. Both experimental settings increased the rate of spontaneous NET release and potentiated the NET-inducing capacity of phorbol esters (PMA), ionomycin, monosodium urate and LPS. In contrast, an acidic environment impaired <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> formation both spontaneous and induced. Our findings indicate that intracellular alkalinization of neutrophils {{in response to an}} alkaline environment leads to an increase of intracellular calcium and neutrophil activation. We further found that the anion channel blocker DIDS strongly reduced NET formation induced by bicarbonate. This finding suggests that the effects observed are due to a molecular program that renders neutrophils susceptible to <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> formation. Inflammatory foci are characterized by an acidic environment. Our data indicates that NET formation is favored by the higher pH at the border regions of inflamed areas.

30|$|Resistin impairs {{intracellular}} actin polymerization, a key {{prerequisite for}} many neutrophil functions [30, 31]. We therefore studied {{the effect of}} resistin on other F-actin dependent neutrophil functions that are also crucial for antibacterial host defense [21, 22]. Whereas resistin {{did not appear to}} interfere with extracellular bacterial clearance, it clearly inhibited intracellular clearance of P. aeruginosa by NB 4 PMN. As resistin fails to affect extracellular bacterial clearance, we can postulate that resistin does not interfere with bacterial phagocytosis or <b>extracellular</b> clearance via <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>traps</b> (<b>NET),</b> both of which are also crucial processes for neutrophil-mediated host defense [32]. The effects of resistin pre-treatment did not exactly match those observed with cytochalasin B pre-treatment. One can therefore hypothesize that mechanisms other than inhibition of actin polymerization also play a role. Nonetheless, inhibition of actin polymerization still appears to be a crucial mechanism in resistin-mediated neutrophil dysfunction.|$|R
40|$|<b>Neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> {{formation}} {{is a significant}} innate immune defense mechanism against microbial infection that complements other neutrophil functions including phagocytosis and degranulation of antimicrobial peptides. NETs are decondensed chromatin structures in which antimicrobial components (histones, antimicrobial peptides and proteases) are deployed and mediate immobilization of microbes. Here we describe an effect of iron chelation on the phenotype of NET formation. Iron-chelating agent desferrioxamine (DFO) showed a modest but significant induction of NETs by freshly isolated human neutrophils as visualized and quantified by immunocytochemistry against histone-DNA complexes. Further analyses revealed that NET induction by iron chelation required NADPH-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as protease and peptidyl-arginine-deiminase 4 (PAD 4) activities, three key mechanistic pathways previously linked to NET formation.

40|$|Indian Echis carinatus bite causes {{sustained}} tissue destruction at {{the bite}} site. Neutrophils, the major leukocytes {{in the early}} defence process, accumulate at the bite site. Here we show that E. carinatus venom induces <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> formation. The NETs block the blood vessels and entrap the venom toxins at the injection site, promoting tissue destruction. The stability of NETs is attributed {{to the lack of}} NETs-degrading DNase activity in E. carinatus venom. In a mouse tail model, mice co-injected with venom and DNase 1, and neutropenic mice injected with the venom, do not develop NETs, venom accumulation and tissue destruction at the injected site. Strikingly, venom-induced mice tail tissue destruction is also prevented by the subsequent injection of DNase 1. Thus, our study suggests that DNase 1 treatment may have a therapeutic potential for preventing the tissue destruction caused by snake venom...|$|R

Here we show that Hepoxilin A 3, a proinflammatory eicosanoid, and the synthetic analog of Hepoxilin B 3, PBT- 3, directly induce NETosis in human neutrophils. Furthermore, we show that Hepoxilin A 3 -mediated NETosis is NADPH-oxidase-dependent at lower doses of Hepoxilin A 3, while it is NADPH-oxidase-independent at higher doses. Together, these results demonstrate that Hepoxilin A 3 is a previously unrecognized inducer of NETosis in cystic fibrosis lungs and may represent a new therapeutic target for treating cystic fibrosis and other inflammatory lung diseases...|$|R

40|$|Inhibitory CD 33 -related Siglec receptors {{regulate}} immune cell activation upon engaging ubiquitous sialic acids (Sias) on {{host cell}} surface glycans. Through molecular mimicry, Sia-expressing pathogen group B Streptococcus binds inhibitory human Siglec- 9 (hSiglec- 9) to blunt neutrophil activation and promote bacterial survival. We unexpectedly discovered that hSiglec- 9 also specifically binds {{high molecular weight}} hyaluronan (HMW-HA), another ubiquitous host glycan, through a region of its terminal Ig-like V-set domain distinct from the Sia-binding site. HMW-HA recognition by hSiglec- 9 limited <b>neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> formation, oxidative burst, and apoptosis, defining HMW-HA as a regulator of neutrophil activation. However, the pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) expresses a HMW-HA capsule that engages hSiglec- 9, blocking NET formation and oxidative burst, thereby promoting bacterial survival. Thus, a single inhibitory lectin receptor detects two distinct glycan "self-associated molecular patterns" to maintain neutrophil homeostasis, and two leading human bacterial pathogens have independently evolved molecular mimicry to exploit this immunoregulatory mechanism...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} neutrophilic airway inflammation. <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>extracellular</b> <b>trap</b> (<b>NET)</b> formation - a meshwork of neutrophil DNA components and neutrophil enzymes are involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Little {{is known about the}} presence of these structures in induced sputum from stable COPD patients. METHODS: Induced sputum samples of 23 COPD patients and 10 healthy controls were collected. Sputum cells were harvested, cultivated and stained for NET components. Extracellular DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. RESULTS: NET formation was markedly upregulated in COPD sputum compared with healthy controls, irrespective of sputum purulence or smoking status. NET formation was associated with significantly higher concentration of extracellular DNA in sputum supernatant (484 ng/mul in COPD versus 268 ng/mul in controls, p = 0. 013). Log-transformed extracellular DNA correlated with log-transformed absolute neutrophil numbers in sputum (r = 0. 60; p < 0. 001) and airway obstruction (r = - 0. 43; p = 0. 013).
