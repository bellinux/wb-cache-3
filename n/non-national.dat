5|$|Usage of {{the flag}} is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws {{relating}} to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use {{of the flag}} by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing.

25|$|Although in Ireland {{the term}} dual {{carriageway}} technically applies to any road with physically separated lanes, {{it is usually}} used only to refer to those route sections {{that do not have}} a motorway designation. Most often it is national roads (roads with a route number prefix of N; e.g. N8) that are built as or upgraded to dual carriageway. A number of <b>non-national</b> roads (for example, regional roads) are dual carriageway, for example in urban areas near or in cities, or where the road was formerly part of a national route.|$|E
25|$|Biological weapons may be {{employed}} in various ways to gain a strategic or tactical advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments.

25|$|Dual carriageways of {{this class}} differ from {{motorways}} {{in a number}} of ways.

Local authorities have the power to apply a limit of up to 120km/h (75mph) as used on most motorways (The High Quality Dual Carriageway section of the N1 between the end of the M1 and the border with Northern Ireland and the N25/N22 Ballincollig Bypass in Cork are the only route sections with such special limits).|$|E
50|$|A large {{proportion}} of the migration in the Nordic countries occurs between and among the countries themselves, largely {{as the result of the}} free labour market and liberal rules for the exchange of students in the Nordic countries. The trend has led to an increasing number of foreign citizens in the Nordic countries during the past few decades. In all the countries, the major part of the foreign citizens is non-Nordic. That is not the case for Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which have a high proportion of other Nordic citizens. <b>Non-nationals</b> range from 47 per cent of the total immigration in Iceland, to 89 per cent in Norway. In 2013 the largest proportions of <b>non-nationals</b> were in Norway and Denmark, where they account for 8.9 and 8.8 per cent of the population. The proportionof <b>non-nationals</b> in the Finnish population is small compared to the other Nordic countries - 3.6 per cent in 2013 - but the proportion has risen significantly during and after the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|Migrants {{represent}} between one-third and four-fifths of {{the population}} in the Gulf States. Despite their sizable numbers, migrants can only have temporary residency, they have no access to citizenship, and they have limited membership in society, conditions which are unique to the Gulf States as destination countries. The first section argues that <b>non-nationals</b> have been instrumental in shaping the social link between nationals, and the relationship between them and their rulers. The second section shows how oil-generated wealth has allowed demographic growth through high fertility among nationals, and high immigration among <b>non-nationals</b> through high immigration. The faster growth among <b>non-nationals</b> has produced societies with a continuously shrinking proportion of nationals. Indeed, while policies of not allowing immigrants’ integration in the citizenry have worked well, policies aiming at reducing dependency on foreign workers through indigenizing the workforce and those limiting their duration of stay have not been successful. The exceptional demography of the Gulf States is not explained by an exceptional level of immigration as much as by an exceptional closure of local societies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Xenophobia is the hatred, fear or dislike that is {{expressed}} in attitudes and behaviours towards <b>non-nationals</b> and/or perceived outsiders, and that violates human rights by denying individuals the basic right to humane treatment, because of feelings or attitudes of superiority over others. This phenomenon has attracted significant public attention and raised the quest to understand and explain its causes. This study contributes to this understanding through focusing on a particular segment of society, university students. The presence of <b>non-nationals</b> (foreigners) in a country {{does not seem to}} affect the citizens of that country in similar ways. Xenophobic attacks in South Africa have shown the lack of integration and tolerance of difference that is exhibited by some of the country’s citizens. Literature on xenophobia has suggested that the phenomenon is caused by issues that include poverty and unemployment, impact of the apartheid past, gender and age effects, as well as scapegoating. This study was aimed at taking these explanations and ‘testing’ them on local university students at the University of Johannesburg’s Soweto Campus. The objective here was to ascertain students’ perceptions of and attitudes towards <b>non-nationals</b> and to reflect on how this microcosm differed from the larger national scenario. Data was collected quantitatively, through survey questionnaires, from a sample of 262 students at the Soweto Campus. The results of the study provide support for the argument that contextual particularities of the environment or society need to be strongly considered. It was concluded that, although some issues associated with xenophobia are realised amongst university students, students generally show that they are collaborating with, and receptive to the circumstances of <b>non-nationals.</b> It appears from {{the findings of this study}} that perceptions of <b>non-nationals</b> differ across genders, socio-economic backgrounds and levels of study. It is recommended that future studies combine quantitative and qualitative methods in conducting studies on xenophobia (and related issues). This would yield results that combine statistical descriptions and the personal thoughts and feelings of the respondents. The depth and reliability of studies of this nature would also be increased. It is further recommended that studies of this nature be done comparatively at all campuses of the university as well as at universities across South Africa. M. A. (Sociology...|$|R
