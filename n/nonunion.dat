5|$|Negotiations resumed in Denver on June 2, and {{the parties}} reached an {{agreement}} on June 4. The agreement provided for resumption of the $3.00-per-day wage and the eight-hour day. The mine owners agreed not to retaliate against or prosecute any miner who had taken part in the strike, and the miners agreed not to discriminate against or harass any <b>nonunion</b> worker who remained employed in the mines.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of <b>nonunion</b> workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while <b>nonunion</b> workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E

30|$|Forearm <b>nonunions</b> are {{uncommon}} but severely disabling {{and challenging}} to treat. Multiple {{factors have been}} associated with the establishment of forearm <b>nonunions</b> such as fracture location and complexity, patient characteristics and surgical technique. Treatment of diaphyseal forearm <b>nonunions</b> differs from that of other type of diaphyseal <b>nonunions</b> because of the intimate relationship between the radius and ulna and their reciprocal movement. There is a wide variation of surgical techniques, and the optimal choice of management remains subject to debate. In this review, we aim to summarize the available evidence in the literature on forearm <b>nonunions</b> and combine it with practical recommendations based on our clinical experience to help guide the management of this complex problem.|$|R

40|$|We {{reviewed}} the clinical {{results of the}} past 7  years in order to investigate the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in <b>nonunions</b> of long bone fracture. Sixty-nine patients with 69 <b>nonunions</b> (22 femora, 28 tibiae, 13 humeri, 5 radii, and 1 ulna) were treated with extracorporeal shock waves. The technical parameters were 6, 000 to 10, 000 impulses at 28  kV (0. 62  mJ/mm 2 energy flux density) for the femur and tibia, 4, 000 impulses at 24  kV for the humerus (0. 56  mJ/mm 2 energy flux density), and 3, 000 impulses at 24  kV (0. 56  mJ/mm 2 energy flux density) for the radius and ulna. Sixty-six patients were followed up. The total successful rate of bony union was 75. 4 %. ESWT was successful in hypertrophic <b>nonunions</b> and {{seemed to have no}} evident effect in atrophic <b>nonunions.</b> We believe that extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be a good choice for <b>nonunions</b> of long bone fracture especially in hypertrophic <b>nonunions...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} if 3 -dimensional height-to-length (H/L) measurements including coronal plane assessment will improve malalignment detection of scaphoid fractures and to {{determine if}} more waist than proximal pole <b>nonunions</b> are malaligned. Computed tomography scans of uninjured wrists (n = 74) were used to obtain 3 -dimensional models of healthy scaphoids. These models {{were used to determine}} 95 % normal ranges of the H/L ratio in standard sagittal and coronal planes in an automated fashion. Subsequently, the H/L ratios of fibrous <b>nonunions</b> (n = 26) were compared with these normal ranges and were classified as either aligned or malaligned. The mean normal H/L ratio in the sagittal plane was 0. 61 (range, 0. 54 - 0. 69) and in the coronal plane 0. 42 (range, 0. 36 - 0. 48). The mean H/L ratios of the <b>nonunions</b> differed from those of the healthy scaphoids in these planes: 0. 65 and 0. 48, respectively. Based on sagittal plane evaluation of all <b>nonunions,</b> 46 % exceeded the normal H/L range versus 54 % based on combining sagittal and coronal plane measurements. More waist <b>nonunions</b> (71 %) than proximal pole <b>nonunions</b> (22 %) exceed the normal H/L range. Evaluation of the H/L ratio in the coronal plane provided valuable additional information for the detection of scaphoid deformities.

30|$|In {{comparison}} with healed proximal ulna and distal radius <b>nonunions,</b> diaphyseal forearm <b>nonunions</b> generally tend {{to result in}} somewhat better functional outcome, likely because the relationships in the proximal and/or DRUJ are not (or less) affected [4, 21, 22].|$|R

25|$|<b>Nonunion,</b> {{failure of}} the {{fracture}} to heal, is common in fractures of {{the neck of the}} femur, but much more rare with other types of hip fracture.

30|$|For {{proximal}} and midshaft <b>nonunions,</b> an above-elbow splint (well-padded dorsally) {{allowing for}} wound healing is given for 7 – 10  days. For distal radius <b>nonunions,</b> a below-elbow splint suffices. Rehabilitation {{is dependent on}} the surgeon’s estimate of the achieved fixation stability. Patients with atrophic and oligotrophic <b>nonunions</b> should refrain from pro-/supination as well as any lifting for a minimum of 6  weeks. Patients with hypertrophic <b>nonunions</b> in which a rigid compression plating has been achieved generally do well with early mobilization. Swelling and stiffness can be minimized by elevation of the hand and active hand exercises. Active assisted elbow, forearm and wrist exercises can be initiated as comfort allows. Passive manipulation by a physical therapist is not allowed. Once early consolidation is established on radiographs, it is reliable to start resistive exercises for strengthening. This may take much longer in large defects treated with autologous bone grafting in a healthy environment.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nonunions</b> of {{the distal}} femur are {{relatively}} rare but can occur {{with or without}} previous surgery. Many surgical methods have been described {{for the treatment of}} these <b>nonunions</b> including external fixation, intramedullary nailing, arthroplasty, and fixed angle plating. While arthroplasty may have a limited role in the elderly patient with osteoporosis and severe communiution, most <b>nonunions</b> can be reliably treated with revision fixation using a fixed angled device, lag screws, and bone grafting as needed. Fixed-angle plating also has the advantage of stabilising a small distal segment where intramedullary nailing has proven to be less effective. Any surgical intervention must include restoration of the normal mechanical axis of the distal femur for a satisfactory clinical outcome. Proximal tibia <b>nonunions</b> are a similarly rare clinical entity due to the excellent blood supply in the metaphysis. Extra-articular proximal tibial <b>nonunions</b> are often due to malreduction during the index surgery resulting in poor bone contact and biomechanical stability. Soft tissue forces and improper use of intramedullary implants often predispose these fractures to malalignment. Revision surgery consisting of deformity correction and at least a lateral tension band plate with lag screws has led to predictable union and good clinical results. Tibial plateau <b>nonunions</b> are exceedingly uncommon but are difficult to treat because of small, often devascularised fragments, post-surgical scarring, and osteopenia. Revision surgery with meticulous soft tissue handling to restore the articular surface and mechanical axis with repair of meniscal pathology gives the patient the best chance of recovering knee function...|$|R
40|$|Extracorporeal {{shockwave}} {{therapy is}} increasingly {{used as an}} adjuvant therapy {{in the management of}} <b>nonunions,</b> delayed unions and more recently fresh fractures. This is in an effort to increase union rates or obtain unions when fractures have proven recalcitrant to healing. In this report we have systematically reviewed the English language literature to attempt to determine the potential clinical efficacy of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in fracture management. Of 32 potentially eligible studies identified, 10 were included that assessed the extracorporeal shockwave therapy use for healing <b>nonunions</b> or delayed unions, and one trial was included that assessed its use for acute high-energy fractures. From the included, studies' overall union rates were in favor of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (72 % union rate overall for <b>nonunions</b> or delayed unions, and a 46 % relative risk reduction in <b>nonunions</b> when it is used for acute high-energy fractures). However, the methodologic quality of included studies was weak and any clinical inferences made from these data should be interpreted with caution.

40|$|Introduction: Bone {{fractures}} fail to {{heal and}} form <b>nonunions</b> in roughly 5 % of cases, with little expectation of spontaneous healing thereafter. We present a systematic review and meta-analysis of published papers that describe <b>nonunions</b> treated with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS). Methods: Articles in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched, using an approach {{recommended by the}} Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS), with a Level of Evidence rating by two reviewers independently. Studies are included here if they reported fractures older than 3 months, presented new data with a sample N ≥ 12, and reported fracture outcome (Heal/Fail).
