25|$|Boullée {{promoted}} {{the idea of}} making architecture expressive of its purpose, a doctrine that his detractors termed architecture parlante ("talking architecture"), which was an essential element in Beaux-Arts architectural training in the later 19th century. His style was most notably exemplified in his proposal for a cenotaph for the English scientist Isaac Newton, who 50 years after his death became a symbol of Enlightenment ideas. The building itself was a 150m (500ft) tall sphere, taller than the Great Pyramids of Giza, encompassed by two large barriers circled by hundreds of cypress trees. Though the structure was never built, Boullée had many ink and wash drawings engraved and circulated widely in the professional circles in 1784. Boullée's Cenotaph for Isaac Newton is a funerary monument celebrating a figure interred elsewhere. The small sarcophagus for Newton is placed at the lower pole of the sphere. The design of the memorial creates the effect of day and night. The <b>night</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when the sarcophagus is illuminated by the sunlight coming through the holes in the vaulting. This gives the illusion of stars in the night sky. The day effect is an armillary sphere hanging in the center that gives off a mysterious glow. Thus, the use of light in the building's design causes the building's interior to change its appearance.|$|E

Later, when the pictures had dried, he sent both of them to Theo in Paris, noting: [...] "The olive trees with the white cloud and the mountains behind, as well as the rise of the moon and the <b>night</b> <b>effect,</b> are exaggerations {{from the point of view}} of the general arrangement; the outlines are accentuated as in some old woodcuts." ...|$|E
60|$|Dorriforth. The black room is doubtless not {{the last}} word of art, but {{it struck me as}} a {{successful}} application of a happy idea. The contrivance was perfectly simple--a closer <b>night</b> <b>effect</b> than is usually attempted, with a few guttering candles, which threw high shadows over the bare walls, on the table of the court-martial. Out of the gloom came the voices and tones of the distinguishable figures, and it is perhaps a fancy of mine that it made them--given the situation, of course--more impressive and dramatic.|$|E

Agadam also {{claims to be the}} first film to be shot using <b>night</b> <b>effects</b> with a hand-held camera. Issack successfully remade the same film in Telugu as Seesa with actor Sivaji in lead role.|$|R

60|$|I coughed {{down the}} {{beginning}} of a most improper fit of laughter, and felt ashamed of myself. Her eyes raised for a moment seemed full of innocent suffering and unexpressed menace {{in the depths of the}} dilated pupils within the rings of sombre blue. It was--how shall I say it?--a <b>night</b> <b>effect</b> when you seem to see vague shapes and don't know what reality you may come upon at any time. Then she lowered her eyelids again, shutting all mysteriousness out of the situation except for the sobering memory of that glance, nightlike in the sunshine, expressively still in the brutal unrest of the street.|$|E
6000|$|The words, {{mechanically}} uttered, suggested something, and I {{thought that}} if they were in for weirdness I would give them as much weirdness as they could ask for. [...] "When you get along toward fifty you'll find that the foot you've still got out of the grave doesn't work so lively as it used. Besides, I was interested in the <b>night</b> <b>effect.</b> It's so gloriously dark; and I had a fine sense of isolation as I came along, as if I were altogether out of my epoch and my environment. I felt as if the earth was a sort of Flying Dutchman, and I was the only passenger. It was about the weirdest sensation I ever had. It reminded me, I don't know how, exactly of the feeling I had when I was young, and I saw the sunset one evening through the woods after a sleet-storm." ...|$|E
6000|$|Equally {{unnecessary}} is {{the scholastic}} {{attempt to take}} over the relations of the child to [...] "nature," [...] art, and literature. To read the educational journals, to hear the scholastic enthusiast, one would think that no human being would ever discover there was any such thing as [...] "nature" [...] {{were it not for the}} schoolmaster--and quotation from Wordsworth. And this nature, as they present it, is really not nature at all, but a factitious admiration for certain isolated aspects of the universe conventionally regarded as [...] "natural." [...] Few schoolmasters have discovered that for every individual there are certain aspects of the universe that especially appeal, and that that appeal is part of the individuality--different from every human being, and quite outside their range. Certain things that have been rather well treated by poets and artists (for the most part dead and of Academic standing) they regard as Nature, and all the rest of the world, most of the world in which we live, as being in some way an intrusion upon this classic. They propound a wanton and illogical canon. Trees, rivers, flowers, birds, stars--are, and have been for many centuries Nature--so are ploughed fields--really the most artificial of all things--and all the apparatus of the agriculturist, cattle, vermin, weeds, weed-fires, and all the rest of it. A grassy old embankment to protect low-lying fields is Nature, and so is all the mass of apparatus about a water-mill; a new embankment to store an urban water supply, though it may be one mass of splendid weeds, is artificial, and ugly. A wooden windmill is Nature and beautiful, a sky-sign atrocious. Mountains have become Nature and beautiful within the last hundred years--volcanoes even. Vesuvius, for example, is grand and beautiful, its smell of underground railway most impressive, its <b>night</b> <b>effect</b> stupendous, but the glowing cinder heaps of Burslem, the wonders of the Black Country sunset, the wonderful fire-shot nightfall of the Five Towns, these things are horrid and offensive and vulgar beyond the powers of scholastic language. Such a mass of clotted inconsistencies, such a wild confusion of vicious mental practices as this, is the stuff the schoolmaster has in mind when he talks of children acquiring a love of Nature. They are to be trained, against all their mental bias, to observe and quote about the canonical natural objects and not to observe, but instead to shun and contemn everything outside the canon, and so to hand on the orthodox Love of Nature to another generation. One may present the triumph of scholastic nature-teaching, by the figure of a little child hurrying to school along the ways of a busy modern town. She carries a faded cut-flower, got at considerable cost from a botanical garden, and as she goes she counts its petals, its stamens, its bracteoles. Her love of Nature, her [...] "powers of observation," [...] are being trained. About her, all unheeded, is a wonderful life that she would be intent upon but for this precious training of her mind; great electric trains loom wonderfully round corners, go droning by, spitting fire from their overhead wires; great shop windows display a multitudinous variety of objects; men and women come and go about a thousand businesses; a street-organ splashes a spray of notes at her as she passes, a hoarding splashes a spray of colour.|$|E
60|$|The second great {{result of}} this Covent Garden {{training}} was understanding of and regard for the poor, whom the Venetians, we saw, despised; whom, contrarily, Turner loved, and more than loved--understood. He got no romantic sight of them, but an infallible one, as he prowled {{about the end of}} his lane, watching <b>night</b> <b>effects</b> in the wintry streets; nor sight of the poor alone, but of the poor in direct relations with the rich. He knew, in good and evil, what both classes thought of, and how they dwelt with, each other.|$|R

50|$|Dip (bank) angle : during turns, the {{horizontal}} {{part of the}} loop aerial {{will no longer be}} horizontal and detect a signal.

One of {{the bars of the}} window of the ward on the first floor in which they were, with fifteen other Confederate officers, confined, had been removed; the screws having been taken out by a large screw-driver which they left behind them. They had lowered themselves to the yard, and climbed over the wall by means of a rope which was found in position in the morning. The rest of the prisoners professed an entire ignorance of the affair, and declared that, until they found the beds unoccupied in the morning, they knew nothing of the occurrence.|$|R

The darkness and their {{ignorance of the}} roads prevented the movement being attended with the hoped-for success. Had the operation been carried out without a hitch, Franceschi and Mermet would both have been driven off the line of retreat to the bridge of Oporto, and must have been captured or destroyed. As it was, Franceschi fell back fighting, joined Mermet's division at Crijo, a day's march in the rear, and although the whole were driven {{on the following day}} from this position, they retired in good order, and that <b>night</b> <b>effected</b> their retreat across the bridge of boats, which was then destroyed.|$|R
60|$|Three wondrous <b>nights.</b> <b>Effects</b> of moon, clouds, stars, and night-sheen, never surpass'd. I am {{out every}} night, enjoying all. The sunset begins it. (I have said already how long evening lingers here.) The moon, an hour high just after eight, is past her half, and looks somehow {{more like a}} human face up there than ever before. As it grows later, we have such {{gorgeous}} and broad cloud-effects, with Luna's tawny halos, silver edgings--great fleeces, depths of blue-black in patches, and occasionally long, low bars hanging silently a while, and then gray bulging masses rolling along stately, sometimes in long procession. The moon travels in Scorpion to-night, and dims all the stars of that constellation except fiery Antares, who keeps on shining just to the big one's side.|$|R
50|$|For each problem he undertook, he {{furnished}} a new {{and more}} perfect formula. He never again equaled the emotion and tragedy of The Crowning with Thorns (Louvre); in the expression of the mysterious and the divine he never equaled the poetry of the Pilgrims of Emmaus; while in superb and heroic brilliancy he never again executed anything more grand than The Doge Grimani adoring Faith (Venice, Doge's Palace), or the Trinity, of Madrid. On the other hand, from the standpoint of flesh tints, his most moving pictures are those of his old age, such as the poesie and the Antiope of the Louvre. He even attempted problems of chiaroscuro in fantastic <b>night</b> <b>effects</b> (Martyrdom of St. Laurence, Church of the Jesuits, Venice; St. Jerome, Louvre; Crucifixion, Church of San Domenico, Ancona).|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{reported}} that it [...] "Looks like a Dracula plus, touching a new peak in horror plays," [...] and described Karloff's performance as [...] "a fascinating acting bit of mesmerism." [...] Its review also singled out {{the look of the}} film as uniquely praiseworthy, calling the photography [...] "splendid" [...] and the lighting [...] "the last word in ingenuity, since much of the footage calls for dim or <b>night</b> <b>effect</b> and the manipulation of shadows to intensify the ghostly atmosphere." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Night</b> <b>effect</b> : Radio waves {{reflected}} {{back by the}} ionosphere {{can cause}} signal strength fluctuations 30 to 60 nautical miles (54 to 108 km) from the transmitter, especially just before sunrise and just after sunset. This is more common on frequencies above 350 kHz. Because the returning sky waves travel over a different path, {{they have a different}} phase from the ground wave. This has the effect of suppressing the aerial signal in a fairly random manner. The needle on the indicator will start wandering. The indication will be most erratic during twilight at dusk and dawn.|$|E

The subject may feel discomfort and anxiety, which may make sleep more difficult and of inferior quality. This is the well-known first <b>night</b> <b>effect.</b> Complete adaptation to the sleep laboratory may take four days or longer, which is longer than the duration of most laboratory studies. Also, the content of dreams at the laboratory has been observed {{to be different from}} dreams at home. Similarly, the laboratory environment may alter the content of dreams recalled from spontaneous awakenings {{at the end of a}} night's sleep, as indicated by high frequency of laboratory references in morning spontaneous awakenings in REM and NREM dream reports).|$|E
5000|$|Director Issack {{gave up his}} {{software}} job to [...] "make a {{film that}} is different, yet entertaining" [...] {{and said that he}} wanted his first film to make an impact. He spent over a year on the script and stated that he was inspired by Russian Ark. Ten people were involved in the making of the film, the director, the cameraman, and 8 actors, who were all newcomers. The team rehearsed for over a month before the filming and the entire sequence was said to be rehearsed over 40 times. Agadam was also the first film to be shot in the <b>night</b> <b>effect</b> with a hand-held camera. The film, which had no songs, was awarded a U/A certificate by the Censor Board.|$|E

The Climax {{was shot at}} Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad in which Chaitanya and others participated. In December 2012, the opening sequence of the film was shot at a railway station set in Ramoji Film City by using an old steam engine train which {{was said to be}} used in the film in <b>Night</b> <b>Effect.</b> However the film's shoot was halted due to financial turmoil and the news of its revival came in August 2013 by Deva Katta himself. He further added that they are planning to start the shoot from 10 September 2013, finish a song and the patchwork in India and shift to Malaysia for the last song which would complete the photography work.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} whether the hemispheric {{asymmetry}} inversion observed in the wake-sleep transition can also be revealed by the latency of inter tapping intervals 2. 5 s for each hand and the latency of theta burst 2. 5 s in symmetrical loci of the two hemispheres during the sleep onset process. Data collected from 16 right-handed subjects showed a hemispheric asymmetry in the sleep onset latency with both behavioural and EEG indices. For the first time, a hemispheric asymmetry in the sleep onset latency was found considering a visual analysis of EEG. Results suggest that the hemispheric pattern found during sleep onset {{can be considered a}} steady characteristic of the transition from wake to sleep, relatively independent of homeostatic and time of <b>night</b> <b>effects.</b> These results are interpreted as being consistent with the hypothesis concerning an advantage of the right hemisphere in sustaining vigilance...|$|R
