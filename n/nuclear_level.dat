Many can produce hormones, a [...] "chemical messenger" [...] between cells that {{encourage}} mitosis, the effect of which depends on the signal transduction of the receiving tissue or cells. In other words, when a hormone receptor on a recipient cell is stimulated, the signal is conducted {{from the surface of the}} cell to the cell nucleus to affect some change in gene transcription regulation at the <b>nuclear</b> <b>level.</b> Some oncogenes are part of the signal transduction system itself, or the signal receptors in cells and tissues themselves, thus controlling the sensitivity to such hormones.

In particular, we have studied Mossbauer spectroscopy when there is Zeeman splitting of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>levels</b> and a further interaction due to an applied rf-radiation field when the rf frequency is in the neighborhood of the ground-state splitting. The dressed-state approach treats the coupling of the ground <b>nuclear</b> Zeeman <b>levels,</b> due to a radio frequency field, by considering the total system made up of: nucleus, static magnetic field, and rf field as one global quantum system.

40|$|AbstractCanonical Wnt {{signaling}} converts the TCF/LEF {{transcription factor}} from repressor to activator by increasing <b>nuclear</b> <b>levels</b> of its coactivator, β-catenin. A striking exception {{had been reported}} for Wnt-induced endoderm formation during C. elegans embryogenesis. It has long been believed that transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes in the endoderm precursor occurred due to a lowering of <b>nuclear</b> <b>levels</b> of the worm TCF/LEF protein, POP- 1, effectively alleviating POP- 1 repressive activity. Contrary to this model, we demonstrate here that POP- 1 directly activates Wnt target genes in the endoderm precursor. Wnt converts POP- 1 from a repressor to an activator, and this conversion requires that POP- 1 <b>nuclear</b> <b>levels</b> be lowered in the endoderm precursor. We propose that the balance between TCF/LEF and coactivator(s), achieved by elevating coactivator levels (the canonical pathway) and/or reducing TCF/LEF levels (worm endoderm), determines Wnt signal strength...|$|R

40|$|Apurinic/apyrimidinic {{endonuclease}} APE/Ref- 1 is a multifunctional protein {{provided with}} DNA repair, transcription-factor regulation and anti-apoptotic activities.

We have {{also shown that}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>levels</b> of this protein are reduced both in thyroid carcinoma tissues and cell lines. In the present study, APE/Ref- 1 expression and cellular localization were analysed by Western blot in hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules from patients with toxic adenoma and/or toxic multinodular goiter. The total content of APE/Ref- 1 protein was increased {{in the majority of}} the hyperfunctioning tissues with respect to normal adjacent tissue.

These results demonstrate that the phenomenon of nuclear translocation of APE/Ref- 1 hypothesized on the basis of cell culture experiments does actually occur in vivo. Together with previous observations in thyroid carcinomas and tumoral cell lines, our findings suggest a two-stage model of APE/Ref- 1 behaviour during malignant thyrocyte transformation: an early stage characterized by simple hyperplasia and upregulation of APE/Ref- 1 in the nuclear compartment of the cell and a later stage in which <b>nuclear</b> <b>levels</b> of the protein drop to below-normal levels as the cell becomes progressively undifferentiated.

Sylvester Stallone then called Walter Hill who had just had a movie fall apart six weeks before that he had been trying to do for a year. Hill later recalled:When Sly and I first talked about doing it, I told him I thought if we did it as an homage to ’70s or ’80s action films - and if he got a haircut and if we played it not at some <b>nuclear</b> <b>level</b> and left a little room for humor - everything would probably work out. I mean, {{this is one of those}} plots... You know, in terms of the real world, they’re fairly preposterous. But that’s OK. That’s part of the given. As long as you don’t break the rules and contradict yourself within that sensibility, people go for the ride.... Sly and I have known each other for probably 35 years. I have always been a great admirer of Sly’s. Most directors love movie stars because they’re such fabulous tools to tell stories with. Sly is an actor but he’s a star and he’s been a star for a very long time. When he sent me this, there was a feeling on both our parts, that if this was ever going to happen - us working together - we better sit down and do it. Time is moving on.Thomas Jane was originally cast for the part that would eventually go to Sung Kang. The role was recast at the insistence of producer Joel Silver, stating a need for a [...] "more 'ethnic' actor" [...] to appeal to a wider audience.Hill stated:The real truth is these movies are all foreign driven. They need domestic releases. If the economics are right, people feel like they can be commercial in a reasonable way domestically. But they’re really foreign driven. This movie would not exist without expectation of the foreign audience being vastly greater than the domestic.Hill said he wanted to have fun with the genre:We’re not breaking new ground. We’re trying to be entertaining within a format that’s familiar. There’s a kind of ice skating that goes on where you must let the audience know that you’re not taking yourself too seriously. But at the same time, the jokes are funny but the bullets are real. The jeopardy has to be real. When it gets outlandish, there needs to be no drift into parody - self-parody, maybe inevitable for old directors.Hill said the film would be called a [...] "buddy movie" [...] but that he made [...] "anti-buddy movies:They don’t like each other. They’re not going to like each other. The most they’re going to achieve by the end is a kind of grudging respect. I’m just comfortable with that. It seems to be an inherently more dramatic situation than if they’re friendly and they get along and respect each other. Also, frankly, it gives you better avenue to work in humor. These things have to be leavened with humor. It actually reinforces the action.|$|E
