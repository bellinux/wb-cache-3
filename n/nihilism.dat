5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and <b>nihilism.</b> He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark explorations {{of the self}} ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, <b>nihilism,</b> and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, follow-up The Fragile, and the aforementioned Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian <b>nihilism</b> encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
25|$|Both the Mādhyamikas and the Yogācārins saw {{themselves}} as preserving the Buddhist Middle Way between the extremes of <b>nihilism</b> (everything as unreal) and substantialism (substantial entities existing). The Yogācārins criticized the Mādhyamikas for tending towards <b>nihilism,</b> while the Mādhyamikas criticized the Yogācārins for tending towards substantialism.|$|E

25|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} by other writers, who state that Madhyamaka is not nihilistic {{but it is a}} middle way between <b>nihilism</b> and eternalism. Some scholars interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental absolute, while other scholars consider it a mistake. The consensus is that Nāgārjuna defended the middle way, one between <b>nihilism</b> and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as emptiness is the soteriological middle way.|$|E
25|$|Turgenev's {{novel was}} {{responsible}} for popularizing {{the use of the}} term <b>nihilism,</b> which became widely used after the novel was published.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Klossowski, in his 1947 book Sade Mon Prochain ("Sade My Neighbour"), {{analyzes}} Sade's {{philosophy as}} a precursor of <b>nihilism,</b> negating Christian {{values and the}} materialism of the Enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|Arkady Nikolaevich Kirsanov – A recent {{graduate}} of St. Petersburg University {{and friend of}} Bazarov. He is also a nihilist, although his <b>nihilism</b> {{has a lot to}} do with Bazarov's influence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} credits to Seed (2007), Boll used footage of animal abuse and torture he {{acquired}} from PETA {{to underscore the}} film's <b>nihilism.</b> He has also promised to donate 2.5 percent of his net profits from Seed to PETA.|$|E
25|$|And Then There Were None (2005 play), On 14 October 2005, a {{new version}} of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and {{directed}} by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the original story, restoring the <b>nihilism</b> of the original.|$|E
25|$|In a 1992 book, {{sociologist}} Max Dublin {{pointed to}} many past failed predictions of technological progress {{and argued that}} modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate. He also objected to {{what he saw as}} scientism, fanaticism and <b>nihilism</b> by a few in advancing transhumanist causes. Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between Millenarian religions and Communist doctrines.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s a {{movement}} known as <b>Nihilism</b> developed in Russia. A term originally coined by Ivan Turgenev in his 1862 novel Fathers and Sons, Nihilists favoured {{the destruction of}} human institutions and laws, {{based on the assumption}} that such institutions and laws are artificial and corrupt. At its core, Russian <b>nihilism</b> was characterized by the belief that the world lacks comprehensible meaning, objective truth, or value. For some time many Russian liberals had been dissatisfied by what they regarded as the empty discussions of the intelligentsia. The Nihilists questioned all old values and shocked the Russian establishment. They moved beyond being purely philosophical to becoming major political forces after becoming involved in the cause of reform. Their path was facilitated by the previous actions of the Decembrists, who revolted in 1825, and the financial and political hardship caused by the Crimean War, which caused large numbers of Russian people to lose faith in political institutions.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{believed}} the Western {{world to be}} on a trajectory headed for total war, and on the brink of profound <b>nihilism</b> (the rejection of all religious and moral principles), which would be the purest and highest revelation of Being itself, offering a horrifying crossroads of either salvation or the end of metaphysics and modernity; rendering the West a wasteland populated by tool-using brutes, characterized by an unprecedented ignorance and barbarism in which everything is permitted.|$|E
25|$|Madhyamaka {{states that}} impermanent {{collections}} of causes and conditions are designated by mere conceptual labels. This {{also applies to}} the principle of causality itself, since everything is dependently originated. If unaware of this, things may seem to arise as existents, remain for a time and then subsequently perish. In reality, dependently originated phenomena do not arise as having inherent existence in the first place. Thus both existence and <b>nihilism</b> are ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} era of silent films, smoking has had a major part in film symbolism. In the hard-boiled film noir crime thrillers, {{cigarette}} smoke often frames characters and is frequently used to add an aura of mystique or <b>nihilism.</b> One of the forerunners of this symbolism {{can be seen in}} Fritz Lang's Weimar era Dr Mabuse, der Spieler, 1922 (Dr Mabuse, the Gambler), where men mesmerized by card playing smoke cigarettes while gambling.|$|E
25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw <b>nihilism</b> ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not {{objective}} facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{literary}} figures {{developed a}} conservative sensibility and warned of threats to Western Civilization. In the 1900–1950 era Henry Adams, T. S. Eliot, Allen Tate, Andrew Lytle, Donald Davidson, and others feared that heedless scientific innovation would unleash forces that would undermine traditional Western values {{and lead to}} the collapse of civilization. Instead they searched for a rationale for promoting traditional cultural values in the face of their fear of an onslaught by moral <b>nihilism</b> based on historical and scientific relativism.|$|E
25|$|The {{time frame}} is usually near-future and the {{settings}} are often dystopian in nature. Common themes in cyberpunk include advances {{in information technology}} and especially the Internet, visually abstracted as cyberspace, artificial intelligence, and cybernetics and post-democratic societal control where corporations have more influence than governments. <b>Nihilism,</b> post-modernism, and film noir techniques are common elements, and the protagonists may be disaffected or reluctant anti-heroes. Noteworthy authors in this genre are William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and Pat Cadigan. James O'Ehley has called Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner a definitive example of the cyberpunk visual style.|$|E
25|$|Absurdism shares some concepts, and {{a common}} {{theoretical}} template, with existentialism and <b>nihilism.</b> It has its origins {{in the work of}} the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own existentialist philosophy. Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought and published his essay The Myth of Sisyphus. The aftermath of World War II provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of France.|$|E
25|$|Atheism in {{the twentieth}} century found {{recognition}} {{in a wide variety of}} other, broader philosophies in the Western tradition, such as existentialism, Objectivism, secular humanism, <b>nihilism,</b> logical positivism, Marxism, anarchism, feminism, and the general scientific and rationalist movement. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. Proponents such as Bertrand Russell emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, Ludwig Wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. H. L. Mencken sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea that science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.|$|E
25|$|The Romanian socialist clubs, {{which first}} held {{congress}} during that year, were still undecided about which {{school of thought}} should inspire their agenda: Marxism, Lassallism, Anarchism and <b>Nihilism</b> each had adherents in Romania. The proponents of a non-violent and liberal Marxism, as theorized political refugee Dobrogeanu-Gherea, eventually won the day, and the socialist clubs began constructing programs for a collectivist economy. Anton Bacalbașa had an essential contribution in this process. After 1881, he joined the Marxist group around Contemporanul magazine. His 1883 brochure, Capitalul, was the first ever introduction to, and summary of, Karl Marx's Das Kapital. Bacalbașa's literary ambitions were satisfied the same year. Some of his poems saw print in the magazine Literatorul, which was put out in Bucharest by writer Alexandru Macedonski.|$|E
25|$|Thanos {{was born}} on Saturn's moon Titan, and is the child of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such shares the {{physical}} appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother attempted to kill him. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist and would only play with his brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with <b>nihilism</b> and death, worshipping and eventually {{falling in love with}} the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death. As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers mystically and artificially. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by starting a family. He is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his family.|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent <b>nihilism</b> and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the period}} of these sūtras, Mahāyāna metaphysics was {{dominated}} by teachings on emptiness, {{in the form of}} Madhyamaka philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of dependent origination and on the mysterious reality of nirvana using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of <b>nihilism.</b> In these sūtras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary that described a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.|$|E
25|$|This social trauma made itself {{manifest}} {{in many different}} ways. Some people were revolted by nationalism and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more internationalist world through {{organizations such as the}} League of Nations. Pacifism became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and cynicism became pronounced. <b>Nihilism</b> grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded {{the end of the world}} as they had known it, including the collapse of capitalism and imperialism. Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.|$|E
25|$|Pribegi în țară răpită {{was written}} with noted {{documentary}} contributions by Ion Pelivan, the Bessarabian activist. It is, in part, {{an answer to}} Pavel Krushevan's own novel, Millions, and a homage to Bessarabia on the centennial of her incorporation into Russia. The Moruzis, including Dumitru's brother Alexandru, appear as the Mavrocosta clan, and the novel delves into their political convictions and intimate affairs. The book also fictionalizes events relating to the Keșcos and to Bessarabian anarchist Zamfir Arbore; Constantin Moruzi appears both as himself and as the Mavrocosta patriarch (the two are brothers-in-law). Here, Russification is depicted in more serious tones, having led to the wholesale import of customs and created new pidgin dialects. Mavrocosta finds himself torn between his loyalty to Russia and his Moldavian patriotism. The author's conservatism is again on display, targeting revolutionary ideologies. For instance, Moruzi praises the rationality and ethos of social democracy, opposing them to Russian <b>nihilism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1847, {{two great}} {{literary}} {{figures of the}} Arab cultural renaissance, Butrus Al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji, founded the first literary society, Jam'iyyat al-Adab wal-'Ulum (The Literary and Scientific Society). Its members were exclusively Syrian Christians and Europeans {{living and working in}} diplomatic and missionary circles. However, ten years later, al-Jam'iyya al-'Ilmiyya al-Suriyya (The Syrian Scientific Society) was established, and attracted Western-educated Muslims and Druze as well as Christians. In 1917, the Tunisian literary figure, Hassan Hosni Abdel-Wahab wrote about the urgent need for educated Muslim young women to take charge of the future and to 'awaken the nationalist spirit', as without this, 'life would turn to <b>nihilism</b> and its consequences'. Only a few years later in the 1920s, Manwia Al-Wartani and Habiba al-Minshari, became the leaders of a dynamic women's movement in Tunisia. Like these Tunisian pioneers, women of the upper and middle classes across the increasingly imagined Arab world began to reap the benefits of education, and many of them began to focus on writing and joined their male counterparts in contributing to the Arab Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} group eventually explores {{all four}} labyrinths, successfully unlocking the {{doors in the}} Velvet Room and restoring Zen's memories. He reveals that his true identity is the human avatar of Chronos, a manifestation of death created by the Collective Unconscious, and Rei is really a girl named Niko who died of illness twelve years prior. When Chronos came to escort her to the afterlife, he was intrigued by her descent into <b>nihilism</b> {{as a result of}} having lived an apparently meaningless life. Chronos created the alternate Yasogami High, split himself into Zen and a powerful being known as the Clockwork God, and sealed both of their memories {{in order to try to}} bring Rei happiness. The Clockwork God is the one responsible for trapping SEES and the Investigation Team in the alternate Yasogami, hoping for them to traverse the labyrinths and recover Zen's memories so they can merge and become Chronos once again: this would result in the teams being erased from time when their tasks were completed. The Clockwork God abducts Rei and transports her to the top of a clock tower outside the school. SEES and the Investigation Team decide to help Zen rescue Rei, and they ascend the tower and defeat the Clockwork God. After spending some carefree time together before the pocket dimension collapses, Zen and Rei vanish into the afterlife, while SEES and the Investigation Team promise to meet again someday and return home, although their memories of the incident are erased.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} radical {{physical}} therapies {{were developed in}} central and continental Europe in the late 1910s, the 1920s and most particularly, the 1930s. Among these we may note the Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg's malarial therapy for general paresis of the insane (or neurosyphilis) first used in 1917, and for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1927. This treatment heralded {{the beginning of a}} radical and experimental era in psychiatric medicine that increasingly broke with an asylum-based culture of therapeutic <b>nihilism</b> in the treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, most particularly dementia praecox (increasingly known as schizophrenia from the 1910s, although the two terms were used more or less interchangeably until at least the end of the 1930s), which were typically regarded as hereditary degenerative disorders and therefore unamenable to any therapeutic intervention. Malarial therapy was followed in 1920 by barbiturate induced deep sleep therapy to treat dementia praecox, which was popularised by the Swiss psychiatrist Jakob Klaesi. In 1933 the Vienna-based psychiatrist Manfred Sakel introduced insulin shock therapy and in August 1934 Ladislas J. Meduna, a Hungarian neuropathologist and psychiatrist working in Budapest, introduced cardiazol shock therapy (cardiazol is the tradename of the chemical compound pentylenetetrazol, known by the tradename metrazol in the United States), which was the first convulsive or seizure therapy for a psychiatric disorder. Again, both of these therapies were initially targeted at curing dementia praecox. Cardiazol shock therapy, founded on the theoretical notion that there existed a biological antagonism between schizophrenia and epilepsy and that therefore inducing epiletiform fits in schizophrenic patients might effect a cure, was superseded by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), invented by the Italian neurologist Ugo Cerletti in 1938.|$|E
500|$|Fighting <b>Nihilism</b> with Honesty (an Officer and a Female Nihilist) (Борьба нигилизма с честностью (офицер и нигилистка)) (1864–73): a {{pamphlet}} planned since mid-1864 {{while working on}} [...] "About a Man Who Was Eaten by a Crocodile" ...|$|E
500|$|This {{divergence}} {{from the}} original was criticised by some, including Anthony Sacramone of First Things, who called the film [...] "an act of vandalism", noting the irony of how Cuarón had removed religion from P.D. James' fable, in which morally sterile <b>nihilism</b> is overcome by Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, {{as well as}} {{a fierce}} temper that could emerge as rage on occasion. Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta could be [...] "quite unscrupulous, even brutal" [...] in using others to get what he wanted, but that he never {{displayed}} any physical cruelty or <b>nihilism.</b>|$|E
500|$|In August 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote The Stuckists {{manifesto}} which {{stress the}} value of painting as a medium, its use for communication, and the expression of emotion and experience – {{as opposed to what}} Stuckists see as the superficial novelty, <b>nihilism</b> and irony of conceptual art and postmodernism. The most contentious statement in the manifesto is: [...] "Artists who don't paint aren't artists".|$|E
