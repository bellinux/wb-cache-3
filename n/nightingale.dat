5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the <b>nightingale</b> which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the <b>nightingale,</b> it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the <b>nightingale,</b> have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Nightingale</b> {{was written}} in April 1798, {{during the same time}} Coleridge wrote Fears in Solitude. The poem was {{included}} in the Lyrical Ballads, a joint publication with Wordsworth. The <b>nightingale</b> is part of a discussion directed to Wordsworths in which Coleridge refutes the traditional association between nightingales and melancholic feelings because of the bird's appearance in the myth of Philomela.|$|E
5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela {{was turned into}} a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a <b>nightingale,</b> singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela {{was turned into a}} <b>nightingale,</b> and Procne into a swallow. Eustathius' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E

[...] When The <b>Nightingales</b> split in 1986, Lloyd embarked on a solo career, initially signing to In-Tape before signing to Virgin Records in 1989 and releasing the album Me and My Mouth. The album featured Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas (of The Attractions), Andy Scott (of Sweet) and Craig Gannon (formerly of The Smiths among others), but for the tour to promote the album, Lloyd had to recruit a new band which included former <b>Nightingales</b> guitarist Peter 'The Tank' Byrchmore (who also played on the album).

5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence <b>Nightingale</b> to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and <b>Nightingale</b> left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E

5|$|The gorge {{area was}} {{inhabited}} {{at least as}} early as the Iron Age, probably by the Dobunni tribe. In Leigh Woods above <b>Nightingale</b> Valley, a steep dry valley beside the suspension bridge, is Stokeleigh Camp, one of three Iron Age hill forts in the area. Stokeleigh was occupied from 3BCE to 1CE, and was also used in the Middle Ages. The camp was protected on two sides by the cliff faces of the gorge and <b>Nightingale</b> Valley, and was also protected by earthworks, and is now a scheduled ancient monument. A second hill fort was situated across <b>Nightingale</b> Valley, but has since been built on, and bridge road cuts through it. The third hill fort was situated {{on the opposite side of}} the gorge, in what is now observatory green. Archaeology, plus the configuration of the three forts, suggest they played a role in defending the gorge.|$|E

40|$|Capsule <b>Nightingales</b> Luscinia megarhynchos with song territories in scrub {{vegetation}} {{also used}} adjacent woodland. Aims To examine spatial use by <b>Nightingales</b> of vegetation mosaics and associated selection of vegetation height classes. Methods We examined habitat selection by male <b>Nightingales</b> through territory mapping and radiotracking within {{a mosaic of}} dry scrub and woodland adjacent to water-filled gravel pits in eastern England. Results Fourteen song territories were exclusively in scrub, 2 were exclusively in woodland, and 13 comprised both habitat types. Densities were greatest in scrub vegetation of 3 – 5 m height. Best-supported models for territory density indicated the importance of considering optimal vegetation height within management prescriptions. Despite song territories being in scrub, kernel home-ranges of all radiotracked <b>Nightingales</b> contained areas of mature trees. Birds also spent more time there than expected based on availability of woodland within kernels. Conclusions Habitat quality has been implicated in the decline of <b>Nightingales</b> in lowland woodland in Britain (and an associated increase in the proportion found in scrub). Our results indicate that woodland habitat characteristics provide resources for <b>Nightingales</b> with song territories located in dry scrub and may {{be a factor in}} territory establishment, and are therefore relevant for conservation practitioners at such sites...|$|R
