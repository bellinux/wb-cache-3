40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{question}} of <b>national</b> <b>language</b> choice, acceptance, promo-tion, and development has raised {{a great deal}} of conflict in India. The conflict is related to the status and function of the <b>national</b> <b>language,</b> Hindi, 1 and the ex-colonial language, English, on the one hand, and Hindi and other Indian languages on the other. This paper examines the complexity and dynamics of the conflict and provides an explanation {{within the framework of the}} political sociology of language for it. The main objective is to highlight some recurrent features characteristic of language conflict in most developing nations and to arrive at generalizations which would be relevant for both language planning theory as well as for the political sociology of <b>language.</b> The <b>National</b> <b>Language</b> in its Sociolinguistic Context One recurrent feature of the <b>national</b> <b>language</b> in most developing nations has been its assocation with the national struggle and independence movement. The <b>national</b> <b>language</b> was considered a symbol of national identity and prestige. Though initially the colonial language united the elites and political leaders for national movement, a common <b>national</b> <b>language</b> was considered essential for unifying the country, mobilizing the masses, and developing a national literature. While a common <b>national</b> <b>language</b> as a symbol of national identity was an integral component in the national struggle of colonial countries, the emphasis on the <b>national</b> <b>language</b> differed partly because of the different sociolinguistic situations and partly because of the ideological commitment of the political parties. The case of Hindi as a <b>national</b> <b>language</b> may be considered as a prototype of the complex sociolinguistic issues involved in national identity. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 16, 2016 ips. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R
