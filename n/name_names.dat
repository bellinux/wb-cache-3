5|$|Rififis heist {{scene was}} based on an actual {{burglary}} that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to <b>name</b> <b>names</b> in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. This act was not in the original novel.|$|E
25|$|When Miller {{applied in}} 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the House Un-American Activities Committee used this {{opportunity}} to subpoena him {{to appear before the}} committee.

25|$|Lowe {{describes}} the inflation incident in his official report less dramatically, {{saying that he}} was told by the gas plant supervisor to disconnect and let another balloon go first. Lowe did not <b>name</b> <b>names,</b> but it is not likely that it was anyone other than Wise. Lowe's report about a new balloon has to be considered over Hoehling's account of the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with many}} in Hollywood, Bernstein faced censure during the McCarthy {{era of the}} early 1950s. Bernstein was called by the House Un-American Activities Committee when it was {{discovered}} that he had written some music reviews for a Communist newspaper. After he refused to <b>name</b> <b>names,</b> pointing out that he had never attended a Communist Party meeting, he found himself composing music for movies such as Robot Monster and Cat-Women of the Moon, a step down from his earlier Sudden Fear and Saturday's Hero.|$|E

25|$|After over a year, Kidd {{was sent}} to England for {{questioning}} by the Parliament of England. The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd {{as a tool to}} discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to <b>name</b> <b>names,</b> naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the High Court of Admiralty in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous Newgate Prison, and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} also {{somewhat}} autobiographical for Rossen, relating to {{his dealings with}} the House Un-American Activities Committee. [...] A screenwriter during the 1930s and '40s, he had {{been involved with the}} Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to <b>name</b> <b>names</b> at his first HUAC appearance. Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members. Similarly, Felson sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character.|$|E
500|$|Górecki's Symphony No. 3 {{was written}} in 1976, when Górecki was, {{in the words of}} the music critic Jane Perlez, [...] "a fiery figure, fashionable only among a small circle of modern-music aficionados". The 1977 world première at the Royan Festival, Ernest Bour conducting, was {{reviewed}} by six western critics, all of them harshly dismissive. Heinz Koch, writing for Musica, said that the symphony [...] "drags through three old folk melodies (and nothing else) for an endless 55 minutes". Górecki himself recalled that, at the premiere, he sat next to a [...] "prominent French musician" [...] (Górecki did not <b>name</b> <b>names,</b> though it was probably Pierre Boulez), who, after hearing the twenty-one repetitions of an A-major chord at the end of the symphony, loudly exclaimed [...] "Merde!" ...|$|E

500|$|Queen Elizabeth had {{certainly}} {{been worried about}} the possibility and sent messages to Anne warning her not to listen to papist counsellors and requesting the names of anyone {{who had tried to}} convert her; Anne had replied that {{there was no need to}} <b>name</b> <b>names</b> because any such efforts had failed. Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping Henrietta Gordon, wife of the exiled Catholic George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly, as a confidante; after Huntly's return in 1596, the St Andrews minister David Black called Anne an atheist and remarked in a sermon that [...] "the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion's sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{little support}} from the Palermo archdiocese, Puglisi tried to change his parishioners' mentality, which was {{conditioned}} by fear, passivity and omerta – imposed silence. In his sermons, he pleaded to give leads to authorities about the Mafia's illicit activities in Brancaccio, {{even if they could}} not actually <b>name</b> <b>names.</b> He refused their monies when offered for the traditional feast day celebrations, and would not allow the Mafia [...] "men of honour" [...] to march at the head of religious processions.|$|E

[...] While Depp was on {{location}} in Los Angeles, he got a phone call from comedian Bill Murray who had played Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam.

2500|$|Many other {{well-known}} {{artists were}} named, including Hollywood {{stars such as}} Edward G. Robinson and Orson Welles (who by then, due to tax problems, was in Europe), literary figures such as Dorothy Parker and Lillian Hellman, and musicians such as Hazel Scott, Pete Seeger and Leonard Bernstein. Ex-leftist and HUAC informant J. B. Matthews claimed responsibility for providing the listings; he would also work for United States Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-WI). By 1951, those identified in Red Channels were blacklisted across much {{or all of the}} movie and broadcast industries unless and until they cleared their names, the customary requirement being that they testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and <b>name</b> <b>names,</b> which the vast majority refused to do.|$|E
2500|$|Caspary was concerned; {{if she was}} subpoenaed {{to appear}} {{she would not be}} able to leave the country, unless she became a [...] "friendly witness" [...] and named names. [...] On a lawyer's advice the couple left the country as soon as possible. [...] They {{remained}} in Europe, Igee going from studio to studio trying to finance new projects or remake old ones, finally inspiring Caspary to write a musical comedy, Wedding in Paris. It was while working in Austria on the musical adaptation of Daddy Long Legs, Caspary learned she had been added to the gray list and told to abandon the project. [...] If you had appeared before the HUAC committee and refused to <b>name</b> <b>names,</b> you were blacklisted, if your file indicated that you had signed pledges, attended congresses or contributed to doubtful causes, you were graylisted. Caspary described the former as hell, while the latter merely purgatory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} and release of High Noon intersected {{with the second}} Red Scare and the Korean War. In 1947, while Carl Foreman was writing the screenplay, he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during its investigation of [...] "Communist propaganda and influence" [...] in the Hollywood motion picture industry. Foreman {{had once been a}} member of the Communist Party, but he declined to identify fellow members, or anyone he suspected of current membership. As a result, he was labeled an [...] "uncooperative witness" [...] by the committee, making him vulnerable to blacklisting. After his refusal to <b>name</b> <b>names</b> was made public, Foreman's production partner Stanley Kramer demanded an immediate dissolution of their partnership. As a signatory to the production loan, Foreman remained with the High Noon project; but before the film's release, he sold his partnership share to Kramer and moved to Britain, knowing that he would not find further work in the United States.|$|E
