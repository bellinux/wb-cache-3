The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store and analyse data from experiments, as well as simulate events. Researchers need remote access to these facilities, so the lab has historically been a major wide area <b>network</b> <b>hub.</b> CERN is also {{the birthplace of the}} World Wide Web.|$|E
2500|$|Connectors are {{the people}} in a {{community}} who know {{large numbers of people}} and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer <b>network</b> <b>hub.</b> They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who [...] "link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together". They are [...] "a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [...] making friends and acquaintances". Gladwell characterizes these individuals as having social networks of over one hundred people. To illustrate, he cites the following examples: the midnight ride of Paul Revere, Milgram's experiments in the small world problem, the [...] "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" [...] trivia game, Dallas businessman Roger Horchow, and Chicagoan Lois Weisberg, a person who understands the concept of the weak tie. Gladwell attributes the social success of Connectors to the fact that [...] "their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy".|$|E

40|$|Plant–animal mutualistic {{networks}} {{are characterized by}} highly heterogeneous degree distributions. The majority of species interact with few partner species, while a small number are highly connected to form <b>network</b> <b>hubs</b> that are proposed {{to play an important}} role in community stability. It has not been investigated, however, if or how the degree distributions vary among types of mutualisms or communities, or between plants and animals in the same network. Here, we evaluate the degree distributions of pollination and seed-dispersal networks, which are two major types of mutualistic networks that have often been discussed in parallel, using an index based on Pielou 2 ̆ 7 s evenness. Among 56 pollination networks we found strong negative correlation of the heterogeneity between plants and animals, and geographical shifts of <b>network</b> <b>hubs</b> from plants in temperate regions to animals in the tropics. For 28 seed-dispersal networks, by contrast, the correlation was positive, and there is no comparable geographical pattern. These results may be explained by evolution towards specialization in the presence of context-dependent costs that occur if plants share the animal species as interaction partner. How the identity of <b>network</b> <b>hubs</b> affects the stability and resilience of the community is an important question for future studies...|$|R

30|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in the transshipment hub port selection criteria between the two networks, “berth availability” {{was selected as the}} most significant criterion for both <b>networks.</b> For <b>hub</b> and spoke <b>networks,</b> high significance was given to criteria associated with the feeder segment, whereas criteria such as hub port accessibility and frequency of delays were considered significant for relay networks. Commercial aspects, such as marketing efforts, personal contacts, and other aspects, were identified as least significant for both networks. Since only the time category significantly differed between the two <b>networks,</b> <b>hub</b> port selection may not have clear distinctions between the two networks from the shipping lines’ perspective despite the different <b>network</b> configurations of <b>hub</b> and spoke and relay.|$|R
50|$|Airlines quickly {{moved to}} a {{hub-and-spoke}} system, whereby an airline selected an airport, the hub, as the destination point for flights {{from a number of}} origination cities, the spokes. Because the size of the planes used varied according to the travel on that spoke, and since hubs allowed passenger travel to be consolidated in “transfer stations”, capacity utilization increased. The hub-and-spoke model survives among the legacy carriers, but the low-cost carriers (LCCs), now 30 percent of the market, typically fly point to point. The <b>network</b> <b>hubs</b> model offers consumers more convenience for routes, but point-to-point routes have proven less costly for airlines to implement. Over time, the legacy carriers and the LCCs will likely use some combination of point to point and <b>network</b> <b>hubs</b> to capture both economies of scale and pricing advantages.|$|R

Although today's Ethernet installations typically are switched, CSMA/CD is utilized anyway to achieve compatibility with hubs.|$|R

Here, we investigate what regional factors underlie these modifications, asking whether networks are either altered at (1) regions activated by a given task or (2) hubs that interconnect different networks. We used fMRI “functional connectivity” (FC) to compare networks during rest and three distinct tasks requiring semantic judgments, mental rotation, and visual coherence. We found that network modifications during these tasks were independently associated with both regional activation and <b>network</b> <b>hubs.</b> Furthermore, active and hub regions were associated with distinct patterns of network modification (differing in their localization, topography of FC changes, and variability across tasks), with activated hubs exhibiting patterns consistent with task control. These findings indicate that task goals modify brain networks through two separate processes linked to local brain function and <b>network</b> <b>hubs...</b>|$|R
