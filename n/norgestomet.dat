American breedtype cows were allotted to one of three hics. groups and one of five different estrus synchronization regimens in order to evaluate the effectiveness and subsequent fertility of each regimen. Cows, less than 56 days postpartum, were synchronized using one of two protocols. The GIAPG group received <b>norgestomet</b> implants (6 mg) and an injection of GIIRH (100 ug, i. m.; Cystorelin) on day 0 and an injection of prostaglandinF 2 [] (25 mg, i. m.) on day 7. The PG group received a single injection of prostaglandinF 2 [] (25 mg, i. m.) on day 7. The GIIRH treated group expressed estrus and developed luteal tissue in significantly higher percentages than the PG treated group. Pregnancy rates to embryo transfer were not different between groups (p<. 05) at 90 days post transfer. Trial 2 involved the use of two hormonal regimens for the synchronization of estrus. Cows in the I+L group received a <b>norgestomet</b> implant (6 mg) on day 0 and an injection of prostaglandin Fi (25 mg) on day 9. Cows in the SMB (Synchro-mate B) group received a <b>norgestomet</b> implant (6 mg) and an injection of SMB indictable solution (3 mg <b>norgestomet,</b> 5 mg estradiol valerate) on day 0 and implants were removed on day 9. The percentage of females expressing estrus and the percentage of females having developed luteal tissue by day 7 post-estrus was significantly higher for the SMB treated group. The conception rate to first service was not significantly different between groups. Trial 3 involved 3 synchronization protocols used in cows bred via artificial insemination. SMB treated cows received a <b>norgestomet</b> implant (6 mg) and an injection of SMB injectable solution(3 mg <b>norgestomet,</b> 5 mg estradiol valerate) on day 0 and implants were removed on day 9.

In S 3 group two additional <b>norgestomet</b> implants were inserted on Day 16 for 36 h. Artificial insemination was performed at 48 and 72 h after the implant removal. Follicular development was monitored by transrectal ultrasonography, starting on Day 10, on alternate days from Day 11 until Day 19 and then daily until apparent ovulation. Blood samples were collected on Days 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29 και 31. Cervical mucus and endometrial biopsies were collected on Days 21 and 20, respectively. Competitive EIA and ECLIA were applied to estimate serum concentrations of P 4 and E 2, respectively. Plasminogen activator activity was determined in the cervical mucus and in the endometrium by a spectrophotometric method. For the identification of plasminogen activators (t-PA and u-PA) both immunological and spectrophotometric methods were used. Hormone concentrations, enzyme activity, characteristics of dominant follicles, behavioral estrus and ovulation were compared within the four groups by Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney test. Spearman’s rank coefficient was calculated to detect correlations between hormone concentrations, enzyme activity and follicular characteristics, while x 2 was used to estimate association between other variables.

With the purpose of enhancing mounting behavior in treated and/or non-treated animals, on the third day of each trial, three other cows with an active CL were injected with 25 mg of PGF(2) alpha. All animals were examined three times a week by rectal ultrasound, and a blood sample was also taken for progesterone analysis. Sexual activity was monitored by a closed-circuit TV from 1500 to 0600 h. Direct observation was carried out from 0900 to 1200 h. A total of 15 cows displayed 36 mounting periods (11 with ovulation). Twenty-five annovulatory estrous periods were observed, 77 % supported by large follicles. More cows (66 % vs. 16 %) showed mounting activity when estradiol valerate was used as part of the progestagen treatment (P=. 03). Ovulation rate in response to the effect of <b>norgestomet</b> implant was 16 %, independent of treatment.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{experiments}} {{evaluated the}} effects of timing of the induction of ovulation in superstimulated lactating Holstein donor cows that were fixed-time artificially inseminated. Secondary objectives were to evaluate {{the effects of}} the timing of progesterone (P 4) device removal (Experiment 1) or the addition of a second <b>norgestomet</b> implant (Experiment 2) during superstimulation. In Experiment 1, 12 cows were allocated to one of four treatment groups with the timing of P 4 device removal (24 or 36 h) and pLH treatment (48 or 60 h), after the first PGF as main factors, in a Latin Square (cross-over) design. There was an interaction (P = 0. 03) between time of P 4 device removal and time of pLH treatment. Mean (± SEM) numbers of transferable embryos were higher when the P 4 device was removed at 36 h and pLH was administered at 60 h after the first PGF (P 36 LH 60 = 6. 3 ± 1. 4) compared to other treatments (P 24 LH 60 = 3. 7 ± 1. 1; P 24 LH 48 = 2. 4 ± 0. 8; or P 36 LH 48 = 2. 2 ± 0. 7). In Experiment 2, 40 cows were randomly allocated into one of four treatments with the number of <b>norgestomet</b> implants (one or two) and the time of induction of ovulation with GnRH relative to the first PGF (48 vs. 60 h) as main effects. The mean number of transferable embryos was higher (P = 0. 02) when GnRH was administered at 60 h (4. 2 ± 1. 3) compared to at 48 h (2. 7 ± 0. 8), and the number of freezable embryos was increased (P = 0. 01) in cows receiving two (3. 0 ± 1. 0) rather than one <b>norgestomet</b> implant (1. 5 ± 0. 5). In summary, embryo production in lactating Holstein cows was increased when the ovulatory stimulus (pLH or GnRH) was given 60 h after the first PGF, particularly when the P 4 device was removed 36 h after the first PGF and when two <b>norgestomet</b> ear implants were used during the superstimulation protocol...|$|E

Treatment 1 consisted of 2 injections of PGF(2 alpha) 14 d apart (n = 12); Treatment 2 of a subcutaneous 3 -mg <b>norgestomet</b> implant and an intramuscular injection of 3 mg of <b>norgestomet</b> and 5 mg estradiol valerate, with the implant removed 10 d later (n = 12; norgestomet-estradiol); Treatment 3 of norgestomet-estradiol, with a subcutaneous injection of PMSG given at time of implant removal (Day 10; n = 12); and Treatment 4 of <b>norgestomet</b> implant (as for Treatments 2 and 3) inserted for 10 d, with an intramuscular injection of PGF(2 alpha) given {{at the time of}} implant removal (n = 12). The experiment was conducted in 2 replicates (24 cows/replicate, 6 cows/group).

Both {{experiments were}} 2 x 2 factorials (eCG or No eCG, and GnRH or No GnRH), with identical treatments. In Experiment 1, 50 anestrous cows, 134. 5 +/- 2. 3 d postpartum, received a 3 mg <b>norgestomet</b> ear implant se, plus 3 mg <b>norgestomet</b> and 5 mg estradiol valerate im on Day 0. The implant was removed on Day 9, with TAI 54 h later. Cows received 400 IU eCG or no further treatment on Day 9 and GnRH (100 mu g gonadorelin) or no further treatment at TAI. Treatment with eCG increased {{the growth rate of}} the largest follicle from Days 9 to 11 (means +/- SEM, 1. 53 +/- 0. 1 vs. 0. 48 +/- 0. 1 mm/d; P < 0. 0001), its diameter on Day 11 (11. 4 +/- 0. 6 vs. 9. 3 +/- 0. 7 mm; P = 0. 03), as well as ovulation rate (80. 8 % vs. 50. 0 %, P = 0. 02), whereas GnRH improved the synchrony of ovulation (72. 0 +/- 1. 1 VS. 71. 1 +/- 2. 0 h). In Experiment 2 (n = 599 cows, 40 to 120 d postpartum), pregnancy rates differed (P = 0. 004) among groups (27. 6 %, 40. 1 %, 47. 7 %, and 55. 7 % for Control. GnRH, eCG, and eCG + GnRH groups). Both eCG and GnRH improved pregnancy rates (51. 7 % vs. 318 %, P = 0. 002; and 48. 0 % vs 37. 6 %, P = 0. 02, respectively), although their effects were not additive (no significant interaction). In conclusion, eCG at <b>norgestomet</b> implant removal increased the growth rate of the largest follicle (LF) from implant removal to TAI, the diameter of the LF at TAI, and rates of ovulation and pregnancy rates.

Pure breed Nelore cows (n= 241), on lactation with calf received one of the four treatments: new Crestar®during 10 days administrated with 3 mg of NG and 5 mg of VE (group IN/NG+VE; n= 61); new Crestar®inserted during 8 days with 50 mg of P 4 and 2 mg of BE (group IN/P 4 +BE; n= 61); reused Crestar®inserted during 10 days in association with 3 mg of <b>norgestomet</b> and 5 mg of VE (group IR/NG+VE; n= 58) or reused Crestar®inserted during 8 days in association with 50 mg of P 4 and 2 mg of BE (group IR/P 4 +BE; n= 61). On the day the releasing devices were removed the animals received 7, 5 mg of Luprostiol and after 24 hours 1 mg of BE. A fixed-time {{artificial insemination}} was done 54 to 56 hours after the removal of the releasing devices. Cows detected in estrus after the insemination at fixed-time were observed during a period of 49 days and reinseminated.

There was no interaction between the characteristics of the (new or reused) releasing devices and the treatment given at the day the releasing devices were inserted (NG+VE e P 4 +BE). The use of new or used CIDR®had no effect on TP IATF (48, 3 % vs 48, 7 %) and on TP EM (85, 2 % vs 86, 5 %).
