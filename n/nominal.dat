Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the <b>nominal</b> working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The <b>nominal</b> gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.|$|E
50|$|Masculine <b>nominals</b> {{are marked}} {{either by the}} suffix -ni or -ti, and {{feminine}} <b>nominals</b> by -ŋa or -ka. Furthermore, many <b>nominals</b> are implicitly masculine or feminine and lack overt marking. However, as <b>nominals</b> denoting properties always take regular gender suffixes that agree with the object they modify, the covert gender of these <b>nominals</b> can be ascertained.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} on nominalizations often distinguishes classes of derived (deverbal) <b>nominals</b> with an event related interpretation, commonly analyzed as {{inherited from the}} semantics of the underlying verbal/aspectual structure. However, the classes of nouns that have been called 'eventive' exhibit sometimes contrastive properties. Dealing here with three such classes of derived <b>nominals,</b> i. e., Complex Event <b>nominals</b> (CENs), Simple Event <b>nominals</b> (SENs) and 'eventive' -er <b>nominals,</b> we propose a system that distinguishes between a 'strong' grammatical event and a 'weak' semantic event {{to account for the}} properties of event inheriting <b>nominals.</b> We further account for well-known differences between these classes of <b>nominals</b> using semantic type distinctions, and pave the way to an integrated compositional analysis of deverbal <b>nominals...</b>|$|R

3000|$|Another main {{group of}} OWL 2 constructors that are {{excluded}} from the OWL 2 Learn profile are <b>nominals.</b> The OWL 2 constructors that refer to <b>nominals</b> are: ObjectOneOf (...), DataOneOf (...), ObjectHasValue (...) and DataHasValue (...) [...]. They have been used only in three ontologies of the corpus. Even though the inclusion of <b>nominals</b> gives the ontology designers more syntactic freedom, it increases the computational complexity. While OWL 2 RL includes <b>nominals,</b> <b>nominals</b> have been excluded from several Semantic Web languages and are not used in some ontologies. For example, <b>nominals</b> have been excluded from the DL ontology proposed by Kepler et al. (2006).

50|$|Research {{conducted}} by Christian Stang, Ferdinand de Saussure, Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Vladimir Dybo {{has led to}} a conclusion that Balto-Slavic <b>nominals,</b> with regard to accentuation, could be reduced to two paradigms: fixed and mobile. <b>Nominals</b> of the fixed paradigm had accent on one of the stem syllables, and in the <b>nominals</b> of the mobile paradigm, the accent alternated between the stem and the ending. As shown by Illič-Svityč, Balto-Slavic <b>nominals</b> of the fixed paradigm correspond to the PIE <b>nominals</b> with accent on the root (PIE barytones). The only exception were <b>nominals</b> with the accent on the ending (PIE oxytones) when it was shifted onto the root in Balto Slavic in accordance with Hirts law; such <b>nominals</b> also have fixed accent in Balto-Slavic.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the formal nouns mentioned above, clauses, verbs, and unanalyzable particles can also be classified as <b>nominals.</b> Clausal <b>nominals</b> are such things as sentential subjects and compliments. Verbal <b>nominals</b> usually describe their referents.|$|R

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the <b>nominal</b> interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower <b>nominal</b> interest rate.|$|E

5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term <b>nominal</b> wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed <b>nominal</b> prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed <b>nominal</b> wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a <b>nominal</b> rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} deverbal <b>nominals</b> {{denoting}} participants to processes, in a syntactic approach to word formation. The main {{goal is to}} verify the relevance of a correlation between event reading and argument structure (generally assumed for event-denoting deverbal <b>nominals</b> since Grimshaw (1990). After a careful consideration of the properties associated with different groups of participant <b>nominals,</b> we propose a three-way typology {{on the basis of}} French data, and more specifically -eur <b>nominals,</b> based on a contrast between episodic / dispositional / instrument Ns. The three classes of -eur <b>nominals</b> are distinguished on the basis of whether they involve an underlying event (and therefore a verbal base) or not; and whether the underlying event is episodic or generic. This latter property correlates with the expression of specificity on internal arguments. The proposal is further extended to <b>nominals</b> denoting internal arguments (French -é/i/u <b>nominals)</b> ...|$|R
