5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, {{there is a small}} stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is <b>not</b> <b>certain,</b> however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{started his}} career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He {{probably}} owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this is <b>not</b> <b>certain.</b>|$|E

5|$|De Coventre {{received}} a B. A. under John de Waltirstone from the University of Paris by Lent, 1333.

5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still {{found time to}} write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, by adding a finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, but it is <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E
5|$|Donald became King of Scotland. It is <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> what {{happened}} next, but an insertion in the Chronicle of Melrose states that Donald forced his three nephews into exile, {{although he was}} allied with another of his nephews, Edmund. John of Fordun wrote, centuries later, that an escort into England was arranged for them by their maternal uncle Edgar Ætheling.|$|E

5|$|Even {{once the}} mysteries were established, {{they were not}} {{performed}} everywhere Isis's cult was present. The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy, Greece, and Anatolia, although she was worshipped in nearly every province of the Roman Empire. In Egypt itself, only a few texts and images from the Roman period refer to the mysteries of Isis, and it is <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> that they were ever performed there.|$|E
5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position is <b>not</b> <b>certain.</b> Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is <b>not</b> <b>certain,</b> the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> {{that the}} slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership}} of Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> what {{significance}} {{the classic}} Maya {{gave to the}} 13th b'ak'tun.
