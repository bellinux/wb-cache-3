50|$|<b>Naevus</b> is a British {{experimental}} rock group. Formed in London in 1998 by Lloyd James (vocals, acoustic guitar) and Joanne Owen (bass, accordion), <b>Naevus</b> {{were often}} categorised {{as part of}} the ‘neo-folk’ genre. Their music has also drawn comparison with acts such as Swans and Wire, and often includes elements of industrial music.|$|E

50|$|The {{condition}} was first described by French physicians Maurice Klippel and Paul Trénaunay in 1900; {{they referred to}} it as <b>naevus</b> vasculosus osteohypertrophicus. The German-British physician Frederick Parkes Weber described cases in 1907 and 1918 that were similar but not identical to those described by Klippel and Trénaunay.|$|E
50|$|To {{diagnose}} {{basal cell}} carcinomas, a skin biopsy is performed for histopathologic analyses. The most common method is a shave biopsy under local anesthesia. Most nodular basal cell cancers can be diagnosed clinically; however, other variants {{can be very}} difficult to distinguish from benign lesions such as intradermal <b>naevus,</b> sebaceomas, fibrous papules, early acne scars, and hypertrophic scarring.|$|E
5000|$|The nomen Naevius is {{generally}} regarded as a patronymic surname derived from the praenomen Gnaeus, indicating a birthmark. [...] Gnaeus and <b>naevus,</b> the usual form of the Latin word for a birthmark, were pronounced similarly, {{and a number of}} other Latin words could be spelled with either gn- or n-, such as gnatus and natus, [...] "born".|$|E
5000|$|Susskind {{was born}} with a {{prominent}} vascular birthmark (of the <b>naevus</b> flammeus aka [...] "port-wine stain" [...] variety) on his right cheek. He grew up in New York City and in 1983 married Leslie Tuttle. They raised their two children in Southborough, MA where Susskind created the Southborough Open Land Foundation. They currently live in Cambridge, MA.|$|E
5000|$|The genus name Ixoreus {{comes from}} the Ancient Greek ixos, [...] "mistletoe". This was a synonym of a former name for the mockingbird genus, Mimus; the genus creator Bonaparte assumed wrongly that, because Swainson had shown a mockingbird and this thrush on the same plate of his book, they were related. The {{specific}} naevius is Latin for [...] "spotted" [...] from <b>naevus,</b> [...] " [...] spot".|$|E
50|$|According to Festus, the praenomen Gnaeus {{originally}} {{referred to}} a birthmark, which was <b>naevus</b> in Latin. This etymology is generally accepted by modern scholars. In his treatise {{on the origin of}} Roman praenomina, Chase cites the archaic spelling Gnaivos in support of this explanation. However, as with other praenomina, Gnaeus was generally chosen because it was a family name, not necessarily because the children who received it had a noteworthy birthmark.|$|E
5000|$|Nevus (pl: nevi) is a nonspecific medical {{term for}} a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion of the skin or mucosa. The term {{originates}} from <b>nævus,</b> which is Latin for [...] "birthmark," [...] however, a nevus can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Common terms, including mole, birthmark, and beauty mark, are used to describe nevi, but these terms do not distinguish specific types of nevi from one another.|$|E
50|$|The band {{released}} four albums between 1999 and 2004 before expanding to a four-piece {{with the}} addition of John Murphy (drums) and Greg Ferrari (electric guitar). Their first album with the expanded line-up was Silent Life, which was a critical success, and included contributions from members of Urge Within, Sieben, and Current 93. Their sixth album Relatively Close To The Sea saw them combining elements of their earlier post-punk sounds alongside more melodic material and progressive rock elements. In 2009, Hunter Barr returned as drummer, having previously played on EP The Body Speaks in 2004, and the EP Days that Go followed in 2010. The seventh <b>Naevus</b> album, The Division of Labour, was completed by Lloyd James as a solo effort and was released in May 2012. In 2013, the compilation CDs Stations and Others were released, gathering together all singles, B-sides and compilation tracks from 2001 to 2012 as well as new and previously unreleased material. The EP Backsaddling was released in 2014. The eighth <b>Naevus</b> studio album, Curses, is due for release in the summer of 2017.|$|E

50|$|Secondary CVG {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a number of diseases or drugs that produce changes in scalp structure. These include: acromegaly (excessive growth hormone levels due to pituitary gland tumours), excessive drug use that mimics acromegaly (including the injection of growth hormone itself and drugs that stimulate growth hormone output, such as GHRP-6 and CJC-1295), melanocytic naevi (moles), birthmarks (including connective tissue naevi, fibromas and <b>naevus</b> lipomatosus), and inflammatory processes (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, Darier disease, folliculitis, impetigo, atopic dermatitis, acne).|$|E

50|$|They are growths, like tumours {{found in}} organs {{as a result}} of faulty development. They are {{normally}} made up of a mixture of tissues. They contain mucus-filled glands, with retention cysts, abundant connective tissue, and a chronic cellular infiltration of eosinophils. They grow at the normal rate of the host tissue and rarely cause problems such as compression. A common example of a hamartomatous lesion is a strawberry <b>naevus.</b> Hamartomatous polyps are often found by chance; occurring in syndromes such as Peutz-Jegher Syndrome or Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Macrocephaly-capillary {{malformation}} (M-CM) is {{a multiple}} malformation syndrome causing abnormal body and head overgrowth and cutaneous, vascular, neurologic, and limb abnormalities. Though not every patient has all features, commonly found signs include macrocephaly, congenital macrosomia, extensive cutaneous capillary malformation (<b>naevus</b> flammeus or port-wine stain type birthmark {{over much of}} the body; a capillary malformation of the upper lip or philtrum is seen in many patients with this condition), body asymmetry (also called hemihyperplasia or hemihypertrophy), polydactyly or syndactyly of the hands and feet, lax joints, doughy skin, variable developmental delay and other neurologic problems such as seizures and low muscle tone.|$|E
50|$|A great anatomist of the {{auditory}} system, Politzer wrote and illustrated extensively on it, {{and left a}} remarkable collection of anatomic and pathological specimens in Vienna, which were donated to the Anatomy and Pathology Museum. The luminous cone of the tympanic membrane is named after him, {{as well as the}} Unna-Politzer <b>naevus,</b> a typical birthmark found on the nape of the neck in 25 to 50% of normal persons. In addition, in 1893 Politzer was the first to describe otosclerosis as a separate clinical entity. He also studied the pathology of cholesteatoma, serous otitis media, labyrinthitis, congenital deafness and intracranial complications of otitis media.|$|E
5000|$|In 1896, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen wrote {{a letter}} to Franz Exner and {{informed}} him of his finding - the X-ray. This led to intensive research in this field. [...] A few days later (even before Röntgen had a chance to present his findings in Würzburg), the College of Physicians presented the first radiograph of a shotgun injury. The first radiologic atlas was published by Josef Maria Eder and Eduard Valenta in February 1896. Even the first angiogram was produced in Vienna by Eduard Haschek and the idea to use X-rays in radiotherapy came from Leopold Freund, who very successfully treated a <b>naevus</b> with it.|$|E
5000|$|White sponge nevus (WSN, {{or white}} sponge <b>naevus,</b> Cannon's disease, {{hereditary}} leukokeratosis of mucosa, white sponge nevus of Cannon, familial white folded dysplasia, or oral epithelial nevus), is an autosomal dominant {{condition of the}} oral mucosa (the mucous membrane lining of the mouth). It {{is caused by a}} mutations in certain genes coding for keratin, which causes a defect in the normal process of keratinization of the mucosa. This results in lesions which are thick, white and velvety {{on the inside of the}} cheeks within the mouth. Usually, these lesions are present from birth or develop during childhood. The condition is entirely harmless, and no treatment is required ...|$|E
50|$|The first {{attempted}} {{x-ray treatment}} was by Victor Despeignes, a French physician who used {{them on a}} patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment {{was followed by a}} diminution of pain and reduction {{in the size of the}} tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments. Freund's first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a <b>naevus</b> in order to induce epilation and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of lupus vulgaris. A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in x-ray therapies. Thereafter they did a successful treatment of lupus erythematosus in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a 'butterfly-patch' which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Diagnosis of <b>naevus</b> lesions may be complex {{where they}} contain {{little or no}} pigmentation. <b>Naevus</b> spilus (or <b>naevus</b> on <b>naevus)</b> is, generally, readily {{identified}} by the difference in pigmentation between overlying and underlying naevi and healthy skin. Malignant transformation of <b>naevus</b> spilus is rare. We report two cases of melanoma in which surgical procedures revealed underlying melanocyte lesions, diagnosed at histology but undetectable on clinical examination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two patients were operated for melanoma in which surgery, at a site remote from the melanoma, suggested incomplete relapse {{despite the fact that}} previous clinical examination had indicated healthy skin. A diagnosis was made of melanoma in invisible <b>naevus</b> spilus. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of melanoma in invisible <b>naevus</b> spilus may be suspected where several naevi are found together in a specific area. The main problem is the therapeutic stance to be adopted since complete excision of the underlying naevi is difficult in practice. Wood's light examination may be helpful...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{presence}} of multiple melanocytic naevi {{is a strong}} risk factor for melanoma. Use of the whole body <b>naevus</b> count to identify at-risk patients is impractical. OBJECTIVES: To (i) identify a valid anatomical predictor of total <b>naevus</b> count; (ii) {{determine the number of}} naevi that most accurately predict total <b>naevus</b> count above 25, 50 and 100; and (iii) evaluate determinants of multiple melanocytic naevi and atypical naevi. METHODS: Clinical data from 292 consecutive Spanish patients consulting for skin lesions requiring debriding were collected throughout 2009 and 2010. Correlations between site-specific and whole body <b>naevus</b> counts were analysed. Cut-offs to predict total <b>naevus</b> counts were determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The studied population was young (median age 31  years, interquartile range 28 - 43). The <b>naevus</b> count on the right arm correlated best with the total nevus count (R(2) 0 · 80 for men, 0 · 86 for women). Presence of at least five naevi on the right arm was the strongest determinant of a total <b>naevus</b> count above 50 [odds ratio (OR) 34 · 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 13 · 9 - 85 · 0] and of having at least one atypical <b>naevus</b> (OR 5 · 7, 95 % CI 2 · 4 - 13 · 5). Cut-off values of 6, 8 and 11 naevi on the right arm best predicted total <b>naevus</b> count above 25, 50 and 100, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the arm as a practical and reliable site to estimate the total <b>naevus</b> count when screening or phenotyping large populations. Threshold values for the number of naevi on the arm are proposed to help identify patients for melanoma screening...|$|E

40|$|<b>Naevus</b> {{count is}} the strongest risk factor for {{melanoma}}. Body Mass Index (BMI) {{has been linked to}} melanoma risk. In this study, we investigate the link between <b>naevus</b> count and height, weight and bone mineral density (BMD) in the TwinsUK cohort (N = 2119). In addi-tion we adjusted for leucocyte telomere length (LTL) as LTL is linked to both BMD and <b>naevus</b> count. <b>Naevus</b> count was positively associated with height (p = 0. 001) but not with weight (p = 0. 187) despite adjusting for age and twin relatedness. This suggests that the previously reported melanoma association with BMI may be explained by height alone. Fur-ther adjustment for LTL did not affect the significance of the association between height and <b>naevus</b> count so LTL does not fully explain these results. BMD was associated with naevu...|$|E
