Since this <b>neuro-protective</b> effect originated from cryotherapy-treated PC- 3 cells, the presence of putative factors secreted by PC- 3 cells in the medium following cryo-shock was analyzed.

Therefore, this study explored potential <b>neuro-protective</b> effects of GR through its systemic metabolic regulating mechanism by using mass spectrometry–based metabolomic profiling. Rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with GR intravenously. Their metabolic profiles in serum were measured by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry on 1 and 3 days after MCAO. GR exhibited a potent <b>neuro-protective</b> effect by significantly decreasing the neurological scores and infarct volume in the MCAO rats. Moreover, 18 differential metabolites were tentatively identified, all of which appeared to correlate well with these disease indices.

Early neonatal brain injury may be preceded by low {{cerebral blood flow}} (CBF) and elevated cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE). This study investigated the effect of antenatal MgSO₄ on cerebral oxygen delivery, consumption, and cFTOE in preterm infants. METHODS: CBF and tissue oxygenation index were measured, and oxygen delivery, consumption, and cFTOE calculated within 24 [*]h of birth and at 48 and 72 [*]h of life in 36 infants ≤ 30 [*]wk gestation exposed to MgSO₄ and 29 unexposed infants. RESULTS: Total internal carotid blood flow and cerebral oxygen delivery did not differ between the groups at the three study time-points. Cerebral oxygen consumption and cFTOE were lower in infants exposed to antenatal MgSO₄ (P = 0. 012) compared to unexposed infants within 24 [*]h of delivery. This difference was not evident by 48 [*]h of age. Fewer infants in the MgSO₄ group developed P/IVH by 72 [*]h of age (P = 0. 03).

40|$|Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} disabling neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe difficulties with body motions and associated with autonomic dysfunction, depression, and dementia. Oxidative stress {{is thought to}} play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD and oxidative damage characterizes proteins, lipids, and DNA in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of PD patients. To date, L-dopa is the most effective medication for controlling PD symptoms, although long-term treatment can enhance oxidative stress and accelerate the degenerative process of residual cells. Thus, the inhibition of oxidation of L-dopa and the inhibition of reactive oxygen species formation are important strategies for <b>neuro-protective</b> therapy. Therefore, efforts are made not only to improve the effect of L-dopa treatment for PD, but also to investigate new drugs with both antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Hespiridin (HDN), a naturally occurring flavonoid presents in fruits and vegetables, has been reported to exert a wide range of pharmacological effects including antioxidant, anti-hypercholesterolemic, antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and <b>neuro-protective</b> actions.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of physical exercise in promoting retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival in acute IOP elevation models in rats. METHODS: Sprague Dawley Rats of 4 - 5 weeks old were divided into exercise group(n= 5) and control group(n= 8). In exercise group, the rats were housed separately in cage with a free running wheel while in control group the rats were housed separately in the same cage without running wheel system. The IOP was elevated to 140 mmHg for 75 minutes after 30 days of housing in right eyes of all rats. On day 37, RGC was retrogradely labeled by fluorogold (FG).

Current AD therapies largely focus on symptomatic aspects of the clinical pathology, but {{they have yet to}} demonstrate any major impact on the disease progression [1]. The most important role of the research aimed at fighting the AD is the development of <b>neuro-protective</b> agents, able to interfere with the protein aggregation process whose clinical signature is represented by the plaques deposition. An important role in AD’s framework could be played by Heat shock proteins (HSPs), highly regulated proteins that mediate the proteins proper folding and promote recovery of their native conformations lost due to stress [2]. Recently, it was shown that HSP 60 mediates translocation of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Amyloid Beta peptide (Aβ) to the mitochondria, leading to dysfunction of the organelle [3].

40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis was {{to evaluate the}} effects of inflammation at very preterm birth on subsequent morbidity, {{as well as on}} the <b>neuro-protective</b> IGF-system. Prospective clinical studies of very preterm infants constituted a base for the evaluation. Temporal changes in levels of cytokines were chosen as markers of an induced inflammatory response and were evaluated together with components of the IGF-system at birth and during the first 3 postnatal days. The studies could describe associations between increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent morbidity. Inflammation present in cord blood related to impaired developmental outcome at 2 years of age, as well as to changes in components of the IGF-system, which indicates that inflammation present already before delivery may injure the immature brain and interfere with <b>neuro-protective</b> mechanisms. A postnatal increase in cytokines was on the other hand associated with early morbidity, such as arterial hypotension and cerebral hemorrhage. Concentrations of IGF-I displayed a temporal decrease from birth and onwards, suggesting a low endogenous production after very preterm birth. We could show that exogenous administration of IGF-I from adult donor plasma elevated low endogenous levels of IGF-I in extremely preterm infants without any side effects. In summary, these findings imply that the time point of an induced inflammatory response appears important for type of subsequent morbidity. This may be of relevance for determining an optimal time point of delivery and for intervention with anti-inflammatory or protective strategies, with the purpose to decrease brain injury after very preterm birth...|$|E
