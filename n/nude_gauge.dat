A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the <b>nude</b> <b>gauge</b> is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in {{the wall of the}} chamber.

40|$|A {{stainless}} steel, Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) chamber, {{featuring a}} large vertical rectangular port (53 ”W by 16 ”H), has been fabricated {{to house the}} one-meter magnet assembly of a newly installed undulator insertion device for beamline X- 25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source. To achieve UHV, the new chamber {{is equipped with a}} differential ion pump, NEG pump, <b>nude</b> ion <b>gauge,</b> residual gas analyzer, and an all metal roughing valve. Temperature of the magnet assembly is maintained below 90 oC during vacuum bake. The large rectangular port cover is sealed to the main flange of the chamber using a one-piece flat aluminum gasket and special sealing surfaces developed exclusively by Nor-Cal Products, Inc. The large flange provides easy access to the gap of the installed magnet girders for in situ magnetic measurements and shimming. Special window ports were designed into the cover and chamber for manipulation of optical micrometers external to th...|$|R
40|$|Manganese {{films have}} been {{identified}} as potential candidates for the self-formation of barriers to prevent the diffusion of copper interconnects into the underlying silicon substrate. Given the complex topography of the modern integrated circuits where these diffusion barriers are to be used and the unique nature of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), those methods are considered to replace the traditional physical deposition approach, forming more conformal diffusion barriers layers. In this project, the growth of manganese-based films on silicon substrates via chemical deposition of two Mn metalorganic complexes, bis(N,N '-di-isopropyl-pentylamidinato) Mn(II)) (Mn Amidinate) and methylcyclopentadienyl-manganese(I) tricarbonyl (MeCpMn(CO) 3, was characterized and contrasted by using an instrument equipped with a reactor coupled to a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analytical chamber. The goal of this project is to develop a molecular-level understanding of the surface chemistry for the precursor to improve the selection of manganese precursors. In our initial studies on the nature of films prepared by chemical means using MeCpMn(CO) 3 as the precursor, it was found that a manganese silicate layer grows first and a thin manganese silicide film develops latter at the SiO 2 /Si (100) interface between approximately 550 and 750 K. It was also found that a typical <b>nude</b> ion <b>gauge</b> is capable of enhancing the deposition through gas-phase activation of MeCpMn(CO) 3 by electron bombardment. Finally, Mn Amidinate was proved to be highly reactive, affording the deposition of Mn at reasonable rates, higher at higher temperatures, but also leading to the incorporation of nitrogen and additional carbon in the grown Mn(0) films; MeCpMn(CO) 3, by contrast, was quite unreactive, but did not leave nitrogen contaminants on the surface. As with the carbonyl precursor, deposition with the Mn amidinate leads to the formation of a nonstoichiometric mixture of MnOx + SiOx and Mn silicate first, possibly followed by the formation of a thin subsurface Mn silicide layer. The combined Mn silicate/Mn silicide structure acts as an effective diffusion barrier, after which Mn(0) metallic films can be grown on top. One copper precursor, copper (I) - N,N '-di- sec -butylacetamidinate, was also deposited on the as-formed manganese thin film above with different ratios of Mn(0) and Mn silicate. Details of the results from this work are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The ESA comet mission Rosetta was {{launched}} in early March 2004. The goal of this mission is the rendez-vous with comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014. The spacecraft will then accompany the comet towards the sun for about one year. During this close encounter {{the evolution of the}} nucleus and the coma will be monitored and analyzed. One of the instruments on board is the Comet Pressure Sensor. Two gauges are integrated in the sensor, which allow the measurement of the dynamic pressure and the total neutral particle density in the cometary coma. From these measurements the expansion velocity of the coma can be derived. Starting shortly after launch during a time period of about 2 years several tests and background measurements of the total particle density {{in the vicinity of the}} spacecraft have been made. Some data were collected during the Rosetta thruster firing cycles which show a huge pressure increase during thruster operation by several orders of magnitude above the background pressure. After 2 years flight duration the background pressure around the spacecraft is about 2 × 10 - 11 mbar whereas values up to 1 × 10 - 5 mbar have been recorded during the thruster operation. Such high pressures might induce, in the worst case, high voltage discharges as well as be responsible for a contamination layer on sensitive, exposed surfaces of the payload.
