An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace <b>negotiations.</b> <b>Negotiations</b> may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during <b>negotiations.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Negotiation</b> {{is a vital}} {{component}} of electronic trading. It is the key decision-making approach used to reach consensus between trading partners. Generally, the trading partners implement various <b>negotiation</b> strategies {{in an attempt to}} maximize their utilities.

In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute mobile agent-based <b>negotiation</b> strategy that maximizes client’s utility. The strategy focuses on one-to-many bilateral <b>negotiation.</b> It considers different factors that have significant effect on the scheduling of various <b>negotiation</b> phases: offer collection, evaluation, <b>negotiation,</b> and bid settlement.

This <b>negotiation</b> conflict occurs during the bilateral <b>negotiation</b> process between the participants due to the misperception, aggressive behavior, and uncertain preferences and goals about their opponents. Existing research work focuses on the prerequest context of <b>negotiation</b> conflict optimization by grouping similar <b>negotiation</b> pairs using distance, binary, context-dependent, and fuzzy similarity approaches. For some extent, these approaches can maximize the success rate and minimize the communication overhead among the participants. To further optimize the success rate and communication overhead, the proposed research work introduces a novel probabilistic decision making model for optimizing the <b>negotiation</b> {{conflict in}} the long-term <b>negotiation</b> context. This decision model formulates the problem of managing different types of <b>negotiation</b> conflict that occurs during <b>negotiation</b> process as a multistage Markov decision problem. At each stage of <b>negotiation</b> process, the proposed decision model generates the heuristic decision based on the past <b>negotiation</b> state information without causing any break-off among the participants.
