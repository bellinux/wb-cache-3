500|$|Eddie Condon, Hoagy Carmichael, and Mezz Mezzrow, {{all of whom}} hyperbolically {{raved about}} his playing, also saw Beiderbecke play live or {{performed}} alongside him. Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] But I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E

500|$|Vocalist Karl Willetts of {{the death}} metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an {{inspiration}} for the band: [...] "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like that before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica. So we took the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together." [...] Chuck Schuldiner of the band Death said the record was [...] "life changing at the time" [...] asserting, [...] "That was {{some of the early}} stuff that gave me that push." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there was something about it. I've <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic rated New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light {{four stars}} {{out of five}} with {{reviewer}} Fred Thomas commenting that [...] "Stetson explores scorched landscapes and heavenly scenes alike with his stylized playing." [...] In his review for Consequence of Sound, Jeremy D. Larson lauded Stetson's album as [...] "his strongest and most cohesive collection in his career" [...] and suggested that [...] "you’ve <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it", giving a mark of four-and-a-half stars out of five. Vol. 3 received an eight out of ten review from Drowned in Sound, where Alexander Tudor found the album to be [...] "essential listening and another triumph." [...] Exclaim! magazine's Vincent Pollard awarded the album a perfect ten out of ten score, praising its [...] "accessible and compelling compositions" [...] and dubbing it a [...] "masterpiece." [...] Angus Finlayson of FACT magazine was more critical, rating the album three-and-a-half out of five and commenting that Vernon's vocals [...] "run the risk of taming Stetson’s playing." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the group}} have {{generally}} been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several notable musicians, including Rush, John Lydon, Marc Almond, Graham Coxon, Luca Prodan, Mark E. Smith, John Frusciante, Bruce Dickinson and Julian Cope. Dickinson, {{who has been a}} fan of the band since he saw them at Oundle School aged 13, said that Hammill was one of his childhood heroes. Coxon is particularly fond of [...] "House with No Door" [...] from H to He (1970), saying the track is [...] "extremely beautiful, with Jackson's truly lovely sax-and-flute instrumental section." [...] Almond recalled hearing [...] "Killer" [...] for the first time saying, [...] "I'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it before. It wasn't just Peter's snarling operatic vocal, it was the mix of instruments... I became an instant fan." [...] Mentioning their reputation as something of an acquired taste, Lydon said, [...] "There's a few Van Der Graaf things I like, but I'm not going to recommend anything to anyone. It might not be for them. Music doesn't come with a set of guidelines." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis of Korn said {{he respects}} Metallica as his {{favorite}} band; he said, [...] "I love that they've done things {{their own way}} and they've persevered {{over the years and}} they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever." [...] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, [...] "they really changed my life when I was 16 years oldI'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> that heavy". Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, [...] "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppetsand the staying powera timeless record like that". Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, [...] "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a [...] "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are [...] "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'", and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.|$|E

500|$|According to Greil Marcus, Martin Scorsese {{said that}} the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film Taxi Driver was based on Astral Weeks. Marcus {{referred}} {{to the impact of}} the album, calling it a [...] "common language", and relates that [...] "I was so shocked when I was teaching a seminar at Princeton just a couple years ago, and out of 16 students, four of them said their favorite album was Astral Weeks." [...] Marcus goes on to say, [...] "Now, how did it enter their lives? We're talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born, and yet it spoke to them. They understood its language as soon as they heard it." [...] Elvis Costello described Astral Weeks as [...] "still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium, and there hasn't been a record with that amount of daring made since". Johnny Depp, in a Rolling Stone interview in 2008, recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother (by ten years), tiring of Johnny's favourite music of the time said, [...] "'Try this.' And he put on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. And it stirred me. I'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it." [...] Joan Armatrading has said that Astral Weeks was the first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically. In August 2010, director and choreographer, Jessica Wallenfels, staged a production in Portland, Oregon of a rock opera/story ballet of Astral Weeks called [...] "Find me Beside You".|$|E
500|$|Chandler {{had been}} {{dissatisfied}} with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he took the advice of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, after taking a five-week break from recording while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Assisted by engineer Mike Ross, the band were especially productive during the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] and basic instrumental tracks for [...] "Love or Confusion", [...] "Can You See Me", and [...] "Third Stone from the Sun". Ross recalled the impact of Hendrix's Marshall stacks: [...] "It was so loud you couldn't stand in the studio... I'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it in my life." [...] When Ross asked Hendrix where he would like the microphone placed Hendrix replied: [...] "Oh, man, just put a mic about twelve feet away {{on the other side}} of the studio. It'll sound great." [...] Ross agreed, and with a Neumann U87 tube mic he recorded Hendrix's guitar playing in a large room that, according to Ross, [...] "was absolutely vital to the uniquely powerful Experience sound." [...] Ross noted that input from Mitchell and Redding was minimized, and he asserted that Chandler was clearly [...] "the one in charge" [...] of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and backup vocals were overdubbed. Despite his dwindling finances, Chandler encouraged the Experience to record numerous takes of a song, affording them the luxury of repeated attempts at a satisfactory recording. With a live instrument track as the foundation of the recordings, they eschewed the common practice of piecing together parts of several takes to make one continuous piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their television debut, on Britain's Ready Steady Go! ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed's {{breakthrough}} album, Transformer, {{was released}} in November 1972. Transformer was co-produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK. The hit single [...] "Walk on the Wild Side" [...] was an ironic yet affectionate salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol. When first introduced to Reed's music, Bowie had said, [...] "I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> quite like it. It was a revelation to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is {{recognized}} for widening hip-hop’s vocabulary, {{as well as}} instrumentation and samples within hip-hop music. It is also recognized for influencing {{a wide range of}} acclaimed hip-hop and R artists, including Common, D'Angelo, Digable Planets, Erykah Badu, Fugees, J Dilla, Kendrick Lamar, Mos Def, Outkast and Kanye West. Pharrell Williams stated [...] "I listened to [...] "Bonita" [...] everyday. I’d <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like that in my life. That’s where I changed". On another occasion, Williams explained that People's Instinctive Travels [...] "caused a turning point in my life, which made me see that music was art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have claimed}} that the sound of [...] "That's Alright" [...] was not entirely new, [...] "It wasn't that they said 'I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it before.' It wasn't as if this started a revolution, it {{galvanized}} a revolution. Not because Elvis had expressed something new, but he expressed something {{they had all been}} trying to express." [...] Sam Phillips indicated that for him it was a new sound, saying [...] "It just broke me up". And many echo the sentiment that it was a sound like no other they had heard: [...] "When I first heard Elvis singing 'That's Alright Mama'. The time just stood still. It knocked my socks off." [...] --Ramon Maupin.|$|E
2500|$|Musically, Harper's {{earliest}} influences were American blues musician Lead Belly {{and folk}} singer Woody Guthrie and, in his teens, jazz musician Miles Davis. Of the blues musicians Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy and Josh White Harper said they made music which [...] "...seemed {{to be from}} a different planet ...We'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it. It changed our world overnight, a sledge hammer of a cultural change ...an equivalent would be to suddenly hear music from outer space". Harper was also exposed to classical music in his childhood and has pointed {{to the influence of}} Jean Sibelius's Karelia Suite. Lyrical influences include the 19th century Romantics, especially Shelley, and Keats's poem [...] "Endymion". Harper has also cited the Beat poets as being highly influential, particularly Jack Kerouac.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked what}} made her singing style unique, she once said [...] "my feeling for a lyric, I'm a storyteller and I try to have {{excellent}} diction so you don't have to guess what I'm saying. Some people listen to a song for years and don't know what the lyric is." [...] In 1965 while listening to “Violets For Your Furs” by Billie Holiday, Alexandria said:"There’s not too much left to say about Billie Holiday, {{how is it possible}} for a woman to be this great? This comes from a period when she wasn’t supposed to be singing too well but I’ve <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> by her that I didn’t realize what she was feeling which is very important regardless of the shape of the pipes or what may be happening [...] She always got the message across. She never failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mel Powell {{was born}} Melvin D. Epstein on February 12, 1923, in The Bronx, New York City to Russian Jewish parents, Milton Epstein and Mildred Mark Epstein. He began playing piano at age four, taking lessons from, among others, Nadia Reisenberg. A passionate {{baseball}} fan, his home was {{within sight of}} Yankee Stadium. A hand injury while playing baseball as a boy, however, convinced him to pursue music instead of sports as a career. Powell dreamed {{of life as a}} concert pianist until his older brother took him to see jazz pianist Teddy Wilson play, and later to a concert featuring Benny Goodman. In a 1987 interview with The New Yorker magazine Powell said [...] "I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> as ecstatic as this music", prompting a shift from classical to jazz piano. By the age of 14 Powell was performing jazz professionally around New York City. As early as 1939, he was working with Bobby Hackett, George Brunies, and Zutty Singleton, as well as writing arrangements for Earl Hines. He changed his last name from Epstein to Powell in 1941 shortly before joining Benny Goodman's band.|$|E
2500|$|When Figo {{returned}} to Barcelona {{for the first}} time in a Real Madrid shirt on 21 October 2000, the noise at Camp Nou was deafening. There were banners hung around the stadium with words like [...] "Traitor", [...] "Judas", [...] "Scum", and [...] "Mercenary". Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout, and when he came out of the tunnel and ran onto the field the jeers of almost 98,000 Barcelona fans escalated, with a visibly shocked Figo putting his fingers to his ears. When El Clásico started, each time Figo got the ball the noise rose with insults and missiles flying such as oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters and mobile phones. The regular corner taker for Madrid, Figo did not take any corners at the Camp Nou to avoid being in close proximity to the fans. Barcelona were victorious, winning 2–0, and Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez stated after the match, [...] "The atmosphere got to us all." [...] Madrid defender Iván Campo commented, [...] "That night when Figo first went back was incredible. I’ve <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>anything</b> like it. Luís didn't deserve that. He'd given his all for Barcelona. It was built up before: 'a traitor’s coming,' the media said. No, Luís Figo is coming, one of the greats for you. That night hurt him, you could see. His head was bowed and he was thinking: 'bloody hell, I was here last season ...' But my lasting emotion was admiration: you’ve got balls." ...|$|E
