5|$|Pre-season {{fears of}} a {{conflict}} with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with.</b> Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role, and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames fair value on his contract, Tanguay requested a trade at the Christmas break. He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet {{so as not to}} become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay's request was revealed in the off-season. He suffered offensively, falling to 58 points.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 {{and formed}} his own {{production}} company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu's departure {{was that the}} company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo, and he was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the new location. Also, he cites {{the fact that he}} had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. Uematsu composed only the main theme for Final Fantasy XII (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for Final Fantasy XIII (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of Final Fantasy XIV, Uematsu decided to hand the job over to the main Final Fantasy XIII composer, Hamauzu.|$|E

His appearance was panned by critics and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who stated that Bieber was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who stated {{that he did not}} enjoy the presence of Bieber or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.|$|E
25|$|String theory, as {{mentioned}} above, {{ran into a}} problem: another version of the equations was discovered, then another, and then another. Eventually, five major string theories were developed. The main differences between the theories were principally the number of dimensions in which the strings developed, and their characteristics (some were open loops, some were closed loops, etc.). Furthermore, all these theories appeared to be workable. Scientists were <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> five seemingly contradictory sets of equations to describe the same thing.|$|E
25|$|Some generic {{drugs are}} viewed with {{suspicion}} by doctors. For example, warfarin (Coumadin) has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent blood tests {{to make sure}} patients {{do not have a}} subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in Ontario showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe, but many physicians are <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> their patients taking branded generic equivalents. In some countries (for example, Australia) where a drug is prescribed under more than one brand name, doctors may choose not to allow pharmacists to substitute a brand different from the one prescribed unless the consumer requests it.|$|E

He returned to local politics and left the Land League. He sold the Connaught Telegraph to T.H. Gillespie in 1888 and became a full time farmer. He continued in local Government and served on Mayo County Council and Castlebar Urban District Council. Remaining a force in local politics, he supported the United Irish League and was President of the Connacht '98 Council.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{was ordered}} home by London as the Foreign Office was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea of}} him {{commanding}} the Chinese Army against Russia if war should break out, believing that this would cause an Anglo-Russian war and Gordon {{was told that he}} would be dishonorably discharged if he remained in China. Though the Qing court rejected Gordon's advice to seek a compromise with Russia in the summer of 1880, Gordon's assessment of China's military backwardness and his stark warnings that the Russians would win if a war did break out {{played an important role in}} ultimately strengthening the peace party at the court and preventing war.|$|E
25|$|Their fourth record Meltdown, {{released}} in 2004, was the band's final record with Hatherley {{before returning to}} their original three-piece lineup for their fifth studio album Twilight of the Innocents in 2007. After five conventional albums the band released 26 singles in The A-Z Series in 2009, one every two weeks. The band have had one silver, two gold and two platinum-selling (and chart-topping) records in the United Kingdom, as well as 18 songs in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. In 2015, they released a sixth studio album, entitled Kablammo!. They were associated with Britpop, though as that musical movement emphasised Britishness which is a controversial state in Northern Ireland, they were <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the association.|$|E

25|$|While the SAF was {{concerned}} {{of the safety}} of out gay and trans men living and working with straight servicemen it was also reluctant to exempt them from the compulsory National Service that all Singaporean men had to perform. However, post-operative male-to-female transsexuals were exempted from National Service as the Singapore Government recognised their new gender identity as women. It is unknown if post-operative female-to-male transsexuals perform National Service, though {{it is unlikely that}} many of them exist who have undergone their operation by the time of enlistment, around the age of 18. In any case, most homosexuals did (and do) not declare their sexual orientation during this examination and go on to serve in all variety of vocations. Gay men do not come out for many reasons, the most common being that they are <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> declaring their sexuality to a State and organisation that is perceived to be homophobic. Some gay men also refrain from coming out as they wish to perform their duties alongside others, and find the segregation of homosexuals offensive.|$|E
25|$|BNL's second album, Maybe You Should Drive, {{released}} in 1994, fared considerably less {{well with the}} Canadian public. They tried touring the United States, but the tour was a failure and ended up losing money despite an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Before the next release Andy Creeggan {{decided to leave the}} band. He had become disillusioned with the direction of the band, and was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the fame the group had attained. According to Page, he had considered leaving as early as the rehearsals for the Drive album; The rest of the band convinced him to stay to record that album, and for the subsequent touring. In addition, Creeggan wanted to attend McGill University to study music further. Tyler Stewart has also suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement by Stewart as percussionist. Andy Creeggan's departure came during a time in which members of the band were starting to become sick of each other, with Page and Robertson rarely speaking to one another. Stewart cites the departure as worsening the situation. Page also began struggling with both alcohol abuse and depression. In an attempt to correct the band's downward slide, they signed with Terry McBride and Nettwerk as their management.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of her dance at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, Srintil is told that she must undergo a ritual before she can truly become a ronggeng, called bukak klambu (literally [...] "opening the veil"); her virginity will be sold to the highest bidder. This upsets Rasus, who tells Srintil that he is <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> her {{becoming}} a ronggeng. Srintil says that she will give her virginity to Rasus, and {{on the day of}} the bukak klambu they have sex in a goat shack; that evening, Srintil has sex with two other [...] "highest bidders" [...] and becomes a full ronggeng.|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra, [...] "then they would go off with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals". However, more trouble arose as Madonna was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began in September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.|$|E
500|$|In May 1878, Bond {{made her}} first {{appearance}} on the dramatic stage {{at the age of}} 25, creating the role of Cousin Hebe in W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore. [...] The role had been written for a veteran performer, Mrs Howard Paul. But Gilbert and Sullivan were unhappy with Mrs. Paul's vocal abilities, which were deteriorating. [...] Finally, with only about a week to go before opening night, Carte hired Bond to play Cousin Hebe. At this stage of her career, Bond was <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> spoken dialogue, and so her character was written out, or given nothing to say, in several scenes. After opening night, however, a portion of the recitative was converted to spoken dialogue, and Bond would have dialogue in all of the remaining roles that she created. [...] She quickly grew to enjoy character acting.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's further {{inspiration}} for the track came from the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. She introduced liturgical words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning. With superficial pop lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface, the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners. Leonard {{explained that he was}} <b>not</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the lyrics and the sexual innuendos present in it. He gave the example of the first verse for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] which goes [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer, I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there." [...] Leonard understood that the dual meaning referred to someone performing fellatio. Being aghast he requested that Madonna change the line, but she was adamant about keeping it.|$|E
