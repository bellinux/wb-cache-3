40|$|The work {{presented}} here addresses {{the question of}} how to determine whether a grammar formalism is powerful enough to describe <b>natural</b> <b>languages.</b> The expressive power of a formalism can be characterized in terms of i) the string languages it generates (weak generative capacity (WGC)) or ii) the tree languages it generates (strong generative capacity (SGC)). The notion of WGC is not enough to determine whether a formalism is adequate for <b>natural</b> <b>languages.</b> We argue that even SGC is problematic since the sets of trees a grammar formalism for <b>natural</b> <b>languages</b> should be able to generate is difficult to determine. The concrete syntactic structures assumed for <b>natural</b> <b>languages</b> depend very much on theoretical stipulations and empirical evidence for syntactic structures is rather hard to obtain. Therefore, for lexicalized formalisms, we propose to consider the ability to generate certain strings together with specific predicate argument dependencies as a criterion for adequacy for <b>natural</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R

40|$|Design {{methods in}} {{information}} systems frequently create software descriptions using formal languages. Nonetheless, most software designers prefer to describe software using <b>natural</b> <b>languages.</b> This distinction {{is not simply}} a matter of convenience. <b>Natural</b> <b>languages</b> are not the same as formal languages; in particular, <b>natural</b> <b>languages</b> do not follow the notions of equivalence used by formal languages. In this paper, we show both the existence and coexistence of different notions of equivalence by extending the no-tion of oracles used in formal languages. This allows distinctions to be made between the trustworthy oracles assumed by formal languages and the untrust-worthy oracles used by <b>natural</b> <b>languages.</b> By examin-ing the notion of equivalence, we hope to encourage designers of software to rethink the place of ambiguity in software design.

5|$|The key {{difference}} between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns {{a list of}} documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in <b>natural</b> <b>language,</b> seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.|$|E

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or <b>natural</b> <b>language</b> require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
