40|$|Kaminski, Thomas W. The AIM of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the addition of elastic taping or a <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> alters performance, stability, and comfort in soccer players compared to wearing a soccer cleat without any external support. Twenty male club soccer players were recruited and randomly assigned to the 3 conditions. Functional testing and comfort assessment for each condition took place in one testing session, while stability testing was completed during a separate session. The only significant finding was improved inversion/eversion stability in both the elastic tape and <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> conditions as compared to the cleated condition. The addition of tape or a <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> did not have an adverse effect on performance or comfort during functional and stability testing, and should therefore be considered as a method to decrease ankle injuries in soccer athletes as external supports provide increased stability in inversion/eversion range-of-motion.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{variety of}} knee {{injuries}} and pathologies may cause a deficit in knee proprioception which {{may increase the}} risk of reinjury or the progression of disease. Stochastic resonance stimulation is a new therapy which has potential benefits for improving proprioceptive function. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if stochastic resonance (SR) stimulation applied with a <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> could improve knee proprioception relative to a no-stimulation/no-sleeve condition (control) or a sleeve alone condition in the normal, healthy knee. We hypothesized that SR stimulation when applied with a sleeve would enhance proprioception relative to the control and sleeve alone conditions. Methods Using a cross-over within subject design, twenty-four healthy subjects were tested under four combinations of conditions: electrical stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/no sleeve, and stimulation/no sleeve. Joint position sense (proprioception) was measured as the absolute mean difference between a target knee joint angle and the knee angle reproduced by the subject. Testing was conducted during both partial-weight bearing (PWB) and non-weight bearing (NWB) tasks. Differences in joint position sense between the conditions were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance testing. Results Joint position sense error during the stimulation/sleeve condition (2. 48 ° ± 1. 32 °) was found to be more accurate (P Conclusion These results suggest that SR electrical stimulation when combined with a <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> is an effective modality for enhancement of joint proprioception in the PWB knee. We believe these results suggest the need for further study of the potential of SR stimulation to correct proprioceptive deficits in a clinical population with knee injury/pathology or in subjects at risk of injury because of a proprioceptive deficit. </p...|$|E

50|$|Hunters using {{centerfire}} rifles find suppressors bring various important {{benefits that}} outweigh {{the extra weight}} and resulting change in the firearm's center of gravity. The most important advantage of a suppressor is the hearing protection for the shooter {{as well as their}} companions. Many hunters have suffered permanent hearing damage due to someone else firing a high-caliber gun too closely without warning. By reducing noise, recoil and muzzle-blast, it also enables the firer to follow through calmly on their first shot and fire a further carefully aimed shot without delay if necessary. Wildlife of all kinds are often confused as to the direction of the source of a well-suppressed shot. In the field, however, the comparatively large size of a centerfire rifle suppressor can cause unwanted noise if it bumps or rubs against vegetation or rocks, so many users cover them with <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effects of {{positioning}} and sleeve type bracing on passive position sense of shoulder joints of healthy untrained subjects. Method: A cross over study was carried out on 26 subjects (13 male, 13 female) with a proprioception measurement device. The selected method of testing was passive reproduction of a target angle. Both shoulder joints of all the subjects were evaluated with and without a compressive <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> type of brace at two different start positions (45 ˚ internal rotation, 75 ˚external rotation) with an angular rotational movement at a constant speed of 0. 5 /̊s. The angular displacements from the target angles {{at the end of the}} reproduction tests were recorded as position sense deficit scores. Results: The overall mean (SD) deficit score (0. 99 (0. 06)) was significantly (p, 0. 001) lower with the brace than without, and the overall mean deficit score was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher at the 45 ˚ internal rotation start position than at the 75 ˚ external rotation start position. However, there was no significant (p. 0. 05) interaction between brace application and start position. Conclusion: Terminal limits of range of motion facilitate the position sense of shoulder joints. Compressive brace application improves the passive positioning sense possibly by stimulating cutaneous mechanoreceptors. ...|$|E
40|$|Patients with knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{find that}} use of elastic knee sleeves gives them partial pain relief and {{a greater sense of}} joint stability. However, the scientific effects of knee OA patients wearing braces are unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of knee sleeves on static and dynamic balance in knee OA patients. Fifty patients with knee OA were enrolled in the study and all subjects were randomly divided into two groups. Initially, subjects in group A did not wear a <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> while receiving balance tests but then wore them to be re-tested. Subjects in group B did just the reverse procedure. In this investigation, an instrument (KAT 2000; Breg Inc., Vista, CA, USA), which quantified motor control performance of the lower extremities was used and balance scores from the KAT 2000 software were obtained. The results revealed that the scores of patients wearing braces were significantly lower than those of patients without braces (p < 0. 05). The finding of this study demonstrated that knee OApatients wearing knee sleeves could experience increased balance ability in both static and dynamic conditions. The improvement might prevent knee OA patients from falling down and increase their sense of security during physical activities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{literature}} it is mentioned that ski boots might decrease balance ability and this increases injury risk. The use of knee braces during skiing might help in knee stabilization and, therefore, improve balance ability. Eight female sport {{students participated in}} this study (age 24. 88 ± 2. 1 years; BMI 21. 6 ± 1. 97). Four knee supports were tested: the first (B 1) was a soft knee sleeve with a reinforcement around the patella and two thin flexible metal bars for the lateral stabilization; the second (B 2) was a <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> with thin flexible metal bars for the lateral stabilization; the third (B 3) was an elastic brace with double-joint metallic bars for the lateral stabilization, a reinforcement and a hole around the patella and fixation straps; the fourth (B 4) was a massive knee brace with a more rigid structure ideated to return to sport after injury. The balance ability test was performed using the MFT-S 3 Check System. The test was repeated five times, one without knee brace and one with each type of knee brace, in randomized order. Wearing the B 3 a worsening in balance ability in comparison with the condition without brace was found. Wearing B 2 the stability index (symmetry of the platform movement) in the anterior-posterior direction was significantly better than wearing the more cumbersome braces B 3 and B 4. No significant differences between the conditions were detected for the balance ability in the medio-lateral direction. From this pilot study it is possible to conclude that knee braces might influence balance ability wearing ski boots...|$|E

40|$|Differential near {{infrared}} sensors recently sparked a growing interest as a promising measuring modality for brain computer interfacing. In our study we present {{the design and}} characterization of novel, differential functional NIRS sensors, intended to record hemodynamic changes of the human motor cortex in the hand-area during motor imagery tasks. We report on the spatial characterization of a portable, multi-channel NIRS system with one module consisting of two central light emitting diodes (LED) (770 nm and 850 nm) and four symmetric pairs of radially aligned photodiodes (PD) resembling a plus symbol. The other sensor module features four similar, differential light paths crossing {{in the center of}} a star. Characterization was performed on a concentric, double beaker phantom, featuring a PBS/intralipid/blood mixture (97 / 1 / 2 %). In extension of previous work, the inner, oxygenated beaker was covered by <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeves</b> with holes of various sizes, thus giving an estimate on the spatial limits of the NIRS sensor’s measurement volume. The star shaped sensor module formed a diffuse focus of approximately 3 cm in diameter at 1. 4 cm depth, whereas the plus shaped arrangement suggested a concentric ring of four separate regions of interest, overall larger than 6 cm. The systems measurement sensitivity could be improved by removing ambient light from the sensing photodiodes by optical filtering. Altogether, we conclude that both our novel fNIRS design as well as its electronics perform well in the double-layered oxygenation phantom and are thus suitable for in-vivo testing...|$|R
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} 30 years {{there has been}} {{considerable}} interest in different conservative treatments for patellofemoral pain. Although a consensus has emerged that low cost treatments such as taping and bracing are effective at relieving pain, there has been an ongoing debate about whether these effects are mediated by enhancing proprioceptive mechanisms. In addition few papers have been published comparing the biomechanical effects of such interventions on knee varus/valgus and internal/external control in normal subjects or subjects who suffer from knee pain and instability. Purpose: The purpose of this work was to explore the biomechanical effects of taping and bracing in healthy individuals and people with patellofemoral pain, and to determine if a “ladder of effectiveness” exists with the different interventions. Methods: Twenty-four patients with patellofemoral pain and thirty-nine healthy individuals were asked to perform a slow step down task. This was conducted under a range of randomised conditions including: (a) no intervention, (b) neutral patella taping, (c) tubigrip, (d) patellofemoral web brace with patellar stabilization and (e) a silicone reinforced compression sleeve. In all cases three dimensional movement and moments at the knee were collected using a ten camera infra-red Qualisys motion analysis system and two AMTI force platforms. Reflective markers were placed on the foot, shank and thigh using the Calibrated Anatomical Systems Technique. Results: An independent samples t-test showed that the patients had a significantly greater knee varus/valgus range of motion than the healthy individuals, 9. 5 and 6. 5 degrees respectively (p < 0. 01) with no intervention. A mixed methods ANOVA identified changes in the knee varus/valgus and internal/external range of motion between the interventions, p = 0. 03 and p = 0. 01 respectively. The brace with patellar stabilization reduced knee varus/valgus and internal/external range of motion by 2. 8 degrees (p < 0. 01), followed by the textured <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeve</b> and tubigrip which reduced the knee varus/valgus range of motion by 2. 7 degrees (p < 0. 05), with the neutral taping showing a 1. 3 degree reduction in the patient group only (p < 0. 05). No differences were seen in peak knee flexion. At the end of the test {{the participants were asked to}} place the conditions in a rank order of which they thought helped most with joint stability and pain. The most popular order was the web brace with patellar stabilization or silicone reinforced compression sleeve, neutral tape or tubigrip and then no intervention. Conclusion(s) : These changes in knee mechanics provide important evidence about the possible proprioceptive and mechanoreceptive effects of such treatments, and their role in the management of individuals with patellofemoral pain. This reinforces the view that varus/valgus and internal/external mechanics should not be overlooked when studying knee pain and instability. Implications: This work provides evidence for a graduated ladder of intervention, from neutral taping which produced a small improvement in varus/valgus control, tubigrip and textured neoprene sleeves giving a further improvements varus/valgus control and bracing producing the greatest improvement in varus/valgus and internal/external control. These results fit well with participants’ perceptions of which they thought helped most with joint stability and pain level...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: It {{has been}} shown that muscle fatigue has a {{negative}} influence on proprioception. Several studies already have demonstrated improvement of proprioception by using knee <b>sleeves.</b> Hypothesis: <b>Neoprene</b> knee <b>sleeves</b> have different effects on the joint position sense in locally fatigued subjects with good or poor proprioceptive acuity. Design: A true experimental design with random assignment to intervention and control limbs. Setting: Military hospital, department of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Participants: Sixty-four healthy subjects. Interventions: All subjects underwent four consecutive assessments of the same active joint-repositioning test under different conditions (braced, nonbraced, fatigued, and nonfatigued). Main Outcome Measurements: A three-way analysis of variance with repeated-measures design was conducted to investigate the effects of side (braced versus control side), assessment sequence (one to four), and proprioceptive acuity ("good" versus "poor"), and their interactive effect on the joint position sense. Results: Post hoe analysis revealed that only subjects with "poor" proprioceptive acuity benefit from the braced condition before the isokinetic fatigue protocol (P < 0. 001). In contrast, all subjects benefit from the braced condition after the fatigue test. Conclusions: Bracing is helpful in individuals with a poor baseline proprioceptive acuity in both fatigued and nonfatigued states. Subjects with a good joint position sense benefit from bracing only when in a fatigued state. The present findings suggest a rationale for using <b>neoprene</b> knee <b>sleeves</b> as a preventative measure or treatment in subjects and patients to enhance proprioceptive acuity in a fatigued state. Classification into "poor" and "good" proprioceptive acuity is only relevant in the nonfatigued condition...|$|R
5000|$|Body {{armor and}} pads, often {{referred}} to simply as [...] "armor", protect limbs and trunk {{in the event of}} a crash. While initially made for and marketed at downhillers, freeriders and jump/street riders, body armor has trickled into other areas of mountain biking as trails have become steeper and more technically complex (hence bringing a commensurately higher injury risk). Armor ranges from simple <b>neoprene</b> <b>sleeves</b> for knees and elbows to complex, articulated combinations of hard plastic shells and padding that cover a whole limb or the entire body. Some companies market body armor jackets and even full-body suits designed to provide greater protection through greater coverage of the body and more secure pad retention. Most upper-body protectors also include a spine protector that comprises plastic or metal reinforced plastic plates, over foam padding, which are joined together so that they articulate and move with the back. Some mountain bikers also use BMX-style body armor, such as chest plates, abdomen protectors, and spine plates. New technology has seen an influx of integrated neck protectors that fit securely with full-face helmets, such as the Leatt-Brace. There is a general correlation between increased protection and increased weight/decreased mobility, although different styles balance these factors differently. Different levels of protection are deemed necessary/desirable by different riders in different circumstances. Backpack hydration systems such as Camelbaks, where a water-filled bladder is held close to the spine, are used by some riders for their perceived protective value. More recently, with the increase in enduro racing, backpack hydration systems are also being sold with inbuilt spine protection. However, there is only anecdotal evidence of protection.|$|R

All subjects were tested in four conditions in a random order: 1. nonbraced (control) 2. using a <b>neoprene</b> knee <b>sleeve</b> 3. using a knee sleeve with four bilateral metal supports and 4. using a prophylactic knee brace. The study design was a crossover, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects completed single leg vertical jump, cross-over hop, and the isokinetic knee flexion and extension (at 60, 180, 300 °/sec).

Comparisons of these variables in the four testing conditions revealed no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05). The selected prophylactic brace/sleeves did not significantly inhibit athletic performance which might verify that their structure and design have caused no complication in the normal function of the knee joint.

However, many athletes might refrain from wearing the braces because {{of the fear of}} performance hindrance in the playing field. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of three functional knee brace/sleeves upon the isokinetic and functional performance of ACL-deficient and healthy subjects. Six anterior cruciate ligament deficient (29. 0 ± 5. 3 yrs., 175. 2 ± 5. 4 cm, and 73. 0 ± 10. 0 kg) and six healthy male subjects (27. 2 ± 3. 7 yrs., 176. 4 ± 6. 4 cm, and 70. 3 ± 6. 9 kg) were selected. The effect of a custom-made functional knee brace, and two <b>neoprene</b> knee <b>sleeves,</b> one with four metal supports and one without support were examined via the use of isokinetic and functional tests in four sets (non-braced,wearing functional knee brace,and wearing the sleeves). Cross-over hop and single leg vertical jump test were performed and jump height, and hop distance were recorded. Peak torque to body weight ratio and average power in two isokinetic velocities(60 °. s(- 1), 180 °. s(- 1)) were recorded and the brace/sleeves effect was calculated as the changes in peak torque measured in the brace/sleeves conditions, expressed as a percentage of peak torque measured in non-braced condition. Frequency content of the isokinetic torque-time curves was also analyzed. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the measured values in four test conditions within each control and ACL-deficient group,and Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparison between the two groups. No significant differences in peak torque, average power, torque-time curve frequency content, vertical-jump and hop measurements were found within the experimental and the non-braced conditions (p> 0. 05). Although the examined functional knee brace/sleeves had no significant effect on the knee muscle performance, there have been some enhancement regarding the extension peak torques and power generating capacity of the ACL-deficient subjects that could be helpful in reducing the bilateral asymmetry in these patients...|$|R
