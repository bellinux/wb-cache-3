40|$|This diploma work is {{focus on}} the <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> {{management}} and <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> prosecution in the company operating in fast moving consumer goods business segment. In the work there are mentioned the accounting and tax aspects related to <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> and their correct performance with the allignment of corporate income tax legislation and provision law. The specialised literature and the basic tax and accountacy principles, which are described in the theoretical part of the work, were studied for this work. These principles are applied on the practical cases which are designed to cover all typical problems from <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> area including correct accounting and tax solution. The tax legislative requests for <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> are arranged to clear scheme that can cover decision steps in particular phases of <b>bad</b> <b>debts.</b> Based on the practical cases and studies of the <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> management in the company were recommended steps {{which can lead to}} simplification of <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> evidence, to correct creation of tax provisions and to use the cession of <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> which have not been already used...|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} {{statistical}} technique used is logistic regression to predict a binary outcome: <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> or no <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> Some banks also build regression models that predict {{the amount of}} <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} <b>bad</b> <b>debts,</b> whether {{business}} or non-business-related, are considered tax deductible. Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code provides {{the requirements for}} which a <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> to be deducted.|$|R
50|$|In {{financial}} accounting and finance, <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> is {{the portion of}} receivables that {{can no longer be}} collected, typically from accounts receivable or loans. <b>Bad</b> <b>debt</b> in accounting is considered an expense.|$|R
50|$|The first {{method is}} the {{allowance}} method, which establishes a contra-asset account, allowance for doubtful accounts, or <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> provision, {{that has the}} effect of reducing the balance for accounts receivable. The amount of the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> provision can be computed in two ways, either (1) by reviewing each individual debt and deciding whether it is doubtful (a specific provision); or (2) by providing for a fixed percentage (e.g. 2%) of total debtors (a general provision). The change in the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> provision from year to year is posted to the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense account in the income statement.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> and uncollected accounts in {{the banks and}} other creditors have affected the cash inflow very badly. The transformation of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> into cash flow is vey crucial for daily business operation or for further expansion in the future. In view of the above, effective collection and recovery of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> strategies are {{very important for the}} business to be successful and mitigate losses. Banks and creditors maintain the current recovery model, the in-house collection activities to recover the <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> However, in certain circumstances, the amount recovered is not as expected and as such, alternative options are required. The two most feasible and efficient recovery tools are to outsource the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> to an established debt collection agency or to sell the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> to an interested buyer to maximize the recovery. The procedures, concepts, and workflow including the guidelines of Bank Negara Malaysia involved in all the three options are outlined to have a better understanding and comparison on the different recovery activities. Literature reviews on the causes of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> and other recovery tools are discussed with the relevant examples. These <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> problems are not only affecting Malaysia, but also has been a major problem in the developed and emerging economies. The worldwide financial crisis has affected a lot of banks and other creditors with substantial amount of <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> Further, the increasing demand for unsecured loans including credit cards {{is one of the main}} causes for increasing of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> amount. The research is conducted with the appropriate research methodology and suitable respondents are selected as the samples. The feedbacks from the interview are reported and summarized in a tabular format to develop three different hypotheses. The findings are discussed in detail with the benefits and limitations available for the three alternatives. The selection of the recovery tool is subject to the guidelines and requirement of the individual bank or creditor to maximize recovery and minimize the cost of operation...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{dramatic}} increase and general concern with U. S. hospital <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense (AMNews, January 12, 2004; Philadelphia Business Journal, April 30, 2004; WSJ, July 23, 2004), {{there appears to be}} little available analysis of the precise sources and causes of its growth. This is particularly true in terms of the potential contribution of insured patients to <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense in light of the recent shift in managed care from health maintenance organization (HMO) plans to preferred provider organization (PPO) plans (Kaiser Annual Survey Report, 2003). This study examines and attempts to explain the recent dramatic growth in <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense by focusing on and analyzing data from two Houston-area hospital providers within one healthcare system. In contrast to prior studies in which self-pay was found to be the primary source of hospital <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense (Saywell, R. M., et al., 1989; Zollinger, T. W., 1991; Weissman, Joel S., et al., 1999), this study hypothesizes that the growing hospital <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense is mainly due to the shifting trend away from HMOs to PPOs as a conscious decision by employers to share costs with employees. Compared to HMO plans, the structure of PPOs includes higher co-pays, coinsurance, and deductibles for the patient-pay portion of medical bills, creating the potential for an increase in <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> for hospital providers (from a case study). This <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense has a greater impact in the community hospital than in the Texas Medical Center hospital. ...|$|R

The {{question of how to}} quantify the level of risk of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> losses will be discussed in this paper. Input values of this risk are the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default. It is shown how companies can derive probability functions to describe uncertainty and variability for each input value. Based on these probability functions a simulation model is developed to quantify the risk of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> losses. Based on an empirical study probability functions for probability of default and loss given default are presented. simulation, risk of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> losses, risk assessment...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> is a {{monetary}} amount owed to a creditor that {{is unlikely to}} be paid and, or which the creditor is not willing to take action to collect because of various reasons, often due to the debtor not having the money to pay, for example due to a company going into liquidation or insolvency. There are various technical definitions of what constitutes a <b>bad</b> <b>debt,</b> depending on accounting conventions, regulatory treatment and the institution provisioning. In the USA, bank loans with more than ninety days' arrears become [...] "problem loans". Accounting sources advise that the full amount of a <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> be written off to the profit and loss account or a provision for <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> as soon as it is foreseen.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} factor in applying the criteria is {{the classification of}} the debt (non-business or business). A business <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> {{is defined as a}} debt created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. Whereas, a non-business debt is defined as a debt that is not created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. The classification is quite significant in terms of the deductibility. A non-business <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> must be completely worthless in order to be deducted. However, a business <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> is deductible whether it is partially or completely worthless.|$|R

40|$|This paper (1) {{identifies}} {{factors that}} influence changes in accounts receivable and <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserves and (2) measures the relation between unexpected changes in the ratio of total accounts receivable-to-sales and the ratio of <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserves-to-sales, and (3) estimates the relation between changes in the accounts receivable-to-sales ratio and the <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserve-to-receivables ratio and changes in future earnings. The results show that extreme changes in both ratios are signals of declining future performance when the firm is currently profitable and are signals of better future performance when the firm is currently unprofitable. Relatively large changes in these ratios signify changes in a company’s receivable credit policy, which in turn signal changes in a company’s economic outlook. These findings are important because previous studies examining the impact of current unexpected changes in accounts receivable or <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> reserves on future earnings and stock returns sometimes report contradictory or inconsistent results...|$|R

40|$|The {{granting}} of credit {{is a necessary}} risk of doing business. If companies only accepted cash, sales would be negatively impacted. In a perfect world, all consumers would pay their bills when they become due. However, {{the fact is that}} some consumers do default on debt. Companies are willing to accept default risk because the value of defaults does not exceed the value of the additional sales generated. This creates an issue in regards to the valuation of uncollectible accounts. In order for a company to disclose the true value of its accounts receivable, it must establish an allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> Traditionally, companies estimate their <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> expense and the related allowance for doubtful account by one of two methods: 1) As a percentage of total credit sales or 2) An aging of accounts receivable (that assesses a higher likely rate of default, the older the account becomes past due). By their very nature, these methods take into account only endogenous variables based on past experiences. For many years, the aforementioned methods of estimating <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> were the only viable ways of determining the allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debts.</b> However, with the explosion of technology and the easy availability of information, a more comprehensive method of determining <b>bad</b> <b>debts</b> seems appropriate. Neural network computer systems, which mimic some of the characteristics of the human brain, have been developed and may offer an alternative method for estimating the allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debt.</b> These systems can predict what events may happen, analyze what did happen, and adjust the factor weights accordingly for the next set of event predictions. Thus, it is noteworthy to explore the use of neural networks to predict what a reasonable allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> should be for an entity based on an array of interacting variables. Since, a neural network can incorporate both endogenous and exogenous variables one would expect to use such a system to develop a tool which gives a better estimation of the allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> than the traditional approaches. In the current study, the findings indicate that neural networks over the balance of the time are better predictors of a company’s ending allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> than regression. On a case by case basis, even when neural networks provide a less accurate estimate than regression, statistical analyses demonstrated the neural networks are a less volatile method and their predictions are less likely to result in a significant difference from actual allowance. Neither approach provides results that are exactly the same as the actual ending balance of the allowance for <b>bad</b> <b>debt</b> amount. Even though regression provides a more accurate estimate 45 percent of the time, this result is mitigated by two items: 1) On average, the absolute difference between actual and predicted is much lower when neural networks are used and 2) The standard deviation derived when using neural networks is only a third of the standard deviation derived from regression when applied to the absolute differences between the actual and predicted allowance...|$|R
