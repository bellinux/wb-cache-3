5|$|Although many squadrons {{were raised}} at RAAF Station Laverton during World WarII, the base's prime focus {{continued}} to be its aircraft depot. Following the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939, No.1 AD began expanding to handle the RAAF's growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> and combat aircraft, among them the Wirraway, de Havilland Tiger Moth, Lockheed Hudson, Hawker Hurricane, and Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk. The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible {{for the maintenance of}} in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No.1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as B-17 Flying Fortresses.|$|E
5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began to limit the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a number of American breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, due to {{the provisions of the}} Defence Act (1903) which precluded deploying the Militia outside of Australian territory, the government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service, known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). As such while the Militia would provide a cadre for this force, its main role was to provide training to conscripts as part of the compulsory training scheme which was re-established in early 1940. During this time the Militia were called up in cohorts for periods of continuous training and the 27th Battalion, {{along with the rest of}} the 3rd Brigade, undertook garrison duties in South Australia as well as running <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> camps designed to increase the nation's defences in case of war in the Pacific. With Japan's entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, the battalion was mobilised for wartime service on 9 December 1941 and transported to Darwin in northern Australia where it formed part of the garrison force to defend against possible Japanese attack. During this time it was based at Winnellie and took part in building defences in the north.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this period}} of {{extended}} service, Robinson was brought home, appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the King for his Caspian Sea service, promoted again to Captain and posted to HMS Iron Duke. Robinson then served in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> establishments and dockyards, {{as well as a}} brief stint with the Far East Fleet, during which he received the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class for his services. In 1925, he was inducted into the Freemasons and remained a prominent member of the Navy Lodge {{for the rest of his}} life. The organisation still commemorates him in their publications. He retired at age 51 in 1933 as a rear-admiral, but when the Second World War broke out, Robinson immediately offered his services and for three years, commanded convoys across the Atlantic Ocean. For this service, he was later presented with the Norwegian King Haakon VII's Freedom Cross. Eventually a bout of ill-health caused by a combination of the strain of long service, his age, and the death of his son, Midshipman Edward Cordeaux Robinson, in the sinking of the cruiser HMS Neptune in December 1941, prompted a second retirement in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1940 and 1941 the {{battalion}} undertook a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> camps in Victoria. In December 1941, with Japan's {{entry into the}} war following the attacks on Malaya and Pearl Harbor, {{the battalion}} was mobilised for war service and tasked with defending the Dandenong area. In 1942, however, it received orders to move north to Darwin, where it carried out garrison duties to defend the town and experienced a number air raids from Japanese aircraft. During this time also, the battalion {{was transferred to the}} 23rd Brigade. Originally the 23rd Brigade {{had been part of the}} 8th Division and made up of Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) battalions, however, after these units were captured or destroyed on Rabaul, Ambon and Timor, it had been rebuilt using Militia battalions and placed under the command of Brigadier Arnold Potts, and assigned to the 12th Division.|$|E
5|$|Vanguards {{first task}} after {{completing}} her sea trial {{at the end}} of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and Vanguard briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, Vanguard was involved in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> exercises with NATO forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of the work. Vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Lowerson {{left for}} Australia in April 1919 and was {{discharged}} from the AIF three months later. Like his father, Lowerson became a farmer and worked a block of land, which he named St. Quentin, near Myrtleford and which he converted to tobacco and dairy. He married in 1930 and had a daughter. After {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, he rejoined the Australian Army but his old war wounds confined him to service on the home front as a sergeant with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> battalions. He was serving with 2/8 Training Battalion when he was discharged from service in 1944 but became ill with leukemia the following year. He died on 15 December 1945. Buried in Myrtleford, he was survived by his wife and daughter.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the {{battalion}} conducted a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> camps during 1940 and into 1941 at Mount Martha {{before moving to}} Seymour in early 1942. With the entry of Japan into {{the war and the}} potential threat that this posed to the Australian mainland the Militia were called up for full-time service to undertake defensive duties on the mainland and in the Australian territory of New Guinea. A few months later in March {{the battalion}}, {{along with the rest of}} the 15th Brigade was relocated to New South Wales where they were given the task of defending the Tweed Valley in case of Japanese invasion. Late in the year the 15th Brigade was released from this task and sent north to Caboolture, Queensland, where they began training for deployment to New Guinea.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Training Act 1964 {{set up an}} Industrial Training Board to {{encourage}} training for people in work, and within 7 years there were “27 ITBs covering employers with some 15 million workers.” From 1964 to 1968, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> places had doubled. The Docks and Harbours Act (1966) and the Dock Labour Scheme (1967) reorganised the system of employment in the docks {{in order to put}} an end to casual employment. The changes made to the Dock Labour Scheme in 1967 ensured a complete end to casual labour on the docks, effectively giving workers the security of jobs for life. Trade unions also benefited from the passage of the Trade Dispute Act 1965. This restored the legal immunity of trade union officials, thus ensuring that they could no longer be sued for threatening to strike.|$|E

25|$|The 42nd Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. Raised {{as part of}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War, it was established at Enoggera in December 1915, forming part of the 11th Brigade in the 3rd Division. It subsequently served on the Western Front in France and Belgium in 1916–18 before being disbanded on 22 October 1918. In 1921, the battalion was reformed {{as part of the}} Citizens Forces becoming known as the 42nd Battalion (Capricornia Regiment). Following the outbreak of the Second World War the battalion held a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> exercises and camps until 1941, before being mobilised in March 1942 as part of the 29th Brigade, in the 5th Division. It subsequently served in New Guinea fighting against the Japanese during 1943–44 and on Bougainville in 1945, before being was disbanded on 7 May 1946. In 1948, it was reformed as part of the re-raised Citizens Military Forces. Today, its lineage is perpetuated by the 31st/42nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, a unit which continues to serve in the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Following this, the 46th Battalion {{undertook}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> camps as the Militia were called up for periods of continuous training throughout 1940 and 1941. Following Japan's {{entry into the}} war in December 1941, however, the tempo was increased and in March 1942 the battalion was moved to Queensland {{along with the rest}} of the 4th Brigade to conduct garrison duties. In mid-1942, however, amid concerns about the ability of the Australian economy to continue to meet the demands being placed upon it by the war effort, the decision was made by the government to reduce the size of the Australian military forces and return manpower to industry by disbanding or amalgamating a number of Militia units. The 46th Battalion was one of those units chosen to be amalgamated and, as a result, in August 1942, the 46th Battalion was amalgamated with the 29th Battalion to form the 29th/46th Battalion. The 29th/46th would later go on to serve in New Guinea during the Huon Peninsula campaign in 1943–44 and then the New Britain campaign in 1945, before being disbanded in 1946. After the war, although the 46th Battalion was not re-raised, in 1961 the 46th Battalion was awarded three battle honours, which it bore for the 29th/46th Battalion.|$|E
25|$|Work on Akron {{commenced}} on 7 November 1929 at the Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Ohio. The {{ship was}} christened on 8 August 1931 by Mrs Hoover, undertook her first flight trial on 23 September, and was commissioned on 27 October. Between November 1931 and January 1932, Akron undertook a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> flights, before proceeding {{on her first}} mission with the Scouting Fleet {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas on 9 January 1932. On 22 February, the ship was damaged while being removed from the hangar at Lakehurst, which led to her missing the 1932 fleet problem exercise in the Pacific. On 3 May, Akron utilised the aircraft trapeze for the first time, before flying from Lakehurst to San Diego. From 1–4 June, Akron exercised with the Scouting Fleet off the coast of California, before returning to the east coast. The remainder of the year was spent in maintenance, and flight testing of the ship's new air group to develop the tactics for its use. In early March 1933, Akron was used as part of President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony. On 3 April, the ship left Lakehurst to engage in the calibration of radio direction finders in New England. The ship was caught in a storm off the coast of New Jersey and crashed just after midnight on 4 April, killing 73 people on board, including Rear Admiral William Moffett, the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics.|$|E
