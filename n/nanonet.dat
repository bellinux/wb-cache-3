30|$|In summary, the {{structure}} design of oxygen-passivated silicon <b>nanonets</b> {{could result in}} indirect–direct band gap transitions of silicon. The Si–O–Si passivated 100 X and 100 D <b>nanonets</b> exhibit direct band gap characteristic when the porosities exceed 29 and 37 %, respectively. The –OH-passivated 110 D and 110 X <b>nanonets</b> with different porosities we {{concerned in this study}} have indirect band gap. Si–O–Si bond has more effective influence on the band edge region of the <b>nanonets</b> than –H or –OH bonds and is expected to change the band gap structure of silicon <b>nanonets.</b> With the rapid development of the materials nano fabrication, it is expected that this electronic characteristic of the <b>nanonets</b> could be validated in experiments.|$|R
30|$|The 110 X <b>nanonets</b> {{have the}} same macro {{appearance}} compared with the 100 X <b>nanonets,</b> only with the difference of the crystal orientation of Si substrate. It {{should also be noted}} that a 45 ° rotation exists between the coordinate axes of the 110 X <b>nanonets</b> and the 100 X <b>nanonets,</b> which lead to the difference of the special points shown in the band structure. The motion of CBM appears in the GZ path. When the porosity is lower than 30 %, the CBM stays at 1 / 6 GZ or 1 / 3 GZ (Fig. 2 f). However, when the porosity increases to 39 %, the CBM move from 1 / 6 GZ or 1 / 3 GZ to G (Fig. 2 g). As the VBM always stays at X, the 110 X <b>nanonets</b> exhibit indirect band gap in various porosities we study. The 110 D <b>nanonets</b> can be treated as the 100 X <b>nanonets</b> with the pore side orientation rotates a degree of 45 °. Similar to the 110 X <b>nanonets,</b> the 110 D <b>nanonets</b> with different porosities in our study present indirect band gap with the CBM at point X and the VBM at point M (Fig. 2 h). Both the –OH-passivated 110 X and 110 D <b>nanonets</b> have indirect band gap in different porosities, which is rather different from the results of 100 X and 100 D Si–O–Si passivated <b>nanonets.</b>|$|R
40|$|A longstanding {{challenge}} facing energy conversion/storage materials is their low electrical conductivity, which {{often results in}} unwanted sluggish electrochemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate {{a new class of}} one-pot surface engineering strategy based on metallic single-walled carbon nanotube (mSWCNT) -enriched, ivy-like conductive <b>nanonets</b> (mSC <b>nanonets).</b> The mSC <b>nanonets</b> are formed on the surface of electrode materials through a poly(9, 9 -di-n-octylfluorenyl- 2, 7 -diyl) (PFO) -assisted sonication/filtration process. PFO is known as a dispersant for SWCNTs that shows a higher affinity for semiconducting SWCNTs (sSWCNTs) than for mSWCNTs. Driven by this preferential affinity of PFO, sSWCNTs are separated from mSWCNTs in the form of sSWCNT/PFO hybrids, and the resulting enriched mSWCNTs are uniformly deposited on electrode materials in the form of ivy-like <b>nanonets.</b> Various electrode materials, including lithium-ion battery cathodes/anodes and perovskite catalysts, are chosen to explore the feasibility of the proposed concept. Due to their ivy-like conductive network, the mSC <b>nanonets</b> increase the electronic conductivity of the electrode materials without hindering their ionic transport, eventually enabling significant improvements in their redox reaction rates, charge/discharge cyclability, and bifunctional electrocatalytic activities. These exceptional physicochemical advantages of the mSC <b>nanonets,</b> in conjunction with the simplicity/versatility of the one-pot surface engineering process, offer a new and facile route to develop advanced electrode materials with faster electrochemical reaction kinetics...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHere, {{we report}} the {{morphological}} and electrical properties of self-assembled silicon nanowires networks, also called Si nanonets. At the macroscopic scale, the nanonets involve several millions of nanowires. So, the observed properties should result from large scale statistical averaging, minimizing thus the discrepancies that occur from one nanowire to another. Using a standard filtration procedure, the so-obtained Si nanonets are highly reproducible {{in terms of}} their morphology, with a Si nanowire density precisely controlled during the <b>nanonet</b> elaboration. In contrast to individual Si nanowires, the electrical properties of Si nanonets are highly consistent, as demonstrated here by the similar electrical properties obtained in hundreds of Si nanonet-based devices. The evolution of the Si <b>nanonet</b> conductance with Si nanowire density demonstrates that Si nanonets behave like standard percolating media despite the presence of numerous nanowire-nanowire intersecting junctions into the nanonets and the native oxide shell surrounding the Si nanowires. Moreover, when silicon oxidation is prevented or controlled, the electrical properties of Si nanonets are stable over many months. As a consequence, Si nanowire-based nanonets constitute a promising flexible material with stable and reproducible electrical properties at the macroscopic scale while being composed of nanoscale components, which confirms the Si <b>nanonet</b> potential {{for a wide range of}} applications including flexible electronic, sensing and photovoltaic applications...|$|E

Large doping amounts produce serious structural damage and cause the formation of carbon <b>nanonet</b> structures {{at the top of}} the nanoarrays. The formation of ANPE amorphous CNWs at the top of CNTs enhances the field emission characteristics of the CNTs. The φeff, the minimum Eon and Eth of the ANPE amorphous CNW/CNT hetero nanostructures are 4.23 eV, 0.68 and 1.09 V/μm, respectively, and these values are lower than those of the as-grown CNTs.

30|$|In Fig. 2 a, it {{is shown}} that the {{conduction}} band minimum (CBM) of bulk Si moves to 1 / 3 GZ or X due to the folding effect, which is {{in accordance with the}} theoretical analysis. In the 100 X <b>nanonets,</b> the notable changes of the valence band occur at X. For the bulk Si, a valley exists at point X, which is much lower than G. With the porosity increases, the value of X increases and the valley disappears when the porosity reaches 29 %. The G–X are 0.26, 0.08, 0.06, and 0.04 eV for bulk Si, 100 X 4 B 4 W 4 P 16 O, 100 X 3 B 4 W 2 P 29 O and 100 X 4 B 6 W 2 P 45 O, respectively. However, G is always the valence band maximum (VBM) in all the 100 X <b>nanonets</b> we concerned, which is the same with the location of VBM in bulk Si. In the conduction band, the changes of X are most important. With the porosity increases, the X–G changes from negative to positive and the CBM moves from X to G, leading to an indirect to direct band gap transition. All the 100 X <b>nanonets</b> with porosities higher than 29 % exhibit direct band gap structure in our calculation (Fig. 2 c, d). For the 100 D <b>nanonets,</b> {{it should be noted that}} the coordinate axes have been rotated a degree of 45 ° compared with the 100 X <b>nanonets.</b> Thereby, the paths of ZAMGZRXG shown in the band structure of 100 D <b>nanonets</b> correspond to ZRXGZAMG in the 100 X <b>nanonets.</b> The location of CBM is fixed at M and the change of the M–G in the valence band is the key factor of the band gap transition. Our results show that the values of M–G are negative for 100 D 3 B 4 W 2 P 25 O and 100 D 4 B 4 W 2 P 33 O (Fig. 2 e). However, when the porosity reaches 37 %, the G–M becomes positive and the VBM moves from G to M and result in a direct band gap. Both the Si–O–Si passivated 100 X and 100 D <b>nanonets</b> exhibit the band gap transitions when the porosities are increased. However, the location of the VBM and CBM are different for these two models when direct band gap is obtained. Both the VBM and CBM locate at G for the 100 X <b>nanonets,</b> while M for the 100 D <b>nanonets.</b> This indicates that the distribution of the nanopore arrays is another key factor of the band gap structure of <b>nanonets.</b>|$|R

A geometry optimization of the silicon <b>nanonets</b> was carried out first with the atomic positions and the crystal cell parameters relaxed by total energy minimization. For the {{calculations of}} electronic characteristic, the cut-off energy of 340 eV was assumed in the plane-wave basis set, the SCF convergence tolerance of the electronic energy per atom was 1 × 10 − 6 eV and the k-point separation was 0.4 nm− 1.|$|R

30|$|High-dose {{implantation}} {{will create}} a lot of dislocation and sputtering of carbon atoms and induce the breakdown of the top microstructure in the nanoarrays due to energetic ion irradiation. According to the calculated data from Table 1, the dpa of carbon atoms is larger than 1.00 when the Ag ion-doped doses are higher than 6 × 1016 cm− 2. The large dpa shows that the average displacement of every atom in the doping area of the CNTs from equilibrium lattices occurs more than once and induces serious structural damage {{at the top of the}} CNT arrays. Here, the individual structures of nanowires at the top of the nanoarrays have been destroyed and transformed into a carbon <b>nanonet,</b> as demonstrated by SEM analysis. The formation of the carbon <b>nanonet</b> structures at the top of the CNT array decreases the numbers and enlarges the sizes of emitting points.

A remarkable enhancement in the electrical, thermal and other transport properties of the matrix due to the long aspect ratio dispersions like nanotube/nanowires has been observed my many research groups. This has motivated tremendous research to explore these composites for various macro-electronic and micro-electronic applications in the last decade. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) network based thin-film transistors (TFTs) promise improved performance for flexible plastic electronics with potential applications in displays, e-paper, e-clothing, bio-chemical sensing, conformal radar, and others. A detailed theoretical and numerical framework is required to understand {{the functioning of the}} CNT network transistors and to interpret different experimental observations. In the present work we develop a computational model based on the classical transport equations to analyze the electro-thermal transport in isotropic 2 D nanotube-net (<b>Nanonet)</b> based TFTs. We represent the <b>Nanonet</b> as a simple, two-dimensional, interpenetrating percolating network of metallic and semiconducting nanosticks. The methodology couples the electrical and thermal transport in an efficient and self-consistent manner. We show the effect of electro-thermal coupling on device performance and explore temperature rise as a function of different parameters like channel length (LC), network density, tube-to-substrate thermal conductance (BiS), and tube-to-substrate thermal conductivity ratio. We also analyze the electrical characteristics of CNTs based organic thin-film-transistors. This technique relies on “doping” the organic host with metallic carbon nanotubes to increase the transconductance (equivalently, reduce effective channel length, Leff). Our analysis reproduces experimental characteristics and explains many trends not understood through the experimental observations. We show that Leff scales as a power-law of CNT-doping density and illustrate the importance of an active subpercolating network of semiconducting-CNTs in an organic host. To explore the viability and potential of this technology, we establish the upper limit of transistor-count for an IC based on this technology as a function of density, on-current and circuit-failure probability. This work should be important both as a generalization of classical percolation theory to heterogeneous multi-component percolation as well as theory development and optimization of <b>Nanonet</b> transistors for flexible electronics...|$|E

Here we show that these <b>nanonets</b> are able to rapidly collect proteins in the pericellular space (i. e., near the surface) of cancer cells. Because the secretory substances are at their highest concentration near the cell surface, the use of pericellular <b>nanonets</b> to collect the cancer secretome maximizes the yield and quality of samples, reduces pre-analytical variations, and allows the dynamic profiling of secretome samples.

30|$|After the {{geometry}} optimization of the silicon nanonets, the atomic positions and the cell parameters become reasonable. The bond lengths {{are similar to}} the results reported in the study of siloxenic clusters [21]. As the length of Si–O bond is much smaller than the Si–Si bond, the distance between the silicon atoms which are linked by the same oxygen atom becomes much smaller in the Si–O–Si passivated nanonets. Hence, the presence of the oxygen atoms on the nanowalls of the Si–O–Si passivated nanonets produces a local diminution of the second-neighbor separation for silicon lattice, and consequently a structural contraction. For the –OH-passivated <b>nanonet</b> models, the Si–Si bond length increases in the case that both of the silicon atoms are linked with –OH, and decreases in the case that one silicon atom is linked with hydroxyl while the other with hydrogen. This is due to the different interactions between the passivation atoms.|$|E

30|$|To {{achieve this}} goal, it is {{necessary}} to design a novel fiber-type anode that possesses a hierarchical crystalline TiO 2 structure to reduce the grain boundaries and defects, and maintains a relatively high surface area in the meanwhile. Electrochemical anodization can be used to anodize a Ti wire into a cylindrically core-shell-like TiO 2 nanotube (TNT) array anode. In particular, this anodization process can greatly simplify anode post-processing by employing un-anodized inner Ti cores as the electric conduction leads. Electrochemical anodization has been widely employed to anodize metals into porous oxide membranes, such as anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) [4] and anodic titanium oxide (ATO), which can be further utilized as the templates to prepare various confined or patterned nanostructures [5], including quantum dots [6], nanowires/nanotubes [5, 7 – 9], and even <b>nanonets</b> [8, 10 – 12]. This process possesses an advantage that the key structural parameters of the porous membranes (pore diameter, inter-pore distance, and membrane thickness) can be tuned by carefully controlling the anodization conditions. Porous ATO has drawn particular attention due to the significant role of TiO 2 in DSSCs [13, 14], photocatalysis [15], water photoelectrolysis [13], and organic pollutants degradation [16]. So far, most TNT arrays have been prepared on flat Ti foils [17] as well as other flat substrates such as glass, alumina, and silicon [18]. Wang and co-workers [19] recently reported the fabrication of a DNA-like photo-electrode via electrochemical anodization as well as the application of this photo-electrode in liquid DSSCs. Another group of scientists [20] fabricated the liquid DSSCs by employing the TNT arrays. The device structure by inserting the photo-anode in a capillary glass tube along with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, however, limited the device's flexibility and thus restricted post-processing of solid solar cells.|$|R
40|$|As the key {{components}} of innate immunity, human host defense antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) {{play a critical role}} in warding off invading microbial pathogens. In addition, AMPs can possess other biological functions such as apoptosis, wound healing, and immune modulation. This article provides an overview on the identification, activity, 3 D structure, and mechanism of action of human AMPs selected from the antimicrobial peptide database. Over 100 such peptides have been identified from a variety of tissues and epithelial surfaces, including skin, eyes, ears, mouths, gut, immune, nervous and urinary systems. These peptides vary from 10 to 150 amino acids with a net charge between − 3 and + 20 and a hydrophobic content below 60 %. The sequence diversity enables human AMPs to adopt various 3 D structures and to attack pathogens by different mechanisms. While α-defensin HD- 6 can self-assemble on the bacterial surface into <b>nanonets</b> to entangle bacteria, both HNP- 1 and β-defensin hBD- 3 are able to block cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II. Lysozyme is well-characterized to cleave bacterial cell wall polysaccharides but can also kill bacteria by a non-catalytic mechanism. The two hydrophobic domains in the long amphipathic α-helix of human cathelicidin LL- 37 lays the basis for binding and disrupting the curved anionic bacterial membrane surfaces by forming pores or via the carpet model. Furthermore, dermcidin may serve as ion channel by forming a long helix-bundle structure. In addition, the C-type lectin RegIIIα can initially recognize bacterial peptidoglycans followed by pore formation in the membrane. Finally, histatin 5 and GAPDH(2 - 32) can enter microbial cells to exert their effects. It appears that granulysin enters cells and kills intracellular pathogens with the aid of pore-forming perforin. This arsenal of human defense proteins not only keeps us healthy but also inspires the development of a new generation of personalized medicine to combat drug-resistant superbugs, fungi, viruses, parasites, or cancer.

The workshop focused on the safety assessment and management of nanomaterials (NMs) while reflecting on experiences in regulating endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).   This report describes the presentations, break-out group discussions and conclusions of the meeting. The regulatory frameworks and links between NMs and EDCs as well as the applicability of test guidelines and risk assessment tools for nanomaterials were addressed in presentations and break-out group work.   Regulatory possibilities were further considered in a panel-led discussion. The Nordic dimension was of special interest: strengthening of Nordic regulatory cooperation in the field of nanosafety gained support, while commencing a TG/GD project in the OECD test guideline programme was seen a concrete idea for future cooperation...|$|E
40|$|The MinION device by Oxford Nanopore {{produces}} {{very long}} reads (reads over 100 kBp were reported); however it suffers from high sequencing error rate. We present an open-source DNA base caller based on deep recurrent neural networks {{and show that}} the accuracy of base calling is much dependent on the underlying software and can be improved by considering modern machine learning methods. By employing carefully crafted recurrent neural networks, our tool significantly improves base calling accuracy on data from R 7. 3 version of the platform compared to the default base caller supplied by the manufacturer. On R 9 version, we achieve results comparable to <b>Nanonet</b> base caller provided by Oxford Nanopore. Availability of an open source tool with high base calling accuracy will be useful for development of new applications of the MinION device, including infectious disease detection and custom target enrichment during sequencing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—NanoNets are {{networks}} of nanomachines at extremely small dimensions, {{on the order}} of nanometers or micrometers. Re-cent advances in physics and engineering have made basic comput-ing and communication feasible on nanomachines, and NanoNets are envisioned as an important emerging technology with broad fu-ture applications. Traditional networking solutions require signif-icant modifications for application in NanoNets. In this paper, we focus on routing algorithm design in NanoNets. Based on the salient features of a <b>NanoNet,</b> including low node cost and very low avail-able power, we propose a new routing paradigm for multi-hop data transmission in NanoNets. Our design, termed Buddy Routing (BR), is enabled by latest advancements in physical layer network cod-ing, and argues for pair-to-pair data forwarding in place of tradi-tional node-to-node data forwarding. Through both analysis and simulations, we compare BR with point-to-point routing, in terms of raw throughput, error rate, energy efficiency, and protocol over-head, and show the advantages of BR in NanoNets.

40|$|In 2012 the HZDR, and in {{consequence}} also the Institute of Ion Beam Physics and Materials Research (IIM) including its Ion Beam Center (IBC), {{has undergone a}} scientific evaluation. The evaluation committee composed of the Scientific Advisory Board and numerous external experts in our field of research concluded that “the overall quality of the scientific work is excellent”, that “there are an impressive number of young scientists working enthusiastically {{on a variety of}} high-level projects” and that “the choice of these projects represents a clear underlying strategy and vision”. We feel honored and are proud that the external view on our scientific achievements is that extraordinary. In view of this outstanding result we would like to express our gratitude to all our staff members for their commitment and efforts! In the past year, we continued our integration into the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers (HGF) with our Institute mostly active in the research area “Matter”, but also involved in a number of activities in the research area “Energy”. In this respect, many consultations were held with the Helmholtz centers contributing to common research areas to precisely define the role we will play in the newly established HGF program “From Matter to Materials and Life” (see schematic below). Our IBC has been recognized as a large-scale user facility for ion beam analysis and modification of materials, i. e., specializing on materials science. In particular, the IBC plays a prominent role in the recently approved Helmholtz Energy Materials Characterization Platform (HEMCP), which mainly concentrates on the development of dedicated analytical tools for the characterization of materials required for future energy technologies. The successes achieved by the IBC allows us to invest 7200 k€ to further improve and strengthen the ion beam capabilities at the Institute. In addition to this infrastructure-related grant, we were also successful in our funding application for the establishment of the International Helmholtz Research School for Nanoelectronic Networks (IHRS <b>NANONET),</b> aiming at promoting the next generation of leading scientists in the field of nanoelectronics. The IHRS <b>NANONET</b> is coordinated by our Institute and offers a well-structured PhD program to outstanding students of all nationalities with emphasis on interdisciplinary research and comprehensive training in technical and professional skills...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} simple but {{efficient}} method to fabricate versatile graphene <b>nanonet</b> (GNN) -devices. In this method, networks of V 2 O 5 nanowires (NWs) were prepared in specific regions of single-layer graphene, and the graphene layer was selectively etched via a reactive ion etching method using the V 2 O 5 NWs as a shadow mask. The process allowed us to prepare large scale patterns of GNN structures which were comprised of continuous networks of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with chemical functional groups on their edges. The GNN can be easily functionalized with biomolecules for fluorescent biochip applications. Furthermore, electrical channels based on GNN exhibited a rather high mobility and low noise compared with other network structures based on nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, which was attributed to the continuous connection of nanoribbons in GNN structures. As a proof of concept, we built DNA sensors based on GNN channels and demonstrated the selective detection of DNA. Since our method allows us to prepare high-performance networks of GNRs over a large surface area, it should open up various practical biosensing applications. close 0...|$|E
