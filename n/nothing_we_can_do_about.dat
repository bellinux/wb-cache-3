2500|$|On {{the safety}} {{copy of the}} Basement Tapes, this song was labeled [...] "Answer to Ode". Heylin interprets it as a parody of [...] "Ode to Billie Joe", which was a hit single for Bobbie Gentry in mid-1967 when the {{basement}} songs were being taped. He calls it [...] "as deadpan a deconstruction" [...] of the Gentry hit as the Blonde on Blonde track [...] "4th Time Around" [...] was of The Beatles' [...] "Norwegian Wood". (He adds that, in his view, Dylan generally parodied songs that he liked.) For Heylin, it illustrates Dylan's feeling that folk songs delivered [...] "the underground story". An event with potentially world-shaking implications—"The vice president's gone mad!"—is treated in a detached, stoic manner by the community: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it". The narrative piles up both banal and surreal details, but [...] "Dylan delivers the 'saga' in the most laconic manner imaginable".|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the book}} [...] "Comm Check..." [...] by William Harwood and Michael Cabbage, Linda Ham squelched {{requests}} for external photos to be taken after the requests had been sent by two individual departments at NASA. Engineers in these departments were concerned that the foam strike on the left wing, clearly captured by launch-day video recorded for every launch, had caused more damage than initially thought. Based on computer modeling later proven inadequate, Ham's mistaken belief was that the damage was not serious, and that at most it would merely lengthen the time necessary to refurbish Columbia between missions. Referring to the supposed minor damage in a review meeting, she {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "...there's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it anyway". Ham decided to quash the request for high-resolution imaging of the shuttle, based on her belief that the damage was too minor to be of consequence.|$|E

5000|$|Radiohead: The Best Of is {{the first}} {{compilation}} album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 June 2008 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Capitol Records in the United States. The album contains various songs from their first six studio albums, recorded under Radiohead's record contract with EMI subsidiary labels Parlophone and Capitol. The compilation only contains songs for which EMI held the publishing rights, and so contains no songs recorded after Radiohead's final studio album with EMI, Hail to the Thief (2003). Radiohead: The Best Of was prepared when the band decided not to renew their contract with EMI. In 2008, lead singer Thom Yorke said, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it. The work is really public property now anyway...

5000|$|Another {{member of}} the Front, Siri Shpallo, replied to these criticisms, saying that, [...] "The fact that no other group {{has been able to}} {{organize}} itself after ten months of liberation means that the creation of such groups has not been {{in the interests of the}} people. The people are with the Front. If there are some who want to organize themselves outside the Front, let them try, but they will run up against the strength of the Front and will lose. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> this." [...] Kokoshi and a number of other non-communist Front members would later be accused of attempting to set up illegal opposition to the Front and government with the assistance of the British Military Mission in Albania, which had called on the Democratic Government to grant foreign observers first-hand access to the electoral process along with the holding of what it termed [...] "free elections" [...] as a precondition for the United Kingdom to provide diplomatic recognition to Albania.|$|E
60|$|What then {{is to be}} done? The {{tentative}} {{suggestions of}} this chapter may appear to the reader inadequate.

However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> will help you like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|R
