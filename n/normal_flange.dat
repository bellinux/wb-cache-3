50|$|The allowed {{unbalanced}} superelevation {{will cause}} trains {{to run with}} <b>normal</b> <b>flange</b> contact. The points of wheel-rail contact {{are influenced by the}} tire profile of the wheels. Allowance has to be made for the different speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment if speeds and superelevation are not within the permitted limits. Many high-speed lines do not permit the use of slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the wear or friction of flange contact on curves is reduced by the use of flange lubrication.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} shows a {{development}} {{and analysis of}} 2 -D axisymmetric CFD model of flanged diffuser that {{was used as a}} casing for developed small wind turbines to increase the generated power. The 2 -D CFD diffuser model grids are developed by GAMBIT, while the flow field analysis has been carried out using commercial software FLUENT. This study focuses on the effect of flange’s angles as a varied parameter on velocity at diffuser entrance. All models have the same dimensions in diffuser length, entrance diameter, exit diameter and flange height but differ in flange angle. Flange angles of these tested models vary from − 25 ° to + 25 °, where flange angles were measured to vertical axis. Present model verification indicates a good agreement between present numerical work and previous published experimental work. The numerical simulation shows the created vortices behind flange that cause pressure drop which increases mass flow rate through the diffuser. The results indicate also that the right flange angle at 15 ° is the optimum angle that accelerates flow at diffuser entrance. The increase of velocity at this optimum flange angles is higher than the case of normal angle, where the expected increase in the generated power by wind turbine can reach 5 % more compared with <b>normal</b> <b>flange...</b>|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{leakages}} are {{a considerable}} problem when measuring waveguide structures at high frequencies. In {{order to maintain}} good electrical contact, flanges need to be tightly and evenly screwed to the device under test. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially with repeated measurements. We present a metamaterial-based adapter, which prohibits leakage even {{in the presence of}} gaps at the interconnects. This so-called gap adapter has been fabricated from a metallized polymer (SU 8). The reflection coefficient is below - 20 dB throughout the band for a 50 -mu m gap {{on both sides of the}} gap adapter. In comparison, a conventional waveguide with a 50 -mu m gap on both sides has a reflection coefficient of - 10 dB. The gap adapter can be used to perform fast measurements, since the <b>normal</b> <b>flange</b> screws are redundant. We compare the SU 8 gap adapter with a Si version and to a smooth metal waveguide reference disc. The SU 8 gap adapter performed better than the Si version and much better than the waveguide disc in all test cases. SU 8 gap adapters were used to measure on a waveguide component. The SU 8 gap adapters with 50 -mu m gaps performed comparable with the waveguide component with the flange screws carefully tightened. The polymer also makes the gap adapter mechanically robust and easy to mass fabricate. [2015 - 0113...|$|E
5000|$|On some systems (such as Paris, Montreal, and Mexico City) {{there is}} a [...] railway track between the roll ways and the {{vehicles}} also have railway wheels with larger (taller) than <b>normal</b> <b>flanges,</b> but these are normally at some distance above the rails and are used only {{in the case of}} a flat tyre and at switches/points and crossings. In Paris these rails were also used to enable mixed traffic with rubber-tyred and steel-wheeled trains using the same track, particularly during conversion from normal railway track. Other systems (e.g. Lille and Toulouse) have other sorts of flat tyre compensation and switching methods.|$|R

The tensile and compression performance and shear performance {{should not be}} changed when using variation principle to analyze shear lag of box beams. So based on transformed-section method, the section composed with steel and concrete can be transformed to one section made of supposing material. The shear lag of supposing section is analyzed to calculate the distribution of normal stress, then according to the constitutive relation of steel and concrete, the stress of actual section can be obtained. At last, the formula of <b>normal</b> stress in <b>flange</b> slab for reinforced concrete box girder is given...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{of the scientific community}} in obtaining the local buckling stresses for pultruded FRP (PFRP) shapes is shown by the huge number of published studies on this subject. The main objective of the present paper is to provide accurate estimates of the local buckling moment for PFRP beams. These estimates are fundamental for defining the nondimensional slenderness parameter introduced by the Italian Design Guide CNR DT 205 / 2007 [1] for beams in pure bending. One of the most technically sound formulations is that proposed by Kollár [2], who derived explicit expressions for the critical <b>normal</b> stresses of <b>flange</b> and web panels of PFRP beams that depend on the rotational stiffness of the web-flange junction in compression. This formulation is based on a consolidated approach for estimating the flange buckling strength of typical steel profiles [3]. In the present paper, a literature review is initially reported. In particular, it is shown that the approximate expression for the critical stress provided in [3] for steel members tends to underestimate the local buckling strength, {{especially in the case of}} wide-flange cross-section profiles. This underestimation becomes particularly evident for PFRP beams. For example, in [4], on the basis of the results of 10 bending tests, an average ratio of 1. 2 between experimental and predicted local buckling moments was obtained. Anyway, it has clearly been shown that the web-flange junctions play a crucial role in determining the buckling and ultimate strengths of PFRP beams [5]. Therefore, the experimental and numerical characterization of the junction behaviour is necessary [6]-[7]. The rotational spring stiffness used in Kollár’s model to reproduce the behaviour of the web-flange junction seems sensitive to the shear modulus of the flanges [4] and to the ratio Io,f/Io,w [8], with Io,f and Io,w being the ratios between transverse and longitudinal Young’s moduli for the web and flanges, respectively. Hence, in the present paper estimates of this stiffness based on a series of finite element buckling analysis results are finally reported. The influence of possible differences in the mechanical properties between flange and web panels is suitably taken into account...|$|R
