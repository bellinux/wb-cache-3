The line is approximately 150 km long. Alongside the line, more than 100 km <b>noise</b> <b>shields</b> have been constructed. The question is how, and to what extent, this <b>noise</b> <b>shield</b> will affect the pool shape and size of an instantaneous release of a flammable liquid, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In case of an instantaneous release of liquid from a rail tanker (50 m 3), both risk analysts and emergency responders use a circular pool shape of about 600 m 2 would result. To assess the influence of a <b>noise</b> <b>shield,</b> a full scale test was conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline. A rail tanker was filled with 50 m 3 red-colored environmentally safe liquid. The liquid was instantaneously released. A very peculiar pool shape actually results due to the presence of a <b>noise</b> <b>shield.</b> A zone between the rails and the <b>noise</b> <b>shield</b> (2 m wide and 90 m long) is within 2 - 3 min filled with 15 cm of liquid. The total pool size area was about 750 m 2. Both shape and size deviate substantially from the traditional figures.

The question is to what extent this <b>noise</b> <b>shield</b> hinders the cooling of a rail tanker, carrying flammable liquid such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) ? To answer this question, a full scale testwas conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline [N. Rosmuller, D. W. G. Arentsen, (2005). Praktijkproeven Betuweroute: Instantane uitstroming en koeling 24 juni 2005, Nibra, Arnhem, The Netherlands]. Two railcars and a rail tanker were placed behind a 3 m high <b>noise</b> <b>shield.</b> First, it was tested as to whether firemen or water canons should be used to deliver the water. Water canons were best next, four positions of the water canons to wet the rail tanker were tested. Three camera’s and three observers recorded the locations and the extent of water that hit the rail tanker. The results indicate that the <b>noise</b> <b>shield,</b> to a large extent, prevents thewater fromhitting, and therefore cooling, the rail tanker. The upper parts of the rail tanker were minimally struck by the water canons and the small amount of water flowing down the rail tanker did not reach the lower parts of it because of the armatures at the rail tanker. Also, the amount of water in the ditches to be used for wetting was too small. The ditch nearby ran empty. These insights are both relevant to emergency responders for disaster abatement purposes and towater management organizations. The Ministry of Transport is examining the possible strategies to deal with these findings. The results are based upon one single full scale test near a 3 m high <b>noise</b> <b>shield.</b> In addition, it would be valuable to determine what the influence would be of other heights of the <b>noise</b> <b>shield...</b>|$|R

Most research on <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> is focused on BlendedWing Body (BWB) configurations because of the large dimension of the fuselage. However, <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> is also considered relevant in conventional tube and wing configurations when the engines are mounted above the wings.

In this work two methods are used to calculate <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> and compared in terms of accuracy and computational time, the Diffraction Integral Method (DIM) and a method built on the Modified Theory of the Physical Optics (MTPO). Both methods are based on the Kirchhoff integral and are considered accurate for sharp-edged objects.

Since airports tend to be located close to or inside cities, an increasing amount of people suffer from aircraft noise pollution. More silent aircraft are needed to be able to reduce this noise pollution. One {{way to do this is}} through blocking the engine noise propagation with elements of the aircraft itself such as the wings. This method is called aircraft engine <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> To be able to shield the aircraft engine noise efficiently, a <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> assessment tool is required. In this thesis project, such a tool is developed for conventional tube with wing aircraft. This tool needs to have low computational cost while the accuracy should be sufficient for the preliminary design. To create a fast and accurate noise prediction tool, the aircraft's fuselage is modelled as a cylinder and the wings as planar surfaces. The engine is represented by a monopole sound source. The most suitable <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> calculation methods are found to be the barrier shielding method for the wings and the analytic solution of a cylinder for the fuselage. The <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> assessment tool is validated against results obtained with the Kirchhoff theory of diffraction. The <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> prediction tool developed in this thesis project has shown to be able to determine the noise attenuation by a point source of different aircraft configurations with low computational cost.

The effect of P/G noise on crosstalk is analyzed for different line lengths, line widths, and interconnect driver resistances. Considering the P/G <b>noise,</b> a <b>shield</b> line can degrade rather than enhance signal integrity due to increased P/G noise coupling on the victim line. A 2 RLC interconnect model is used to investigate the effects of both coupling capacitance and mutual inductance on the crosstalk noise. Physical spacing and shield insertion are compared in terms of the coupling noise on the victim line for several technology nodes. Boundary conditions are also provided to determine the effective range of spacing and shield insertion {{in the presence of}} P/G noise.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} industry is facing growing complaints on aircraft {{noise from the}} residents around airports. Therefore novel aircraft architectures ("Low Noise Aircraft" - LNA) with unconventional engine positioning are considered to benefit from engine noise reduction through shielding effects.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, noise {{reduction}} is improved by housing electrodes in box-shaped metal casings. The {{distance from the}} tip of each electrode to its dedicated amplifier is kept short at ~  10  cm, amplifiers are mounted inside the metal electrode casings, and those metal casings cover the entire region near the heart to act as <b>noise</b> <b>shielding.</b> Further, since electrodes are pushed into the interior of the housings with body contact, metal casings are drawn closer to the body-surface to increase <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> during measurement. Effective shielding has been demonstrated up to 71.92 μT, which is {{in the vicinity of the}} 60  Hz, 83.3 μT guideline value of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Further, when measurements were made intentionally exposing the measurement platform to high amplitude electromagnetic radiation (noise), some noise effects were observable but large differences in measurement values between the high-noise and normal environment were not observed. Accordingly, <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> is sufficient to measure body-surface potential under normal (low radiation) conditions. In addition, electrode casings are joined in a ball-joint fashion allowing independent movement and rotation. Each electrode casing can incline independently to conform to the contour of the body making it easy to establish reliable contact with accurate electrode positioning.|$|E

The noise generated by the engines has decreased over the generations to the extent that a whole-airframe approach is required now to achieve further significant reductions. One option is to install the engines over the wings so the airframe reflects the fan noise away from on-the-ground observers. However, in addition to good <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> performance, the position of the engine also has to satisfy aerodynamic effciency criteria. We investigate the sensitivity of aerodynamic and acoustic performance metrics with respect to the positioning of the engine relative to the wing. More specifically, we trade drag computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes simulations versus <b>noise</b> <b>shielding</b> performance, obtained experimentally through scale model tests conducted in an anechoic chamber.
