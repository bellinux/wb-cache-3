An obvious solution to the aforesaid problem lies in electrochemical energy storage systems like fuel cells and batteries. The desirable properties attributed to these devices like quick response, long life cycle, high round trip efficiency, clean source, low maintenance etc. have made them very attractive as energy storage devices. Compared to many advanced battery chemistries like nickel-metal hydride and lithium - ion batteries, metal-air batteries show several advantages like high energy density, ease of operation etc. The notable characteristics of metal - air batteries are the open structure with oxygen gas accessed from ambient air in the cathode compartment. These batteries rely on oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions during discharging and charging processes. The efficiency of these systems {{is determined by the}} kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction. Platinum is the most preferred catalyst for many electrochemical reactions. However, high cost and stability issues restrict the use of Pt and hence there is quest for the development of stable, durable and active electrocatalysts for various redox reactions. The present thesis is directed towards exploring the electrocatalytic aspects of titanium carbonitride. TiCN, a fascinating material, possesses many favorable properties such as extreme hardness, high melting point, good thermal and electrical conductivity. Its metal-like conductivity and extreme corrosion resistance prompted us to use this material for various electrochemical studies. The work function as well as the bonding in the material can be tuned by varying the composition of carbon and nitrogen in the crystal lattice. The current study explores the versatility of TiCN as electrocatalyst in aqueous and non-aqueous media. One dimensional TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 nanowires are prepared by simple one step solvothermal method without use of any template and are characterized using various physicochemical techniques. The 1 D nanostructures are of several µm size length and 40 ± 15 nm diameter (figure 1). Orientation followed by attachment of the primary particles results in the growth along a particular plane (figure 2). (a) 	(b) (c) Figure 1.

The next aspect of the thesis discusses the electrochemical performance of TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 especially for oxygen reduction. Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) reveals that the nanowires possess high activity for ORR and involves four electron process leading to water as the product. The catalyst effectively converts oxygen to water with an efficiency of 85 %. A comparison of the activity of different (C/N) compositions of TiCN is shown in figure 3. The composition TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 shows the maximum activity for the reaction. The catalyst is also very selective for ORR in presence of methanol and thus cross-over issue in fuel cells can be effectively addressed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also lead to the same composition as the best for electrocatalysis, supporting the experimental observations. Figure 3. Linear sweep voltammetric curves observed for different compositions of titanium carbonitride towards ORR. The next chapter deals with the use of TiC 0. 7 N 0. 3 as air cathode for aqueous metal -	air batteries. The batteries show remarkable performance in the gel- and in liquid- based electrolytes for zinc - air and magnesium - air batteries. A partial potassium salt of polyacrylic acid (PAAK) is used as the polymer to form a gel electrolyte.

40|$|Supported nickel onγ-Al 2 O 3 {{catalysts}} possesses surface nickel (NiOx) {{and nickel}} oxide crystallites (NiO), and surface nickel aluminate compound (NiAlxOy). Surface nickel {{interacts with the}} titania support to form surface <b>nickel</b> <b>titanate</b> compound (NiTiOx) which has a lower reducibility. However, the surface Lewis acid sites of these catalysts increase with increasing nickel concentration. The weak interaction between the surface nickel and the silica support results {{in the formation of}} nickel oxide crystallites (NiO). From the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments, the reducibility of the supported nickel catalysts has the following sequence: Ni/Al 2 O 3 > Ni/SiO 2 > Ni/TiO 2. Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ni/TiO 2 catalysts contain new surface Lewis acid sites and the amount of surface Lewis acid sites increases with increasing nickel concentration. Thus, the surface nickel species (NiOx) present on Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst and surface <b>nickel</b> <b>titanate</b> compound (NiTiOx) present on Ni/TiO 2 catalyst create coordinately unsaturated sites for adsorbing pyridine. The Ni/SiO 2 catalysts have no sign of the presence of the surface Lewis acid sites. Furthermore, only the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts have shown the ammonia adsorption at temperature of 200 oC. For the results of reductive amination of PEG- 400, the best catalyst was Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst (total amine yield was 54. 5 %), and the result was identical with the TPR experiment that the catalyst processes higher reducibility will also have the higher activity for reductive amination of PEG- 400. As for the studies of optimum reaction condition, the best temperature for reductive amination of PEG- 400 was 250 ℃. The effect of temperature on PEG- 400 amination was greater than the total pressure at room temperature. Increasing the hydrogen partial pressure results in a slightly increasing in total amine yield as 58. 3 %, and the total amine yield will also increase with the increasing feed of ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 (OH)). When using ammonia as reaction gas, the PEG- 400 was dehydrogenation first and the intermediate (polyetheraldehyde) was formed. Then ammonia was react with the polyetheraldehyde to form polyetherimine. Finally, the polyetheramine or polyetherdiamine was formed by the hydrogenation of polyetherimine. When use ammouium hydroxide to replace the ammonia, the formed polyetheramine will prefer to react with ketone to form secondary imine due to the base of polyetheramine was higher than the ammonium hydroxide and the excess water will make the reverse reaction occur. After hydrogenation of secondary imine, the secondary amine will be formed.

Water {{splitting}} using photocatalyst has become a topic of recent investigation since {{it has the potential}} of producing hydrogen for clean energy from sunlight. An extensive number of solid photocatalysts have been studied for overall water splitting in recent years. In this study, two methods were employed to synthesize two different photocatalysts for water splitting. The first method describes the synthesis of <b>nickel</b> oxide-loaded strontium <b>titanate</b> (NiO-SrTiO 3) particles on electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers incorporated with graphene nanoplatelets for water splitting. The electrospun PAN fibers were first oxidized at 270 degrees C for two hours and subsequently immersed in a solution containing ethanol, titanium (IV) -isopropoxide [C 12 H 28 O 4 Ti] and strontium nitrate [Sr(NO 3) (2) ]. This solution was then treated with NiO nanoparticles dispersed in toluene. The surface treated PAN fibers were annealed at 600 degrees C in air for 1 hour to transform fibers into a crystalline form for improved photocatalyst performance. In the second method, coaxial electrospinning process was used to produce core/shell strontium titanate/nickel oxide (SrTiO 3 -NiO) nanofibers. In coaxial method, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) was dissolved in deionized (DI) water, and then titanium (IV) isopropoxide [C 12 H 28 O 4 Ti] and strontium nitrate [Sr(NO 3) (2) ] were added into the solution to form the inner (core) layer. For outer (shell) solution, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) at a weight ratio of 10 : 90 and then nickel oxide was mixed with the solution. Ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry and static contact angle measurement techniques were employed to characterize the structural properties of photocatalysts produced by both methods and a comparison was made between the two photocatalysts.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{at a better}} {{understanding}} of the high piezoelectric properties encountered in lead-based ferroelectrics by focusing on the extrinsic contributions to the response. The main characteristics of these materials are the highly nonlinear character of the electro-mechanical response and the presence of a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) where properties are reaching a maximum. Thus, our approach was first to develop a new description for the piezoelectric hysteresis and nonlinearities and second to investigate MPB effects on the extrinsic contributions to the piezoelectric response. For these purposes, lead titanate (PT), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and lead <b>nickel</b> niobate-lead zirconate <b>titanate</b> solid solution (PNN-PZT) were chosen as prototype compositions. The sample preparation was classical for the first two compounds whereas two new synthesis routes of PNN-PZT were developed. The first consists in the preparation of a B-site precursor combining all the perovskite B-site cations before calcination with lead oxide, enhancing chemical homogeneity and insuring good reproducibility in the final properties. The second processing method aimed at more time efficiency: the use of a nickel hydroxy-carbonate instead of nickel oxide permitted to obtain in one single calcination step a pure perovskite phase exhibiting properties as high as those obtained for two firing steps procedures. The piezoelectric hysteresis and nonlinearity description was undertaken using the Preisach formalism, first developed in ferromagnetism. This approach considers that each hysteretic system satisfying the wiping-out and the congruency properties can be seen as composed of bistable units characterized by distributed coercive and bias fields. In our case, the use of a general expression for the unit parameters distribution function permitted to describe the most significant piezoelectric coefficient nonlinearities such as applied field dependence, saturation or threshold fields. Moreover, a minimal expression describing the piezoelectric nonlinearity in lead-based compounds was derived from experimental determination of the distribution function topography. Advanced piezoelectric hysteresis modelling was attained by coupling the classical viscous descriptions with Preisach-inspired loops expressions. This allowed to separate piezoelectric losses into viscous and field dependent parts. Moreover, the possibility of extracting distribution function parameters from the loops was established. The versatility of the Preisach hysteresis description was also demonstrated by deriving pinched ferroelectric loops from the supposed microscopical mechanisms in hard-doped ferroelectrics. Morphotropic phase boundary study started with the derivation of a composition-temperature phase diagram for PNN-PZT using dielectric and pyroelectric measurements along with X-ray diffraction. The MPB of this solid solution was shown to be strongly curved toward the rhombohedral side. Therefore, certain compositions undergo a tetragonal to rhombohedral transition upon cooling. The influence of electric field and thermal history on this morphotropic transition was first investigated in view of optimizing the poling conditions of such materials. Then, the piezoelectric extrinsic contributions at MPB for both PZT and PNN-PZT were studied as a function of composition and temperature. The peak of properties occurring in this region was assigned to intrinsic effects coupled with an extension of the irreversible contributions. Using the developed hysteresis and nonlinearity formalism, this extrinsic contributions increase could be related to an extended response of each defect rather than to an increase in the defects density...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) are {{electrochemical}} {{devices that}} combine {{the characteristics of}} batteries and supercapacitors in one asymmetric cell. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) represent two ends of the power and energy density spectrum. On {{one end of the}} Ragone plot spectrum, LIBs utilize faradaic reactions to provide high energy densities (150 – 250) Whkg- 1, however, this relatively slow reaction process limits the power density of LIBs (100 000 cycles), however SCs suffer from limited energy densities (< 10 Whkg- 1). Combining half-battery and half supercapacitor in one device to bridge the energy/power density gap, while improving cycle life is a promising solution to meet the evolving energy requirements. However, the rapid fading of the power density, reduced capacitance retention and reduced cyclability at high power rates are the main challenges hindering the development of HSC devices. The power density decays significantly because the faradic material at the battery part can’t adjust its rate of charge-discharge reactions to match the adsorption-desorption rate of SCs. The capacitance retention and cycle life correspond to the stability of the material on the battery component. To overcome these challenges, it is important to develop a new type of nanostructure materials with improved electrochemical capabilities. In this work, we investigate a new class of nanostructure materials with high stability and improved reaction kinetics for the faradic component of the HSC. The development strategy introduces alterations to the intrinsic characteristics of the materials, without changing their chemical phase. The investigated materials included: 1 D <b>nickel</b> doped lithium <b>titanate</b> oxide nanofibers, 2 D vanadium-modified chalcogens nanosheets anchored graphene nanosheets, and reconciled 2 D vanadium disulfide nanosheets with prominent 3 D ultra-small nanoparticles attached to graphene nanosheets. The developed materials exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance. In chapter 5, we report how a simple and scalable electrospinning technique was utilized to synthesis 1 D <b>nickel</b> doped lithium <b>titanate</b> oxide nanofibers (Ni-LTONF 10). The physiochemical characterization confirmed: 1) the successful insertion of nickel into the lattice of the lithium titanate oxide nanofibers (LTONF) without changing its chemical structure and, 2) that the nickel was homogenously distributed throughout the nanofibers to the atomic level, resulting in significantly enhanced ion diffusion and electrical conductivity. This unique coupling of 1 D morphology and nickel doping of LTO was investigated as the anode material for lithium ion batteries capable of demonstrating outstanding rate capabilities (up to 50 times higher than theoretical capacity (50 C)). The investigated nanofibers also performs 3 times better than nickel-doped nanoparticles demonstrated in other recent reports and shows outstanding ability to maintain high capacity even at 50 C. Ni-LTONF 10 shows 20 times higher capacity compared to un-doped lithium titanate nanofibers at 50 C. Specifically, Ni-LTONF 10 displays an initial capacity of 190 mAhg- 1 at 0. 2 C which is 9 % higher than the theoretical capacity of LTO, 150 mAhg- 1 at 5 C, 116 mAhg- 1 at 20 C and 63 mAhg- 1 at 50 C. Additionaly, a hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated using Ni-LTONF 10, showing superior energy density at high power density. The device was capable of delivering an energy density of 60 Wh kg - 1 at a power density of 1. 5 kW kg- 1 and also retained a high energy density of 35 Wh kg - 1 at 5 kW kg- 1. In chapter 6, we discuss the development of vanadium-modified binary chalcogens (NiCo 2 S 4) wrapped with graphene (VNCS), forming tuned 2 D sheet-on-sheet nanostructure. This unique material has been synthesized using a facile solvothermal method and is used as an electrode material for supercapacitors capable of demonstrating outstanding improvement in cyclability and capacitance retention at high power rates. The VNCS material shows a superior performance with 430 % improvement in capacitance retention at high power rates (50 A g- 1) and 140 % improvement in capacitance retention after 10, 000 cycles at 10 A g- 1, when compared to the un-modified material. Specifically, the VNCS showed an initial capacitance of 1340 F g- 1 at 2 A g- 1 and outstanding capacitance retention at 50 A g- 1 (1024 F g- 1). Impressively, the capacitance retention after 10, 000 cycles at 10 A g- 1 exceeds 90 %. These exceptional results are considered at the top of reported work in literature as discussed in chapter 6. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was fabricated using the VNCS showing superior performance. The HSC delivers an energy density of 45. 9 Wh kg - 1 at 0. 87 kW kg- 1 and maintains a superior energy density of 33. 6 Wh kg - 1 at 9 kW kg- 1 indicating the excellent potential of this material in hybrid supercapacitor applications The sheet-on-sheet structure reduced particle aggregation, provided larger surface areas with more electroactive sites for ion diffusion, enhanced the charge-discharge kinetics, which allows for faster electron transport. The morphology and structure characterization techniques confirmed that the vanadium is homogenously distributed throughout the binary chalcogens, resulting in significantly enhanced material stability at high power rates. HRTEM analysis confirmed the role of vanadium in fine-tuning the nano-architecture of the material and showed the dislocation in material structure. In chapter 7, we introduce the use of a safe and simple solvothermal method to synthesize a distinctive, flower bouquet-like, 2 D vanadium disulfide (VS 2) nanosheet structure with ultra-small prominent 3 D VS 2 nanoparticles (10 - 25 nm) on its surface and anchored on the surface of graphene nanosheets (VS 2 /G). This inimitable material has been tested in supercapacitors and showed superior capacitance, cyclability and capacitance retention at high power rates. The VS 2 /G showed 130 % higher capacitance at 1 A g- 1 compared to other recent reports and remarkably improved capacitance at higher current densities. The material also showed a distinctive ability to maintain capacitance after long cycles at high current densities. Specifically, VS 2 /G showed 211 F g- 1 at 1 A g- 1, 135 F g- 1 at 20 A g- 1 and 97 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles at 5 A g- 1. The VS 2 /G was tested in a full cell HSC and showed superior energy density of 46. 93 Wh kg- 1 at a power density of 0. 91 kW kg- 1 and retained high energy density of 23. 11 Wh kg- 1 even when the power density was increased ten-fold (9. 40 kW k g- 1) highlighting the excellent potential of this material {{to bridge the gap between}} battery and supercapacitor technologies. The unique morphology of VS 2 nanosheets embedded on graphene nanosheets with ultra-small VS 2 nanoparticles distributed uniformly at the surface of the nanosheets was confirmed by different characterization techniques including SEM and TEM. The presence of graphene and the harmonized synergy between the 2 D sheet-on-sheet morphology with the 3 D ultra-small VS 2 nanoparticles has a number of advantages. As such, it 1) hinders the agglomeration of the material and provides a large contact area with the electrolyte; and 2) generates strong covalent interactions between the VS 2 with the graphene surface. These characteristics lead to an increase in capacitance due to the increase in the number of electroactive sites and improve the charge transfer kinetics, while paving shorter ion diffusion pathways, all resulting in stable and reversible charge transfer processes. Chapter 8 summarizes and concludes the thesis and suggests potential future works for capitalizing on the reported scientific achievements. The introduction of effective changes to the intrinsic characteristics of materials and the development of tuned and novel nanostructure materials, using simple and inexpensive methods, pave the way toward the development of commercial and industrial scale hybrid supercapacitor devices. Future work can investigate the design and development of thick electrodes in an attempt to exploit the high stability of the developed materials and increase the material loading on the electrodes leading to higher energy densities without scarifying the power densities. The increased working voltage and the long cycling life along with the high capacitance retention of the developed materials at high power rates can be used as a base to investigate the design of multi-stack device for industrial scale applications such as electrical vehicles, backup systems, transportation, etc. It is also recommended to further investigate incorporating the developed material in other energy storage and conversion devices...|$|R
