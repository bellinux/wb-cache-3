40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{examine the impact of}} feeder and drinker designs on pig performance, water use and manure volume. In the first experiment, pigs with access to a Crystal Springs® wet/dry feeder grew faster, but had a poorer feed conversion and similar carcass merit as pigs using dry feeders with wall-mounted nipple drinkers. Water use was reduced 25. 6 % in the combined winter and summer trials and manure volume reduced 28. 9 % in the summer trial for the wet/dry feeder system versus the dry feeder and wall-mounted <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker</b> system. In the second experiment, {{there was no difference in}} pig performance or carcass merit for pigs using Trojan WaterSwing® drinkers versus gate mounted Trojan nipple drinkers. There was an 11. 1 % reduction in water use and a 16. 2 % reduction in manure volume for pigs using the swinging waterer. The reduction in manure volume for both systems compared to a conventional dry feeder and gate-mounted <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker</b> system has implications for designing manure storage devices and estimates of time necessary for manure removal. While the volume needed to store 180 days of manure production decreases with either the wet/dry feeders or swinging <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker,</b> the estimated acres of cropland to utilize the stored manure as a fertilizer resource does not change. It appears the difference in volume is due to a reduction in water wastage only. The total pounds of nutrients (N, P, K, etc) in the stored manure do not change, only their concentration per 1, 000 gallons...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of using nipple drinkers during brooding on the performance of Large White turkeys. There were 6 different drinkers tested: the control and 5 <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker</b> systems. The control was the Plasson Drinker and the nipple systems tested were the Plasson Easy Start (PES), Val-Co Turkey Drinker (VC), Lubing Traditional Nipple (LTN), Lubing EasyLine (LEL) and ZiggityTM Big-Z Activator (BZ). Three experiments were conducted with turkeys brooded using the 6 drinker types. Some <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker</b> treatments were used in the rearing periods. At 20 wk, Body Weight (BW) was reduced for toms brooded to 6 wk on the LTN and brooded and reared on the VC. The use of LEL and LTN (during brooding) resulted in improved Feed Conversion (FC) at 20 wk. Trial 2 -experiment 1 with hens of two strains was terminated at 3 wk because of excessive mortality from dehydration with some drinker types. In trial 2 -experiment 2, there were no poult hydration issues. The BW of hens at 6 wk brooded on the Plasson Drinker and the VC were higher compared to the BW of hens brooded on the PES and the BZ with the BW of hens on the LEL being intermediate. The use of the LTN resulted in significantly lower hen BW compared with all other drinkers through 10 wk. By 16 wk, there were no longer differences in hen BW due to drinker type. Drinker type did not have an effect on hen FC. Nipple drinkers can be used effectively to brood turkeys with some types also being useful during the rearing period. However, poor quality, inactive, or diseased poults may be at risk for dehydration on some <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|A summer {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{examine the impact of}} drinker design on pig performance, water use and manure volume.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} of evaluate the influence of different drinker types on the egg production, water intake, mortality, poultry litter relative humidity, egg weight, eggshell percentage, and egg specific gravity of broiler breeders. The experiment was carried out in a commercial farm with 37 - to 44 -wk-old broiler breeders. A randomized block experimental design, consisting of two treatments (bell or <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers)</b> with four replicates of 4. 000 females each, was applied. Data were submitted to analysis of variance, and means were compared by the test of Student-Newman-Keuls at 5 % significance level. Birds submitted to <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> presented lower water intake (p 0. 05) of drinker type on egg production or mortality. Poultry litter relative humidity was lower (p< 0. 05) under the nipple-drinker system. Birds drinking from bell drinkers produced heavier eggs (p< 0. 05) between weeks 39 and 40.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the nest location and the placement of <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> on nest use by laying hens in a commercial aviary was assessed. Twenty pens in a laying hen house were equipped with the same commercial aviary system, but the pens differed in the nest location and the placement of <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Nests were placed along the walls in 10 pens, and <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> were installed {{in front of the}} nests in 5 of these pens. The other 10 pens were equipped with nests placed on a tier within the aviary (integrated nests). <b>Nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> were installed in front of the nests in 5 of these pens. A total of 225 Lohmann Selected Leghorns were housed per pen. The hens were offered 4 nests per pen: 2 facing the service corridor of the laying hen house and 2 facing the outdoor area. The numbers of nest eggs and mislaid eggs were counted daily per pen. At 25, 36, and 43 wk of age, the nest platforms were videotaped and the behavior of laying hens in front of the nests was analyzed. The nest location affected the stationary and locomotive behaviors in front of the nests. Hens in front of the integrated nests and the nests with drinkers displayed more stationary behaviors than hens in front of wall-placed nests or nests without drinkers. No difference in the number of nest eggs could be detected, but the integration of the nests inside the aviary led to a more even distribution of hens while nest searching. In the pens with wall-placed nests, significantly more hens laid eggs in the nests at the wall near the service corridor than at the wall near the outdoor area. Due to this imbalance, crowding in front of the preferred nests occurred and pushing and agonistic interactions on the nest platforms were significantly more frequent. Placement of <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> in front of nests had no effect on the number of eggs laid in those nest...|$|R

40|$|Dois sistemas de bebedouros utilizados na criação avícola, {{pendular}} e chupeta (nipple), foram estudados objetivando avaliar a qualidade microbiológica da água fornecida às aves, em relação à presença de coliformes totais e fecais, aeróbios mesófilos, bolores e leveduras. Realizaram-se coletas de água no primeiro, 14, 28 e 42 dias de idade, sendo os dias de amostragem divididos em três períodos, de acordo com o horário de limpeza dos bebedouros pendulares: primeira, antes da limpeza; segunda, logo após a limpeza e terceira, ao meio dia. Os bebedouros avaliados apresentaram índices de contaminação em relação ao NMP de coliformes fecais acima dos limites estabelecidos pela Portaria do MS-Brasil. As contagens para UFC de bolores e leveduras obtidas para bebedouros pendulares apresentaram índices de contaminação maiores do que os chupeta. Em uma segunda etapa do estudo, foi avaliado o efeito da cloração constante sobre a qualidade microbiológica da água, usando os mesmos parâmetros anteriores. Foram instaladas bombas dosadoras de cloro em cada galpão reguladas para manter concentração de 2 mg/L de cloro residual livre. A cloração contínua da água melhorou a qualidade microbiológica em relação ao NMP de coliformes totais e fecais nos bebedouros avaliados. Quanto aos aeróbios mesófilos, os bebedouros apresentaram-se fora dos padrões estabelecidos pela Portaria MS-Brasil, sendo o chupeta o que apresentou melhor desempenho. O bebedouro chupeta apresentou índices de contaminação da água inferiores aos apresentados pelos pendulares. Mesmo assim, foram considerados fora dos padrões para água potável. Two drinker systems used {{by commercial}} broiler growers, the bell drinker type and the <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker,</b> were studied aiming {{to evaluate the}} microbiological quality of the water supplied to the birds in relation to occurrence of total and fecal coliforms, mesophilic aerobic, moulds and yeast. The water samplings were taken on the 1 st, 14 th, 28 th and 42 th days of age. The days of sampling, {{in accordance with the}} cleaning schedule for the bell type drinkers, were divided into three periods: before the cleaning, right after cleaning and at noon. The evaluated drinkers presented patterns of contamination in relation to the most probable number (mpn/ 100 ml) of fecal coliforms above that of the limit number established by the Ministry of Health, Brazil. The counts for mould and yeast (cfu/mL) obtained from bell type drinkers showed a higher pattern of contamination when compared to the <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker.</b> In a second stage of the study, the effect of constant flow chlorination was evaluated on the microbiological quality of the water, using the same standard parameters as previous described. Dosage measurement pumps of chlorine were installed in each poultry house and managed to keep a concentration of 2 mg/l of free residual chlorine. Continuous flow water chlorination improved the microbiological quality in relation to the MPN of total and faecal coliforms in the evaluated drinkers.

A single <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker</b> was provided in each pen of 35 to 40 pigs. In 36 of the 66 pens, wet/dry feeders were not connected to the water line, and in 30 pens, wet/dry feeders provided additional water. Chains were provided in alternate pens. Pigs were individually weighed and assigned an ear score at weaning (approximately 3 wk of age) and at approximately 8 wk of age. Piglets in 48 pens were videotaped for 24 h on days 7, 14, and 21 post-weaning, using black-and-white time-lapse video equipment.

40|$|Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{are often}} {{presented}} suffering from urolithiasis/cystitis. In the prophylaxis of uroliths a high water intake and output is regarded to be beneficial. With respect to an improvement of water intake a study was performed using 12 rabbits. The animals {{were subjected to}} different feed and water regimes with practical relevance. Water was provided by an open dish and/or by a <b>nipple</b> <b>drinker.</b> During some trial periods water access was restricted to 6 h or 12 h; during the remaining trial periods water was accessible ad libitum. In the preference trial open dishes were preferred. With restricted water access rabbits exhibited a 20 % higher water intake when open dishes were offered compared to nipple drinkers; {{there was no such}} difference when water was accessible ad libitum. At least 50 % parsley and hay ad libitum in the feeding doubled total water intake and output and led to less concentrated urine. This feeding can therefore be recommended for urolith prophylaxis. Water restriction to 12 h decreased water (- 11 %) and food intake (- 7 %), and increased the dry matter content of urine (+ 25 %) and faeces (+ 11 %). For both animal welfare and physiological reasons, limited water access is therefore rejected. To reach an optimal water provision we recommend feeding with a high proportion of fresh food as well as additional hay ad libitum, with free water access, offered in an open dish...|$|E
40|$|When offered diets with hay ad libitum, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) clearly prefer open dishes over <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers,</b> {{but whether}} this {{preference}} also applies in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) is unsure. We tested the drinker preference of 10 guinea pigs when offered open dishes (OD) and <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> (ND) simultaneously and measured {{the amount of}} water consumed by each animal on four different diets (grass hay 100 %, or as 10 % of intake on diets of fresh parsley, seed mix or pelleted complete feed, respectively) on either of the drinking systems. All animals ingested the hay portion of the combined diets ﬁrst. The amount of water consumed differed signiﬁcantly between individual animals. Animals drank less water on parsley than on the other diets. Nine of 10 animals clearly preferred ND when having a choice, and eight of these drank more when on ND only. The difference between the drinking systems was not consistent across all diets: on hay, similar amounts of water were drunk when on OD or ND only. Differences in water intake were reﬂected in urine production. Because drinking from ND in guinea pigs involves jaw movements similar to those in chewing, the results could suggest that when motivation for oral processing behaviour is not satisﬁed by a diet, animals may respond in using ND beyond physiological water necessity. Whereas physiological water requirements are probably better investigated with other drinking systems due to a possible overestimation when using ND, offering ND to pet guinea pigs most likely offers a form of behavioural enrichment {{that at the same time}} may increase water intake and hence act as prophylaxis against urolithiasis...|$|R

40|$|A Canada-wide flock {{management}} {{survey of}} 294 randomly selected commercial broiler chicken flocks was conducted during 1989 - 1990. The prevalence of flocks that yielded Salmonella from cultures of floor litter or drinking water, and {{the prevalence of}} floor litter samples that yielded Salmonella, were significantly associated (p < 0. 05) with {{the age of the}} flock and the region of Canda in which the flock was located. Culture of Salmonella from the drinking water was significantly associated (p < 0. 05) with the type of drinker used, the dead bird disposal method, and the region of Canada in which the flock was located. There was a significantly greater risk (p < 0. 05) of contamination of drinking water with Salmonella from trough drinkers (odds ratio = 7. 99) and plastic bell drinkers (odds ratio = 6. 10) than from <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers.</b> No significant associations were found between pest control, restrictions on visitors, clean-out methods, or water sanitization and the culture of salmonellae from floor litter or drinking water...|$|R
40|$|Heat and {{moisture}} production rates (HP, MP) of modern broiler chickens (Cobb strain males) raised on litter in commercial production housing were determined from extensive environmental and production data of 20 house–flocks. The flock size was 18, 800 birds, with a typical growth period of 56 days. Regression equations were established that predict total, sensible and latent HP of the broiler houses over common ranges of body mass (0. 4 to 3. 2 kg), house temperature (20 to 32 C), relative humidity (30 – 80 %), and photoperiod (light or dark). Specific total HP rate {{from this study}} was up to 31 % higher than found elsewhere at 0. 4 kg body mass, and the difference diminished as mass approached 2. 3 kg. Modern broiler houses have reduced MP that presumably resulted from use of <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> as opposed to trough drinkers on {{which most of the}} literature data were based. The new HP and MP data are expected to enhance efficient design and operation of modern broiler housing ventilation systems. The results further confirm the need to systematically update literature HP and MP data for engineering practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{drinking}} water needed daily by the pig depends on numerous influences, including temperature, diet, stage of production and health. Within a 24 -hour period under thermal-neutral conditions, grow-finish and gestating swine demonstrate a peak in water usage in late afternoon while lactating females consume water more consistently throughout the day. In times of heat stress, grow-finish pigs alter their water usage pattern with a peak between 8 to 9 a. m. and second peak around 5 to 8 p. m. Daily drinking water needs for pigs range from less than 0. 5 gal/pig/day for newly weaned pigs to greater than 1. 5 gal/pig/day for grow-finish pigs using <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Water requirements for breeding swine range from 3 to 4 gal/day for gestating females and 6 gal/day for lactating swine. Knowledge of the daily water needs of pigs, and the patterns of water usage within the day allow for the appropriate sizing of delivery devices and prediction {{of the impact of}} pork production on available water supplies. Daily charting {{of drinking water}} usage can serve as a predictor of the on-set of swine health challenges such as swine influenza. As more sophisticated methods become available to record water usage, other predictors of performance may be developed depending on the patterns detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{production}} systems {{on the welfare}} of ducks grown for meat is becoming increasingly controversial. In the UK, approximately 18 million ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were reared for meat in 2006 (British Poultry Council, 2008; [URL] Despite the association between ducks and water in the wild, there are no legal requirements {{for them to have}} water for bathing or swimming. Some have troughs in which they dip their heads and splash water onto their bodies but for some, their only contact with water is drinking water from ball-bearing 'nipples'. The Council of Europe (1999) recommends that ducks should be able to dip their heads in water and spread water over their feathers. We here provide clear evidence that duck welfare is related to {{the nature and extent of}} their access to water. We recorded body and plumage condition and undertook three behavioural techniques to assess the effect of water source on the welfare of ducks. Ducks were reared with access to one of five water sources: a bath (small pond), a trough, an overhead shower, <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> only or <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> until 5 weeks and a bath thereafter. Their behaviour was assessed by recording (i) the time spent with a single resource, (ii) rebound in water related behaviour when given access to a bath and (iii) their preference for water source when given a four-way choice of all resources. The results showed that without the opportunity to at least dip their heads and splash their feathers with water, ducks were unable to keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers fully clean. Importantly, there was no difference in the time spent bathing from the bath, trough or shower, indicating resources were equivalent in their provision of bathing water. Very little time, however, was spent showing bathing movements at the nipples. Only ducks in the nipple-only group showed 'compensatory rebound' when finally given access to water in a bath, indicating previous bathing deprivation. There was no rebound in groups reared with a trough or shower, again indicating that the trough and shower were equivalent to the bath in its provision of bathing water. When given choice, the ducks preferred to rest and drink-dabble with the shower, and bathe with the bath; the shower was intermediate to the trough. Little time was spent with the nipples when the ducks were given access to other water sources and little time was spent swimming in the bath. The results suggest that commercial farmers may be able to improve duck welfare as much by providing water in troughs or from overhead showers (both clean and economical of water) as from actual ponds (baths). © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Detailed {{information}} on the pigs’ temporal drinking patterns is essential when delivering water based health products {{because there is a}} risk that not all pigs will visit the drinker adequately and hence, may not receive sufficient vaccine or medication required to protect the animal. The objectives of this study were to determine the percentage of pigs that drank within a 6 hour time period and the number and length of drinking visits on an hourly basis for seven week old pigs when water was either withheld or not withheld for 15 hours over two consecutive days. All pigs in the pens took at least one 5 second or longer visit to the drinker over both days (Table 1). Number of drinking visits to the <b>nipple</b> cup <b>drinker</b> per hour differed (P = 0. 0001) for the first hour (0700) after water was made available between WH and CONT treatments respectively (Table 2). For all other hours there were no (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) differences. Total length of time spent at the <b>nipple</b> cup <b>drinker</b> differed (P = 0. 0001) at 0700 with WH spending longer than their CONT counterparts. For all other time periods there were no (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) differences (Table 3). In conclusion, withholding water over the 15 hour period to make sure all pigs receive sufficient vaccine is not needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of engagement with different materials as environmental enrichment by growing rabbits in cages with plastic slatted floor was studied in two experiments using {{a total of}} 108 rabbits (ZIKA hybrids). In each experiment, 54 rabbits were kept in four group-cages with different group-sizes (8, 8, 16 and 22) at the same stocking density (625 cm/rabbit). The cages were equipped with <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> and feeders. Feed and water were available ad libitum. The duration of the photoperiod was 16 hours. In the first experiment (D 1), pellets were fed ad libitum from a conventional feeder installed outside the cage. In the second experiment (D 2), another feeding system which gives the rabbit the possibility to take crude-fiber ad libitum was additionally located {{in the middle of}} every cage. Three different occupational tools were installed in the cages: an iron-chain with a wooden gnawing stick (WGS) for the two groups with eight rabbits (A, B), one iron-chain with a plastic gnawing stick (PGS) placed in the group with 16 rabbits (C) and two iron chains connected by a horizontal iron stick (ICS) for the group with 22 rabbits (D).

40|$|Five week-old Pannon White rabbits were {{housed in}} a closed climatized rabbitry and {{randomly}} assigned to pens (56 rabbits) having a basic area of 1 m 2 with a stocking density of 16 and 12 rabbits/m 2 or to 18 individual cages (0. 24 m 2; 1 rabbit/cage; stocking density of 4 rabbits/m 2). The pens and the cages were divided into 2 parts and animals could move freely among the 2 parts through swing doors. The vertical sides of {{one part of the}} pens and cages were completely covered with mirrors while the other part was covered with white plastic panels. A 24 hour video recording was performed twice a week using infrared cameras and the number of rabbits in each pen and cage was counted with a frequency of 15 minutes (96 times a day). The duration of the trial was 6 weeks. The lighting period was 16 L/ 8 D. Rabbits were fed ad libitum a standard diet and water was available ad libitum from <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Throughout the entire rearing period 67 % of the individually caged rabbits showed a preference for the part of the cage enriched with mirrors (P< 0. 001). This preference slightly decreased with increasing age. The strong preference toward the part of the cage provided with mirror walls was independent of the time of day.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of health related symptoms and to analyze the work activities of workers in contracted non-mechanized broiler farms in two regions of the state of Paraná in order to determine possible factors associated to those symptoms. The methods consisted in selecting the houses and the workers, and to apply a questionnaire that included demographic data, questions related to work, the Nordic Questionnaire for Musculoskeletal Symptoms, other symptoms (runny nose, skin itching, throat and eye irritation). In addition, workers were asked if they enjoyed their job, if the supervisor motivated them to work, and if they were afraid to lose their job. Activities were submitted to systematic observations, adapted from Ergonomics, and the loads carried were analyzed and some instruments weighted. The study included 80 workers of both genders between 16 and 59 years, being 40 from each region. There were evidences of low back pain risk in the activities of filling drinkers and washing bell drinkers, with a higher prevalence in region A, where automated systems were less frequently used. The study suggests that mechanized filling of feeders, and the use of <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers</b> may prevent health problems. It was also found that psychosocial aspects were associated to musculoskeletal symptoms. Promoting better working conditions is essential, as these aspects can affect human behavior at work.

40|$|Reducing water waste, and {{therefore}} the total volume of manure produced, {{is one of the}} ways to lower the environmental impact of intensive pig farming. The aim of this trial was to verify whether the absence of additional fresh drinking water could compromise the production traits or behaviour of liquid-fed heavy pigs. Sixty animals (initial BW 78 kg) were divided into two experimental groups, both fed a liquid diet (water-to-feed ratio 3 : 1 w/w). All pens were equipped with nipple drinkers; one of the groups had permanent access to fresh water (working drinkers—WD), whereas the other group had no water supply except that delivered with food (dry drinkers—DD). The pigs were housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms. They were brought to a weight of 160 kg and then slaughtered. Hams were dry-cured according to the directives for Parma ham production. No significant differences (P> 0. 05) were observed between the experimental groups with respect to growth parameters (ADG and FCR), behavioural traits, blood parameters or the qualitative traits of carcasses (dressing out, lean meat yield, backfat thickness), meat (pH, colour, WHC, fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat and tenderness) and cured hams (weight losses, sensory properties, chemical composition and oxidative status). With respect to drinking behaviour, a low number of visits to the drinker were recorded for both groups and data seem to indicate a high amount of water wasted by pigs provided with additional water delivery by <b>nipple</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Liquid feeding did not suppress drinkers use or drinker manipulation in both groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to {{study the effects of}} a high flow volume (2. 3 mL/s) nipple waterer (HEN) versus a low flow volume (. 4 mL/s) nipple waterer (LFN) on the productive performance of broiler chickens as measured by average body weight (kilograms), average feed conversion (kilograms:kilogram), and percentage mortality rate. Equal numbers of male and female birds were used during Trial 1; only male birds were used during Trials 2 and 3. All trials were conducted during the summer months. An attempt was made during Trial 2 to expose the birds to artificial heat stress. No differences were seen during any of the trials in feed conversion between the two treatments. In Trial 1 the only significant difference (P <. 05) exhibited was in average male body weight (1. 87 kg HFN; 1. 84 kg LFN). A highly significant difference (P <,. 01) was seen in average body weight (1. 75 kg HFN; 1. 64 kg LFN) during Trial 2. Average body weight difference during Trial 3 was highly significant at 42 days of age but not at Day 49. Mortality rate figures during Trial 2 indicate a highly significant difference during the 38 -day period prior to heat stress (2. 2 % LFN;. 4 % HFN), and significant difference during the heat stress period (38 to 44 days; 2. 9 % LFN; 1. 5 % HFN). During Trial 3 mortality rate differences were significant by 49 days (20. 6 % LFN; 11. 4 % HFN) although there was no difference at 42 days. All instances of significant difference indicate that superior performance (lower mortality rate or higher body weight) can be expected from male broilers reared on HFN waterers.
