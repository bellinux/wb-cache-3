5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is <b>not</b> <b>unusual.</b> <b>To</b> prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after {{learning}} {{the news of}} Kazangap's death, Yedigei observes a rocket launching from the launch site north of the Boranly-Burranyi junction. Launches, though infrequent, are <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> Yedigei, but this one in particular is {{because he had no}} prior knowledge of it. Generally, such occasions heralded pompous celebration, but this one had not.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheme was}} not {{considered}} a great success. In fact, during periods of severe service disruption, it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> see several trains buffer-to-buffer along the line, though this occurred when the line was much busier than now. Concern was expressed that similar coloured aspects had different interpretations depending on where on the signal they appeared.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Dictaphone {{replaced}} wax cylinders {{with their}} Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove {{into a plastic}} belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. However, cylinders for older style dictating machines continued to be available for some years, and it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> encounter cylinder dictating machines into the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Quetta usually {{receives}} snow in December, January, and February, {{though it}} is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> have a snowfall as late as March. During the drought of 1998-2002, Quetta didn't receive any snowfall; while in 2004, 2005, and 2008 it snowed only once in the year. In 2004 and 2008, the city received heavy snow twice after hiatus of fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|Historically it {{was common}} {{practice}} for daughters {{to be given the}} mother's family name and sons to be given their father's. For example, Vasco da Gama married Catarina de Ataíde. They had six sons who bore the surname da Gama, and one daughter who had the surname de Ataíde. Even now, among the older population, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> find siblings with completely different combinations of surnames.|$|E
25|$|Human activities, mainly {{cultivation}} of the steppes, {{resulted in the}} disappearance of animals formerly common in the basin, such as tarpan, steppe antelope, saiga antelope, marmots and others. Back in the 1960s–1970s, especially near Oskol River, it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> meet bobak marmot, Eurasian deer, wild boar and Russian desman. Current mammals of the basin include European beaver, Dipodidae, suslik, mice, European otter, European mink, weasel and bats.|$|E
30|$|It is proved in [2] that a normed {{linear space}} {{satisfies}} the (CN)-inequality if {{and only if}} it satisfies the parallelogram identity, i.e., is a pre-Hilbert space; hence it is <b>not</b> so <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> have an inner product-like notion in Hadamard spaces. Berg and Nikolaev [5] introduced the concept of quasilinearization as follows.|$|R

25|$|Most {{countries}} have breed descriptions that {{say that the}} Irish Terrier should not be more than 48cm measured at the withers. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> see females that are 50cm tall or dogs that are even 53cm (20in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, {{but there is a}} downside to this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type.|$|E
25|$|In Finnish culture, nudism is {{considered}} to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole {{is considered}} less taboo than many other countries.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{procedure}} {{occurs with}} masculine names, but using a reverse order. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> find masculine {{names such as}} João Maria, José Maria, Manuel Maria, Luís Maria etc. In this case, Maria would always be the second given name, in honour of the Virgin Mary, and the first name would be a masculine name. This custom is fashionable among the Portuguese and Brazilian nobility and the upper classes, but is considered tacky in Brazilian society.|$|E

25|$|The {{limbic system}} can also {{significantly}} impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> identify {{higher than normal}} HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques {{have been developed to}} ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.|$|E
25|$|However, at finer scales {{than this}} the {{distribution}} of the valleys where present is highly patchy and discontinuous. Within the highlands, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>to</b> find heavily dissected slopes immediately adjacent to almost entirely unmodified surfaces, both at valley and catchment scales. The valleys are also regionally clustered, with little dissection in Northwest Arabia and southwest and southeast of Hellas, but much in Terra Cimmeria and just south of the equator from 20°E to 180°E. They are also much more prominent on steeper slopes, for example on crater rims, but again may only be present on one side of such a rim.|$|E
