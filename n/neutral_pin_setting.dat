50|$|All NEMA 14 devices {{provide a}} ground <b>pin,</b> a <b>neutral</b> <b>pin</b> and two phase pins (X & Y) {{which are used}} for the two phases of a {{split-phase}} source. They differ in rating {{and shape of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>pin.</b> The 14-30 has a rating of 30 A and an L-shaped <b>neutral</b> <b>pin.</b> The 14-50 has a rating of 50 A and a straight <b>neutral</b> <b>pin</b> sized so that it will not fit in the slot of a 14-30.|$|R
25|$|Earlier type 11 & 12 plugs had {{line and}} <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> without sleeved pins, which present a shock hazard when {{partially}} inserted into non-recessed sockets. Since 1 January 2013, only type 11 & 12 plugs with line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> partially sleeved {{are allowed to}} be imported and distributed to reduce the risk.|$|R

25|$|NEMA 7 {{devices are}} 2-pole and ground {{connectors}} rated at 277V. The 15A 7-15 plug has the crowsfoot current carrying pins of the Type I plug, {{but with a}} U-shaped earth pin.

50|$|IEC 60906-1 plugs {{are similar}} in size and shape to the Europlug, with the front profile being a flat hexagon. They are {{nominally}} 35.5 mm wide. The 3-pin Class I plug is 17 mm high, whereas the 2-pin Class II plug is 14 mm high (similar to the Europlug). The parallel side faces are 26 mm apart, and the two pairs of side faces are orthogonal to each other. Like Schuko and Europlug, the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pin</b> are 19 mm long and on centres spaced at 19 mm. The pins have a diameter of 4.5 mm, intermediate between Schuko (⌀4.8 mm) and Europlug (⌀4.0 mm). In common with the Europlug there is an insulating sleeve {{around the base of}} the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins.</b> The 3-pin version has a round protective-earth pin of the same length and diameter as the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins,</b> but with no insulating sleeve. The protective-earth pin's center is offset 3 mm from the center point between the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} feature a ground pin that {{is longer than}} the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins,</b> ensuring that the ground connection is made first, and thus the safety ground is in place before line voltage {{is applied to the}} downstream equipment.|$|R
50|$|The socket {{has either}} a 10 mm deep recess or a 12 mm high rim, to exclude {{incompatible}} plugs. It {{ensures that the}} protective-earth pin establishes contact before the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins.</b> Sockets are required to have shutters for the line and neutral apertures.|$|R

50|$|For stage {{lighting}} use, {{a common}} plug is the 32-A 5-pin connector with a <b>neutral</b> <b>pin.</b> Motor loads that don't need the neutral use a four-pin connector. Larger requirements may use powerlock or camlock connectors. In the IT industry, the IEC 60309 system is sometimes used.|$|R
5000|$|As from 3 April 2005 the [...] "live" [...] (Line and <b>Neutral)</b> <b>pins</b> {{of every}} 10 amp and 15 amp flat pin plug sold were {{required}} {{to comply with the}} requirements of AS/NZS 3112: 2000, which states that the live pins must be insulated, as shown in the picture.|$|R

50|$|NEMA 10 {{devices are}} a curious throwback {{to an earlier}} time. They are {{classified}} as 125/250 V non-grounding, yet they are usually used {{in a manner that}} effectively grounds the appliance, albeit not {{in a manner consistent with}} most modern practice. They provide a <b>neutral</b> <b>pin</b> and two phase pins (X & Y) which are used for the two phases of a split-phase source.|$|R
50|$|When {{looking at}} the socket, the phase {{sequence}} should be L1, L2, L3, and then the <b>neutral</b> <b>pin,</b> proceeding clockwise from the earth pin. (Counter-clockwise on the corresponding plug.) Since some wiring may be reversed, which would make motors turn backward, many machines on construction sites feature a phase swap plug that allows the L2 and L3 phase pins to be swapped, thereby reversing the phase sequence.|$|R
50|$|When {{inserted}} into the socket, the Schuko plug covers the socket cavity (1) and establishes protective-earth connection through the earth clips (2) before the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> (3) establish contact, thereby preventing users from touching connected pins. A pair of non-conductive guiding notches (4) {{on the left and}} right side provides extra stability, enabling the safe use of large and heavy plugs (e.g. with built-in transformers or timers).|$|R

25|$|The {{plug and}} socket are rated 16 A 250 V a.c. and are {{intended}} for use only on systems having nominal voltages between 200 V and 250 V a.c. The plug pins are 4.5mm in diameter, line and neutral are on centres 19mm apart. The earth pin is offset 3.0mm. The line pin {{is on the left}} when looking at a receptacle with the earth pin offset down. Shutters over the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> are mandatory.|$|R
2500|$|BS1363-1 {{specifies}} {{the dimensions}} of plug pins and their disposition with {{respect to each other}} in precise, absolute terms. [...] The [...] and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> have a rectangular cross section 6.4mm by 4.0mm, 17.7mm long and with centres 22.2mm apart. The protective-earth pin is a rectangular cross section 8.0mm by 4.0mm, 22.3mm long and with a centre line 22.2mm from the line/neutral pin centre line. The dimensions were originally specified in decimal inches with asymmetric tolerances and redefined as minimum and maximum metric dimensions in BS1363:1984.|$|R
50|$|In Brazil, {{this kind}} of plug is {{commonly}} found in high-power appliances like air conditioners, dishwashers, and household ovens. The reasons why they have been unofficially adopted for this use may be the robustness and high-current bearing capabilities, the impossibility of inverting phase and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins,</b> {{or the fact that}} Argentina, a border country, uses this plug and used to be more developed than Brazil in the past so {{there may have been a}} flux of high-powered appliances from Argentina to Brazil at some point in time.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a safety ground connection and are {{commonly referred to}} as two pin and ground (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The ground pin is situated between the line and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The ground pin is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the safety ground connection is made first when making a connection.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{variants}} include plug/sockets with {{a rating}} of 10 A utilising a round earth pin, which is used on [...] "special use" [...] circuits, such as storage heaters in classrooms; and a 110 V 10 A version that has round active & <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> with a flat earth pin. The latter is rated at only 110 V (since certain foreign 110 V plugs could be inserted into the Socket-Outlet) and may be used on PAR 64 lights, where two 110 volt 1000 Watt lamps are used in series.|$|R

2500|$|Dimensions {{are chosen}} to provide safe {{clearance}} to live parts. The distance from {{any part of}} the [...] and <b>neutral</b> <b>pins</b> to the periphery of the plug base must be not less than 9.5mm. [...] This ensures that nothing can be inserted alongside a pin when the plug is in use, and helps keep fingers away from the pins. [...] The longer earth pin ensures that the earth path is connected before the live pins, and remains connected after the live pins are removed. The earth pin is too large to be inserted into the [...] or neutral sockets by mistake.|$|R
