40|$|The Institute of Development Studies (IDS) {{has contributed}} to African {{agricultural}} policy debate which has featured prominently in growth and poverty reduction assessment in sub-Saharan Africa. This debate has rekindled interest {{in the use of}} agricultural input subsidies to promote food security nationally and at household level. After the enforced withdrawal of these agricultural subsidies during the structural adjustment era, their re-introduction as ‘market-smart’ subsidies has led to several assessment studies. This article draws on evidence from five countries and a detailed study in Ruvuma Region, Tanzania. These subsidy programmes were reported to be successful in increasing maize yields and reducing poverty and had positive spillover effects on input use by non-recipients and private sector development in rural areas. However, unclear programme objectives and serious implementation problems prevented most of these programmes from being effective.

A simple and reproducible method to automatize CAPI in an operational context with the overreaching goal to reduce control costs and completion time was developed in this study. Validated control data provided by the Portuguese Control and Paying Agency for Agriculture (IFAP) and a multispectral atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ time series were used to calibrate and test the method. Taking advantage of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> declarations, object-based land cover classification for the 12 most controlled classes was carried out in the region of Ribatejo. The main feature of the presented method is that it allows choosing a confidence level on the automatic classification of farmers’ parcels. While higher confidence levels reduce the risk of misclassifications, lower levels increase the number of automatic control decisions. A confidence level of 80 % is a good compromise. This confidence level leads to over 55 % of automatically taken control decisions with an overall accuracy of 84 %. Furthermore, over 85 % of all parcels classified as maize, rice, wheat or vineyard can be controlled by the method with the optimal confidence level...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MA (Geography and Environmental Studies) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In 2004, {{the then}} Department of Housing’s Breaking New Ground (BNG) policy {{introduced}} {{a compilation of}} principles that underlie a sustainable human settlement. The principles were aimed at guiding, amongst others, municipal officials in the decisions they take {{when faced with a}} housing development project. This thesis will set out to determine how municipal officials have taken up BNG’s principles for sustainable housing settlements as well as the perceptions, methods of implementation and degree of acceptance that housing and town planning managers have of BNG. In the study, the perceived relevance that these managers have of BNG within their non-metropolitan towns is explored using five of the fifteen leader towns of the Western Cape Province. This research has shown that BNG considers the compact urban form, coupled to other development considerations, as the most sustainable for South Africa. In terms of building sustainable human settlements: the low-income housing unit has evolved substantially since its conception, and that the current unit is held in far higher regard (by both municipalities and beneficiaries) than its predecessors. The design of this unit remains standardised {{due to a lack of}} funding for a more flexible design, but its structure allows for additions to be made at the cost of the beneficiary. Funding thus remains a major constraint to housing delivery. Municipalities feel that they are able to implement BNG, but that there are certain shortcomings in the document which prevent its full implementation. One of these shortcomings is the lack of an external funding mechanism for housing delivery, proposed in BNG, but never having materialised. Further, BNG focuses more on the metropolitan scenario and is not always relevant to non-metropolitan towns. Almost all of the municipalities have initiated inner city regeneration projects, but fewer have included the provision of social housing as part of their inner city rejuvenation. Subsidy housing is the most implemented housing typology, but these units often experience decay due to the absence of original owners who have (mostly illegally) sold or rented out their units. The one-erf-one-unit <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> housing is not seen as sustainable owing to space limitation experienced by most of the municipalities interviewed. Contrary to earlier research, in situ upgrading is a common occurrence in municipalities. However, there is a great need for stronger regional (or broader scale) planning regarding housing delivery. Low-income housing is strongly influenced by politics – a fact which municipalities say negatively influences housing delivery. Migration also poses a serious threat to municipal backlogs. Currently, the fight against an escalating demand for low-cost housing is a losing battle as the rate at which government is rolling out housing is vastly ineffectual. Municipalities deem that large-scale projects like the N 2 Gateway might be a solution to their housing backlogs which, they concur, are at crisis point. However, municipalities indicated that their implementation of large scale projects will not follow the same path as the N 2 Gateway – the planning of which is seen to be substandard. Currently, urban integration takes place on an income basis and not due to racial division. Inclusionary housing is seen as a relevant tool for the promotion of integration, but cannot be enforced to its full potential due to a lack of supporting legislation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause of {{the central}} {{importance}} of higher education and its long-turn positive extern effects on the whole society, the government often might wish to enforce its will on the universities through the subsidy it provides to them. Thus the question arises: what are the welfare consequences <b>of</b> state <b>subsidies</b> offered to universities? I try {{to answer this question}} with the recently developed tools of the so-called reference point theory, established by Oliver Hart and his coauthors. In my model the two participants are the government and the university. Exclusively a rector controls the university and the representative of the government is the administrator. The objective of the administrator is to maximize public welfare, whereas the rector maximizes her own payoff. The administrator offers a subsidy that comes together with the obligation to fulfill the state's instructions. Since these ‘handcuffs’ are usually against the rector's own interest, but subsidy is valuable to the rector, there is a tradeoff. I investigate the optimal behavior of the rector in two cases: a private university and a state owned public university. In spite of the simplified assumptions, this setup undoubtedly shows the ambiguous <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies...</b>|$|R

OBA is the provision <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> for the delivery of and access to social or infrastructure services.

Though by birth belonging to the middle class in a country of hide-bound aristocracy, he lived to move on equal terms in the society of princes and statesmen; which would never have been the case had he been notoriously bought and sold. Yet that he was in the habit of receiving gifts from all and sundry who hoped for his backing is beyond dispute.

Yet he never made any secret of these gifts; Metternich was aware of them, and he never suspected Gentz of writing or acting in consequence against his convictions.

The importance of these cross-ecosystem resource flows from donor systems to recipient consumers is increasingly recognized. Streams, especially small streams with their high edge ratio with the terrestrial system, provide excellent models for the study <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> and {{a large portion of}} this literature has been produced by aquatic scientists.

40|$|Concerned about {{national}} food self-sufficiency and rural household incomes, in 2004 China decided to reverse its longstanding policy of taxing farm households and instead began {{to provide them}} with subsidies. Since 2004, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Despite the historic turnaround of policy and likely implication <b>of</b> this <b>subsidy</b> policy to China's food economy, there has been little household level survey-based research that has sought to understand the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> China's <b>subsidy</b> programs from the viewpoint of the farmer. Using data from two sets of household-based surveys (covering tens of thousands of households and most major producing provinces) and survey data from government, in this paper we examine the subsidies that are directly given to farmers, one of the newest and relatively high profiles components <b>of</b> China's <b>subsidy</b> programs. We focus on China's grain, input, seed, and machinery subsidy programs. According to the survey-based findings, we show that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on a per hectare basis the rate <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> is high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most of grain, input and seed subsidies are non-distorting, but machinery subsidy is based on farmers' actual purchase of machineries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Streams and {{adjacent}} terrestrial ecosystems are characterised by permeable boundaries that are crossed by resource subsidies. Although the importance <b>of</b> these <b>subsidies</b> for riverine ecosystems is increasingly recognised, {{little is known}} about how they may be influenced by global environmental change. Drawing from available evidence, in this review we propose a conceptual framework to evaluate the effects of global change on the quality and spatio-temporal dynamics <b>of</b> stream-terrestrial <b>subsidies.</b> We illustrate how changes to hydrologic and temperature regimes, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, land-use, and the distribution of non-indigenous species can influence subsidy fluxes by affecting the biology and ecology of donor and recipient systems and the physical characteristics of stream-riparian boundaries. Climate-driven changes in the physiology and phenology of organisms with complex lifecycles will influence their development time, body size and emergence patterns, with consequences for adjacent terrestrial consumers. Also, novel species interactions can modify subsidy dynamics via complex bottom-up and top-down effects. Given the seasonality and pulsed <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies,</b> alterations <b>of</b> the temporal and spatial synchrony of resource availability to consumers across ecosystems is likely to result in ecological mismatches that can scale up from individual responses, to communities, to ecosystems. Similarly, altered hydrology, temperature, CO 2 concentration, and land-use will modify the recruitment and quality of riparian vegetation, the timing of leaf abscission, and the establishment of invasive riparian species. Along with morphological changes to streamterrestrial boundaries, these will alter the use and fluxes <b>of</b> allochthonous <b>subsidies</b> associated with stream ecosystems. Future research should aim to understand how subsidy dynamics will be affected by key drivers of global change, including agricultural intensification, increasing water use, and biotic homogenization. Our conceptual framework based on the match-mismatch between donor and recipient organisms may facilitate understanding of the multiple effects of global change and aid in the development of future research questions.

40|$|Pakistan has {{a history}} of subsidising {{agricultural}} inputs. Although none of the agricultural inputs were subsidised during the early 1950 s, the process was initiated {{in the second half of}} the decade by subsidising chemical fertilisers in order to popularise their use [Niaz (1984) ]. The list of subsidised inputs and the rate structure <b>of</b> the <b>subsidies</b> were expanded considerably throughout the Sixties. Towards the end of the Sixties, it was noted that almost all the agricultural inputs including fertilisers, insecticides, seeds, irrigation water, tubewell installations, and the operation and purchase of tractors and tractor-related equipment were subsidised in one form or another [Aresvik (1967) and Kuhnen (1989) ]. In the 1970 s, some curtailment <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> occurred as a result of input price increases which followed the worldwide recession, a major oil shock, the credit crunch, the war with India, and the consequent steep devaluation of Pakistani Rupee [Chaudhry (1982) ]. Although the subsidies had survived the onslaught of the Seventies and tended to persist on most inputs, the government became totally committed to their removal beginning with the 1980 s, under pressures from the IMF and the World Bank [Government of Pakistan (1980) ]. As a consequence, there was a total withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> from seeds, insecticides, tubewells, and tractors. A phased-out withdrawal <b>of</b> fertiliser <b>subsidy,</b> culminating in 1984 - 85 in the case of nitrogenous fertilisers and in 1989 - 90 in the case of phosphatic and potash fertilisers, was also to be undertaken [World Bank (1986) ]. The purpose of the present paper is to highlight the progress of withdrawal <b>of</b> input <b>subsidies</b> in Pakistan, to study the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the input <b>subsidies</b> and possibly analyse the impact of the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> on the farm sector. Needless to add that the study is also intended to make policy recommendations on the various aspects <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> withdrawal. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{explain why}} in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) - {{especially}} Russia - unemployment has remained low and employment in state and privatized firms has remained high, {{while at the same}} time the informal or unofficial economy has grown swiftly. They trace this development to a combination of factors, including the control regime of state and privatized firms, the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> worker compensation, and privatized firms, and the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> or financial supports that firms continue to receive. Firms have remained the primary site for social protection. Subsidies for social benefits have effectively been a subsidy to employment and have promoted the workers'continuing attachment to these firms. Partly because the subsidies still flow and partly because of the firms'internal control structure, firms have held back on shedding labor. Firms typically work at low capacity. Instead of laying workers off, they significantly cut hours and wages, sometimes through wage arrears. The share of worker compensation that is nonmonetary had grown during the transition, and is significant. So workers search for additional sources of income, either moonlight or get involved in the informal economy. Why has this happened? Privatization has so far failed to keep firms from behaving as if they have important social responsibilities. Managers may have more discretion in decisionmaking, but seem tobe reluctant to fire workers. This reluctance reflects various pressures, including insider coalitions and pressure from local and federal governments to limit the flow to unemployment. One factor may be the need to keep workers cooperative and possibly repel outsider interest. And in the FSU, many firms continue to operate under soft budget constraints, so they are under less pressure to reduce employment levels than firms in Eastern and Central Europe. The authors show that under certain conditions if the subsidy to insider-dominated firms disappears, those firms will scale down employment and the provision of benefits. In a firm with two divisions - one that produces and one that provides benefits - the dominant (producing) division will tend to close down the benefits-providing division if the firm assumes a simple majority decision rule.

40|$|The First Amendment {{speech rights}} of public employees, which have {{traditionally}} enjoyed {{protection under the}} doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, have suddenly diminished in recent years. At one time developed {{to shut the door}} on the infamous privilege/rights distinction, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine has now been increasingly used to rob these employees of their constitutional rights. Three interrelated developments explain this state of affairs. First, a jurisprudential school of thought – the “subsidy school” – has significantly undermined the vitality of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine through its largely successful sparring with an alternative school of thought, the “penalty school. ” Second, although initially developed in the government as sovereign context, this subsidy approach to the unconstitutional conditions doctrine has now infiltrated the government as employer context and eviscerated large parts of the holding in Pickering v. Bd. of Education. Third, and most significantly, the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>subsidy</b> argument in the government as employment context has morphed into the government speech doctrine, through which the government employer claims the speech of its employees as it own and may regulate it willy-nilly. It is this neoformalism <b>of</b> the <b>subsidy</b> school that explains the reemergence of the privilege-right distinction in public employment law. This Article argues for the restoration of Pickering, its constitutional balancing standards, and the penalty version of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.

40|$|Emissions {{trading is}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular in environmental law. Allowances to trade emissions can either be auctioned off or handed out free of charge by means of grandfathering. Although grandfathering is frequently used in emissions trading schemes, it is a popular view in the economic and legal literature that grandfathering is inconsistent with the polluter-pays principle. We come to a different, more nuanced view. The question of whether polluters pay under grandfathering depends on how the polluter-pays principle is interpreted. We present a taxonomy of interpretations. Based on an efficiency interpretation of the principle, consistency is demonstrated by emphasizing {{the economic impact of}} the opportunity costs of gratis allowances and the lump sum <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>subsidy</b> that is inherent to grandfathering. Inconsistency can only be claimed based on an equity interpretation of the polluter-pays principle. Allocating allowances free of charge means that polluting firms receive a capital gift making their shareholders richer, which may be perceived as unfair. We draw two conclusions. First, contrary to what some have claimed, grandfathering is compatible with an efficiency interpretation of the polluter-pays principle. Second, only auctioning is consistent with an extended form of this principle. Auctioning ensures not only that pollution costs are internalized (efficiency), but also that producers buy their allowances before they pass on those costs to consumers (equity). ...|$|R

The analysis <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> development was carried by means of comparing the total amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> and own revenues in relation to the total revenue in the period 1994 - 2007. In addition, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> structure and the analysis of average volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> per unit in the period 2001 - 2007 were used in order to reach the intended objective. The paper is focused in particular on the municipalities of South Bohemia Region. Out {{of the total number of}} 662 municipalities, a representative sample of 179 municipalities was selected where the analysis was performed. The analysis also included all municipalities of the Czech Republic with population higher than 40, 001. The total number of municipalities in the representative sample amounted to 203. The municipalities were classified into eight size categories by population. The public self-administration reform resulted in the fact that revenues from shares and assigned taxes started to flow into the municipal budgets, which contributed to a higher financial and decision-making self-sufficiency of the municipalities. Despite the public administration reform, the volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> still represents a considerable portion of sources of regional budgets. By means of analysing the structure <b>of</b> <b>subsidies,</b> it was ascertained that the share <b>of</b> the claimed <b>subsidies</b> in the total revenues from subsidies was growing with the growing number of population and on the other hand, the share <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> that may not be claimed in the total revenues from subsidies has been declining with the growing population. By means of analysing an average volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> per unit, it was ascertained that the amount <b>of</b> provided claimed <b>subsidies</b> as well as subsidies that may not be claimed grows with the number of population.
