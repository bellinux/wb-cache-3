40|$|Abstract: In Tunisia, globe {{artichoke}} is mainly propagated by underground dormant axillary buds (ovoli), which {{are removed from}} the field in August during the quiescence period. The high cost of in vitro-plants {{and the absence of}} specialized nurseries were among the reasons for the rise of heterogeneity and spread of diseases. The aim was to help farmers to improve artichoke yield and quality by ameliorating their vegetative propagation technique with low cost methods. Three plant cuttings management methods were tested: summer ovoli (T 0); spring offshoots <b>nursery’s</b> <b>cuttings</b> forced to pass a vegetative rest period by stopping irrigation (T 1); and offshoots <b>nursery’s</b> <b>cuttings</b> not forced (T 2). The cuttings management can affect both yield and qualitative traits of artichoke. T 1 nursery plants produced the heaviest primary heads, 7 % and 23 % higher than T 2 and T 0, respectively. T 1 plants exhibited the highest yield during the harvest season, with + 17. 7 % and + 12. 2 % compared to T 0 and T 2, respectively. T 0 and T 1 showed the highest total antioxidant capacity and inulin content; the propagation method also affected the short-chain sugars ratio. T 1 is a viable and sustainable alternative to the traditional one that does not heavily impact on growing costs and improves yield and quality of artichoke...|$|R

However, trunk disease pathogens have been isolated from soaking water, indicating cross contamination. Cuttings of Vitis vinifera cv. Sunmuscat and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris rootstock cv. 140 Ruggeri were immersed in sterilized, deionised water for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 h. The soaking water was cultured (25 °C for 3 days) on non-specific and specific media for fungi and bacteria. The base of each cutting was debarked and trimmed and three 3 mm thick, contiguous, transverse slices of wood cultured at 25 °C for 3 days. The soaking water for both cultivars became contaminated with microorganisms within the first hour. Numbers of fungi isolated from the wood slices soaked for one hour were significantly greater than those from non-soaked cuttings. The number of bacterial colonies growing from the wood slices increased after soaking for 2 - 4 h in Sunmuscat. In a second experiment Shiraz cuttings were soaked for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. The soaking water became contaminated within the first hour but only the bacterial count increased significantly over time. Microorganisms also established on the container surfaces within the first hour although {{there were no significant}} increases over 24 h. These results confirm that soaking cuttings is a potential cause of cross contamination and demonstrate contamination of cuttings occurs after relatively short periods of soaking. Avoiding exposing cuttings to water will reduce the transmission of trunk diseases in propagation. © Firenze University Press.

40|$|The {{crucial point}} for the {{exploitation}} of Mediterranean species for agronomic purposes relies {{on the availability of}} planting material with high physiological quality. As it is known, the plant propagation may be realized by seed or by asexual or vegetative propagation. The latter has an unquestionable advantage for the propagator because it allows obtaining plants that reproduce exactly the genetic and morphological characteristics of the parent plant and, theoretically, it allows to obtain a large number of individuals in a short time. Among the various types of asexual propagation used in the <b>nursery</b> industry, <b>cutting</b> propagation finds the greater application as it is technically easier to run and economically profitable in respect to all possible alternative methods. It would be advantageous to set up such propagation method for Mediterranean shrubs that are difficult-to-root, on the one hand selecting superior genotypes {{and on the other hand}} developing technical strategies for the improvement of donor physiology and the rooting competence. The environmental factors, irradiance above all, but also nutrient and water availability in the substrate for growth, influence the physiological, hormonal and nutritional status of stock plants and may influence the cuttings quality and their rooting ability. The ontogenetic age of cutting may also influence the propagating attitude of the species. As regards myrtle and lentisk, few studies have been done concerning the influence of stock plant physiology on rooting. Crobeddu and Pignatti (2005) studied the rooting results of rejuvenated plants, many other Authors focused on micropropagation but no considerations were done about the physiology of donors. The primary objective of the present research was to enhance the use as ornamental plants of two typical species of the Mediterranean environment, by means of the optimization of nurseries cycles. In particular, the study focused on physiological and morphological features potentially related to adventitious rooting in myrtle and lentisk. The specific objectives aimed at: - Determining the influence of light availability and rejuvenation on the morphological, chemical and ecophysiological features of mature plants - Assessing the eventual influences on rooting - Assessing the influence of intra-specific variability on propagation trials, with the declared aim to look for genotypes offering an economically supportable option to propagate the studied species...|$|R

Recycling of contaminated {{irrigation water}} increases the risk of spreading diseases. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a simple slow sand filtration treatment of irrigation water as a method for eradicating fungal and bacterial pathogens in eucalypt <b>cutting</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Pilot filter units were constructed from PVC pipes containing a 80 cm high layer of sand with grain size varying from 0. 50 to 0. 75 mm, drainage layers of 10 cm of fine gravel (4 mm) followed by a 15 cm layer of coarse gravel (8 mm), connected to a water outlet. The PVC pipe had space for a 150 mm water column above the sand layer and the filter had a flow rate of 100 to 300 L m- 2 h- 1. Eradication of the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, and the fungal pathogens Cylindrocladium candelabrum and Botrytis cinerea through the use of the filter was evaluated. Detection of bacteria in filter-treated irrigation water was performed through the micro drop method followed by PCR of colonies, while fungal pathogens were detected using a castorbean leaf biological bait method. Evaluations were performed daily 35 times for R. solanacearum, 25 times for C. candelabrum and 18 times for B. cinerea during a period of 12 months. After the last evaluation period, samples from various depths of the sand layer in the filters were taken and analyzed for the presence of the plant pathogens. The slow sand filters were able to remove B. cinerea and C. candelabrum spores with 100 % efficiency while eradication of R. solanacearum colonies reached up to 99. 6 %. Colonies of Trichoderma sp. were found predominantly on the all filter layers. The results of this study show that slow sand filters are efficient for recycled water in eucalypt nurseries, especially in eradicating fungal pathogens...|$|R
