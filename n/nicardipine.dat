5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, <b>nicardipine,</b> and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Our {{purpose was}} to compare the safety and {{efficacy}} of {{food and drug administration}} (FDA) recommended dosing of IV <b>nicardipine</b> versus IV labetalol for the management of acute hypertension. Methods Multicenter randomized clinical trial. Eligible patients had 2 systolic blood pressure (SBP) measures &# 8805; 180 mmHg and no contraindications to <b>nicardipine</b> or labetalol. Before randomization, the physician specified a target SBP &# 177; 20 mmHg (the target range: TR). The primary endpoint was the percent of subjects meeting TR during the initial 30 minutes of treatment. Results Of 226 randomized patients, 110 received <b>nicardipine</b> and 116 labetalol. End organ damage preceded treatment in 143 (63. 3 %); 71 <b>nicardipine</b> and 72 labetalol patients. Median initial SBP was 212. 5 (IQR 197, 230) and 212 mmHg (IQR 200, 225) for <b>nicardipine</b> and labetalol patients (P = 0. 68), respectively. Within 30 minutes, <b>nicardipine</b> patients more often reached TR than labetalol (91. 7 vs. 82. 5 %, P = 0. 039). Of 6 BP measures (taken every 5 minutes) during the study period, <b>nicardipine</b> patients had higher rates of five and six instances within TR than labetalol (47. 3 % vs. 32. 8 %, P = 0. 026).

40|$|RATIONALE: Ca(2 +) {{signaling}} {{controls the}} production of T helper (Th) type 2 cytokines known to be deleterious in asthma. Recently, we showed that Ca(2 +) signaling was dihydropyridine (DHP) -sensitive in Th 2 lymphocytes and that the DHP derivate, <b>nicardipine,</b> used {{in the treatment of}} cardiovascular pathologies, prevents Th 2 -dependent B cell polyclonal activation. OBJECTIVES: We tested the effect of <b>nicardipine</b> in experimental allergic asthma. METHODS: BALB/c mice immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) in alum and challenged with intranasal OVA were treated with <b>nicardipine</b> once the Th 2 response, or even airway inflammation, was induced. We also tested the effect of <b>nicardipine</b> in asthma induced by transferring OVA-specific Th 2 cells in BALB/c mice exposed to intranasal OVA. We checked the impact of <b>nicardipine</b> on T-cell responses and airway inflammation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <b>Nicardipine</b> inhibited in vitro Ca(2 +) response in Th 2 cells. In vivo, it impeded the development of Th 2 -mediated airway inflammation and reduced the capacity of lymphocytes from lung-draining lymph nodes to secrete Th 2, but not Th 1, cytokines. <b>Nicardipine</b> did not affect antigen presentation to CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes, nor the initial localization of Th 2 cells into the lungs of mice exposed to intranasal OVA; however, it reduced {{the production of}} type 2 cytokines and the amplification of the Th 2 response in mice with asthma. Conversely, <b>nicardipine</b> had no effect on Th 1 -mediated airway inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Nicardipine</b> improves experimental asthma by impairing Th 2 -dependent inflammation.

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the effect of two calcium antagonists, diltiazem and <b>nicardipine</b> (concentration range: 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 4) M), on the contractile responses to transmural nerve stimulation, exogenous noradrenaline and tyramine in isolated canine saphenous vein rings. Both diltiazem and <b>nicardipine</b> inhibited the contractile response to transmural nerve stimulation in a non-competitive, concentration-dependent manner. At a concentration of 10 (- 4) M, diltiazem and <b>nicardipine</b> inhibited the maximum contractile response to transmural nerve stimulation to 0. 8 +/- 0. 8 % and 20 +/- 10 % of control respectively. Effects of diltiazem and <b>nicardipine</b> (up to 10 (- 4) M) on the contractile response to exogenous noradrenaline were minimal. The only significant difference observed was a 30 % depression of the maximum contractile response with a shift in ED 50 at high concentrations of <b>nicardipine.</b> Diltiazem (up to 10 (- 4) M) had no significant effect on concentration-effect curves for tyramine. <b>Nicardipine</b> inhibited the response to tyramine in a non-competitive manner with the maximum response depressed to 46 % of control at 10 (- 4) M-nicardipine. Release of [3 H]noradrenaline during transmural nerve stimulation was reduced by both calcium antagonists in a concentration-dependent manner. However, release of [3 H]noradrenaline produced by the indirect sympathomimetic agent tyramine was not significantly inhibited by <b>nicardipine.</b> These experiments suggest that the calcium antagonists diltiazem and <b>nicardipine</b> inhibit the contractile response to transmural nerve stimulation in the canine saphenous vein predominantly by inhibiting the release of endogenous noradrenaline.

40|$|The {{interference}} of intraarterial <b>nicardipine,</b> verapamil, and diltiazem {{with the}} forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine was evaluated in hypertensive patients. <b>Nicardipine</b> antagonized the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas verapamil was ineffective, suggesting that functional alpha-adrenergic antagonism may {{participate in the}} vasodilatory and possibly the antihypertensive effect. <b>Nicardipine</b> also blunted the vasoconstriction to lower-body negative pressure and the action of angiotensin II administered intraarterially. Despite a comparable increase in basal forearm flow, verapamil was less potent than <b>nicardipine</b> in inhibiting vasoconstriction after both stimuli. Therefore <b>nicardipine</b> suppressed preferentially regional vascular reactivity, probably by blockade of the influx of extracellular calcium in response to receptor activation, because both alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated. At variance with both <b>nicardipine</b> and verapamil was potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine after the administration of diltiazem. Because intraarterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action and the local vasodilatation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered also with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles.

40|$|ABSTRACT − This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effect of baicalein, an antioxidant, on the bioavailability of <b>nicardipine</b> after orally or intravenously administered <b>nicardipine</b> in rats. <b>Nicardipine</b> was administered orally (12 mg/kg) or intra-venously (4 mg/kg) with or without orally administered baicalein (0. 4, 2 or 10 mg/kg) to rats. In the inhibitory effect of baicalein on CYP 3 A 4 activity, baicalein inhibited CYP 3 A 4 activity with IC 50 values of 9. 2 µM. The cell-based P-gp activity test using rhodamine- 123 also showed that baicalein (30 - 10 µM, p< 0. 01) significantly inhibited P-gp activity. Compared with the control group (given <b>nicardipine</b> alone), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was sig-nificantly (2 mg/kg, P< 0. 05; 10 mg/kg, P< 0. 01) increased by 25. 9 - 60. 0 %, and the peak concentration (Cmax) was sig-nificantly (10 mg/kg, P< 0. 01) increased by 40. 0 % in the presence of baicalein after orally administration of <b>nicardipine.</b> Consequently, the relative bioavailability (R. B.) of <b>nicardipine</b> was increased by 1. 26 - to 1. 60 -fold and the absolute bio-availability (A. B.) was significantly (2 mg/kg, P< 0. 05; 10 mg/kg, P< 0. 01) increased by 26. 0 - 59. 9 %. Compared to the i. v. control, baicalein did not significantly change pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>nicardipine</b> in i. v. administration. Accordingly, the enhanced oral bioavailability of <b>nicardipine</b> might be mainly due to increased intestinal absorption caused by P-gp inhi-bition rather than to reduced elimination of <b>nicardipine</b> by baicalein. The increase in the oral bioavailability might be mainly attributed to enhanced absorption in the small intestine via the inhibition of P-gp and reduced first-pass metabolism of nica-rdipine via the inhibition of the CYP 3 A subfamily in the small intestine and/or in the liver by baicalein.

The animals {{were randomly assigned to}} the following 4 treatment groups: a control group, a verapamil group, a <b>nicardipine</b> group, and a nitroglycerin group. A continuous infusion of verapamil, <b>nicardipine,</b> or nitroglycerin was initiated 5 [*]min prior to ischemia. Infarct size/area at risk decreased in verapamil, and nitroglycerin. The incidence of ischemia-induced arrhythmia decreased in <b>nicardipine,</b> verapamil and nitroglycerin. The incidence of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias decreased in verapamil and nitroglycerin. From the present experimental results, verapamil and nitroglycerin rather than <b>nicardipine</b> did afford significant protection to the heart subjected to ischemia and reperfusion in a rabbit model...|$|E
40|$|A novel calcium entry blocker, <b>nicardipine,</b> {{has been}} tested using a dosage of 20 mg twice a day against placebo on 30 {{patients}} suffering from migraine without aura, according to a double-blind, cross-over design; overall duration {{of the study was}} four months (two with <b>nicardipine</b> and two with placebo). Migraine parameters such as monthly frequency, mean intensity and mean duration of attacks were monitored. Two indexes were also calculated: index A (monthly frequency X mean intensity) and index B (monthly frequency X mean intensity X mean duration). All the parameters considered and the two indexes showed a marked and significant improvement after <b>nicardipine</b> treatment in comparison to both placebo and pre-study scores. Detailed analysis of the cross-over results showed that improve-ment obtained with <b>nicardipine</b> lasted some time after the drug was discontinued. <b>Nicardipine</b> did not alter the blood and attention tests performed and caused few side effects. 0 Calcium entry blockers, migraine, nicardipin...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{determine}} the effectiveness and safety of <b>nicardipine</b> infusion for controlling blood pressure in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: We prospectively evaluated 52 patients with SAH and treated with <b>nicardipine</b> infusion for blood pressure control in a 29 months period. The mean blood pressure of pre-injection, bolus injection and continuous injection period were compared. This study evaluated the effectiveness of <b>nicardipine</b> for each Fisher grade, for different dose of continuous <b>nicardipine</b> infusion, and for the subgroups of systolic blood pressure. Results: The blood pressure measurement showed that the mean systolic blood pressure / diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) in continuous injection pe-riod (120. 9 / 63. 0 mmHg) was significantly lower than pre-injection period (145. 6 / 80. 3 mmHg) and bolus injection period (134. 2 / 71. 3 mmHg), and these were statistically significant (p < 0. 001). In each subgroups of Fisher grade and different dose, SBP/DBP also decreased after the use of <b>nicardipine.</b> Thes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{therapeutic}} effect of <b>nicardipine</b> on diffuse brain injury. Male Wistar adult rats were subjected to a diffuse brain injury. <b>Nicardipine,</b> as a calcium channel blocker was injected intravenously 15 min following induction of injury at doses of 10 or 20 μg kg - 1. Quantitative measurements of water content, as index of brain edema and Evans Blue (EB) content as index of blood brain barrier permeability were determined using standard procedures. The histological examination was done by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the percent of water content between <b>nicardipine</b> treated, trauma alone and trauma + vehicle groups. The content of EB was significantly lower in nicardipine-treated groups in comparison with trauma and trauma + vehicle groups. There was no difference between <b>nicardipine</b> and other groups in histological verification. The present data indicated that <b>nicardipine</b> could have a protective effect on vascular permeability after brain injury...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>nicardipine</b> as the Ca-antagonist in the {{dihydropyridine}} receptor (DHPR) of the transverse (T) tubular voltage sensor (Ca^ channel) were studied in isolated frog skeletal muscle fibers. <b>Nicardipine</b> suppressed the twitch tension about 40 % with repeated tetanic stimulation, and suppressed more than 80 % with repeated applications of high potassium. When caffeine contracture on the <b>nicardipine</b> treated muscle fibers was induced by concentrations of lower than 5 mM caffeine, an inhibitory effect was seen with repeated tetanic stimulation,. On the contrary, an activation effect was {{seen on the}} <b>nicardipine</b> treated muscle fibers with repeated potassium deporalization. However, caffeine contracture with concentrations of more than 5 mM had not the different effects on the both <b>nicardipine</b> treated muscles. These {{results show that the}} voltage sensor in the T-tubular membranes has influence on the Ca-release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with caffeine, and was suggested that the SR membranes has the Ca induced Ca release channels which was inhibited by the voltage sensor on the T-tubles...|$|E
40|$|The {{interference}} by <b>nicardipine</b> and verapamil {{with the}} response to vasoactive stimuli, such as lower body negative pressure and angiotensin II, has been evaluated in the forearm of hypertensive patients. Forearm blood flow was monitored during the intraarterial infusion of either drug at rates equieffective on basal flow. <b>Nicardipine</b> blunted the peak forearm vasoconstrictor action of lower body negative pressure and a comparable result was obtained when angiotensin II was administered intraarterially. In spite of a comparable increase in forearm flow, <b>nicardipine</b> was more potent than verapamil in inhibiting vasoconstriction following both stimuli. Thus, <b>nicardipine</b> suppressed regional vascular reactivity, probably by blockade of the influx of extracellular calcium, in response to receptor activation, since both alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated. However, {{the results of the}} comparison with an unrelated calcium entry blocker, such as verapamil, may suggest that <b>nicardipine,</b> and possibly other dihydropiridine derivatives, preferentially antagonize agonist-mediated vasoconstriction in the human forearm...|$|E
