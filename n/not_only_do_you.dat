5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

2500|$|FIAC started {{holding its}} own BMX World Championships in 1984. At {{the time the}} IBMXF and FIAC were two {{separate}} International sanctioning bodies that both held BMX World Championships. However, the IBMXF's was far more prestigious, professionally competently run and established than FIAC. This was because FIAC refused help from either the IBMXF and the American for profit American Bicycle Association (then as now only one non-profit BMX sanctioning body per nation is recognized by the UCI as representing BMX in a nation. In the United States's case it was and is the NBL), both far more experienced {{at the time in}} running BMX races. In some nations if you race in the IBMXF circuit (see above) you could not race in the FIAC circuit and vice versa, akin to not being allowed to race NBL if you race the ABA circuit if they had such rules in America. FIAC had odd (to Americans) conventions and rules in conducting races, most likely grafted on from road racing in which was FIAC's only experience. For instance <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> race three times to determine average positions in the motos to advance the best four riders to the next stage in racing, something Americans were familiar if they raced NBL, you also, if the class was big enough, raced the eighths, quarters and semis also three times and the best racers qualified for the Main. Then if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> qualify for the Main, you had to race the Main five times to find the final ranking of racers. In the US only the Professionals in the 20" [...] class raced the Main multiple times and only three times at that in either the ABA or NBL. If anything this put a premium on consistency and lowered the luck factor to a bare minimum. However, it was very time consuming even at races scheduled over two days.|$|R

40|$|The Swedish emigrants, in 1901 - 1904, were displeased {{with their}} home country, so {{they moved to}} America with hope {{to find a better}} life. Even though they were displeased they still had a great love for their home country and tried to either create a “new Sweden” (the Swedish-Americans), or they {{traveled}} back to their families, hopefully with savings big enough to buy their own home. Sweden did not have a homestead act like the Americans did, which probably is the biggest reason to the emigration. There was also the question of each individual’s right to vote. When you got American citizenship, you received the right to vote. The right to vote, as a reason to the emigration, was discussed in the Swedish newspaper. Some articles claimed that there were areas in Sweden with little political influence that had a lower emigration rate, in comparison to areas with a larger political influence. However, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> receive the right to vote, but you also get a home for free, thanks to the The Homestead, which later on became a national symbol for Sweden. A little red cottage with a stone wall around the land. The feeling for nationalism grew as this symbol alongside the Swedish national theme came along. There were of course other reasons, such as the strict laws of military service at the age of 20. As the laws got more serious, the emigration got higher.   My purpose behind this thesis was {{to find out what the}} oppinions was from two Swedish newspapers about the great emigration to America that took place between the years of 1901 - 1904. It was two newspapers from each political opposites, and a total of 35 articles was found and used. To make the material manageable, I had to set up a few keywords. That way I could select a few headlines, instead of reading them all. Then I presented the newspapers´ arguments in four kategories. The same four kategories are used to discuss the possibilities and problematics behind the arguments. The point behind this study is to show how the nationalistic arguments are presented in the newspapers...|$|R
