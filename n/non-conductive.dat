5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over <b>non-conductive</b> roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
25|$|The {{floating}} gate may be conductive (typically polysilicon in most kinds of flash memory) or <b>non-conductive</b> (as in SONOS flash memory).|$|E
25|$|A {{capacitor}} {{consists of}} two conductors separated by a <b>non-conductive</b> region. The <b>non-conductive</b> region can either be a vacuum or an electrical insulator material known as a dielectric. Examples of dielectric media are glass, air, paper, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors. A capacitor {{is assumed to be}} self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field. In SI units, a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device.|$|E
25|$|Capacitance sensors use {{principles}} {{associated with}} capacitance {{in order to}} form fingerprint images. In this method of imaging, the sensor array pixels each act as one plate of a parallel-plate capacitor, the dermal layer (which is electrically conductive) acts as the other plate, and the <b>non-conductive</b> epidermal layer acts as a dielectric.|$|E
25|$|Immunity to {{electromagnetic}} interference: Light transmission through {{optical fibers}} is unaffected by other electromagnetic radiation nearby. The optical fiber is electrically <b>non-conductive,</b> {{so it does}} not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals. Information traveling inside the optical fiber is immune to electromagnetic interference, even electromagnetic pulses generated by nuclear devices.|$|E
25|$|Dielectric fluid {{is used as}} {{a cutting}} fluid in {{electrical}} discharge machines (EDMs). It is usually deionized water or a high-flash-point kerosene. Intense heat is generated by the cutting action of the electrode (or wire) and the fluid is used to stabilise the temperature of the workpiece, along with flushing any eroded particles from the immediate work area. The dielectric fluid is <b>non-conductive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Here ε and µ {{denote the}} {{dielectric}} constant and magnetic permeability {{of the medium}} that the conductors are embedded in. There is no electric and no magnetic field inside the conductors (complete skin effect, high frequency). Current flows down on one line and returns on the other. Signals will propagate along the transmission line {{at the speed of}} electromagnetic radiation in the <b>non-conductive</b> medium enveloping the conductors.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most thermoplastics, {{polycarbonate}} can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking. As a result, it can {{be processed}} and formed at room temperature using sheet metal techniques, such as bending on a brake. Even for sharp angle bends with a tight radius, heating may not be necessary. This makes it valuable in prototyping applications where transparent or electrically <b>non-conductive</b> parts are needed, which cannot be made from sheet metal. PMMA/Acrylic, which is similar in appearance to polycarbonate, is brittle and cannot be bent at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the very}} high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the {{electrode}} bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals off the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled; in high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To save costs, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically <b>non-conductive,</b> which, in turn, lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water.|$|E
25|$|ESEM is {{especially}} useful for non-metallic and biological materials because coating with carbon or gold is unnecessary. Uncoated Plastics and Elastomers can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. Coating {{can be difficult}} to reverse, may conceal small features {{on the surface of the}} sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated <b>non-conductive</b> specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where forensic analysis may need to be repeated by several different experts.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of <b>non-conductive</b> specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{macroscopic}} objects contain ions {{distributed throughout}} the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, {{can more or less}} easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as static electricity. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing amber with fur or glass with silk. In this way <b>non-conductive</b> materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of conservation of charge always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|The iPad's (first two generations) {{touchscreen}} {{display is}} a 1024 by 768 pixel, [...] liquid-crystal display (diagonal [...] ), with fingerprint- and scratch-resistant glass. Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be [...] "too small {{to express the}} software" [...] and that 10inches was the minimum for a tablet screen. Like the iPhone, the iPad {{is designed to be}} controlled by bare fingers; normal, <b>non-conductive</b> gloves and styli do not work, although there are special gloves and capacitive styli designed for this use.|$|E
2500|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopes {{operating in}} conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore <b>non-conductive</b> materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible {{the observation of}} <b>non-conductive</b> specimens without coating. [...] <b>Non-conductive</b> materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.|$|E
2500|$|A {{varistor}} remains <b>non-conductive</b> as a shunt-mode device during {{normal operation}} when the voltage across it remains well below its [...] "clamping voltage", thus varistors are typically used for suppressing line voltage surges. Varistors can fail {{for either of}} two reasons.|$|E
2500|$|A {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) {{mechanically}} supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a <b>non-conductive</b> substrate. Components [...] (e.g. capacitors, resistors or active devices) [...] are generally soldered on the PCB. Advanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first step}} is to {{replicate}} the pattern in the fabricator's CAM system on a protective mask on the copper foil PCB layers. [...] Subsequent etching removes the unwanted copper. (Alternatively, a conductive ink can be ink-jetted on a blank (<b>non-conductive)</b> board. This technique is also used in the manufacture of hybrid circuits.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Surface mount {{resistors}} {{have been}} known to fail due to the ingress of sulfur into the internal makeup of the resistor. [...] This sulfur chemically reacts with the silver layer to produce <b>non-conductive</b> silver sulfide. [...] The resistor's impedance goes to infinity. [...] Sulfur resistant and anti-corrosive resistors are sold into automotive, industrial, and military applications. [...] ASTM B809 is an industry standard that tests a part's susceptibility to sulfur.|$|E
2500|$|Newman et al. (2006) {{inserted}} conductive and <b>non-conductive</b> fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a terpolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) [...] ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping {{them on a}} {{small glass}} slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and Kevlar, and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers {{and to some extent}} along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the <b>non-conductive</b> and the conductive fibers.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphoric acid {{fuel cells}} (PAFC) were first {{designed}} and introduced in 1961 by G. V. Elmore and H. A. Tanner. In these cells phosphoric acid {{is used as}} a <b>non-conductive</b> electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode. These cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees Celsius. This high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly. This heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy consuming system. [...] Using this heat in cogeneration can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 40–50% to about 80%. Phosphoric acid, the electrolyte used in PAFCs, is a <b>non-conductive</b> liquid acid which forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit. Since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small, platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate. A key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte. This increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid.|$|E
2500|$|Cascade method: [...] Some EDDs have a platen that is {{hinged on}} one edge to permit {{it to be}} tilted. [...] A mixture of toner and small carrier beads (made of glass or similar <b>non-conductive</b> material) is then poured {{over the surface of}} the {{document}} {{from one side to the}} other. [...] The beads, and excess toner, are captured on the lower edge of the device to be reused. [...] This process can be repeated several times in order to develop all areas of the document.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of surface charge imbalance {{means that the}} objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. [...] This surface charge imbalance, which leads to static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to {{the phenomenon of the}} triboelectric effect. [...] Rubbing two <b>non-conductive</b> objects generates a great amount of static electricity. [...] This is not the result of friction; [...] two <b>non-conductive</b> surfaces can become charged by just being placed {{one on top of the}} other. [...] Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. [...] Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. [...] Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. [...] Some examples of these substances are rubber, plastic, glass, and pith. [...] Conductive objects in contact generate charge imbalance too, but retain the charges only if insulated. [...] The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Note that the {{presence of}} electric current does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the corona discharge, or other phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.|$|E
2500|$|N-type {{inactivation}} {{is typically}} the faster inactivation mechanism, and is termed the [...] "ball and chain" [...] model. N-type inactivation involves {{interaction of the}} N-terminus of the channel, or an associated protein, which interacts with the pore domain and occludes the ion conduction pathway like a [...] "ball". Alternatively, C-type inactivation is thought to occur within the selectivity filter itself, where structural changes within the filter render it <b>non-conductive.</b> There {{are a number of}} structural models of C-type inactivated K+ channel filters, although the precise mechanism remains unclear.|$|E
2500|$|High-purity nickel tubing and cathode {{coatings}} free {{of materials}} that can poison emission (such as silicates and aluminum) {{also contribute to}} long cathode life. The first such [...] "computer tube" [...] was Sylvania's 7AK7 of 1948. Computers were the first tube devices to run tubes at cutoff (enough negative grid voltage to make them cease conduction) for quite-extended periods of time. When their grids became less negative, they failed to conduct. While hot but <b>non-conductive,</b> an insulating layer ("cathode interface") developed between the nickel sleeve and the oxide coating. What was described above cured this problem.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{special-purpose}} {{tubes are}} constructed with particular {{gases in the}} envelope. For instance, voltage-regulator tubes contain various inert gases such as argon, helium or neon, which will ionize at predictable voltages. The thyratron is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube [...] "latches" [...] into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its <b>non-conductive</b> state.|$|E
2500|$|A BS1363 plug has two horizontal, {{rectangular}} pins for [...] and neutral, {{and above}} these pins, a larger, vertical pin for an earth connection. [...] Note, both line and neutral carry current and {{are defined as}} live parts. [...] The earth pin also serves to operate the basic shutter mechanism used in many sockets. [...] Correct polarity is established by {{the position of the}} earth pin relative to the other two pins, ensuring that the [...] pin is connected to the correct terminal in the socket-outlet. [...] Moulded plugs for unearthed, double-insulated appliances may instead have a <b>non-conductive</b> plastic pin (an Insulated Shutter Opening Device or ISOD) the same size and shape as an earth pin, to open the shutters. [...] When looking at the plug pins with the earth uppermost the lower left pin is line, and the lower right is neutral.|$|E
2500|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2) {{extinguisher}} was invented (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in response to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically <b>non-conductive</b> chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in telephone switchboards. It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, cotton covered hose, with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle. CO2 is still popular today as it is an ozone-friendly clean agent and is used heavily in film and television production to extinguish burning stuntmen. [...] Carbon dioxide extinguishes fire mainly by displacing oxygen. It was once thought that it worked by cooling, although this effect on most fires is negligible. This characteristic is well known and {{has led to the}} widespread misuse of carbon dioxide extinguishers to rapidly cool beverages, especially beer.|$|E
