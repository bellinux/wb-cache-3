5|$|Paley {{considers}} {{how some}} structures {{are seen to}} be prepared for future function, like the milk-teeth of a baby, ready formed inside the gums at birth.

5|$|In 1328 Charles IV of France died {{without a}} male heir. Queen Isabella made {{a claim to}} throne of France on behalf of her son Edward {{on the grounds that}} he was a matrilineal {{grandson}} of Philip IV of France. However, the precedents set by Philip V's succession over his niece Joan II of Navarre and Charles IV's succession over his nieces meant that the senior grandson of Philip III in the male line, Phillip of Valois, became king. <b>Not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> power, Edward paid homage to Phillip as Duke of Aquitaine.|$|E
5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing. The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} targeted killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries. He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Tribunal in 1994, only one constitutional reference has been made to it. Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995 arose from the issue of the application of Article 22H(1) of the Constitution in relation to Article 5(2A), which was and is still <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> force. The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to clarify the scope of the application of both Articles. The Government was represented by Chan Sek Keong and Soh Tze Bian of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and the Presidency by Joseph Grimberg and Walter Woon.|$|E

5|$|By December 1941, the M2A1, M2A2 and M2A3 {{were used}} for {{training}} only. The majority of M2A4s, which went to the US Army, were also used only for training between 1940 and 1942. The U.S. Marine Corps ordered M3 Stuart tanks to outfit its armored units in 1940, but as the new tank was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> production, it received 36 M2A4s, after which point production of the M3 had come on line. Many of these tanks were deployed during the Battle of Guadalcanal while assigned to A Company, 1st Tank Battalion, where they and M3 Stuarts were typically spread out among infantry units. Their use was generally limited to providing mobile fire support to the Marines, either in disabling Japanese bunkers or using canister shot against Japanese attacks. In defensive engagements, the M2A4s and Stuarts would deploy in pairs, so they could cover each other with machine gun fire against Japanese soldiers armed with satchel charges.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E
5|$|In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor {{was back}} full-time. West {{averaged}} 27.8points, 7.0rebounds and 5.6assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team; however, {{he played in}} only 55 regular season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 {{in front of their}} home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.|$|E

5|$|On February 4 and 5, Grant landed two {{divisions}} {{just north of}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. (The troops serving under Grant were {{the nucleus of the}} Union's successful Army of the Tennessee, although that name was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> use.) Grant's plan was to advance upon the fort on February 6 while it was being simultaneously attacked by Union gunboats commanded by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. A combination of accurate and effective naval gunfire, heavy rain, and the poor siting of the fort, nearly inundated by rising river waters, caused its commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, to surrender to Foote before the Union Army arrived.|$|E
5|$|Also on Nanking's {{eastern side}} but further south, other {{units of the}} SEA faced the {{difficult}} task of fording the large moat standing between them and three of the city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan's earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> position. That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion of the gate, but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they poured down grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{amendment}} to the Tripartite Pact was <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> force, Hitler chose to declare war on the United States and ordered the Reichstag, along with Italy, to do so on 11 December 1941, {{three days after the}} United States' declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. His hopes that, despite the previous rejections, Japan would reciprocally attack the Soviet Union, were not realized, as Japan stuck to its Nanshin strategy of going south, not north, and would continue to maintain an uneasy peace with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Germany's declaration of war further solidified German–Japanese relations and showed Germany's solidarity with Japan, which was now encouraged to cooperate against the British. To some degree, Japan's actions in South-East Asia and the Pacific in the months after Pearl Harbor, including the sinking of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS Repulse, the occupation of the Crown Colonies of Singapore, Hong Kong, and British Burma, and the air raids on Australia, were a tremendous blow to the United Kingdom's war effort and preoccupied the Allies, shifting British (including Australian) and American assets away from the Battle of the Atlantic and the North African Campaign against Germany to Asia and the Pacific against Japan. In this context, sizeable forces of the British Empire were withdrawn from North Africa to the Pacific theatre with their replacements being only relatively inexperienced and thinly spread divisions. Taking advantage of this situation, Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps successfully attacked only six weeks after Pearl Harbor, eventually pushing the allied lines as far east as El Alamein.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{was briefly}} {{called up to}} the U-21 {{national}} team for a 13-day training camp and four-game tour of Brazil in May. Two of the games were against Brazil's U-21 team and the two others were against Santos FC and Saad FC. Harris {{was one of the}} two players on the roster that were <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>in</b> college. Following the training camp, Harris moved back down to the U-19 team, where {{she was a member of}} the roster for the USYS Cup in late May. Harris started in goal during the first match of the tournament against Canada on May 27 in a 6–1 win. After her appearance in the tournament, Harris once again joined the U-21 team. On July 9, she was named to the 18-player team that would represent the United States at the Nordic Cup in Denmark. She started the team's first match against Denmark on July 21 and recorded a shut out for a 1–0 victory for the United States. She also appeared in the final game of the tournament on July 27 against Sweden. She allowed one goal during the match and the United States won 2–1, taking the Nordic Cup.|$|E
