5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|Hagerstrom {{was then}} sent to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Pinnnelas City Air Base in Florida, flying the Bell P-39 Airacobra and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk with the 20th Pursuit Group. In late September he was posted to the 8th Fighter Squadron (8th FS) of the 49th Operations Group and sent to San Francisco, California. After staying at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, he and forty other {{personnel}} moved on to Fort Mason, where sailed to Hawaii along with 1,500 other soldiers. They did not stay long, however, and set sail again, this time flanked by a naval task force. After an overnight stop at Suva, Fiji, they landed at their destination of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Initially there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and nothing to do until Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, the commander of Fifth Fighter Command, organized a refresher session for the new pilots at Charters Towers Airport. In April1943, he and the P-40-equipped 8th FS relocated to Dobodura Airfield Complex in New Guinea. Shortly thereafter, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E

5|$|Following {{its premiere}} in early September at the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood {{tradition}} of visiting different theaters {{on opening night}} to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers {{did not like the}} film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The film closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.|$|E
25|$|One night Jacob {{climbs up}} and jumps each car, while {{the train is}} moving, to August's room, {{carrying}} a knife between his teeth intending to kill August. However, he backs out, leaving the knife on August's pillow, and returns to his car, only to find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> but Queenie. He then realizes that Walter and Camel were red-lighted, {{and he was also}} supposed to have been.|$|E
25|$|Before his appointment, Radcliffe {{had never}} visited India and knew <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> To the British and the feuding {{politicians}} alike, this neutrality was {{looked upon as}} an asset; he {{was considered to be}} unbiased toward any of the parties, except of course Britain. Only his private secretary, Christopher Beaumont, was familiar with the administration and life in the Punjab. Wanting to preserve the appearance of impartiality, Radcliffe also kept his distance from Viceroy Mountbatten.|$|E

Gang-du finds the creature's sleeping spot but sees <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> As Gang-du climbs down to the hole, the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm hanging out of its mouth and gives chase, meeting Nam-joo on the way. The creature makes its way to the location where Agent Yellow is released and a large crowd has formed in protest.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock {{went down}} to his room to sleep. Three times he heard {{knocks on the door}} only to find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> After finding another cadet drunk, Hitchcock saw Davis head over to room No. 5 where {{thirteen}} cadets were partying. Davis, seeing Hitchcock's arrival, warned the other cadets. The captain entered the room, ordering one of the cadets to open up another cadet's footlocker, but the cadet refused. Hitchcock ordered no more disorder, left the room, and started looking for Thornton around 04:50.|$|E
25|$|Oktar {{posits that}} it is God's mind that {{contains}} and captures all events within itself for all eternity, therefore, Oktar believes that no events or information are ever lost. According to Oktar, if a tree falls in a forest and there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> to hear it: that tree makes a sound, i.e. that event and occurrence is known to and captured by God, and that event remains {{at that point in}} time, and at that point in space for all eternity, preserved within God's book.|$|E

25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
25|$|After a brief reunion, {{they run}} to Granny's to take Anna's hair {{to finish the}} counter spell, but find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there,</b> since Hook has {{captured}} the fairies. The four head to the sheriff's office, where they find Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), David (Josh Dallas), and Neal. Mary Margaret hands Emma {{the keys to the}} jail, and says to lock her and David in separate cells, as they don't want to hurt themselves or anyone else when Ingrid's curse takes effect. Emma reluctantly does so, and takes her baby brother to protect him. Hook comes in, stating that he had to see Emma one last time and the two tearfully kiss goodbye, before Hook leaves to chain himself to a dock at the marina.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, {{a beautifully}} attired Nastassya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are to escort her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastassya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not {{particularly}} surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day, he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him {{to come back to the}} house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastassya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his study.|$|E

500|$|The group {{traveled}} to Orlando, Florida {{to write and}} record {{the remainder of the}} album. A few days after arriving in Orlando, Davis left the band. The remaining members continued work on the album. The band decided to base the album's theme and around Davis' departure. According to Williams, the album's cover art also represented Davis' departure: [...] "The couch with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space." [...] The album's artwork was created by Electric Heat.|$|E
500|$|In a later service {{assessment}} {{done by the}} NWS, it {{was determined}} that the school had taken the appropriate safety precautions to minimize and prevent potential loss of life with the tornado approaching, and the students were indeed in the safest part of the building. However, it was recommended in the assessment that hardened [...] "safe rooms" [...] with enhanced construction should exist, to prevent future disasters in the event of large and violent tornadoes impacting large buildings. A similar tornado on July13, 2004 in Roanoke, Illinois, destroyed an industrial building, yet such rooms were used and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> was seriously injured.|$|E
500|$|About 30 {{minutes after}} D Company had reached Hill 755, an {{estimated}} North Korean battalion launched an attack {{down the slope}} running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The main attack hit Vandygriff's 2nd Platoon just after Vandygriff had set up and loaded his two machine guns. These machine guns {{and the protection of}} the [...] wall on its left enabled D Company to turn back this attack, which left one dead and three wounded in the 2nd Platoon. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks. Having no communication with the 3rd Platoon, Kennedy sent a patrol to its supposed position. The patrol reported back that it could find <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> but had found the platoon's rocket launchers and two light machine guns.|$|E

500|$|Douglas filmed {{the opening}} scene, which is Gekko being {{released}} from Sing Sing maximum-security prison, in Ossining, Westchester County, on September 18. Stone felt that the prison scene was a [...] "key plot element" [...] because there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there</b> to meet Gekko, who returns to society as an outsider. Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world, the director clarified that there is [...] "very little space to do those kind of tricks in this movie" [...] because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis. Filming took place in Fordham University for the classroom scenes on October 10 and 11. In order to shoot a dining scene between LaBeouf and Douglas, Shun Lee West closed for 24 hours so the two could film scenes at the restaurant for the entire day of November 10. Brolin and Stone found extras simply by asking workers, at places like RdV, if {{they would like to}} be a part of the sequel.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{apocryphal}} {{story of}} King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders {{back into the}} pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling {{one of them to}} a position [...] back and [...] to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark [...] "angler". This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he [...] "went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over." [...] He claimed to have [...] "hit the first delivery to cover point but of course there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six." [...] The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale.|$|E
500|$|Mark's other housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), gets in {{from work}} and realises Mark is leaving because of the {{harassment}} he has received due to exposing the corruption within the police force. Mark admits he is going into witness protection and he and Kyle say their goodbyes. Sophie decides to go with Kate and they hurry to meet Mark. At the meeting point, Mark's boss, Duncan Hayes (Paul Ireland), arrives and asks if Mark is ready. He replies that Kate is on her way, as he hands his wallet and phone over. Sophie struggles {{to keep up with}} her sister and tells her to go to Mark, as they can collect her on the way. Kate continues running, just as [...] it starts to rain. Hayes tells Mark that they need to leave, but Mark asks him to wait for a few more minutes. When Kate reaches the meeting point, she finds <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>there.</b> Sophie questions whether Mark changed his mind and Kate runs home to Ramsay Street. She enters Mark's house calling his name and then receives a text message saying [...] "I love you", which Mark sent from Hayes' phone. Kyle comforts Kate while she cries about Mark.|$|E
