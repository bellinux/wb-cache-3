40|$|The future {{creation}} of a region-wide economic agreement in Asia has become the hot issue among trade policymakers in the region. The APEC 2010 Summit Statement clearly states that the members should pursue a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), building on various ongoing regional cooperation formworks including ASEAN+ 3 or + 6 and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This paper considers the path or sequencing towards a future region-wide economic agreement in Asia, both theoretically and empirically. It attempts to streamline the policy arguments on the sequencing issues by clarifying {{the pros and cons}} of various approaches. The paper first presents two possible approaches to a region-wide economic agreement: the consolidation approach and the expansion approach. It then reviews political economy theories on the evolution of economic agreements with regard to four key issues to highlight the differences between the two approaches: (i) negotiation timing, (ii) <b>negotiation</b> <b>format,</b> (iii) broader 2 ̆ 013 deeper trade-off, and (iv) the participation process. The final section of the paper analyzes and considers three existing economic agreements 2 ̆ 014 ASEAN+ 103 free trade agreements, the TPP, and the Asia 2 ̆ 013 Pacific Trade Agreement 2 ̆ 014 that have the potential to be the basis of a future region-wide economic agreement...|$|E
40|$|From a {{technical}} perspective, the Web is a distributed information architecture {{that is based}} on the concepts of interaction (HTTP), format (HTML/RDF) and identification (URI) [5]. "Browsing", "navigating" and "information discovery" are the kinds of generic activities that web developers and information scientists concern themselves with, but the more common labels adopted by users to describe their online activities are Social Networking, Internet Video, Blogging, Online Banking, Open Source Develop-ment, Internet Porn, E-research and Internet Shopping. Specialist kinds of interaction (shopping baskets, playlists, blogrolls) are recognizable in all these activities, even though users may be simply "navigating web pages". Those web engineers and content providers building on the Web to provide Internet Shopping (e-commerce, b 2 b, secure financial transactions, product databases, stock control, warehouses and delivery) have different concerns to those dealing with Internet Video (rights acquisition, media streaming, content licensing, bandwidth <b>negotiation,</b> <b>format</b> transformation). Following the socio-technical perspective described by Law [7], we can see the Web as a loose affiliation of semi-independent content networks (each a web in its own right) with their own practices, technologies, business models and ecology of producers and consumers. The Web is a network of networks of stakeholders mutually reinforced and stabilized by each others’ success and by W 3 C standards and policies. Innovation in the WWW occurs either through making improvements within an existing network (better ways of delivering Internet TV, for example) or by the creation of an entirely new web of activity to supplement the existing Web. Berners-Lee describes this process as ‘magic’[1]; this paper identifies a recent Web innovation, analyses the quantitative evidence of its adoption and models the processes involved in its development {{in order to understand the}} magic of the web and to improve its chances of sustainability...|$|E

50|$|An {{advantage}} of active mechanisms {{is that the}} data {{can be converted to}} a different format before the transfer. In particular, the client receiving the data can request the selection data to be converted into a suitable form. If the sending client refuses to do so, the receiver can request a different format. For example, a piece of text rendering HTML code can be transferred as text to a requester that can only handle text, but can also be transferred as HTML code if the requester can handle it. Such <b>negotiation</b> of <b>format</b> cannot be done by passive mechanisms, in which the client holding the selection (and giving it semantics) transfers the selection and is not involved in the further transfer into a client requesting it.|$|R

Opinions are offered on the likely outcome of current FITS negotiations, such as the year- 2000 problem and the WCS proposal, and on possible subjects of future data interchange <b>format</b> <b>negotiations</b> in astronomy. BINTABLE schemas in third-normal-form are advocated. The long-term importance of the BINTABLE format as a platform for future layered-convention agreements is stressed. 1. On the Philosophy of FITS (Lessons-learned) FITS [Flexible Image Transport System] provides a common canonical language for talking about astronomical data structures and, as such, it has a profound positive influence on software design practice in astronomy. By negotiating FITS as a family of similar data formats, Basic-FITS (1979), random-groups (1980), generalized extensions (1983), TABLE (1984), BINTABLE (1991) and IMAGE (1992), we have minimized the negotiation, documentation and training costs for ou...|$|R

It explores the role of Personality, Decision-Making Style, Coping Style, Cognitive Coping Style and Emotion Regulation and Emotional Intelligence within high stress environments and occupations. The findings suggest that certain individual traits and characteristics {{may play a role in}} negotiator success, via the mediation of specific styles, which are conducive to effective crisis negotiation skills. It is proposed that these findings have application within the field of hostage/crisis <b>negotiation</b> in the <b>format</b> of guidance regarding the recruitment and selection of hostage negotiators and the identification of potential training needs within individual negotiators in order to maximise their efficacy within the field. In line with this, it is argued that a psychometric tool that assesses these constructs is developed in order to aid the process of hostage negotiation selection...|$|R

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of the abbreviated term sheet format is, first, that it expedites the process. Experienced counsel immediately know generally what is meant when the term sheet specifies [...] "one demand registration at the issuer's expense, unlimited piggybacks at the issuer's expense, weighted average antidilution"; it saves time {{not to have to}} spell out the long-form edition of those references. Second, since the term sheet does not propose to be an agreement of any sort, it is less likely that a court will find unexpected promissory content; a [...] "letter of intent" [...] can be a dangerous document unless it specifies very clearly, as it should, which portions are meant to be binding and which merely guide the discussion and drafting. Some portions of a term sheet can have binding effect, of course, if and to the extent an interlocutory memorialization is needed of some binding promises, that is, confidentiality of the disclosures made in the <b>negotiation.</b> The summary <b>format</b> of a term sheet, however, makes it less likely that any party will be misled into thinking that some form of enforceable agreement has been memorialized when it has not.|$|R
40|$|The goal of UNESKOS {{project is}} to {{represent}} the International Standard Nomenclature for fields of Science and Technology and the UNESCO Thesaurus. These vocabularies are provided as RDF datasets with an appropriate structure for access and reuse the contained data, applying the Linked Open Data principles. The representation of these vocabularies has been developed using SKOS. The modeling of the Nomenclature is simple. However, the Thesaurus needs a more complex structure because it is organized into several knowledge domains and micro-thesauri. The queries to the Thesaurus and the Nomenclature can be done through a multilingual website that allows searching (for preferred and alternative labels) and browsing the structure of semantic relationships. Categories and concepts are identified by a derreferenciable URI with content <b>negotiation</b> in multiple <b>formats.</b> There is a SPARQL endpoint to query and retrieval RDF data. SKOS has proven suitable for representing simple vocabularies like the nomenclature, and in more complex cases such as the UNESCO Thesaurus. In this case has been identified the need to define elements that complement SKOS in a future versión of the Thesaurus. The obtained modelling is easily compatible {{with the development of}} a clear and simple query interface. The publication, under the principles of Linked Open Data, provides an simple and flexible reuse of RDF data and enables the development of future projects like the alignment with other vocabularies using mapping relationships...|$|R
40|$|Different {{cultures}} employ different conflict styles. Drawing on {{the dual}} concern model, {{this study investigated}} the differences and similarities in Canadian and Chinese conflict management styles using student samples on multiple negotiation simulations. Results show that both Canadian students and Chinese students prefer compromising and avoiding styles. Moreover, the Chinese {{are more likely to}} use avoiding approach and demonstrate higher level of integrativeness during business negotiation and Canadians are more like to use compromising approach and show higher level of distributiveness in negotiation. Reasons for these differences are explored and the impact of different styles on negotiation behaviors and outcomes are then examined using regression analysis. Because conflict is a culturally defined event (Hocker and Wilmot, 1991), conflict management styles should differ across cultures. With the increasingly globalized world economy, cross-cultural comparison of conflict and conflict management has received more and more attention from both academics and practitioners, and a comprehensive examination of conflict management across different cultures is in great need. In this paper I will therefore examine the influences of cultural factors on conflict handling preferences in two different countries — Canada and China, one from the West and one from the East. Data will be generated using 3 different contextually rich simulations of business <b>negotiation,</b> a popular <b>format</b> of conflict resolution, to explore the general conflict styles across situations and to compare the differences between Canadian and Chinese conflict management styles...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has become}} a prominent paradigm to offer on-demand services for softwares, infrastructures and platforms. Cloud services are contracted by a service level agreement (SLA) between a cloud service provider (CSP) and a cloud service user (CSU) which contains service definitions, quality of service (QoS) parameters, guarantees and obligations. Cloud service providers mostly offer SLAs in descriptive format which is not directly consumable by a machine or a system. The SLA written in natural language may impede the utility of rapid elasticity in a cloud service. Manual management of SLAs with growing usage of cloud services can be a challenging, erroneous and tedious task especially for the CSUs acquiring multiple cloud services. The necessity of automating the complete SLA life cycle (which includes SLA description in machine readable <b>format,</b> <b>negotiation,</b> monitoring and management) becomes imminent due to complex requirements for the precise measurement of QoS parameters. Current approaches toward automating the complete SLA life cycle, lack in standardization, completeness and applicability to cloud services. Automation of different phases of the SLA life cycle (e. g. negotiation, monitoring and management) {{is dependent on the}} availability of a machine readable SLA. In this work, a structural specification for the SLAs in cloud computing (S 3 LACC in short) is presented which is designed specifically for cloud services, covers complete SLA life cycle and conforms with the available standards. A time efficient SLA negotiation technique is accomplished (based on the S 3 LACC) for concurrently negotiating with multiple CSPs. After successful negotiation process, next leading task in the SLA life cycle is to monitor the cloud services for ensuring the quality of service according to the agreed SLA. A distributed monitoring approach for the cloud SLAs is presented, in this work, which is suitable for services being used at single or multiple locations. The proposed approach reduces the number of communications of SLA violations to a monitoring coordinator by eliminating the unnecessary communications. The presented work on the complete SLA life cycle automation is evaluated and validated with the help of use cases, experiments and simulations...|$|R
40|$|By {{conducting}} this theory-based empirical study, {{gathering data}} from working negotiators in the US and Canada, I have determined what primary dynamic activities, communication skills, and negotiation tools {{are used by}} hostage/crisis negotiators. Negotiators implement their negotiation and decision strategies differently {{depending on whether the}} situations they deal with are instrumental or expressive. I have determined which elements of negotiations and factors affecting negotiations differ while handling instrumental and expressive hostage situations. I found that the collected data did not reveal any significant relationship between handling instrumental/expressive hostage situations differently and belief in the elements of Brenda Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's theories. I have also determined that the belief in the elements of the Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's theories is workable and practical for negotiators to use. Based on the above findings, the model suggested by this research adds the elements and directives of Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's models to the common approach used by the negotiators. This revised model suggests that the negotiators pay attention to the dynamics of the interactions presented between the two parties: the negotiators themselves and hostage takers. The revised model also recommends that the negotiators focus on not only the hostage takers behavioral characteristics, psychological conditions, and criminal history but also on the meaning of the sent message and the interaction itself as performed between the two parties. This perspective enables the negotiators to look at the negotiation process as information and communication process. We are not ignoring the fact that hostage <b>negotiation</b> is a <b>format</b> of extreme information management. By looking at such an extreme case, we can add to our understanding of Dervin's and Shannon-Weaver's perspectives in order to see the hostage negotiation process from a wider perspective. The revised model is not an alternative approach to the common approach most negotiators use. Instead, the revised model uses the perspective and directives of the common approach and extends its meaning and content by also focusing on Dervin's sense making theory and Shannon-Weaver's communication model perspectives. The use of the perspective of this revised model is one more tool for the negotiators to use in order to promote new ways of looking at hostage negotiation resolutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] of the ISEM 2011 Proceedings, Stellenbosch, South Africa, 21 - 23 September 2011. Conference theme - Innovative Systems Thinking: Unravelling Complexity for Successful SolutionsIn a recent SAIIE conference paper it was suggested to use xAP protocol in the telemedicine environment. Telemedicine has since been described to evolve into eHealth where the focus is {{not only on the}} remote control of health systems, but now also includes local control. This wider scope is necessary to allow seamless communication amongst systems, irrespective to whether they are in the same room or in a remote location. Local communication is via intranet with a higher data transport rate than internet. Larger data packages can be transported than economical on the internet. This research proposes a framework using a xAP datagram instead of sending the complete data package. It will only broadcast the availability of a data package to both local and remote systems. The bulk content can then be requested for download to local and remote systems either in compressed or uncompressed format. The xAP datagram carries information on the formats that the bulk data can be downloaded in. Intelligence at the retriever would decide which format to download. The compression format can be negotiated at download time. Protocols utilized are UDP for xAP broadcasting and TCP for bulk data retrieval. Scope: It {{is important to note that}} this research is on the efficacy of a datagram to broadcast data availability announcements and not on the design of a database. Also that data retrieval via TCP is not considered as it is used for bulk content retrieval after the announcement and only when an internet link is available. Lastly the bulk content download <b>format</b> <b>negotiation</b> is already available by others, usually “APP” developers of smart devices or similar.
