5|$|Since that time, most US space {{exploration}} {{efforts have been}} led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing {{the development of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.|$|E
5|$|The current Acting Administrator of <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr.. Until January 20, 2017, the Administrator of NASA was Charles Bolden. His {{nomination}} was announced on May 24, 2009 by President Barack Obama, {{and he was}} formally appointed upon successful confirmation by the United States Senate on July 15, 2009. He started his position on July 17, 2009. Also until January 20, 2017, Dava Newman was the Deputy Administrator. Her {{nomination was}} announced on October 17, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun {{provides an opportunity for}} study that will not occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046. Sedna would be 77.27 or 76.43AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E

25|$|Once its {{planetary}} mission was over, Voyager 2 {{was described as}} working on an interstellar mission, which <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> using {{to find out what}} the Solar System is like beyond the heliosphere.

25|$|<b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> {{developing}} a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator {{in which the}} thermocouples would be made of skutterudite, which can function with a smaller temperature difference than the current tellurium designs. This would mean that an otherwise similar RTG would generate 25% more power {{at the beginning of}} a mission and at least 50% more after seventeen years. NASA hopes to use the design on the next New Frontiers mission.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{may exist}} in {{relatively}} large amounts in far-away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial {{time of the}} universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, {{are expected to have}} the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal-matter galaxies, and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish. <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for X-ray and gamma-ray signatures of annihilation events in colliding superclusters.|$|E

The Institute’s User Panel is an advisory board composed of former and current astronauts and flight surgeons that ensures NSBRI’s research program is focused on astronaut health and safety. In preparation for lunar and Mars exploration, Chiao and the User Panel will help align NSBRI’s science and technology projects with the needs of astronauts on long missions.|$|E

25|$|The Centers for Disease Control {{demonstrated}} {{the importance of}} vaccinations on the popular children's site Whyville and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a virtual island on Second Life where people can explore underground caves or explore the effects of global warming. Likewise, NASA has taken advantage of a few social networking tools, including Twitter and Flickr.

500|$|... "Deep Space Homer" [...] is {{the fifteenth}} episode of The Simpsons fifth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on February 24, 1994. In the episode, <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> concerned by the decline in public interest in space exploration, and therefore decides to send an ordinary person into space. Homer is selected and chaos ensues when the navigation system on his space shuttle is destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{approached}} by Michelle Generoo (Susanna Thompson), a communications commander for NASA's Mission Control.

500|$|On July 20, 2009, {{the crew}} of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.

[...] "We want to make sure that <b>NASA</b> <b>is</b> going to be there for them when they want to take their journey." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{accusation}} frequently made by websites {{predicting the}} collision {{is that the}} U.S. government built the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to track Nibiru's trajectory, and that the object has been imaged optically. However, the SPT (which is not funded by <b>NASA)</b> <b>is</b> a radio telescope, and cannot take optical images. Its South Pole location was chosen due to the low-humidity environment, {{and there is no}} way an approaching object could be seen only from the South Pole. The [...] "picture" [...] of Nibiru posted on YouTube was revealed, in fact, to be a Hubble image of the expanding light echo around the star V838 Mon.|$|E
500|$|The season five episode [...] "Deep Space Homer", {{in which}} the {{characters}} Homer and Barney are recruited by <b>NASA,</b> <b>is</b> Mirkin's first writing credit on The Simpsons, the second being [...] "The Man Who Came to Be Dinner", which was co-written with Al Jean. Mirkin worked on the concept for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project scheme to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. The idea proved controversial {{to some of the}} show's writing staff, who felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] an idea. Series creator Matt Groening felt that the idea gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Based on these attitudes, several jokes were toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including the impression that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. During re-writes, Mirkin and the other writers placed greater emphasis on the relationship between Homer and his family and on Homer's attempts to be a hero, but most of Mirkin's original script was retained. The episode {{is considered one of the}} show's best. Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine named it a [...] "contender for greatest ever episode", and in Chris Turner's book, Planet Simpson, he says the episode is [...] "second to none". Regarding the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman's dramatic speech, Turner claimed that it was [...] "simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television". A copy of the episode was later sent to the International Space Station for astronauts to view. Mirkin considers the episode to be [...] "very very special". Ortved says the episode, in its plot and surreal humor, epitomizes Mirkin's era.|$|E
40|$|The stuck fault {{detection}} {{efficiency of the}} test vectors developed for the MIL-M- 38510 / 470 <b>NASA</b> <b>was</b> measured using a hardware stuck fault simulator for the 1802 microprocessor. Thirty-nine stuck faults were not detected {{out of a total}} of 874 injected into the combinatorial and sequential parts of the microprocessor. Since undetected faults can create catastrophic errors in equipment designed for high reliability applications, it is recommended that the MIL-M- 38510 / 470 <b>NASA</b> <b>be</b> enhanced with additional test vectors so as to achieve 100 % stuck {{fault detection}} efficiency...|$|R
