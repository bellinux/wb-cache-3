5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> {{men with}} {{political}} ambitions {{fought in the}} Black Hawk War. At least seven future U.S. Senators took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the Wisconsin Territory; and one future U.S. president. The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the Mounted Ranger Battalion {{under the command of}} Henry Dodge, which was expanded to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1833.|$|E

5|$|In his post-war memoirs, Kesselring {{claimed he}} envisioned making a {{start on the}} {{rehabilitation}} of Germany {{following the end of}} the war. Instead, he was arrested. On 15 May 1945, Kesselring was taken to Mondorf-les-Bains where his baton and decorations were taken from him and he was incarcerated. He was held in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> POW camps before being transferred to British custody in 1946. He testified at the Nuremberg trial of Hermann Göring, but his offers to testify against Soviet, American, and British commanders were declined.|$|E
5|$|On 18 October, the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment {{prepared}} to assault the Hotel Quellenhof, {{which was one}} of the last areas of resistance in the city. American tanks and other guns were firing on the hotel, which was the city's defense headquarters, at point blank range. That night, 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building. A furious German counterattack managed to overrun a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> infantry positions outside of the hotel, and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American mortar fire.|$|E

5|$|The border war {{escalated}} in 1777 after British {{officials in}} Detroit began recruiting and arming Indian war parties to raid the frontier American settlements. An unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> settlers in present Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania were killed during these raids. The {{intensity of the}} conflict increased in November 1777, after enraged American militiamen murdered Cornstalk, the leading advocate of Shawnee neutrality. Despite the violence, many Ohio Indians still hoped {{to stay out of}} the war, which proved difficult because they were located directly between the British in Detroit and the Americans along the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player has to allocate a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> troops in order to establish a beachhead on one of the six beaches of the island. However, many of the beaches are scattered with land mines and may provide an initial disadvantage to the assault. Throughout the game, the player may call in air strikes and other assaults, however they are only available after the American forces are attacked or if the enemy retreats to an inaccessible location. At any time in the game, the player is also able to request troop reinforcements from the fleet. Furthermore, Japanese air forces may sink American battleships throughout the game, although the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} shoot them down. In addition, a Japanese submarine will sink American gunboats at random intervals, and cannot be destroyed in any way. There is no save function in the game.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{credited}} with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> football innovations. He was the first coach to use game film to scout opponents, hire a full-time staff of assistants, and test players on their knowledge of a playbook. He invented the modern face mask, the taxi squad and the draw play. He {{also played a role}} in breaking professional football's color barrier, bringing some of the first African-Americans to play pro football in the modern era onto his teams. Despite these accomplishments, Brown was not universally liked. He was strict and controlling, which often brought him into conflict with players who wanted a greater say in play-calling. These disputes, combined with Brown's failure to consult Modell on major personnel decisions, led to his firing as the Browns' coach in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} the diminishing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|Irvine {{added to}} his tally with home and away goals against Halifax Town, where he {{would go on to}} play the next season, and a strike against Aston Villa that was named as runner-up in a Goal of the Season {{competition}} by television programme Match of the Day. With the forward partnership of Irvine and Kit Napier, Brighton performed better than expected in the 1971–72 season. At the end of the campaign, following a 1–1 draw with Rochdale the team was promoted to the Second Division, after finishing as runners-up behind Aston Villa. Irvine continued to score in a higher division, netting five times in the first eleven matches of the season. However, he was then dropped from the team and never regained his place in the starting line-up. Several clubs became interested in his services, including West Ham United, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> teams, and Scottish side Heart of Midlothian, where Bobby Seith was the manager. Irvine played his last match for Brighton on 18 November 1972, when the team lost 0–1 at home to his former club Burnley.|$|E
5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began {{to limit the number}} of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout the night. As the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{during the}} {{operation}} approximately 4,000 men {{and more than}} 600tons of equipment and supplies were dropped by the Americans at Sukchon and Sunchon on 20 October and the days that followed, including twelve 105mm howitzers, 39 jeeps, 38 1/4-ton trailers, four 90mm antiaircraft guns, four 3/4-ton trucks, as well as ammunition, fuel, water, rations, and other supplies. Although sound in concept, the operation may have had more chance of success had a complete airborne division been employed. The following morning US 1/187 RCT captured the high ground north of Sukchon and established a blocking position on the main highway running north. However, strong North Korean rearguard forces held the next line of hills to the north. While at Sunchon, American troops from US 2/187 RCT had heard reports that a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> prisoners had been murdered nearby by their North Korean captors as the KPA retreated. It {{became apparent that the}} train carrying the prisoners north from Pyongyang had halted in a railway tunnel on the 20th to conceal itself as US 187 RCT jumped into the area, and that while there, many of the men aboard had been shot by the North Korean soldiers guarding them as they waited for their evening meal. Sixty-six bodies were later recovered, {{as well as those of}} seven more who were found to have died of disease or malnutrition. Twenty-three starving and emaciated American survivors were found nearby; however, many were badly wounded and two later died. The American paratroopers were subsequently ordered to return to Pyongyang.|$|E

5|$|The trio {{were joined}} by General Trần Thiện Khiêm, the disaffected {{commander}} of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon, {{and an assortment of}} Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers and their units. Other notable recruits were Diem loyalist and former chief of the Civil Guard, Duong Ngoc Lam, who was under investigation for corruption, and General Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris. The cabal scheduled the coup for 04:00, 30 January. On 29 January, Thi followed Khánh to the capital. The plotters and their agents met in obscure locations spots around town. On the night of 29 January, the rebel troops assumed their positions around Saigon. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 2:00. At 03:00, Khánh took over the Joint General Staff Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, and by dawn, the coup had succeeded without a shot being fired as Minh's junta was caught unaware. The popular Minh was allowed to stay on as a ceremonial but powerless head of state, but his colleagues were taken into custody. Nevertheless, Minh remained disgruntled and persistently tried to regain his influence through political means. On 2 February 1964, Thi was appointed to be commander of the 1st Division based in Huế, as part of I Corps. He stayed in the post until 21 October and on 14 November, he took control of the entire corps. This corps oversaw the five northernmost provinces of central Vietnam and the 1st and 2nd Divisions.|$|E
