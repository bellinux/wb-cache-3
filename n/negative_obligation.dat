40|$|Abstract: The {{complexity}} {{indicated in}} the title of this paper does not refer purely to the internal structure of the prohibition of torture, but also to the obligations of States party to the ECHR that are tied to this prohibition. This is because it is not restricted to <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> understood as a duty {{on the part of the}} State to abstain from certain interferences by the public authorities and which was the fundamental purpose of the ECHR and as such was entered explicit into the normative structure of the freedoms and rights defined in the ECHR, but embraces – firstly – positive obligations which result in a command to take measures for the purpose of ensuring freedom from the said torture for persons under the jurisdiction of States that are party to the ECHR, both in horizontal and vertical relations, and – secondly – a procedural obligations which, year by year, is achieving an ever more autonomous position among the types of commitment resulting from the ECHR for States and the essence of which is the effective clarification of circumstances in the violation of the prohibition of torture.

40|$|The {{right to}} life is {{essentially}} {{bound up with the}} darkest – and perhaps most disturbing – sides of prison: use of force, violent deaths and suicides, and the need for swift medical aid in the event of injury after violence or malady in prison. With regard to the {{right to life}}, the state applies two categories of obligations. Firstly, the state has <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> that can be drawn directly from the wording of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under the <b>negative</b> <b>obligations,</b> the state must refrain from doing things that would endanger a prisoner’s life; for example, it must not employ non-proportional force. Secondly, the state has several positive obligations, not enumerated in Article 2. Under the positive obligations, it is not enough for the state to be passive and not violate the right to life; the state also has to take actions, such as establishing suicide prevention mechanisms in prisons. In addition, the positive obligations are more complex, because they include additional subcategories of duties, among them material and procedural obligations. Since the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights is vast and the principles scattered across numerous judgements, the aim behind the article is to build a clear conceptualisation covering the various aspects of this fundamental right...|$|R
50|$|This {{constitutes}} the <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> {{of the state}} under the convention. The states must under article 2 refrain from any random deprivation of life. This article however offers states a few exceptions to that rule. This constitutes a license to use force and {{is not to be}} construed as a license to kill.|$|E
50|$|Thus a thief {{may have}} a <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> not to steal, and a police officer {{may have a}} <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> not to tackle people - but a police officer {{tackling}} the thief easily meets {{the burden of proof}} that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill - being universally {{regarded as one of the}} highest, if not the highest obligation - is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.|$|E
50|$|Freedom of {{expression}} refers back to individual journalists', {{as well as}} to press institutions' rights. In other words, its significance covers both the individual right of each journalist to express his or her opinion and the press' right as an institution to inform people. To guarantee the protection of free media, state authorities not only underlie the <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> to abstain from intrusion, but as well to the positive commitment to promote media freedom and act as a guarantor against intrusion of public as well as private actors.|$|E
5000|$|Ordinary breach (or {{positive}} malperformance) {{relates to}} the content {{and quality of the}} performance made. In the formulation of AJ Kerr, [...] "If without lawful excuse a party fails to do what he has contracted to do, or does what he has contracted not to do, an ordinary breach of contract is said to have occurred." [...] This is breach in its starkest, most commonsensical form: essentially a failure to comply with the terms of a contract. All terms are susceptible to breach; in other words, both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> can be breached.|$|R
40|$|Can {{absolute}} rights conflict? Is it permissible {{to torture}} {{a person to}} save others from torture? And what can judges learn from trolleys? In this article, presented as a reply to an article by Steven Greer, I investigate the above questions {{in the context of}} the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Drawing on Gäfgen v Germany, I construct a hypothetical case of conflicting absolute rights, which cannot be resolved by the existing strands of legal reasoning in the case law of the Court. Instead, I argue, recourse must be had to moral reasoning. In discussing one of moral philosophy’s deepest conundrums—the Trolley Problem—I rely on the distinction between <b>negative</b> and positive <b>obligations</b> and between direct and indirect agency to unravel the dilemma. Translating the moral argument into legal reasoning, I conclude that in cases of conflicts between absolute rights, <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> principally trump positive obligations...|$|R

5000|$|Easements are {{distinct}} from restrictive covenants {{and the court}} will not allow {{the creation of an}} easement where the right is in substance a restrictive covenant. Showing a restrictive covenant exists requires demonstrating different criteria are met and a restrictive covenant operates only in equity and not at the common law, whereas an easement can operate at either.

50|$|A {{claim for}} {{specific}} performance {{is the primary}} and obvious and most basic remedy for breach of contract, upholding as it does the expectation interest of the creditor: When one enters into a contract, one expects performance in terms of it.

A claim for specific performance may be for the payment of a sum of money (ad pecuniam solvendum), a claim {{for the performance of}} some positive act other than payment of money (ad factum praestandum) or a claim to enforce a <b>negative</b> <b>obligation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Rights {{are often}} spoken of as {{inalienable}} {{and sometimes even}} absolute. However, in practice this is often taken as graded absolutism; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted {{in the course of}} preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: self-defense. Certain widely accepted <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered prima facie, meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted [...] "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.|$|R
30|$|Campbell {{stated that}} {{universal}} bioethics {{is supported by}} three central pillars, namely informed consent, medical confidentiality, and the prohibition of fraud or deception (Campbell, 2013). The first two principles are derived from the principle of respect for autonomy. Beauchamp and Childress bear a meaning of autonomous action as intentionally, understanding, and free of control (voluntariness) without influence, coercion, and manipulation. Autonomy is a personal right which entails that other people {{have an obligation to}} respect it. Medically, physicians have positive <b>obligations</b> and <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> to their patients. The former are the obligations to provide information to others which foster autonomous decision making, known as informed consent, while the latter are the obligation not to interfere with others, to respect their right to privacy which is recognised in part as confidentiality (Beauchamp & Childress, 2013).|$|R
5000|$|From this article, two {{obligations}} arise on {{the part}} of the state: firstly, the <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> to refrain from interfering with an individuals right to life arises; secondly, the positive obligation to protect it said rights. Some cases establish further obligations for states; for instance, LCB v UK establishes a positive obligation for states to take [...] "appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within their jurisdiction." [...] Likewise, Makaratzis v Greece pushes these obligations further, so that the state must have mechanisms to deter offenses against people. This was initially applied to the use of firearms; although the court recognized the defensive benefits in gun ownership, it found a much larger threat in unchecked gun use.|$|E
50|$|In either case, a {{third-party}} contract differs from agency {{in that the}} promisee acts in his own name and for himself, whereas an agent or representative does not. It is also distinguishable from a promesse de porte-fort under which the third party has a <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> to perform and, by expressing his consent, initially substitutes himself for an intended {{party to a contract}} and therefore binds himself. Also, as a somewhat distinct rule, the intended beneficiary of {{a third-party}} contract {{does not need to be}} in existence at the time the contract is concluded. This means a contract may benefit an unborn person (usually a family member) or secure benefits for a legal person, such as a company, still in the process of forming or registering.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{obligations}} confer duty. But as we {{see with}} the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered prima facie. The greatest <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> may have just one exception - one higher obligation of self-defense - but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically {{in the case of}} triage after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably prima facie. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably prima facie they must always be agreed to through contract.|$|E
40|$|Trafficking {{in persons}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing illegal {{activities}} in the world today. This situation has provoked the necessity among the international community to create normative definitions in order to address this crime. In this context, the adjudicatory bodies regarding violations of human right related to trafficking are exclusively located at the regional and local level. However, the state’s positive and <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> towards victims of human trafficking should be address through the judicial application of the norms established by the Protocol and local legislation. Therefore the following questions can be formulated: 1. How effective has the monitoring process for the implementation of the Palermo Protocol been in the case of Peru? 2. Are there better forms of monitoring the states parties in order to comply with their human rights obligations? The thesis comprises some interviews to key actors, both public and private. The present thesis wants to give practical recommendations to improve monitoring human trafficking response in Peru...|$|R
40|$|The UN Independent Expert on the Right to Development {{has argued}} that ‘Development Compacts’ {{clarifying}} the international obligations of national states and other actors (including other states and international organisations) {{in the field of}} development and human rights can be conceptualised as an extension of Sen’s “capability approach”, with particular reference to the concept of “imperfect obligation”.

Analytical complexities posed by the concept of “imperfect obligation ” are considered and the need to supplement Sen’s “capability framework ” with principles and procedures for apportioning specific duties to particular duty-holders is explained.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{obligation}} criminal (Pflichtdelikte) was first proposed by Professor Roxin, but the crime nature of the obligation criminal is still being largely disputed in the criminal law theory circle, and someone {{thought it was the}} legal interest violation, and others thought it was the violation of positive obligation which has been recognized by the criminal law. As viewed from the obligation, the criminal law regulates two obligations, i. e. the positive obligation and the <b>negative</b> <b>obligation,</b> and the former is embodied in the obligation of “not to harm others”, and the latter is embodied in the obligation of “establish the common worlds with others”. The positive obligation not only contains “not to harm others”, but requires people to unify others, so the positive obligation can not equal to the <b>negative</b> <b>obligation.</b> As viewed from the criminal law, it is advisable to identify the behavior of violating <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> with the legal interest violation.

In the first part of the thesis I deal with the European Convention on Human Rights, especially its aplication to be clear when the violation of the Convention is possible. Then I concentrate on the functioning of European Court of Human Rights which was constituted for the purpose to execute the control of compliance with rights and liberties guaranteed by the Convention and Additional Protocols to the Convention which contracting states obligate to fulfill. Then I handle the interpretation of the article 2 of the Convention and I try to describe with the help of judicature of the Court which obligations must be fulfilled by the contracting states and how the contracting states must behave to comply with the Convention. Substantive and procedural obligations give rise to contracting states. These obligations can be divided into positive and <b>negative</b> <b>obligations.</b> I continuously describe these [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether, and if so, {{to what extent}} human rights are progressively transforming the juridical basis {{of the law in}} relation to private landowners. First, the article analyses the vagaries which undermine a coherent framework for horizontality and erode stability and predictability in private land law disputes. It is argued that McDonald v McDonald is applying a species of <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> model with the consequence that horizontality will only apply in non-regulatory and non-consensual circumstances. Various grounds for cognitive dissonance between the analysis in McDonald and normative adjudicative reasoning are explored. It is suggested that judges may be evolving a form of contextual horizontality to deal with complexities involved in difficult circumstances. Secondly, it is examined whether vulnerability as a heuristic device can result in increased human rights protection for occupiers of privately owned land. Case law is analysed to demonstrate that flexibility to help the vulnerable is evident in deserving cases...|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} {{dimension of}} the lawful state {{is represented by the}} consecration and guaranteeing of the fundamental rights and liberties, the ensuring of the optimum conditions for their exercising. The state authorities have the <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> to restrain from any arbitrary or excessive requirement that may restrict or condition the exercise of the constitutional right. In order to be legitimate and constitutional, any restriction of the exercise of the fundamental rights and liberties through the measures prescribed by the state’s authorities, needs to have the character of exemption, not to affect the substance of the law and to fulfill all conditions stipulated by article 53 of Constitution. In relation to these premises we analyze in this study the constitutional institution of restraining some rights’ exercising and the relevant aspects of jurisprudence. The observance of the principle of proportionality is one of the constitutional requirements in order that such a restrictive measure be legitimate. The main particularities of the principle of proportionality applied in the matter of restraining some rights’ exercising are analyzed with reference to the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human’s Rights...|$|E
40|$|The European Union has {{maintained}} that the obligations incumbent upon it {{in the area of}} human rights stem from its own internal legal order. Under this limited approach, the EU is merely under an obligation not to violate human rights when it acts (i. e. a <b>negative</b> <b>obligation</b> to respect human rights) and effectively only to respect those rights enumerated in the European Convention on Human Rights. This article explores how the EU may be subject to more extensive human rights obligations, incumbent on it by virtue of international law. As an intergovernmental organization and subject to international law, the EU can be said to be bound by customary international law, treaties to which it is a party, and human rights treaties entered into individually by Member States through the principle of succession or substitution. This would extend the range of applicable rights far beyond those in the ECHR to other obligations in, for instance, UN human rights treaties. It also implies that the EU must not merely refrain from violating human rights, but also that, within its spheres of competence, it should take positive measures to protect and fulfill human rights...|$|E

40|$|It {{seems that}} we can neither harm nor benefit anyone by {{creating}} him (Derek Parfit, 1984 on the Non-Identity Problem), and that reproductive decisions, {{if they have any}} moral value at all, are at best neutral and at worst incommensurable relative to each other. This sharply contrasts with the moral intuitions we have regarding reproductive choices, and leaves a large area of human endeavour about which morality can say nothing meaningful at all. A theory based on a de dicto conception of future persons, first advanced by Caspar Hare (2007) and further developed here, avoids these anomalies — and has reassuring consequences for some other moral questions. Such a theory also lends strong, albeit qualified, support to the eugenic claims of such as John Harris (esp. 2007) and Julian Savulescu (esp. 2001). Any act that creates a person creates a set of duties to that person; those duties all consist in not making choices which, relative to the alternative, do not disadvantage the person so created; if the reproductive acts between which we are choosing might be said to be creating the same de dicto person, then those choices are covered by those negative duties to that person. There are many theoretical and practical problems with the sort of reproductive libertarianism advocated by the “new eugenicists”, which if anything are more pressing on the de dicto theory. However, I argue that by casting reproductive <b>obligations</b> as <b>negative</b> <b>obligations,</b> the de dicto theory suggests an account of reproductive obligation that acknowledges the theoretical objections and avoids the negative practical consequences of eugenic libertarianism...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} State obligations {{to prevent and}} redress corporate-related human rights violations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It discusses the evolving jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in two areas of international legal doctrine of particular relevance to the business and human rights debate: the application of international human rights obligations to non-state actors (the public-private divide); and the jurisdictional scope of international human rights treaties (the territoriality-extraterritoriality divide). The study revises and updates a 2010 contribution to {{the mandate of the}} Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Entities John Ruggie. The introduction offers an overview of the global regulatory framework on business and human rights. Part B systematises the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the public-private divide in terms of two categories of State obligations: <b>negative</b> <b>obligations</b> to respect human rights in relation to corporations acting as state agents; and positive obligations to protect human rights in relation to corporations acting as third parties. Part C discusses the ECtHR’s approach to the extraterritorial dimension of State obligations to prevent and redress corporate-related human rights violations. The study discusses cases of direct extraterritorial jurisdiction (acts ‘performed’ outside the State’s territory) and extraterritorial effects cases (acts ‘producing effects’ outside the State’s territory), and their respective relevance to the business and human rights domain. Consideration is also given to the growing body of case law on the extraterritorial dimension of the human right to remedy, which remains a pressing concern in the business and human rights domain...|$|R
