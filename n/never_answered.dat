5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais <b>never</b> <b>answered</b> the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E

Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to Rome.|$|E

500|$|Each journal {{covers a}} {{different}} period of Mountstuart's life, {{and they are}} usually geographically named: The School Journal, London I, etc. Boyd varied the narrator's tone in each to demonstrate changes in Mountstuart's character. In the first London Journal he is, according to Boyd, a [...] "modernist aesthete", becoming a [...] "world-weary cynic" [...] in New York and finding [...] "serene and elegiac serenity" [...] in the final French journal. To support the book's historical themes and documentary premise, there is a feigned editorial apparatus: an index listing real people and their relation to Mountstuart alongside fictional characters, an editor's introduction (by Boyd), an authorial preface (by Mountstuart) {{and a list of}} works attributed to Mountstuart. An additional stylistic feature is the anonymous editor (Boyd), who introduces the book and offers explanatory footnotes, cross-references and attempts at dating. Since a journal is written from the perspective of each day, Mountstuart's moods change as events affect him. The form lends itself to [...] "plotlessness", since the author/narrator inevitably cannot see the overall structure of the story. Plot lines which [...] "fizzle and fade" [...] emphasise the theme of multiple selves throughout life. Boyd adds other aspects to the work, such as parenthetical musings that are <b>never</b> <b>answered,</b> to re-enforce the style. His tone of voice gradually changes as he ages: Boyd wanted the style to reflect the major theme that we change and grow throughout life: [...] "I wanted the literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so the voice subtly changes as you read on: from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent, to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic, to sage and serene octogenarian, and so forth." ...|$|E

In May 2011, the Greek government claimed that removing the Sea Diamond would be [...] "too costly" [...] and said that the 150-million-euro cost of raising the ship should be the responsibility of the insurers and company that owned the ship.

Then, in the summer of 1934, when the Met needed a replacement for Frida Leider, Flagstad agreed to audition for conductor Artur Bodanzky and Met general manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza in StMoritz in August 1934, and she was engaged immediately. Upon leaving StMoritz, Bodanzky's parting words for Flagstad were [...] "Come to New York as soon as you know these roles (Isolde, the three Brünnhildes, Leonore in Fidelio, and the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier).

Later, they played games in the cavernous Louisiana Superdome, but things were no better, due to high demand for the stadium, onerous lease terms, and Maravich's constant knee problems. They also faced the prospect of spending a whole month on the road each year due to Mardi Gras festivities, similar to the long road trip faced by the San Antonio Spurs each season during that city's rodeo. [...] Years later, founding owner Sam Battistone claimed {{that there was no}} contingency plan in case the Jazz ever qualified for the playoffs.

2500|$|A {{biography}} about Douglas Bader by Paul Brickhill, Reach for the Sky, {{was published}} in 1954. Some 172,000 copies were sold {{in the first few}} months alone. The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain. Brickhill had originally offered Bader fifty per cent of all proceeds, sealing the arrangement with a handshake. As sales soared, Bader became concerned that, after tax, he would make very little, and he insisted on a new deal, in writing. So, Brickhill agreed to make him a one-off payment from his company Brickhill Publications Limited of £13,125, the majority of which would be for [...] 'expenses', and tax-free, with only a small portion for 'services' and therefore taxable (£ today). The Inland Revenue subsequently waived any tax liabilities on Bader's earnings. After film director Daniel M. Angel bought the film rights and teamed up with Lewis Gilbert to write the screenplay, Bader came to regret the limiting new deal he had wrung from Brickhill. He was so bitter, he refused to attend the premiere, and only saw the film eleven years later, on television. He never spoke to Brickhill again, and <b>never</b> <b>answered</b> his letters. The feature film of the same title was released in 1956, starring Kenneth More as Bader, topping the box office in Britain that year.|$|E

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} Dewey ran such a cautious, vague {{campaign}} came from {{his experience as a}} presidential candidate in 1944. In that election, Dewey felt that he had allowed Roosevelt to draw him into a partisan, verbal [...] "mudslinging" [...] match, and he believed that this had cost him votes. As such, Dewey was convinced in 1948 to appear as non-partisan as possible, and to emphasize the positive aspects of his campaign while ignoring his opponent. This strategy proved to be a major mistake, as it allowed Truman to repeatedly criticize and ridicule Dewey, while Dewey <b>never</b> <b>answered</b> any of Truman's criticisms. Near the end of the campaign, Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive style and responding directly to Truman's criticisms, {{going so far as to}} tell his aides one evening that he wanted to [...] "tear to shreds" [...] a speech draft and make it more critical of the Democratic ticket. However, nearly all of his major advisors – including Edwin Jaeckle, Press Secretary James Hagerty, and aide Paul Lockwood – insisted that it would be a mistake to change tactics. Dewey's wife Frances strongly opposed her husband changing tactics, telling him, [...] "If I have to stay up all night to see that you don't tear up that speech , I will." [...] Dewey relented and continued to ignore Truman's attacks and to focus on positive generalities instead of issue specifics.|$|E

A follow-up radio message relaying the identity of the intruding warships as German, did not reach Bruun. Relying on the reports he had received, and what he had heard on the radio news, Bruun reasoned that he could not be certain if the intruders were German or British. While awaiting clarification of the situation, he decided to seize Roda as a prize and move his own and the German ship to [...] further to the south. An eight-man prize crew was despatched to Roda with instructions to replace the German flag with the Norwegian naval ensign, disable the ship's radio transmitter, and order the German captain to move to Riskafjord.
