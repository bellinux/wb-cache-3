50|$|In 2008, Tracy filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit for}} her out-of-town again husband, Luke. The lawsuit was filed against her sister-in-law Monica, {{which resulted in}} a hospital brawl in the General Hospital elevator. Tracy told Monica not to operate on Luke because of her emotional strain against the deaths of Alan and Emily; however, she did anyway, and froze on the operating table. Since Tracy filed the medical malpractice suit, she has been kicked out of the family's mansion with frozen access to the family money. When Luke did return, she explained to him that she still loved him, but was not {{going to continue to be}} married to him. Luke told her that he was not going to give up on their marriage so easily. Later on, she and Luke left town because Luke was being investigated by his connections with the Zacchara family, which invested in his Haunted Star Casino. The mob family left him to take the fall with the I.R.S. because he stole money from them. Afraid of what he would be up to, she agreed to leave with him. Tracy returned without Luke because he was not spending the money and enjoying their time the way that she wanted him to. At this time, Monica was in rehab after being indicted in court for hit and run. Tracy visited Monica and learned that she was doing fine and was ready to return to work in a few weeks, which pleased Tracy. Tracy visited Monica in rehab and asked for advice about how to save Lulu's life. Monica told Tracy that if she could turn back the clock, she would do everything to save all of her children, especially Jason. With that, she told Tracy that if she wanted to save Lulu's life, then she had to do everything in her power to drive a wedge between Lulu and Johnny. After that, she visited Johnny in his holding cell where she told him about her brush with the mafia. She explained to him that she was once a mob boss and she heard about how his father Anthony Zacchara murdered his wife: Johnny's mother. She told him that if he really cared about Lulu, he would let her go. In October 2008, when Lulu was in her darkest hour, Tracy had one of her 'men' track down Luke. He turned up in Mexico, so Tracy headed there, but not before blackmailing Edward into getting the money laundering charges dropped. Once she was satisfied, she flew to Mexico and found Luke in a bar. They were both briefly put in jail, after a run-in with the local cops. <b>n</b> <b>November,</b> it was announced that Laura had awoken from her coma. There was a question of whether or not Luke would stay married to Tracy or go back to Laura, the love of his life. On November 20, Tracy filed for a divorce, but Luke tried to tell her he loved only her. With a new dawning beginning as Luke proclaimed his love for Tracy, being unconvinced and stubborn, Tracy shut Luke out lying to him and making him believed they were already divorced. However, the obvious love between the two lead to many ploys by Luke to win the new love of his life back. This happened on New Year's Eve when Luke planned a surprise party for Tracy. Tracy thought that it was a stupid gesture and a waste of her time and money. They played roulette, Tracy asked Luke what Laura's Birthday was. He replied December 21. Tracy then said that if the ball landed on 21 Luke will leave the country and give her a divorce but if it landed on 6 (Tracy's Birthday) she had to take him back. The ball landed on 6 and they bring in the new year with a passionate kiss.|$|E

40|$|Network {{convergence}} and {{the multimedia}} service provisioning platforms within Next Generation Networks (NGN) are subjects of huge complexity and the required architecture is extremely expensive to implement. Network operators {{will find it}} difficult to commit the necessary capital expenditure unless the NGN architecture has been thoroughly tried and tested. To ensure early adoption of this convergence platform, low cost testbeds are needed to bring together various parties to research and develop the necessary architectures. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), defined by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) represents today the global Service Delivery Platform (SDP) standard for providing multimedia applications in NGN. Knowing that the full potential of the IMS can only be revealed by the early non-discriminant provisioning of IMS know-how and related technologies to the different market players the Fraunhofer Institute FOKUS launched the "Open Source IMS Core" i <b>n</b> <b>November</b> 2006, which is based on extensions to the SIP Express Router (SER) that cope with the SIP extensions specified by 3 GPP.

40|$|O <b>n</b> <b>November</b> 2, 1920, U. S. radio {{broadcasting}} edged into the market-place when Westinghouse’s KDKA station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,aired {{reports of the}} presidential election held that day. By year-end 1922, some 500 broadcast stations were on the air. “Priority in use ” airwave rights were enforced by the Department of Commerce. But on July 8, 1926, Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover announced that, in response to conflicting court opin-ions, the Department would no longer enforce broadcasting rights. Stations be-came free to jump wavelengths, and many did. Within seven months, some 200 new stations emerged. The resulting chaos demanded a remedy. In November 1926, the Chicago Tribune’s WGN obtained a court injunction against an interloper, protect-ing its use of a frequency under common law. But neither policymakers nor the large commercial stations saw this as the preferred solution. In December 1926, Congress passed a statute requiring all broadcasters to waive any vested rights in frequencies, and in February 1927 the Radio Act established the Federal Radio Commission. Evolving into the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, the agency would administratively determine what use could be made of airwaves according to “public interest, convenience, or necessity”—a standard put forward by the fledgling National Association of Broadcasters (Dill, 1938). The 1927 legislation represented a bargain between policymakers, who ob-tained influence over programming (including such regulations as the “equal time rule ” and, later, the “fairness doctrine”), and radio station owners, who enjoyed rent protection via regulatory barriers to entry (Hazlett 1990, 1997, 2001 a). Con-sumers were not well-represented in this legislative bargain: in fact, one of the first actions taken by the Federal Radio Commission was to reject an expansion of th...|$|E

40|$|O <b>n</b> <b>November</b> 6, 2012, {{voters in}} Colorado andWashington moved to legalize {{the use and}} sale of marijuanaby adults 21 and older. The passage of Amendment 64, which amended the Colorado constitution, and Initiative 502, which amended the Revised Code of Washington, marked “an electoral first not only for America but the world. ” 1 In {{response}} to the legalization of recreational marijuana, Colorado is taking a proactive approach. We are working as a convener for all interested parties and experts to shape public policy that utilizes the decades of public health lessons gained from regulating alcohol and tobacco. We have applied these lessons to marijuana and are making every effort in our laws, regulations, and revenue allocations to address {{public health and safety}} concerns, prevent young people’s use of marijuana, and educate parents and children about the risks of its use. While Colorado and Washington are the first states to legalize mari-juana for recreational purposes, since the 1970 s, the national trend has moved toward decriminalization, increased social acceptance, and legal-ization for medical use. Today, more than half the states in the United States have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana, approved it for medical use, or legalized it completely. 2 Numerous other states—both liberal and conservative—are considering legalization, in-dicating that the recreational use of marijuana is no longer a partisan issue. Colorado and Washington are at the forefront of these national trends, and the establishment of rules, regulations, and a policy frame-work that protects the public’s health and safety and prevents underage use will set a baseline for other states ’ marijuana laws. Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 with 55 % of the vote. Al-though our administration opposed the legalization of adult-use mari-juana, we are committed to fulfilling the will of the voters and directing the responsible regulation of this nascent industry.

40|$|The {{price of}} vacant land {{in an urban}} area is a {{fundamental}} indicator of an area’s attractiveness. However, because the value of vacant land is hard to measure, indirect methods are typically used to gauge prices. A more direct approach to measuring land prices, using a unique data set, reveals {{that the price of}} unimproved land in the New York area is high, and rose sharply from 1999 to 2006. The rising trend suggests the underlying strength of the area’s economy and the increasing value of the area’s productivity and amenities. O. <b>n</b> <b>November</b> 1, 2000, a 3. 4 -acre parcel of land at 10 Columbus Circle in Manhattan sold for $ 345 million, or roughly $ 2, 300 per square foot. 1 The parcel is located 1. 3 miles from the Empire State Building at the southwest corner of Central Park, and housed an exposition and convention center known as the New York Coliseum. The buyers quickly demolished that complex to make way for construction of the Time Warner Center, a 2. 8 -million-square-foot, largely commercial development that includes two office towers, a hotel, retail stores, and a parking garage. The Time Warner Center {{is now one of the}} most valuable properties in New York. Physical space is a requirement for all types of economic activity, from housing to manufacturing and service production, making the value of land an important feature of any economy. The high price of the Columbus Circle property reminds us that the price of land in an urban area is a fundamental measure of the area’s attractiveness. Moreover, changes in the value of land over time and space can provide insight into a host of important regional and macroeconomic issues. However, because land often comes bundled with a structure—and thus is generally not priced separately in a real estate transaction—its value is difficult to measure. 1 Source: CoStar Grou...|$|E
40|$|The North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) is s a 3 -D VHF {{regional}} lightning {{detection system}} that provides on-orbit algorithm validation and instrument performance assessments for the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor, {{as well as}} information on storm kinematics and updraft evolution that offers the potential to improve severe storm warning lead time by up t o 50 % and decrease te false alarm r a t e (for non-tornado producing storms). In support of this latter function, the LMA serves as a principal component of a severe weather test bed to infuse new science and technology into the short-term forecasting of severe and hazardous weather, principally within nearby National Weather Service forecast offices. The LMA, which became operational i <b>n</b> <b>November</b> 2001, consists of VHF receivers deployed across northern Alabama and a base station located at the National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC), which is on t h e campus of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The LMA system locates the sources of impulsive VHF radio signals s from lightning by accurately measuring the time that the signals aririve at the different receiving stations. Each station's records the magnitude and time of the peak lightning radiation signal in successive 80 ms intervals within a local unused television channel (channel 5, 76 - 82 MHz in our case). Typically hundreds of sources per flash can be reconstructed, which i n t u r n produces accurate 3 -dimensional lightning image maps (nominally < 50 m error within 150 la. range). The data are transmitted back t o a base station using 2. 4 GHz wireless Ethernet data links and directional parabolic grid antennas.
