25|$|The matrix is {{responsible}} for producing cells that become the <b>nail</b> <b>plate.</b> The width and thickness of the <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip itself shows if the <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> is flat, arched, or hooked. The matrix will continue to grow as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition.|$|E
25|$|As new <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> {{cells are}} made, they push older <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> cells forward; {{and in this}} way older cells become compressed, flat, and translucent. This makes the {{capillaries}} in the nail bed below visible, resulting in a pink color.|$|E
50|$|A truss {{connector}} plate is manufactured from ASTM A653/A653M, A591, A792/A792M, or A167 structural quality steel and is protected with zinc or zinc-aluminum alloy coatings or their stainless steel equivalent. Metal {{connector plate}}s have integral teeth and are manufactured to various sizes (that is, length and width) and thickness or gauges and {{are designed to}} laterally transmit loads in wood. They are also known as stud ties, metal connector plates, mending <b>plates,</b> or <b>nail</b> <b>plates.</b> However, not all types of <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> are approved for use in trusses and other structurally critical placements.|$|R

40|$|Background: Thigmotropism is a {{biologic}} feature {{coping with}} the directional growth of cells following topographical guidance cues. This mechanism {{is involved in the}} invasive phase of pathogen and opportunistic fungi. It was shown experimentally with fungal hyphae of both dermatophytes and nondermatophyte molds, {{as well as with the}} mycelial phase of the dimorphic yeast Candida albicans. Objective: To revisit histomycology in onychomycoses of a diversity of fungal origins. Method: Histopathological section of <b>nails</b> <b>plates</b> were oriented parallel to the nail direction of growth. Result: Thigmotropism in part explains the patterns of orientations and shapes of fungi invading <b>nail</b> <b>plates.</b> It is probably influenced by onychochronobiology (speed of growth of the affected nails), and it governs various clinical presentations of onychomycoses...|$|R

Six patients had thickening of the <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> while 8 had thinning. In one patient each oil drop sign and splinter haemorrhages were seen; two patients each had associated lichen planus and psoriasis and one each atopic dermatitis, vitiligo and alopecia areata. Personal history of atopy was obtained in 6 patients. Nail biopsy carried out in 5 patients revealed nonspecific histology. Radiological examination of fingers and toes revealed no bony or joint abnormality. The nail changes remained almost static during a 4 year follow-up period...|$|R
25|$|Trauma to the <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> or toe, {{which can}} occur by {{dropping}} objects on or stubbing the toenail, {{or by the}} nail protruding through the shoe (as during sports or other vigorous activity), can cause the flesh to become injured and the nail to grow irregularly and press into the flesh.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> (corpus unguis) is {{the hard}} part of the nail, made of {{translucent}} keratin protein. Several layers of dead, compacted cells cause the nail to be strong but flexible. Its (transverse) shape {{is determined by the}} form of the underlying bone. In common usage, the word nail often refers to this part only.|$|E
25|$|The onychodermal band is {{the seal}} between the <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> and the hyponychium.

40|$|Six {{years ago}} a patient {{suffered}} a severe allergic reaction from Sensitization to methyl methacrylate {{in a mixture of}} materials designed to make artificial nails There was marked erythema, edema, and pain of the eponychial and paronychial tissues with persistent paresthesia of the finger tips. Gradual destruction of the <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> developed and since no regrowth of the nails resumed in six years, the loss of the finger nails is found to be permanent. GIBBS AND LEIDER recently tabulated and illustrated several nail changes due to vari-ous causes. ’Under “eczematous condi-tions, ” the authors state: “Contact dermatitis from primary irritants and from allergic mechanisms, nummular eczema, and sec-ondarily eczematized conditions in, under and around the nails cause transient distor-tion of <b>nail</b> <b>plates.</b> ”This is true, but {{it must be noted that}} occasionally an allergic contact reaction under and around nails produces prolonged distortion of <b>nail</b> <b>plates,</b> 2 - 3 nd on at least one occasion, here reported, caused permanent anonychia.

5000|$|<b>Nail</b> <b>plates</b> {{are used}} to connect timber of the same {{thickness}} in the same plane.

25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} for an ingrown nail {{is carried out}} by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical {{treatment for}} ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Like all skin, {{it is made}} of {{two types}} of tissues: the deeper dermis, the living tissue which {{includes}} capillaries and glands, and the epidermis, the layer just beneath the <b>nail</b> <b>plate,</b> which moves toward the finger tip with the plate.

40|$|Introduction The {{treatment}} of displaced, extra-articular fractures of the distal tibia remains controversial. These injuries {{are difficult to}} manage due to limited soft tissue cover, poor vascularity of the area and proximity to the ankle joint. Surgical treatment options are expanding and include locked intramedullary <b>nails,</b> <b>plate</b> and screw fixation and external fixator systems. The <b>nail</b> and <b>plate</b> options are most commonly used in the UK, but controversy exists over which treatment is most clinically and cost-effective. In this multicentre randomised controlled trial we aim to assess ratings of disability 6  months postinjury in patients who have sustained a distal tibia fracture treated with either an intramedullary <b>nail</b> or <b>plate</b> and locking screw fixation. Methods and analysis Adult patients presenting at trial centres with an acute fracture of the distal tibia will be considered for inclusion. A total of 320 patients will provide 90...|$|R

Nail polish consists of a mix of an organic polymer and several other components, depending on the brand.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} method of roof framing {{employed}} by Australian builders in modern construction {{is the use}} of pre-fabricated <b>nail</b> <b>plated</b> timber roof trusses. These trusses are predominantly manufactured from structural framing timber limited in length to a maximum of 6 metres. The style and size of houses increasingly preferred by Australian homeowners means that trusses are regularly required to span further than 6 metres. Truss manufacturers therefore use larger or additional <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> to splice members during fabrication, and the assembly process becomes far more complex. Finger jointing of sawmill off-cuts and other short lengths of timber is a means of manufacturers economically producing timber in longer lengths. This dissertation investigates the suitability of using finger jointed structural timber for the fabrication of <b>nail</b> <b>plated</b> roof trusses. Physical testing and statistical analysis has been used to compare the performance of finger jointed structural timber with standard structural framing timber normally used in truss fabrication. This study involved characterizing the mechanical properties of the timber, as well as assessing the performance of joints including mechanical fasteners. These methods, along with the static modelling of loading situations, were also used to quantify the probability of inducing failures unique to finger jointed timber, during the truss fabrication and erection process. These investigations concluded that finger jointed timber could be produced with equivalent mechanical properties to standard framing timber. Joints manufactured from finger jointed and solid structural timber also exhibited no significant difference in performance. Furthermore, failures unique to finger jointed timber could occur during fabrication and erection, however, the probability of these, under normal use conditions, is generally quite low. ...|$|R

2500|$|The hyponychium (informally {{known as}} the [...] "quick") is the {{epithelium}} located beneath the <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> at the junction between the free edge and {{the skin of the}} fingertip. It forms a seal that protects the nail bed.|$|E
2500|$|Together, the {{eponychium}} and the cuticle form {{a protective}} seal. [...] The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of non-living, almost invisible dead skin cells that [...] "ride out on" [...] {{and cover the}} back of the visible <b>nail</b> <b>plate</b> while the eponychium is the fold of skin cells that produces the cuticle. They are continuous, and some references view them as one entity; in this classification, the names eponychium, cuticle, and perionychium are synonymous. It is the cuticle (nonliving part) that is removed during a manicure, but the eponychium (living part) should not be touched due to risk of infection. [...] The eponychium is a small band of living cells (epithelium) that extends from the posterior nail wall onto the base of the nail. [...] The eponychium {{is the end of the}} proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed <b>nail</b> <b>plate.</b> The perionyx is the projecting edge of the eponychium covering the proximal strip of the lunula.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} bending {{tests performed}} on composite beams made from glulam beams and {{cross laminated timber}} (CLT) panels. The composite beam, with a T-cross section, represents a section of a floor element in a multi-storey CLT construction system. The shear connections used were made either of double-sided punched metal plate fasteners, either of inclined screws, or {{of a combination of}} both fastener types. The screws are used to secure the shear connection with double-sided <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> with respect to possible separation forces between the glulam and the CLT. An additional test with a screw glued connection was made for comparison as the upper bound case in terms of composite action. The results show the beams with double-sided <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> (with or without screws) achieved a very high level of composite action and an overall satisfactory behaviour. Almost full composite action was achieved for the screw-glued composite beam. A detailed design example of the beam element according to the Eurocode 5 and Finnish National Annex is presented.

30|$|There are {{different}} treatment options for bone metastases. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are appropriate treatments for sensitive tumors [6].

Surgery is indicated for intractable pain and for impending or established pathological fractures [8]. Conventional surgical strategies for humeral metastases are intramedullary <b>nails,</b> <b>plate</b> fixation and cement augmentation for reconstruction of large bone defects. Methylmethacrylate is also an effective adjuvant, both for improving the fixation with intramedullary <b>nails</b> or <b>plates</b> and for sterilizing the diaphysis from metastatic microfoci. On the other hand, when the lesion involves the proximal humerus, the choice for the optimal surgery is often difficult, especially when the destruction area involves the epiphysis.|$|R

30|$|Skeletal {{stabilization}} {{should be}} performed {{at the time of}} initial debridement [3, 30, 31]. This can be achieved by intramedullary <b>nails,</b> <b>plates</b> or external fixators depending on the morphology of the fracture. Restoring alignment of the limb eliminates gross movement at the site of fracture, limits further soft tissue damage and decreases the risk of further bacterial spread [30, 31].

30|$|The {{treatment}} of proximal femoral fractures using fixed angled implants was succeeded by sliding screw devices which produced {{an improvement in}} union rates and fewer fixation and implant failures [12, 15]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies with 3, 069 patients showed {{an increased risk of}} cut-out (13 % vs. 4 %), non-union (2 vs. 0.5 %), implant breakage (14 vs. 0.7 %) and re-operation (10 vs. 4 %) for fixed <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> in comparison with the sliding implants [8]. In addition patients treated with fixed <b>nail</b> <b>plates</b> had a higher mortality rate and survivors more likely to have residual hip pain and impaired mobility. For the past 3 decades the use of sliding screw implants for the fixation of proximal femoral fractures has been almost universal. Two main designs are popular; an extramedullary device (e.g., the Dynamic Hip Screw, DHS) and an intramedullary device (the Gamma nail and equivalent cephalo-medullary constructs). Both types achieve fixation in the femoral head with one or two sliding screws. Extensive clinical investigation has failed to show that either type of device is superior although there is the suggestion that intramedullary devices may be biomechanically more stable [2, 3, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28].|$|R
