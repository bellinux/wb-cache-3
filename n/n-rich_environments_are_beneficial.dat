This extension creates a trend to generalize the definition of effective diversity gain to be applicable to non-uniform multipath environments too. We introduce the richness threshold as a further metric for diversity performance of multi-port antennas.

We assess the liquidity risk and the expected liquidity needs for each bank and for the system, and relate them to the degree of competition in the loan market.

On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

In a bilateral electricity market, the decision variables such as bid volume and price can influence the market clearing price (MCP).

This paper proposes a bi-level coordinate dispatch model with fully consideration of the information interaction between main grid and ADN. Simulation results on a typical ADN validate the feasibility of the proposed method. A balanced proportion between energy market and ancillary services market can be achieved.|$|R

(2) When the quantum system and the thermal bath are in weak coupling, generally speaking, the mutual coupling effect between circuit elements will destroy the quantum coherence; but when the quantum system and the thermal bath are in strong coupling, it will help to enhance the decoherence time by controlling the mutual inductive coupling between the loop components. ...|$|R

In addition, elucidating adaptive mechanisms in possibly Earth's most abundant photosynthetic microorganism is important, due to its significant role in nutrient cycling and climate control. Proteins are synthesised in cells in response to environmental perturbations and are therefore essential for adaptation, and in this thesis proteomics is the principal method applied. Less pronounced protein expression changes are characteristic of long-term adaptive responses as opposed to immediate shock responses, and therefore techniques were developed and applied which could quantify with high accuracy (25 to 50...|$|R

Both predictive mechanisms and reinforcement learning require an appropriate higher-level representation of the agent's sensorimotor space. In this thesis, we argue that a representation maximizing predictability of state transition is suitable for these tasks. We present an unsupervised optimization technique designed to learn such a representation from the raw transition probabilities of a sufficiently explored sensorimotor space of any given agent. The resulting representation is a mapping onto a sparsely connected probabilistic graph. The graph is also minimal in the sense that there is low correlation between the projection patterns of any pair of nodes. This sparseness and decorrelation are the key components of our predictability measure. We apply this algorithmic framework to the sensorimotor state space of a simple, simulated agent exploring a two-dimensional maze.

Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants.

In total, 1, 500 study subjects (50. 5 % females) participated in this questionnaire survey. Although knowledge about tanning and motives to tan were similar among genders, females performed more photoprotective measures and were more connected to nature (all p < 0. 001) compared to males.
