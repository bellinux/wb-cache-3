50|$|For {{infants with}} {{suspected}} congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> (PRNT). RT-PCR of the infants serum and urine {{should be performed}} {{in the first two}} days of life. Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Other recommended tests are cranial ultrasound, hearing evaluation, and eye examination. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Some tests should be repeated up to 6 months later as there can be delayed effects, particularly with hearing.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} rubella virus plaque <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> {{for measuring}} rubella antibody was developed {{based on the}} potentiation of the virus-antibody complex by heterologous anti-immunoglobulin. The test is highly sensitive, yielding titers on the average 50 to 100 {{times higher than the}} haemagglutination inhibition test or the conventional plaque <b>neutralization</b> <b>test.</b> The sensitivity of this enhanced <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> is somewhat limited by the existence of a prozone phenomenon which precludes testing of low-titered sera below a dilution of 1 : 16. No prozone effect was observed with cerebrospinal fluids. The specificity of the enhanced <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> was determined by seroconversion of individuals receiving rubella vaccine. Although the rubella hemagglutination inhibition test remains the test of choice in routine diagnostic and surveillance work, the enhanced rubella <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> is particularly useful in monitoring low-level antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with neurological disorders and in certain instances of vaccine failure...|$|E
40|$|As for the {{immunological}} natures, {{particularly for}} the <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> and the "Absaettigungsversuch", the isolated hepatitis virus was compared with analogous viruses. The results are as follows: 1) Both of the <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> and the "Absaettigungsversuch" of ectromelia virus are ef practical use ot least to a limitted degree. The “Absaettigungsversuch” is, however, of less use than the <b>neutralization</b> <b>test,</b> and is inferred to give a definite result only {{in combination with the}} <b>neutralization</b> <b>test.</b> Consequently, combined employment of the both tests is desirable. 2) Hepatitis antisera showed a high neutralization with hepatitis virus, and not with the other viruses. The result of this <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> was determined by observation of pathological findings. 3) In short, the results of these immunological tests showed that the viruses of infectious hepatitis, ectromelia and "Izumi fever" were clearly different to each other, and distinct discrimination was possible among them...|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} six viruses {{from patients}} diagnosed with aseptic meningitis or hand, foot, and mouth disease. The cytopathic {{effect of these}} viruses on cultured cells was like that of enteroviruses. However, viral <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> against standard antisera were negative. Phylogenetic analysis with the complete VP 4 nucleotide sequences of these 6 viruses and 29 serotypes of enteroviruses classified 3 of the viruses as serotype echovirus type 18 (EV 18) and 3 as serotype human enterovirus 71 (HEV 71). These results were confirmed by remicroneutralization tests with HEV-monospecific antisera or an additional phylogenetic analysis with the complete VP 4 nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic analysis with complete VP 4 genes is more useful than <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> with enterovirus serotype-specific antisera in identifying enterovirus serotypes. he human enterovirus (HEV) genus of the family Picornaviridae includes the human pathogens that cause {{a wide spectrum of}} acute disease, including hand, foot, and mouth disease (1), aseptic meningitis (2, 3), encephalitis (3 - 6), and neonatal sepsislike disease (7, 8).

It was found that the strain-specific complement-fixation test was superior for separating influenza B viruses into groups whereas the haemagglutination-inhibition and serum <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> were better for demonstrating similarities. The results obtained with these three immunological techniques confirmed that antigenic variation exists among influenza B viruses, although it is not as clearcut as among influenza A viruses...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunoperoxidase}} antibody (IPA) {{technique was}} used to develop two new tests for serodiagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infections: a microneutralization test based on {{the reduction of the}} number of infected cells and an IPA test for determination of virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). Neutralizing antibody was determined both in the presence and absence of complement. In a group of 24 infants and young childres, ages less than 1 to 36 months, with acute respiratory syncytial virus infection, serodiagnosis was made by the IPA-IgG test in 20 cases, by <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> with addition of complement in 19 cases, and by <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> without addition of complement in 17 cases. Complement fixation detected only 12 cases of infection. All four cases not serologically diagnosed were infants less than 1 month old. <b>Neutralization</b> <b>test</b> antibody titers in the presence of complement were usually 4 - to 16 -fold higher than titers obtained without addition of complement. Both IPA-IgG and <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> (in the presence of complement) appear very efficient in serologically detecting respiratory syncytial virus infections in infants older than 1 month and give rapid results (IPA-IgG takes 2 h to complete, and the <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> takes 24 h).

No distinctive antigenic differences among reference strains were demonstrated in reciprocal <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> but each antiserum neutralized its homologous virus {{more rapidly than}} any heterologous strain. Forty-six EHV strains isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of apparently healthy horses were antigenically indistinguishable {{from each other and}} from the four reference strains.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was done}} of 231 strains of birnavirus isolated from fish, shellfish, and other reservoirs {{in a survey}} study that began in 1986 in Galicia (northwestern Spain). Reference strains {{from all of the}} infectious pancreatic necrosis virus serotypes were included in the comparison, which was done by <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> and agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the viral genome. The <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> with antisera against the West Buxton, Spajarup (Sp), and Abild (Ab) strains showed that most of the Galician isolates were European types Sp and Ab; however, many isolates (30 %) could not be typed. Results from agarose gels did not provided information for grouping of the strains, since all were found to have genomic segments of similar sizes. Analysis of polyacrylamide gels, however, allowed six electropherogroups (EGs) to be differentiated on the basis of genome mobility and separation among segments, and a certain relationship between EGs and serotypes was observed. A wide diversity of electropherotypes was observed among the Galician isolates, and as <b>neutralization</b> <b>tests</b> showed, most of the isolates were included in EGs corresponding to European types Ab and Sp.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} plaque {{neutralization assay}} for parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and {{respiratory syncytial virus}} was developed in Vero and MA 104 cell cultures. The tests were performed in semimicrotoiter trays containing 24 wells, 16 mm in diameter. Parainfluenza virus type 1 formed plaques in Vero and MA 104 cells only when trypsin {{was added to the}} overlay medium. Plaquing of parainfluenza virus type 1 was more sensitive and technically reproducible in MA 104 cells than in Vero cells. Parainfluenza virus types 2 and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus readily formed plaques in Vero cells. Plaques with all viruses were necrotic in character, except for plaques produced by parainfluenza virus type 3, which appeared red due to an increased uptake of neutral red by infected cells. Different conditions for plaquing of the four viruses had to be used to obtain plaques of suitable size. Antibody titers of commercially prepared guinea pig typing sera were 5 - to 50 -fold higher by the plaque <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> than by complement fixation. The addition of guinea pig immunoglobulin G antiglobulin to the serum-virus mixtures enhanced the conventional <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> 5 - to 10 -fold. The sensitivity and specificity of the plaque <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> was also determined with sera of marmosets experimentally infected with parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. The generally low postinfection titers could be enhanced, on the average, 40 -fold by using human immunoglobulin G antiglobulin in the <b>neutralization</b> <b>test.</b> A low degree of cross-reactivity was shown between parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 both in the conventional <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> and in the anti-immunoglobulin enhanced <b>neutralization</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

The results were as follows: 1) In the present experiment, though some errors should be taken into consideration so far as animal experiment is concerned, it was concluded that reliable result would be obtained by careful selection of the outer conditions and inner factors. 2) As the outer conditions, the experimental temperature and the solution for dilution of rickettsial emulsion are given. The temperature under 10 °C is suitable for treatment of R. tsutsugamushi, and glutamine-sucrose-phosphate buffer is superior as the dilution solution. 3) As the inner factors, those of rickettsia itself and those of immune sera were considered. In orser to make the distribution of rickettsiae equal, many livers and spleens were pooled and treated at the low temperature mentioned above. The selection of immune sera is important, and the <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> with rabbit immune sera showed the best result. 4) After some observation period of <b>neutralization</b> <b>test,</b> a few of the survived mice showed the syndrom of the disease.

The effectiveness of the RRNT was evaluated by examining several hantaviruses and hantavirus-specific convalescent human serum samples. All convalescent serum samples tested by RRNT caused significant decreases in hantavirus genomes with only one specific hantavirus species, which allowed a straightforward identification of the related hantavirus.

40|$|In the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, {{laboratory}} diagnosis plays {{a critical role}} by isolating and identifying poliovirus (PV) from the stool samples from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. In recent years, reestablishment of PV circulation in countries where PV was previously eliminated has occurred because of decreased herd immunity, possibly due to poor vaccination coverage. To monitor the vulnerability of countries to PV circulation, surveillance of neutralizing-antibody titers against PV in susceptible populations is essential in the end game of the polio eradication program. In this study, we have developed a PV <b>neutralization</b> <b>test</b> with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudoviruses to determine the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV in human serum samples.
