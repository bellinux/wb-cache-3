5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the <b>nostrils.</b> This contradicts other accounts that mention that the <b>nostrils</b> were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape of the head and <b>nostrils</b> as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|The snout of Ankylosaurus was arched and {{truncated}} at the front, and the <b>nostrils</b> were elliptical, {{and they}} were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the <b>nostrils</b> were not visible from the front, because the sinuses were expanded {{to the sides of}} the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae, strap-like, side osteoderms of the snout, completely roofed the enlarged opening of the <b>nostrils.</b> The <b>nostrils</b> also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of the snout had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities or chambers of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of the snout into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the choanae (internal <b>nostrils).</b>|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and <b>nostrils.</b> Between the eyes and the <b>nostrils</b> were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The <b>nostrils,</b> eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the <b>nostrils</b> and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. A curtain of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular <b>nostrils.</b> The <b>nostrils</b> are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E
50|$|RHD {{patients}} with left tactile and visual neglect {{were reported to}} exhibit neglect and extinction of olfactory stimuli to the left <b>nostril,</b> {{in spite of the}} anatomically constrained projection of the olfactory input from that <b>nostril</b> to the intact left hemisphere. This ﬁnding was taken to suggest an impaired processing of all inputs from the contralesional side of space, regardless of whether such inputs were primarily directed to the damaged right hemisphere or the intact left hemisphere. Yet this interpretation is questionable because normal subjects appear unable to localize to a <b>nostril</b> a lateralized olfactory stimulus without the aid of an associated stimulation of the crossed trigeminal input from that same <b>nostril.</b> Further, and in keeping with the above notion, on a number of unilateral and bilateral olfactory stimulations those patients identiﬁed the left <b>nostril</b> input correctly, but misplaced it to the right <b>nostril,</b> possibly because of a rightward response bias related to left-sided neglect. Speciﬁcally, when two different stimuli were delivered to each <b>nostril,</b> RHD patients consistently failed to report the stimulus delivered to the left <b>nostril.</b> The olfactory system predominantly projects its ﬁbers ipsilaterally thus these results are evidence supporting the representational theory of neglect. Also patients affected by olfactory extinction showed a large number of displacements in that the correctly identiﬁed stimuli presented to the left <b>nostril</b> were described as being in the right <b>nostril.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Among {{concerned}} nasal appearances, a deform-ity with supero-lateral {{displacement of}} the <b>nostril</b> rim, called retracted <b>nostril</b> rim or elevated <b>nostril</b> rim is com-monly seen and {{is considered one of}} the most difficult types of cases to treat aesthetically. A new surgical method for treating retracted <b>nostril</b> rim was performed in 10 patients, using the combination of auricular composite graft, internal fixation with a retainer, and external continuing suspension with anchoring sutures. The procedure was successful in maintaining the grafted cartilage in the ideal position and in avoiding recurrence of retraction or elevation of the con-structed alar rim. The presented method merits considera-tion as a standard operative approach for correction of retracted <b>nostril</b> rim. Key words: Elevated <b>nostril</b> rim—Retracted ala—Cartilag...|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the Ojibwe {{used the}} powdery gleba as a {{hemostatic}} agent to staunch {{the flow of}} nosebleeds: the spore powder was inhaled through the <b>nostrils.</b> It is now known that this practice {{can lead to the}} pulmonary disease lycoperdonosis, which causes symptoms similar to pneumonia.

5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched <b>nostrils</b> make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the <b>nostril</b> {{symmetry}} following primary cleft rhinoplasty done with either a dorsal onlay or columellar strut graft in patients with non-syndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. In this retrospective study 30 consecutive patients treated with autogenous or alloplastic dorsal onlay grafts and 30 consecutive patients treated with autogenous or alloplastic columellar strut grafts for complete unilateral cleft nose reconstruction were analyzed for nasal symmetry. The autogenous grafts used were costo-chondral or septal cartilage and the alloplastic graft used was high density polyethylene (Medpore((R))). Assessment of the <b>nostril</b> symmetry was done using a two-dimensional nasal analysis 24 - 30 months postoperatively. Ratios between cleft and noncleft side <b>nostril</b> for three parameters were used to assess symmetry namely <b>nostril</b> width, <b>nostril</b> height and <b>nostril</b> gap area. None of the three parameters showed statistically significant changes. A satisfactory, though not statistically significant, difference in symmetrical outcome could be achieved in both the groups with the exception of <b>nostril</b> width symmetry in group treated with dorsal onlay graft...|$|R

30|$|In the {{treatment}} of supernumerary <b>nostril,</b> {{it is important to}} remove the accessory nasal tract entirely and preserve the normal <b>nostril.</b> In most cases of supernumerary <b>nostril,</b> fistulectomy and reconstruction with local flaps was performed as a surgical technique. Surgery should be performed as early as possible, because in early age, it is easier to access the deep portion of the nasal cavity, avoid serious affect to nasal cartilage, and avoid deformity around the ala nasi due to fistula. In this case, the accessory opening was obstructed by using simple incision and primary closure without forming local flap. Although the patient had two surgeries to remove the accessory <b>nostril,</b> small and recognizable residual defect on <b>nostril</b> rim of affected side is observed. For the patient’s psychosocial growth, rhinoplasty will be performed after re-evaluating face.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the <b>nostrils</b> that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the <b>nostrils.</b> There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical <b>nostrils.</b> Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur.

The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular <b>nostrils</b> are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the <b>nostrils</b> is a broad curtain of skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32–60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward-pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E

40|$|The {{nose and}} throat are {{important}} sites of pathogen colonization, yet the microbiota of both is relatively unexplored by culture-independent approaches. We examined the bacterial microbiota of the <b>nostril</b> and posterior {{wall of the}} oropharynx from seven healthy adults using two culture-independent methods, a 16 S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChip) and 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries. While the bacterial microbiota of the oropharynx was richer {{than that of the}} <b>nostril,</b> the oropharyngeal microbiota varied less among participants than did <b>nostril</b> microbiota. A few phyla accounted {{for the majority of the}} bacteria detected at each site: Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the <b>nostril</b> and Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx. Compared to culture-independent surveys of microbiota from other body sites, the microbiota of the <b>nostril</b> and oropharynx show distinct phylum-level distribution patterns, supporting niche-specific colonization at discrete anatomical sites. In the <b>nostril,</b> the distribution of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was reminiscent of that of skin, though Proteobacteria were much less prevalent. The distribution of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx was most similar to that in saliva, with more Proteobacteria than in the distal esophagus or mouth. While Firmicutes were prevalent at both sites, distinct families within this phylum dominated numerically in each. At both sites there was an inverse correlation between the prevalences of Firmicutes and another phylum: in the oropharynx, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and in the <b>nostril,</b> Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. In the <b>nostril,</b> this inverse correlation existed between the Firmicutes family Staphylococcaceae and Actinobacteria families, suggesting potential antagonism between these groups...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} has shown that pigeons rely on an olfactory-based navigational map when homing from unfamiliar locations. Previous studies on pigeons released with one <b>nostril</b> occluded highlighted an asymmetry in favour of the right <b>nostril,</b> particularly concerning the initial orientation performance of naïve birds. Nevertheless, all pigeons experiencing only unilateral olfactory input showed impaired homing, regardless {{of the side of}} the occluded <b>nostril.</b> So far this phenomenon has been documented only by observing the birds’ vanishing bearings. In the present work we recorded the flight tracks of pigeons with previous homing experience equipped with a GPS data logger and released from an unfamiliar location with the right or the left <b>nostril</b> occluded. The analysis of the tracks revealed that the flight path of the birds with the right <b>nostril</b> occluded was more tortuous than that of unmanipulated controls. Moreover, the pigeons smelling with the left <b>nostril</b> interrupted their journey significantly more frequently and displayed more exploratory activity than the control birds, e. g. during flights around a stopover site. These data suggest a more important involvement of the right olfactory system in processing the olfactory information needed for the operation of the navigational map...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess <b>nostril</b> {{symmetry}} and alveolar cleft width {{in infants}} with unilateral cleft lip and palate following presurgical nasoalveolar molding (NAM). Sample and Methods: Fifty-seven newborn patients underwent presurgical nasoalveolar molding. Magnified basal view facial photos were taken at four different times: initial visit (T 1), before cheiloplasty (T 2), 1 month after cheilo-plasty (T 3), and 1 year of age (T 4). Direct measurements from the photos in-cluded: (1) <b>nostril</b> width on the affected and nonaffected side; (2) <b>nostril</b> height on the affected and nonaffected side; (3) columella—nasal base angle; and (4) {{width of the}} alveolar cleft. <b>Nostril</b> width and height data were used to calculate a ratio of affected to nonaffected side.

5|$|The <b>nostrils</b> in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the {{olfactory}} tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal <b>nostrils,</b> but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
