40|$|The {{results and}} {{analyses}} of aerodynamic and acoustic studies {{conducted on the}} small scale noise and wind tunnel tests of upper surface blowing <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> concepts are presented. Various types of <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> concepts were tested.

In addition, aerodynamic tests were continued on a similar multi-slotted <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap,</b> but with 14 slots. All three types of <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> concepts tested appear to be about equal in overall aerodynamic performance but with the split flow nozzle somewhat better than the other two nozzle flaps in the landing approach mode.

Gruhn et al., Aerospace Science and Technology 4 (2000) 555 - 565 [, we examine the flow at a SERN nozzle for a future hypersonic cruise vehicle with help of a nozzle/afterbody wind tunnel model.

Based on the experiments and recent studies, a geoemtry for the <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> of the ference configuration ELAC of the Collaborative Research Center 253 of the Aachen University of Technology is suggested. Numerical studies result in an improved axial thrust going along with an improved thrust vector angle for this new flap in the whole examined Mach range between 1. 23 and 7. The improvements of up to 11 percent in axial thrust coefficient and up to 15 ° in thrust vector angle at low Mach numbers exceed the progresses made for the nozzle of the nozzle/afterbody model in the former study...|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} of aircraft fighters requires higher engine performance and enhanced stealth characteristics for air superiority. A Lockheed-Martin/Boeing aircraft with a Pratt & Whitney F 119 engine was selected by the Air Force for the next advanced tactical fighter (ATF). As part of this program, the NASA Lewis Research Center entered into a cooperative test program with Pratt & Whitney along with the Air Force to study the performance for various advanced nozzle concepts for the F 119 engine. The area of interest was to measure the internal performance (both thrust and flow coefficients) of <b>nozzle</b> <b>flaps</b> redesigned for low observability with minimal performance loss. The experimental program was successfully completed May 1995 in Lewis' CE- 22 facility. The models were tested {{over a wide range}} of geometric variations and nozzle pressure ratios.

40|$|This {{paper is}} to present a {{thermomechanical}} topology optimization formulation. By designing structures that support specific nondesignable domain, optimization is to suppress the stress level in the nondesignable domain and maintain global stiffness simultaneously.

Sensitivity analysis employs adjoint method to derive the global stress measure with respect to the topological pseudodensity variables. Some particular behaviors in thermomechanical topology optimization of elastic supports, such as the influence of different thermomechanical loads and the existence of intermediate material, are also analyzed numerically. Finally, examples of elastic supports on a cantilever beam and a <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> under different thermomechanical loads are tested with reasonable optimized design obtained...|$|E
40|$|A turbine-engine-based hybrid {{propulsion}} system is described. Turbojet engines are integrated with a single-throat ramjet {{so as to}} minimize variable geometry and eliminate redundant propulsion components. The result is a simple, lightweight system that is operable from takeoff to high Mach numbers. Non-afterburning turbojets are mounted within the ramjet duct. They exhaust through a converging-diverging (C-D) nozzle into a common ramjet burner section. At low speed the ejector effect of the C-D nozzle aerodynamically isolates the relatively high pressure turbojet exhaust stream from the ramjet duct. As the Mach number increases, and the turbojet pressure ratio diminishes, the system is biased naturally toward ramjet operation. The common ramjet burner is fueled with hydrogen and thermally choked, thus avoiding the weight and complexity of a variable geometry, split-flow exhaust system. The mixed-compression supersonic inlet and subsonic diffuser are also common to both the turbojet and ramjet cycles. As the compressor face total temperature limit is approached, a two-position flap within the inlet is actuated, which closes off the turbojet inlet and provides increased internal contraction for ramjet operation. Similar actuation of the turbojet C-D <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> completes the enclosure of the turbojet. Performance of the hybrid system is compared herein {{to that of the}} discrete turbojet and ramjet engines from takeoff to Mach 6. The specific impulse of the hybrid system falls below that of the non-integrated turbojet and ramjet because of ejector and Rayleigh losses. Unlike the discrete turbojet or ramjet however, the hybrid system produces thrust over the entire Mach number range. An alternate mode of operation for takeoff and low speed is also described. In this mode the C-D <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> is deflected to a third position, which closes off the ramjet duct and eliminates the ejector total pressure loss...|$|E

The static pressure along the expansion ramp and the <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> was measured at varying total temperatures of the nozzle flow between 300 K and 1000 K. Additional information about the flow was gained by Schlieren optics. It was found that the axial thrust was increased by up to 1. 5 per cent with increasing air temperature.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{optimize}} geometric {{design for the}} flaps of an ejector nozzle, coupled computation investigations on flow field and solid temperature filed of the nozzle were conducted and presented in this paper. Finite volume method is employed to solve flow Navier-Stokes equations. For the calculation of convective fluxes, numerical dissipation in shear layer and total enthalpy non-conservation passing strong shock can be eliminated {{with the help of}} modified Roe scheme while the resolution of shock wave and entropy condition are satisfied. Diffusive fluxes are evaluated by central differencing scheme which can dispel possible odd-and-even decoupling modes. Time-stepping is executed using LUSGS implicit method with multigrid acceleration. Diffusive equation of solid temperature field is discretized applying central difference method of two order accuracy.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the flow field at a {{two-dimensional}} SERN-Nozzle. Main focus lies on the flow around the <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> and the occurring separation of the boundary-layer of the outer flow. The objective {{is to get a}} better understanding of the interacting flow fields and to improve the nozzle performance by an optimized flap geometry. In particular this means a higher axial thrust coefficient and a smaller rotation of the thrust vector in the transonic range. To analyse the flow field two-dimensional numerical calculations and wind tunnel experiments in the hypersonic wind tunnel facility H 2 K of the DLR in Cologne are utilized. The location of the boundary-layer separation is measured depending on different Reynolds numbers and different nozzle pressure ratios, and a criterion to predict the separation location depending on the static pressure is derived. Further on, the influence of the Reynolds number on a three-dimensional corner flow upstream of the flap is shown. Different nozzle configurations are tested and the results are applied to the flap of the hypersonic configuration ELAC of the collaborative research center 253. Numerical simulations confirm the obtained improvements concerning the axial thrust coefficient and the rotating thrust vector in the Mach number range between Ma = 1. 23 and Ma = 7. Further studies deal with the changes of the flow field when the nozzle flow is heated to temperatures up to 1000 K. Focal point is the influence of temperature effects such as the change of viscosity or the change of the ratio of specific heats. With increasing temperature (and constant nozzle pressure ratio) the position of the nozzle shocks vary and the nozzle plume widens. Further on, the static pressure at the expansion ramp is increased. This pressure increase exceeds the pressure increase expected by the decreasing ratio of specific heats, and thus the axial thrust coefficient is increased, too.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} subsonic aerodynamic {{panel code}} (VSAERO) {{was used to}} predict the effects of upper and lower external <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap</b> geometry on the external afterbody/nozzle pressure coefficient distributions and external nozzle drag of nonaxisymmetric convergent-divergent exhaust nozzles having parallel external sidewalls installed on a generic twin-engine high performance aircraft model. Nozzle static pressure coefficient distributions along {{the upper and lower}} surfaces near the model centerline and near the outer edges (corner) of the two surfaces were calculated, and nozzle drag was predicted using these surface pressure distributions. A comparison between the theoretical predictions and experimental wind tunnel data is made to evaluate the utility of the code in calculating the flow about these types of non-axisymmetric afterbody configurations. For free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 60 and 0. 90, the conditions where the flows were attached on the boattails yielded the best comparison between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data. For the Boattail terminal angles of greater than 15 deg., the experimental data for M = 0. 60 and 0. 90 indicated areas of separated flow, so the theoretical predictions failed to match the experimental data.

50|$|Ejector {{refers to}} the pumping action of the very hot, high speed, engine exhaust entraining (ejecting) a {{surrounding}} airflow which, together with the internal geometry of the secondary, or diverging, nozzle controls {{the expansion of the}} engine exhaust. At subsonic speeds, the airflow constricts the exhaust to a convergent shape. When afterburning is selected and the aircraft speeds up, the two nozzles dilate, which allows the exhaust to form a convergent-divergent shape, speeding the exhaust gasses past Mach 1. More complex engine installations use a tertiary airflow to reduce exit area at low speeds. Advantages of the ejector nozzle are relative simplicity and reliability in cases where the secondary <b>nozzle</b> <b>flaps</b> are positioned by pressure forces. The ejector nozzle is also able to use air which has been ingested by the intake but which is not required by the engine. The amount of this air varies significantly across the flight envelope and ejector nozzles are well suited to matching the airflow between the intake system and engine. Efficient use of this air in the nozzle was a prime requirement for aircraft that had to cruise efficiently at high supersonic speeds for prolonged periods, hence its use in the SR-71, Concorde and XB-70 Valkyrie.|$|R

40|$|A three-Dimensional {{computational}} model {{is used to}} simulate flow in a non-axisymmetric, convergent-divergent nozzle incorporating porous cavities for shock-boundary layer interaction control. The nozzle has an expansion ratio (exit area/throat area) of 1. 797 and a design nozzle pressure ratio of 8. 78. Flow fields for the baseline nozzle (no porosity) and for the nozzle with porous surfaces of 10 % openness are computed for Nozzle Pressure Ratio (NPR) varying from 1. 29 to 9. 54. The three dimensional computational results indicate that baseline (no porosity) nozzle performance is dominated by unstable, shock-induced, boundary-layer separation at over-expanded conditions. For NPR {{less than or equal}} to 1. 8, the separation is three dimensional, somewhat unsteady, and confined to a bubble (with partial reattachment over the <b>nozzle</b> <b>flap).</b> For NPR greater than or equal to 2. 0, separation is steady and fully detached, and becomes more two dimensional as NPR increased. Numerical simulation of porous configurations indicates that a porous patch is capable of controlling off design separation in the nozzle by either alleviating separation or by encouraging stable separation of the exhaust flow. In the present paper, computational simulation results, wall centerline pressure, mach contours, and thrust efficiency ratio are presented, discussed and compared with experimental data.

The tests were made with flap deflections from 45 degrees to 85 degrees and with pressure ratios across the <b>flap</b> <b>nozzles</b> from sub-critical up to 2. 9. A limited study of the effects of nozzle location and configuration on the efficiency of the flap was made. Measurements of the lift, drag, and pitching moment were made for Reynolds numbers from 5. 8 to 10. 1 x 10 (6). Measurements were also made of the weight rate of flow, pressure, and temperature of the air supplied to the <b>flap</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The results show that blowing on the deflected flap produced large flap lift increments. The amount of air required to prevent flow separation on the flap was significantly less than that estimated from published two-dimensional data. When the amount of air ejected over the flap was just sufficient to prevent flow separation, the lift increment obtained agreed well with linear inviscid fluid theory up to flap deflections of 60 degrees. The flap lift increment at 85 degrees flap deflection was about 80 percent of that predicted theoretically. With larger amounts of air blown over the flap, these lift increments could be significantly increased. It was found that the performance of the flap was relatively insensitive to the location of the <b>flap</b> <b>nozzle,</b> to spacers in the nozzle, and to flow disturbances such as those caused by leading-edge slats or discontinuities on the wing or flap surfaces.

The noise data are scaled to a 200, 000 -lb TOGW four-engine airplane and are presented in terms of perceived noise level and one-third octave band sound pressure level. Comparisons are made with the noise levels produced by an augmentor wing airplane fitted with a three-element acoustically lined augmentor flap. The static performance is presented in terms of thrust recovery and effective turning angle...|$|R
