[...] The structures of SAMs are commonly determined using scanning probe microscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). STM {{has been able to}} help understand the mechanisms of SAM formation as well as determine the important structural features that lend SAMs their integrity as surface-stable entities. In particular STM can image the shape, spatial distribution, terminal groups and their packing structure. AFM offers an equally powerful tool without the requirement of the SAM being conducting or semi-conducting. AFM has been used to determine chemical functionality, conductance, magnetic properties, surface charge, and frictional forces of SAMs. More recently, however, diffractive methods have also been used. The structure can be used to characterize the kinetics and defects found on the monolayer surface. These techniques have also shown physical differences between SAMs with planar substrates and nanoparticle substrates.|$|E

60|$|Approaching Adelaide we {{dismounted}} {{from the}} train, as the French say, and were driven {{in an open}} carriage over the hills and along their slopes to the city. It was an excursion of an hour or two, and the charm of {{it could not be}} overstated, I think. The road wound around gaps and gorges, and offered all varieties of scenery and prospect--mountains, crags, country homes, gardens, forests--color, color, color everywhere, and the air fine and fresh, the skies blue, and not a shred of cloud to mar the downpour of the brilliant sunshine.

The alluvial coast having no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland. The guidance of a form flattened and uneven at the top like a grinder tooth, and of another smooth, saddle-backed summit, had to be searched for within the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and float like a dry fiery mist, filling the air, ascending from the water, shrouding the distances, scorching to the eye. In this veil of light the <b>near</b> <b>edge</b> of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity. Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon, its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves.|$|E

And the keenness of the more rarefied air into which they ascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration. He looked up and saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then going lower and less apprehensively, he saw the slender figure of the Wind-Vane keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and growing smaller every moment.

We conducted a 2 -year radiotelemetry study of Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) reproductive success and fledgling survival in a 24 -ha forested park in a residential area of Lake Oswego, Oregon. In corroboration of previous research on this species, we found (1) that Spotted Towhees nested closer to the edge between the park and residential neighborhoods than expected by chance, and (2) that pairs nesting <b>near</b> <b>edges</b> produced the largest and most offspring. However, fates were reversed during the postfledging period. Thirty-six of 52 fledglings survived the 27 -day tracking period, and although fledglings {{were more likely to be}} found <b>near</b> <b>edges</b> than in the interior, fledglings <b>near</b> <b>edges</b> had a far higher probability of dying. All deaths were from predation, and at least 11 of 16 predation events were attributable to Domestic Cats (Felis catus) and Western Screech-Owls (Megascops kennicottii). A stochastic model that incorporated probability of nest success, nestling production from successful nests, and fledgling survival showed that the number of independent offspring produced per nest was greatest in the park interior. Heavy use of, and apparent preference for, edge by nesting Spotted Towhees, coupled with high fledgling mortality <b>near</b> <b>edges,</b> created a severe ecological trap that was not apparent until the final stage of parental care. Hence, failure to document offspring survival in the late stages of reproduction may lead to incorrect assessment of habitat suitability and poor management decisions...|$|R
60|$|The {{moonlight}} was {{so bright}} {{that through the}} thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the <b>near</b> <b>edge</b> of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognized the Count, in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension. His right hand gripped her by {{the back of the}} neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion. The great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge, and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth, clamped together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky. And when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin. From her throat trickled a thin stream of blood. Her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} microclimatic edge gradients {{associated with}} grassy powerlines, paved highways and perennial creeks in wet tropical forest in northeastern Australia during {{wet and dry}} seasons. Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, canopy temperature, soil moisture, and air speed {{in the rain forest}} understory were measured during traverses perpendicular to the forest edge. Light intensity was elevated <b>near</b> the <b>edges</b> of powerlines, highways, and creeks, but this effect was strongest for creek edges. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were elevated <b>near</b> powerline <b>edges</b> in the dry season and highway edges in both wet and dry seasons but were not elevated <b>near</b> creek <b>edges</b> in either season. In contrast, soil moisture was lowered <b>near</b> creek <b>edges</b> but not <b>near</b> either powerline or highway edges. No edge gradients were detected for air speed. Canopy temperature was elevated <b>near</b> highway <b>edges</b> and lowered <b>near</b> powerline <b>edges</b> in the wet season but no edge gradients in canopy temperature were detected <b>near</b> creek <b>edges</b> in either the wet or the dry season. We suggest that these different edge gradients may be largely the result of differences in the fluxes of latent and sensible heat within each type of linear canopy opening, with periodic flood disturbance assisting by maintaining a more open canopy <b>near</b> creek <b>edges.</b> Our data indicate that the nature of the linear canopy opening is at least as important as the width in determining the nature and severity of microclimatic edge effects, analogous to the "matrix effect" of traditional fragmentation studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of edge proximity on woodland plants is a well-established research area, yet the {{influence of}} dual edge exposure has rarely been investigated. This novel research aims to establish whether proximity to two edges has any additive influence on Ancient Woodland Indicator (AWI) species presence relative to proximity to a single edge. Several AWI species are threatened and thus specific conservation priorities, while Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW) itself is often highly fragmented: almost half of remnant patches are less than 5 ha, which increases the potential for dual edge effects. Here, systematic mapping of herbaceous AWI species was conducted in 310 vegetation plots in two formerly-connected ASNW fragments in South-West England. Linear regression modelling revealed that distance to <b>nearest</b> <b>edge</b> and distance to second <b>nearest</b> <b>edge</b> were both univariately positively correlated with AWI species richness. After distance from <b>nearest</b> <b>edge</b> was entered into a multivariate model first, distance from second edge was entered in a second optional step after meeting stepwise criteria. The resultant multivariate model was more significant, and explained more variance, than either variable in isolation, indicating an additive effect of dual edge exposure. Likewise, binary logistic regression modelling showed presence of individual AWI species (Anemone nemorosa, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Lamiastrum galaeobdolon and Paris quadrifolia) was significantly related not only to distance from the nearest and second <b>nearest</b> <b>edges</b> in isolation, but significantly more strongly by the additive effect of distance from both edges in a single model. We discuss {{the implications of these}} findings from community ecology and conservation perspectives.

40|$|AbstractThe spatial {{distribution}} of eggs laid over a 48 -h period by individual female almond moths, Cadra cautella Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was examined in bioassays where peanuts covered either the center quarter (quarter-coverage) or the whole (whole-coverage) of a 120 -cm square arena gridded into 3 by 3 -cm cells. The mean total of eggs laid in quarter-coverage bioassays was {{not significantly different from}} the mean in whole-coverage bioassays, i. e., neither food coverage limited oviposition. However, the maximum count of eggs laid in any cell was higher in whole- than in quarter-coverage bioassays, and eggs were more aggregated <b>near</b> <b>edges</b> of the arena in whole-coverage bioassays than <b>near</b> <b>edges</b> of the peanuts in quarter-coverage bioassays. In addition, eggs were aggregated near the release point where females initially encountered food cues. These results suggest that almond moth oviposition behavior in continuous areas of peanuts was similar to patterns observed previously for stored-product insect oviposition in small, scattered food patches. In both cases, females walked or flew between separate oviposition events where eggs were laid in small clumps or lines. Possible behaviors resulting in aggregations of eggs <b>near</b> <b>edges</b> of food, walls, boundaries, or entrances are discussed and implications for precision targeting of insects in food storage areas are considered...|$|R
