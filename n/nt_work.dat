40|$|A {{microgrid}} {{is basically}} the integration of small scale distributed energ y resources within a locality. Microgrids are mainly renewable energy driven with ene rgy stor- age backups. The primary motivation behind the emergence of micro grid is to have energy self-sustainability within a locality through a cost-effective a nd reliable in- frastructure. Microgrids can be installed at industrial parks, aca demic campuses, residential complexes and remote villages {{with or without the}} provisio n of utility grid connection. In the case of utility grid failure, a microgrid can continu e operation in the islanded mode serving the critical loads. During grid-connected operation, the power exchange with the utility grid can be optimized based upon the p revailing grid energy price. However, because of being a low inertia system, the d ynamics of a microgrid needs to be very carefully addressed so as to ensure a st able system op- eration. Unlike conventional power systems, system level studies are often required for a microgrid with regard to the controller parameter tuning. The particular exer- cise requires the small-signal modeling of the entire microgrid system, followed by an eigenvalue analysis and optimization. The main objective of the prese <b>nt</b> <b>work</b> is to improve the system stability through appropriate tuning of contro l parameter...|$|E
40|$|The {{visual cortex}} of mammals is {{immature}} at birth, both anatomically and physiologically, and develops gradually {{in the first}} weeks and months o f postnatal life. Although the initial organization of neural circuits r elies {{on a variety of}} molecular cues that guide axons to appropriate tar get structures, the final specification of patterned connections is wide ly held to depend on patterns of competitive neuronal activity, generate d either by circuits intrinsic to the developing brain or by early exper ience. Much of this sculpting of neuronal connections is thought to occu r during so-called critical periods, when circuits are particularly susc eptible to external sensory inputs. Since the pioneering work of Hubel a nd Wiesel in the  60, research in cat, monkey and humans has led to a ce ntral dogma that beyond this critical period the brain only retains a re duced capacity for such sensory-driven reorganization, likely to lend st ructural and functional stability to the adult cortical circuitry. Curre <b>nt</b> <b>work</b> in rodents however challenges this view since specific treatment s are capable of reinstating substantial cortical plasticity in the adul t. The goal of our work was to study this adult cortical reorganization in detail, since knowledge of the mechanisms of life-long recovery of funct ion holds great promise towards the development of new therapies for reh abilitation and recovery from visual system injuries. Although the mouse has long been ignored in this type of research becaus e of its poor visual acuity and lack of cortical columnar organization, it has been recently introduced as model system, mainly because of the p otential targeted gene disruption and transgene expression holds to adva nce our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in brain plasticity. However in spite of its recent popularity, no conse nsus exists about the mouse visual system structural and functional orga nization. Clearly a comprehensive study was needed in which visual activity patter ns of different regions in mouse cerebral cortex are mapped to set the s tage for future studies of cortical plasticity in the mouse. We therefor e opted to use a very simple visual subdivision based on monocular and b inocular inputs. In Chapter 2 we first attempted to examine this segregated input into th e visual cortex through tracer injections into one eye of adult mice. However, while providing interesting information on subcortical visu al targets, the main goal of this study was not reached. A combination of deprivation of one eye and stimulation of the remaining eye to identify its input in visual cortex proved to be more succesfull. As described in Chapter 3, the screening consisted of the detection of zif 268, an immediate early gene whose transcription is swiftly up-regul ated following sensory stimulation and thus reflects stimulation-induced activity. To delineate {{the full extent of the}} cortical region processin g visual information we analyzed the cortex of mice in which both eyes w ere surgically removed resulting in total light deprivation ànd lac k of spontaneous retinal activity and thus complete inactivation of pure visually driven cortical neurons. Right eye monocular enucleation allow ed the identification of eye-specific subdivisions within this visual co rtex. Summarized, mouse visual cortex consisted of one well defined bino cular zone located across the border of primary and lateral secondary vi sual area, which was flanked by monocularly driven cortex containing bin ocular units at anteromedial coordinates. Furthermore, both lateral and medial extrastriate cortex remained slightly activated following enuclea tion due to a persisting non-visual input. Since literature already suggested the occurrence of OD shifts well into adulthood, the goal of the work presented in Chapter 4 was to examine t his type of cortical reorganization in detail in the mouse visual system and to provide a timeline in which it occurs. Using the information of the previous chapter as a reference map, we established to what extent e ach of these functional subdivisions of visual cortex take part in corti cal reorganization upon enucleation by analyzing their time-dependent re activation using in situ hybridization for the activity reporter gene zi f 268. Briefly, there seemed to be two waves of recovery, the first chara cterized by the expansion of the supragranular binocular zone of V 1 and V 2 L as based on a spreading out of high zif 268 expression from this most central region in the visual cortex outwards. This supragranular reacti vation first occurred in striate monocular cortex, 3 weeks after enuclea tion and after 5 weeks also extrastriate cortex displayed recovery of ac tivity in its superficial layers. The second wave affected the infragran ular layers and was initiated at the outer border of the visual cortex w ith neighboring non-visual cortex and progressed inwards. Except for ant erior V 2 L, it did not occur until 5 weeks post-enucleation and was accom panied by hyper-activity of the adjacent non-visual cortex. Since this infragranular recovery was not observed when measuring visual ly evoked responses or through in situ hybridization for the activi ty marker arc, and since the deeper reactivation was initiated at the bo rder with non-visual cortex and accompanied by a hyperactivation of thes e extra-visual regions, we chose to explore the possibility of a substan tial non-visual contribution to adult visual cortex reorganization. To t est this hypothesis, we combined monocular enucleation with the inactiva tion of the remaining eye or a second sensory modality, either by trimmi ng the vibrissae to limit somatosensory input or by immobilizing the coc hlea to reduce auditory input. Both lack of complete visual cortex deact ivation upon enucleation of the remaining eye, and strong effects of aud itory and somatosensory deprivation on infragranular visual cortex confi rmed our theory of non-visually driven reorganization. To conclude, not only did we find evidence for a non-visual input in ext rastriate visual cortex, as binocular enucleation did not completely abo lish zif 268 labeling, we also gathered a substantial amount of data sugg esting a partial non-visually driven restoration of cortical activity. F irst, in contrast to supragranular expansion of the binocular zone, infr agranular recovery appeared to be initiated at the border with neighbori ng non-visual cortex and was accompanied by a hyperactivation of the adj acent somatosensory and auditory cortex. Second, comparison with a previ ous study on arc expression in monocularly deprived mice conf irmed our hypothesis. Third, subsequent enucleation of the remaining eye did not result in basal zif 268 levels as would be expected if recovery had been purely visually driven. And finally, deprivation of both somato sensory and auditory input, resulted in a strong decrease of activity in infragranular layers of visual cortex. Our work on adult mice thus sugg ests cross-modal plasticity in this popular animal model and calls for a n in-depth investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying this for m of cortical plasticity. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{main issue}} in the {{development}} of transdermal patches made of poly(ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate) (Eudragit® NE 40 D, PMM) is the shrinkage phenomenon during the spreading of the latex onto the release liner. To solve this problem, the latex is usually freeze-dried and then re-dissolved in an organic solvent (method 1). To simplify the production process, we prepared an adhesive matrix by adding to the commercial PMM latex a plasticizer and an additive (anti-shrinkage agent) that avoids the shrinkage of the water dispersion spread onto the release liner (method 2). In some cases the active ingredient itself, such as potassium diclofenac (DK) and nicotine (<b>NT),</b> <b>works</b> as anti-shrinkage agent. In this work, the effects of the preparation method, types and concentrations of the plasticizer (triacetin and tributyl citrate) on the adhesive properties of the transdermal patches were investigated. The adhesive properties of the prepared patch were determined by texture analysis, peel adhesion test and shear adhesion. The PMM/plasticizer interactions were evaluated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the in vitro skin permeation profiles of DK and NT released from the patch were determined by Franz cell method. Generally speaking, the variables that mainly modify the adhesive properties are the concentration and type of the plasticizer. The skin permeation profiles of DK and NT from the patch prepared by method 2 overlapped with those obtained with the commercial products. The results underline that the PMM latex can be used conveniently {{in the development of}} transdermal patches...|$|R

40|$|Bandit {{methods for}} black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, {{are used in}} a variety of {{applications}} including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment design. Recently, multi-fidelity methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data N and/or few training iterations T.

The application is basically a learning machine that integrates fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural network (ANN), and generic algorithm (GA) schemes to process the image, run the learning process, and finally detect the anomalies or defects. The system acquires the image, performs segmentation to separate the object being tested from the background, preprocesses the image using fuzzy reasoning, performs the final segmentation using fuzzy reasoning techniques to retrieve regions with potential anomalies or defects, and finally retrieves them using a learning model built via ANN and GA techniques. FL provides a powerful framework for knowledge representation and overcomes uncertainty and vagueness typically found in image analysis. ANN provides learning capabilities, and GA leads to robust learning results. An application prototype currently runs on a regular PC under Windows <b>NT,</b> and preliminary <b>work</b> has been performed to build an embedded version with multiple image processors. The application prototype is being tested at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, to visually detect anomalies along slide basket cables utilized by the astronauts to evacuate the NASA Shuttle launch pad in an emergency. The potential applications of this anomaly detection system in an open environment are quite wide. Another current, potentially viable application at NASA is in detecting anomalies of the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter's radiator panels...|$|R
40|$|This Final Technical Report {{summarizes}} {{the research and}} development (R&D) work performed by Stolar Research Corporation (Stolar) under U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Contract Number DE-FC 26 - 04 <b>NT</b> 15477. This <b>work</b> involved the development of radar navigation and radio data transmission systems for integration with microhole coiled tubing bottom hole assemblies. Under this contract, Stolar designed, fabricated, and laboratory and field tested two advanced technologies of importance to the future growth of the U. S. oil and gas industry: (1) real-time measurement-while-drilling (MWD) for guidance and navigation of coiled tubing drilling in hydrocarbon reservoirs and (2) two-way inductive radio data transmission on coiled tubing for real-time, subsurface-to-surface data transmission. The operating specifications for these technologies are compatible with 3. 5 -inch boreholes drilled to a true vertical depth (TVD) of 5, 000 feet, which is typical of coiled tubing drilling applications. These two technologies (i. e., the Stolar Data Transmission System and Drill String Radar) were developed into pre-commercial prototypes and tested successfully in simulated coiled tubing drilling conditions. Integration of these two technologies provides a real-time geosteering capability with extremely quick response times. Stolar is conducting additional work required to transition the Drill String Radar into a true commercial product. The results of this advanced development work should be an important step in the expanded commercialization of advanced coiled tubing microhole drilling equipment for use in U. S. hydrocarbon reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Neurotensin receptors {{have been}} studied as {{molecular}} targets {{for the treatment of}} pain, schizophrenia, addiction, or cancer. Neurotensin (NT) and Contulakin-G, a glycopeptide isolated from a predatory cone snail Conus geographus, share a sequence similarity at the C-terminus, which is critical for activation of neurotensin receptors. Both peptides are potent analgesics, although affinity and agonist potency of Contulakin-G toward neurotensin receptors are significantly lower, as compared to those for <b>NT.</b> In this <b>work,</b> we show that the weaker agonist properties of Contulakin-G result in inducing significantly less desensitization of neurotensin receptors and preserving their cell-surface density. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies suggested that both glycosylation and charged amino acid residues in Contulakin-G or NT played important roles in desensitizing neurotensin receptors. Computational modeling studies of human neurotensin receptor NTS 1 and Contulakin-G confirmed the role of glycosylation in weakening interactions with the receptors. Based on available SAR data, we designed, synthesized and characterized an analog of Contulakin-G in which the glycosylated amino acid residue, Gal-GalNAc-Thr 10, was replaced by memantine-Glu 10 residue. This analog exhibited comparable agonist potency and weaker desensitization properties as compared to that of Contulakin-G, while producing analgesia in the animal model of acute pain following systemic administration. We discuss our study in the context of feasibility and safety of developing NT therapeutic agents with improved penetration across the blood-brain barrier. Our work supports engineering peptide-based agonists with diverse abilities to desensitize G-protein coupled receptors and further emphasizes opportunities for conotoxin as novel pharmacological tools and drug candidates...|$|R
