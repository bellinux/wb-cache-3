25|$|The {{most popular}} majors at Middlebury by <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> {{graduates}} are: economics, international studies, English and American literatures, political science, psychology, and environmental studies. Close to 40 percent of graduating seniors choose a single major {{in a traditional}} academic discipline, and about 30 percent of students complete a double or joint major combining two disciplines. Another 30 percent of students major {{in one of the}} College's interdisciplinary programs.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer has had {{a massive}} {{influence}} upon later thinkers, though more so in the arts (especially literature and music) and psychology than in philosophy. His popularity peaked {{in the early twentieth}} century, especially during the Modernist era, and waned somewhat thereafter. Nevertheless, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer. His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to evolutionary theory and modern evolutionary psychology.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} small <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> other {{minority}} groups. Tai peoples in Cambodia include the Lao along the Mekong at the northeast border, Thai (urban and rural), and the culturally Burmese Kola, who have visibly influenced {{the culture of}} Pailin Province. Even smaller <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> Hmong immigrants reside along the Lao border and various Burmese peoples have immigrated to the capital, Phnom Penh.|$|R

25|$|Under Pope Shenouda III, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> renovations were {{performed}} at the monastery. An asphalt road to the monastery was built, {{and there have been}} several major cultivation projects. In addition, six water pumps, a sheepfold, a henhouse and two generators were added, together with the construction of new residential cells {{both inside and outside the}} monastery proper. There is now a clinic and a pharmacy to serve the monks, as well as a spacious retreat center for conferences and a large, two story guesthouse that was opened in January 1981.|$|E
25|$|House {{demolition}} {{is primarily}} a military tactic which {{has been used in}} many conflicts for a variety of purposes. It has been employed as a scorched earth tactic to deprive the advancing enemy of food and shelter, or to wreck the enemy's economy and infrastructure. It has also been used for purposes of counter-insurgency and ethnic cleansing. Systematic house demolition has been a notable factor in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> or ongoing conflicts including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Darfur conflict in Sudan, the Iraq War, the Vietnam War, the Yugoslav wars and the Caucasian conflicts of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|A third view, {{presented}} in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> evaluations, is that Jutland, the last major fleet action between battleships, illustrated the irrelevance of battleship fleets following {{the development of the}} submarine, mine and torpedo. In this view, the most important consequence of Jutland was the decision of the Germans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. Although large numbers of battleships were constructed in the decades between the wars, {{it has been argued that}} this outcome reflected the social dominance among naval decision-makers of battleship advocates who constrained technological choices to fit traditional paradigms of fleet action. Battleships played a relatively minor role in World War II, in which the submarine and aircraft carrier emerged as the dominant offensive weapons of naval warfare.|$|E
5000|$|Large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> {{immigrants}} from Portugal (the so-called [...] "Portuguese Party"), {{who wanted to}} keep their privileges or who were still loyal to the metropolitan government. These were found both among the wealthier parts of the population, as businessmen controlling Brazil's international trade, and the lower ones, as tradesmen and free urban workers (the Brazilian elite was mostly rural).|$|R

In the 1991 census the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Muslims in Portugal was under 10,000. The main Mosque in Portugal is the Lisbon Mosque. The majority of Muslims {{in the country}} are Sunnis, followed by approximately 5,000 to 7,000 Sevener Ismā'īlī Shīʻa Muslims. There is also a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Ahmadiyya Muslims.|$|R

In 2013, the Student Services Centre, which is a {{single point of contact}} for all non-academic enquiries, was opened in the Windsor Building. The Drama Department expanded its performance space {{with the opening of the}} Caryl Churchill Theatre, which seats almost 200 audience members across two levels and has a third floor for technical operation, in 2013. The department also uses the onsite 19th-century boilerhouse, which was converted into a performance space with a sprung dance floor in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Sarkes Tarzian sold WTTV to Teleco for $26.5 {{million in}} September 1978; {{the station was}} then sold to the Tel-Am Corporation in March 1984. By the mid-1980s, WTTV began airing more {{cartoons}} and first-run syndicated talk shows during the daytime hours, {{as well as an}} increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> off-network sitcoms during the evening. The station also began broadcasting 24 hours a day of programming by that time. Although {{it was one of the}} strongest independent stations in the country, WTTV opted against affiliating with the upstart Fox network in 1986 – one of the few long-established independents to do so. This was mainly because most of the markets in its large cable footprint had enough stations to provide Fox affiliates of their own, making the prospect of being a multi-state Fox affiliate unattractive to channel 4. The Fox affiliation in the Indianapolis market instead went to eventual sister station WXIN (channel 59), which became a charter affiliate of the network when it launched on October 6 of that year.|$|E

Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> migrants from the rural areas use Trasyanka (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.|$|R

500|$|While critic Simon Reynolds {{says the}} style {{was tied to}} Southern California and its culture, Trainer says the style [...] "arguably" [...] emerged from {{numerous}} simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of [...] "post-noise neo-psychedelia". Reynolds identifies Pink, Clark, and Ferraro as the [...] "godparents of hypnagogic". He also singled out Pink as the central figure {{to what he calls}} the [...] "Altered Zones Generation", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, a sister site for Pitchfork. Pink gained recognition in the mid 2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds calls [...] "'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering {{in and out of the}} fog". Tiny Mix Tapes Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed [...] "at the nexus of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> popular movements" [...] including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as [...] "much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cuvier named {{this new}} species Caranx bartholomaei after the island {{from which the}} holotype was taken. The genus in which the taxon should be placed has proved contentious, and {{continues}} to be today with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> publications placing the species in Carangoides, while others still classify it within Caranx. This article follows the Fishbase and ITIS classification of Carangoides bartholomaei. The species predominant common name, [...] "yellow jack", comes from the colour the species turns as it gets older, with other common names including [...] "coolihoo" [...] and incorrectly, [...] "green jack".|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, Berger popularized {{the subject}} {{in a series of}} {{articles}} and books, most recently in the March 2008 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society (see reference below).

Systolic geometry is a rapidly developing field, featuring a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>recent</b> publications in leading journals. Recently (see the 2006 paper by Katz and Rudyak below), the link with the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category has emerged.
