25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} active information acquisition when the prediction model {{is meant to}} be applied on a targeted subset of the population. The goal is to label a pre-specified fraction of customers in the target or test set by iteratively querying for information from the non-target or training set. The number of queries is limited by an overall budget. Arising in the context of two rather disparate applications- banking and medical diagnosis, we pose the active information acquisition problem as a constrained optimization problem. We propose two greedy iterative algorithms for solving the above problem. We conduct experiments with synthetic data and compare results of our proposed algorithms with few other baseline approaches. The experimental results show that our proposed approaches perform better than the baseline schemes. Comment: The paper has been withdrawn by the authors. The current version is incomplete and the work is still on going. The algorithm gives poor results for a particular setting and we are working on it. However, we are not planning to submit a revision of the paper.

He filed and obtained a patent that covered tennis racquets with size 95-135 square inches. He also pioneered the development of the graphite racquet, which eventually became the industry standard, replacing wooden racquets.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{ascertain}} if similarities or {{differences exist}} in perceptions {{of quality of}} life (QoL) amongst nursing 10 home (NH) residents with different levels of cognitive impairment (CI). Method: Face-to-face interviews using a simple 15 -item semi-structured interview schedule with 61 older people with a CI (13 mild, 20 moderate and 28 severe) living in three Dublin area based NHs. Results: Four key themes of QoL with accompanying sub-themes were identified: (1) social contact, (2) attachment, (3) pleasurable activities and (4) affect. Whilst some similarities existed between the three groups, 15 results showed emerging differences, particularly between those with a mild and severe CI. In particular, the narratives of those with a severe CI reflected an absence of social contact, a quest for human contact {{and a lack of}} awareness of structured pleasurable activities. A large majority also reported feelings of loneliness, isolation and a search for home. Conclusions: Findings support the increasing evidence that people with a CI and even those with a probable 20 advanced dementia can often still communicate their views and preferences about what is important to them. Whilst apathy, depression and anxiety are common features of advanced dementia, the social inclusion of these people in the day-to-day ethos of NH life <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> careful consideration.

40|$|This {{research}} study investigated a new conceptual {{design for a}} modular structural configuration incorporating storage for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) within {{the base of the}} platform structure. The structure, referred to as a modified gravity base concrete structure (MGBCS), was envisioned specifically to be constructed at a suitable site off the coast of Kuwait. Coastal offshore bathometric information, environmental data and existing data on onshore facilities were examined in the site selection portion of the study. A finite element model of the MGBCS was developed using an industry standard finite element code that allows preliminary sizes of structural models to meet appropriate design codes. A variety of parametric and design load scenarios were investigated. This research tackles some preliminary issues that are adequate for an initial evaluation of the proposed design concept. The proposed design concept <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> scrutiny in order to be sufficiently developed as a concept where it can be confirmed as a truly viable concept and investment. It was confirmed that quartering sea conditions, waves approaching at a 45 degree angle, are the most critical scenarios for the terminal based on maximum values and ranges of shears and moments. In addition, there are several interesting issues in this concept that should be further looked at for this design to be further developed. The limitations of our study must be mitigated in future designs if the proposed design concept is to be carried to the implementation stage...|$|R
