25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We knew that there were strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E

He graduated in 1898, then worked as a lawyer in Halifax before setting up a law practice in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a short time, Dunn was drawn to the booming economy of Montreal, Quebec where he landed a position with one of the city's prominent law firms.|$|E

25|$|On 23 December 2009 PSV Eindhoven {{decided to}} loan out Reimond Manco until June to Peruvian club Juan Aurich. Juan Aurich {{had the chance}} to play the Copa Libertadores, the {{equivalent}} of the UEFA Champions League in South America, which would give Manco some high-calibre matches, but first they would have to get through the first round against Mexican side Estudiantes Tecos. In Juan Aurich's only pre-season friendly Manco came on in the 32nd minute for injured winger William Chiroque. The first leg of the Copa Libertadores tie was in Juan Aurich's homeground, Chiclayo, where the Peruvians won 2–0 in a dominating game where Manco showcased his great skill and destroyed the struggling Mexican team's defense. Estudiantes Tecos, on a five-game losing streak, firmly believed they could win it at home and qualify to the second round, setting up the first goal on the 43rd minute, after beating two defenders on the right flank and crossing perfectly to Luis Tejeda's head, who had also scored the two goals in Peru. Defender Wily Rivas received a red card in the 64th minute and Estudiantes began to press the Peruvians, who tried to hold their ground in defense. The Mexican side came back to score a goal but it was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> and Juan Aurich entered the group stage of the Libertadores by defeating Estudiantes Tecos 4–1 on aggregate. On 17 March 2010 Reimond Manco was chosen as Man of the Match in a 4–2 Copa Libertadores win over as of then undefeated group leaders Alianza Lima, where he provided an assist and scored a goal.|$|E
500|$|Adding to DuMont's {{troubles}} was the FCC's 1948 [...] "freeze" [...] {{on television}} license applications. This {{was done to}} sort out the thousands of applications that had come streaming in, but also to rethink the allocation and technical standards laid down prior to World War II. It became clear soon after the war that 12 channels ("channel 1" [...] had been removed from television broadcasting use because storms and other types of interference could severely affect the quality of signals on this channel) were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> for national television service. What was to be a six-month freeze lasted until 1952, when the FCC opened the UHF spectrum. The FCC, however, did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability. In order to see UHF stations, most people had to buy an expensive converter. Even then, the picture quality was marginal at best. Tied to this was a decision to restrict VHF allocations in medium- and smaller-sized markets. Television sets were not required to have all-channel tuning until 1964.|$|E

500|$|In 1902, Guillaume Grandidier {{described}} subfossil carnivoran remains {{from two}} caves on Madagascar as a larger [...] "variety" [...] {{of the living}} fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), C. ferox var. spelea. G. Petit, writing in 1935, considered spelea to represent a distinct species. Charles Lamberton reviewed subfossil and living Cryptoprocta in 1939 and agreed with Petit in recognizing two species, naming this species from a specimen found [...] at Ankazoabo Cave near Itampolo. The specific name spelea means [...] "cave" [...] and was given because of the location of its discovery. However, Lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of the living fossa, <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> to capture the range of variation in that species, and some later authors did not separate C.spelea and C.ferox as species. Steven Goodman and colleagues, using larger samples, compiled another set of Cryptoprocta measurements that was published in a 2004 article. They found that some subfossil Cryptoprocta fell outside the range of variation of living C.ferox, and identified those as representing C.spelea. Grandidier had not designated a type specimen for the species, and to maintain C.spelea as the name for the larger form of the fossa, Goodman and colleagues designated a specimen {{to serve as the}} type specimen (specifically, a neotype).|$|E
500|$|A half-hour later, Shinano {{was making}} 10 knots with a 13 degree list.

The engines shut down for lack of steam around 07:00, and Abe ordered all of the propulsion compartments evacuated an hour later. He then ordered the three outboard port boiler rooms flooded in a futile attempt to reduce the carrier's list. He also ordered Hamakaze and Isokaze to take her in tow.

As she heeled, water flowed into the open elevator well on her flight deck, sucking many swimming sailors back into the ship as she sank. A large exhaust vent below the flight deck also sucked many other sailors into the ship as she submerged.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels like {{just a few more}} levels for the original game", he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement". PC Zones review closed by commenting that [...] "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>enough</b> to it." ...|$|E
