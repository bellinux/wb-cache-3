5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme <b>negative</b> <b>G</b> forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E
25|$|Messerschmitt also {{conducted}} {{a series of}} flight tests with the series production Me 262. Dive tests determined that the Me 262 went out of control in a dive at Mach0.86, and that higher Mach numbers would cause a nose-down trim that the pilot could not counter. The resulting steepening of the dive would lead to even higher speeds and the airframe would disintegrate from excessive <b>negative</b> <b>g</b> loads.|$|E
25|$|Air Marshal Sholto Douglas {{expressed}} {{concerns that the}} Merlin-engine Spitfires were coming {{to the end of}} their developmental life, whereas the Fw 190 was only just beginning its career. At the time, he feared the enemy held the technological edge. Douglas determined that the Fw 190 was superior to the Spitfire V and also concluded that the Spitfire IX was also inferior in the climb and acceleration owing to <b>negative</b> <b>G</b> carburation. Douglas' fears would prove overly-pessimistic. The Spitfire IX would prove a clear match for the Fw 190A and the Griffon-engined Spitfire XIV would hold the edge on the type. In 1942 several tests were conducted by RAF pilots at the Royal Aircraft Establishment.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional lap bars {{that allow}} riders to {{experience}} so-called airtime, or <b>negative</b> <b>G's,</b> {{the sensation of}} floating above the seat, must be installed. Individual, ratcheting lap bars do not meet this requirement.|$|R
50|$|The coaster {{in recent}} years has been {{hampered}} with some roughness, along with being modified several times for incoming Water Park additions, where some of the four hills have been joined together making them much longer with less of a peak therefore significantly reducing the amount of <b>negative</b> <b>G's</b> experienced.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{begins with}} low swings which {{gradually}} get higher. After about 5 swings it reaches its full height of 75 ft and its {{top speed of}} 50 mph. The approximate angle the swings reach is 104 degrees. At {{the peak of the}} swing, riders feel strong <b>negative</b> <b>G's</b> and at the bottom, positive forces of up to 3.5 G. After 4 swings at its full height, the ride slows down quickly to a stop.|$|R
25|$|The Tiger {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} {{a wide range of}} combat missions, including armed reconnaissance and surveillance, anti-tank and close air support, escort and protection of friendly assets; and can operate during day or night in all-weather conditions, and has been designed to include operations in the aftermath of nuclear, biological, or chemical warfare. The Tiger can also be used in the maritime environment, able to operate from the decks of ships including frigates and during extreme weather conditions. Amongst the Tiger's notable qualities, it possesses very high levels of agility, much of which is attributed to the design of its 13-meter four-bladed hingeless main rotor; the Tiger can perform full loops and <b>negative</b> <b>g</b> manoeuvres. Power is provided by a pair of FADEC-controlled MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce MTR390 turboshaft engines.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under <b>negative</b> <b>G,</b> went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet {{from the bottom of the}} S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|E
2500|$|Float type carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once the float type carburetor is under <b>negative</b> <b>g</b> conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, the float lifts {{toward the top of}} the fuel bowl as the float becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than the float and the fuel. The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel inlet valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E

50|$|As well as rollercoasters, drop towers {{can provide}} the feeling of weightlessness. For example, {{in the case of}} The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Disney California Adventure, Tokyo DisneySea, and Disneyland Paris, the {{elevator}} drops riders faster than gravity normally would, causing them to rise off of their seats by several inches whilst being held down by only a seatbelt, creating the sensation of zero-G. Most drop towers, however, have shoulder bars, preventing riders from rising significantly from their seats, even where <b>negative</b> <b>Gs</b> are present.|$|R

2500|$|The Spitfire IX {{restored}} parity in speed; the Spitfire had an 8mph advantage at 8,000ft; 5mph faster at 15,000ft; and a 5 to 7mph advantage at 25,000ft. The Fw 190 retained speed advantages at 2,000ft and 18,000ft {{where it}} held a lead of 7 to 8 and 3mph respectively. In the climb, they were similar, the Spitfire being slightly faster. However, once the 22,000ft mark was reached, the Spitfire climbing rate increased, while the Fw 190s rapidly fell away. The Fw 190 was faster in the dive, {{particularly in the}} initial stages. The Spitfire had difficulty in following in the dive owing {{to the lack of}} <b>negative</b> <b>G</b> carburettor. The Fw 190 was more manoeuvrable, with the exception of turning circle. The conclusion was the Spitfire IX compared favourably with the Fw 190 provided the Spitfire had the initiative, it had [...] "undoubtedly a good chance of shooting the Fw 190 down".|$|E

5000|$|G-forces (gravitational forces) {{create the}} {{so-called}} [...] "butterfly" [...] sensation felt {{as a car}} goes down a gradient. An acceleration of [...] is the usual force of Earth’s gravitational pull exerted on a person while standing still. The measurement of a person's normal weight incorporates this gravitational acceleration. When a person feels weightless {{at the top of}} a loop or while going down a hill, they are in free fall. However, if the top of a hill is curved more narrowly than a parabola, riders will experience <b>negative</b> <b>Gs</b> and be lifted out of their seats, experiencing the so-called [...] "butterfly" [...] sensation.|$|R

50|$|Air-time is {{a result}} of the effects of the inertia of the train and the riders: as the train goes over a hill {{transitioning}} from an ascent into a descent guided by the rails, the inertia of the relatively loosely-attached riders causes them to momentarily continue upwards, resulting in the riders being lifted out of their seats. The duration of air-time on a particular hill is dependent on the velocity of the train, gravity, and the radius of the track's transition from ascent to descent. Zero-G (where the net vertical G-force is 0) is achieved when the downward acceleration is equal to that of gravity; where the downward acceleration is greater, <b>negative</b> <b>Gs</b> arise.|$|R

50|$|Here {{come the}} SAMs. The trick is seeing the launch. You {{can see the}} steam. It goes {{straight}} up, turns more level, then the booster drops off. If it maintains a relatively stable position, it's coming right for you and you're in trouble. You're eager {{to make a move}} but can't. If you dodge too fast it will turn and catch you; if you wait too late it will explode near enough to get you. What you do at the right moment is poke your nose down, go down as hard as you can, pull maybe three <b>negative</b> <b>Gs</b> at 550 knots and once it follows you down, you go up as hard as you can. It can't follow that and goes under.|$|R

50|$|German fighters used fuel {{injection}} engines {{and did not}} have this problem. So in action, a German fighter could evade a pursuing RAF fighter by flying a <b>negative</b> <b>g</b> manoeuvre which the RAF plane could not follow.|$|E
50|$|The early {{versions}} of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine came equipped with a SU carburettor. When these aeroplanes performed a <b>negative</b> <b>G</b> force manoeuvre (pitching the nose hard down), fuel was forced upwards {{to the top of}} the float chamber of the carburettor rather than into the engine, leading to loss of power. If the <b>negative</b> <b>G</b> continued, the fuel would collect in the top of the float chamber, forcing the float to the floor of the chamber. This would in turn open the needle valve to maximum, flooding the carburettor with fuel and drowning the supercharger with an over-rich mixture. This would lead to a rich mixture cut-out, which would shut down the engine completely, a serious drawback in combat.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight data}} recorder, as {{analyzed}} by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), {{found that the}} sensors had initially recorded a peak normal acceleration of 1.814G in the first sharp ascent.

50|$|The final {{evolution}} of the 710 series was the C.714 Cyclone, {{a variation on the}} C.713 which first flew in April 1938 as the C.714.01 prototype. The primary changes were a new wing airfoil profile, a strengthened fuselage, and instead of two cannons, the fighter had four 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns in the wing gondolas. It was powered by the newer 12R-03 version of the engine, which introduced a new carburettor that could operate in <b>negative</b> <b>g.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>G</b> engine cut-out was not {{a problem}} unique to Merlin-powered fighters since many other pre-war {{aeroplanes}} also used carburettors containing a float chamber. For example, in 1942, the United States acquired a flyable, Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero, known as the Akutan Zero. When test-flown, this aircraft was also found to experience engine cut-outs, due to the float-type carburettor of its Nakajima Sakae engine. The Americans devised tactics to counter the Zero in combat that took advantage of this and other results of testing the aircraft.|$|E
