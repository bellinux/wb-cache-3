40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{was developed to}} predict the noise levels inside propeller-driven aircraft during cruise at M = 0. 8. The model was applied to three study aircraft with fuselages of different size (wide body, narrow body and small diameter) {{in order to determine}} the <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> required to achieve the goal of an A-weighted sound level which does not exceed 80 dB. The model was then used to determine noise control methods which could achieve the required <b>noise</b> <b>reductions.</b> Two classes of noise control treatments were investigated: add-on treatments which can be added to existing structures, and advanced concepts which would require changes to the fuselage primary structure. Only one treatment, a double wall with limp panel, provided the required <b>noise</b> <b>reductions.</b> Weight penalties associated with the treatment were estimated for the three study aircraft...|$|R

40|$|Operational {{techniques}} for reducing approach noise from business jet aircraft were evaluated in flight {{by measuring the}} noise generated by five such aircraft during modified approaches. Approaches with 4 -deg glide slopes were approximately 4. 0 EPNdB quieter than approaches with standard 3 -deg glide slopes. <b>Noise</b> <b>reductions</b> for low-drag 3 -deg approaches varied widely among the airplanes tested; the fleet-weighted reduction was 8. 5 EPNdB. Two-segment approaches resulted in <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> of 7. 0 EPNdB to 8. 5 EPNdB 3 nautical miles and 5 nautical miles from touchdown.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

It is found that only a double-wall system, with a limp inner wall or trim panel, can achieve the required <b>noise</b> <b>reductions.</b> Weight penalties are estimated for the double-wall treatments.

40|$|Five {{business}} jet airplanes were flown {{to determine the}} <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> that result {{from the use of}} modified approach procedures. The airplanes tested were a Gulfstream 2, JetStar, Hawker Siddeley 125 - 400, Sabreliner- 60 and LearJet- 24. Noise measurements were made 3, 5, and 7 nautical miles from the touchdown point. In addition to a standard 3 deg glide slope approach, a 4 deg glide slope approach, a 3 deg glide slope approach in a low-drag configuration, and a two-segment approach were flown. It was found that the 4 deg approach was about 4 EPNdB quieter than the standard 3 deg approach. <b>Noise</b> <b>reductions</b> for the low-drag 3 deg approach varied widely among the airplanes tested, with an average of 8. 5 EPNdB on a fleet-weighted basis. The two-segment approach resulted in <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> of 7 to 8 EPNdB at 3 and 5 nautical miles from touchdown, but only 3 EPNdB at 7 nautical miles from touchdown when the airplanes were still in level flight prior to glide slope intercept.

40|$|The {{results of}} a static {{acoustic}} and aerodynamic performance, model-scale test program on coannular unsuppressed and multielement fan suppressed nozzle configurations are summarized. The results of the static acoustic tests show a very beneficial interaction effect. When the measured noise levels were compared with the predicted noise levels of two independent but equivalent conical nozzle flow streams, <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> for the unsuppressed coannular nozzles were {{of the order of}} 10 PNdB; high levels of suppression (8 PNdB) were still maintained even when only a small amount of core stream flow was used. The multielement fan suppressed coannular nozzle tests showed 15 PNdB <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> and up to 18 PNdB <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> when a treated ejector was added. The static aerodynamic performance tests showed that the unsuppressed coannular plug nozzles obtained gross thrust coefficients of 0. 972, with 1. 2 to 1. 7 percent lower levels for the multielement fan-suppressed coannular flow nozzles. For the first time anywhere, laser velocimeter velocity profile measurements were made on these types of nozzle configurations and with supersonic heated flow conditions. Measurements showed that a very rapid decay in the mean velocity occurs for the nozzle tested...|$|R

40|$|A field noise {{measurement}} {{program has been}} conducted on a standard Bell 47 series helicopter and on {{one that had been}} modified with specially designed, airframe-mounted mufflers to reduce the engine exhaust noise. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the acoustic performance of five experimental exhaust muffler configurations for a helicopter reciprocating engine in an operational environment. All muffler configurations produced beneficial engine exhaust <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> but some configurations were markedly better than others. Flyover noise results indicated that maximum overall <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> of approximately 8 db were obtained with the various mufflers.

40|$|When the {{en route}} noise of a {{representative}} aircraft powered by an eight-blade SR- 7 propeller was previously calculated, {{the noise level}} was cited as a possible concern associated with the acceptance of advanced turboprop aircraft. Some potential methods for reducing the en route noise were then investigated and are reported. Source <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> from increasing the blade number and from operating at higher rotative speed to reach a local minimum noise point were investigated. Greater atmospheric attenuations for higher blade passing frequencies were also indicated. Potential en route <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> from these methods were calculated as 9. 5 dB (6. 5 dB(A)) for a 10 -blade redesigned propeller and 15. 5 dB (11 dB(A)) for a 12 -blade redesigned propeller...|$|R
40|$|The <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> {{from both}} normal- and inverted-velocity-profile (IVP) {{shock-free}} coannular jets are critically assessed {{on the basis}} of existing data. The fully mixed equivalent (FMEQ) single jet, defined as having a uniform exit profile and the same thrust, mass flow rate and exit area as the coannular jet, is used throughout as the reference for noise comparisons. It is shown that uninverted-velocity-profile coannular jets are consistently noisier than FMEQ jets, whereas IVP jets are slightly quieter. The practical implications are discussed in detail. The 'inverted velocity' effects are isolated experimentally from the 'inverted temperature' effects and the resulting <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> or increases are explained by using the measurements of mean flow, turbulence structure, and source location in coannular jets...|$|R

25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws frustrating to both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. Tape speed could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed often was calibrated at the factory, {{and could not be}} changed by users. The slow tape speed increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of wow and flutter. Different tape formulation and <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. <b>Noise</b> <b>reduction</b> also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes quite easily.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure for grouping actuators {{in order to}} reduce the number of degrees of freedom in an active noise control system is evaluated using experimental data. Piezoceramic actuators for reducing aircraft interior noise are arranged into groups using a nonlinear optimization routine and clustering algorithm. An actuator group is created when two or more actuators are driven with the same control input. This procedure is suitable for active control applications where actuators are already mounted on a structure. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated using measured data from the aft cabin of a Douglas DC- 9 fuselage. The measured data include transfer functions between 34 piezoceramic actuators and 29 interior microphones and microphone responses due to the primary noise produced by external speakers. Control inputs for the grouped actuators were calculated so that a cost function, defined as a quadratic pressure term and a penalty term, was a minimum. The measured transfer functions and microphone responses are checked by comparing calculated <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> with measured <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> for four frequencies. The grouping procedure is then used to determine actuator groups that improve overall interior <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> by 5. 3 to 15 dB, compared to the baseline experimental configuration...|$|R
40|$|The Refan Program {{is aimed}} at a large {{reduction}} in aircraft approach and takeoff noise {{in the vicinity of}} airports caused by the JT 3 D-powered 707 's and DC- 8 's and the JT 8 D-powered 727 's, 737 's and DC- 9 's. These aircraft represent {{a major part of the}} existing commercial fleet. The <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> can be achieved by engine and nacelle modifications in the form of aircraft retrofit kits. Engine turbomachinery noise is reduced by replacing the current two-stage fan with a larger single-stage fan and by nacelle acoustic treatment. Jet noise is reduced by the reduction on jet velocity caused by additional turbine work extraction to drive the larger bypass fan. The predicted net effect of these modifications on installed performance is large <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> on both approach and takeoff, increased takeoff thrust, decreased takeoff field length, and maintained or improved aircraft range depending on the amount of acoustic treatment included. The Refan Program is being conducted in two phases under contracts with one engine and two airframe companies. Results of the Phase I work are summarized in this report which describes the refan nacelle configurations studied, the airplane modifications required to install the nacelles, and the resulting airplane performance and <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> predicted for all five aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{effects of}} {{serrated}} brass strips attached near the leading edges {{of two different}} size rotors were investigated. The two bladed rotors were tested in hover. Rotor rotational speed, blade angle, serration shape, and serration position were varied. The serrations were more effective as noise suppressors at rotor tip speeds less than 135 m/sec (444 ft/sec) than at higher speeds. high frequency noise was reduced but the low frequency rotational noise was little affected. <b>Noise</b> <b>reductions</b> from 4 to 8 db overall sound pressure level and 3 to 17 db in the upper octave bands were achieved on the 1. 52 m (5. 0 ft) diameter rotor. <b>Noise</b> <b>reductions</b> up to 4 db overall sound pressure level were measured for the 2. 59 m (8. 5 ft) diameter rotor at some conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the propulsive-lift noise of the NASA-Ames quiet short-haul research aircraft (QSRA) is described. Comparisons are made of measured QSRA flyover noise and model propulsive-lift noise data available in references. Developmental tests of trailing-edge treatments were conducted using sawtooth-shaped and porous USB flap trailing-edge extensions. Small scale parametric tests were conducted to determine noise reduction/design relationships. Full-scale static tests were conducted with the QSRA preparatory to the selection of edge treatment designs for flight testing. QSRA flight and published model propulsive-lift noise data have similar characteristics. <b>Noise</b> <b>reductions</b> of 2 to 3 dB were achieved {{over a wide range}} of frequency and directivity angles in static tests of the QSRA.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model developed {{to predict the}} interior noise of propeller driven aircraft was applied to experimental configurations for a Fairchild Swearingen Metro II fuselage exposed to simulated propeller excitation. The floor structure of the test fuselage was of unusual construction - mounted on air springs. As a consequence, the {{analytical model}} was extended to include a floor treatment transmission coefficient {{which could be used}} to describe vibration attenuation through the mounts. Good agreement was obtained between measured and predicted <b>noise</b> <b>reductions</b> when the foor treatment transmission loss was about 20 dB - a value which is consistent with the vibration attenuation provided by the mounts.

40|$|The {{effects of}} forward flight on the {{turbulence}} {{characteristics of a}} jet in a co-flowing stream have been determined for a 2. 22 inch circular jet in a 36 inch free jet wind tunnel. The nozzle exit velocity was 400 ft/sec, and the tunnel velocity was set at 0, 40, 120 and 200 ft/sec. Measurements of flow properties including mean velocity, turbulence intensity and spectra, convection velocity, integral length scale, and convected integral time scale were carried out using two linearized hot wires. Results were used to predict changes due to flight in the jet acoustic sources.
