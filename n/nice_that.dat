Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> we're able to do that again.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, as anti-Semitism {{was growing}} in Germany, Vishniac was {{commissioned}} by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in Central Europe to photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe {{as part of a}} fund-raising drive to help support these poor communities. Vishniac developed and printed these pictures in his dark room in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again {{at the behest of the}} JDC. Vishniac used both a Leica and a Rolleiflex camera in his photography. In 1939, his wife and children moved to Sweden to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in <b>Nice</b> <b>that</b> summer.|$|E

Pal, that's <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> you're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see {{what it would be like}} on the train to Auschwitz.

[...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.'

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Price Peterson, of TV.com, {{gave the}} episode a positive review, writing that he [...] "oved this episode. That reveal was simultaneously shocking and heartbreaking. Plus it {{took one of}} the show's most annoying characters (Trina) and made her both sympathetic and heartbreaking." [...] He also praised the information found on Veronica's mother: [...] "It was <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> Veronica got to see a better side of her mother than we usually do…Heartwarming!" [...] Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune, called the episode [...] "engrossing" [...] and that it is a better use of a viewer's time than Lost, which aired {{at the same time as}} Veronica Mars.|$|E
500|$|Of the film's {{success with}} Western audiences, Miike {{states that he}} was not surprised, but that he had [...] "no idea {{what goes on in the}} minds of people in the West and I don't pretend to know what their tastes are.

Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E
500|$|For her {{performance}} in the pilot episode, Helen Baxendale was nominated for Top TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1997. At the Broadcasting Press Guild Awards 1998, she was presented with the Best Actress award, for {{her performance}} in Cold Feet and An Unsuitable Job for a Woman. Her portrayal received mixed reviews from television critics when the series began. In the Daily Record, Kathleen Morgan wrote that Baxendale had lost her edge since playing Dr Maitland in Cardiac Arrest; [...] "Instead of making a triumphant return to British television as a tough-talking woman, she has been cast as another spineless character." [...] Sara Villiers wrote in The Scotsman, [...] "Rachel is so unfeasibly bland and <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> she has consigned Baxendale to the title Most Irritating Woman on the Telly." ...|$|E

500|$|Bhatti {{was already}} known to EastEnders {{executive}} producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street {{at the same}} time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she [...] "thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!" [...] Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: [...] "They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about. I'm {{having a great time}} at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, {{for a very long time}} and we've always got on very well.

500|$|Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive {{producer}} David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet {{because he}} was [...] "such a good sport" [...] and had [...] "a great sense of humor". Oakley thought it was <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> Goulet was willing {{to make fun of}} himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons. This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was [...] "bound to happen" [...] sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as [...] "Senator" [...] by Homer.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series, Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five most {{shocking}} death scenes in Spooks. Two of them were deaths from the seventh series.

500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal sounds so sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> {{you want to take}} her home and give her a shampoo". In The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|Billboards Michael Paoletta applauded Vespertine for its [...] "positive [...] ", feeling some of {{the tracks}} [...] "have the {{strength}} to bring tears (of joy and pain) to the eyes." [...] Q also praised the album, stating that it [...] "quietly proves that cutting-edge production and human contact aren't mutually exclusive." [...] American music journalist Robert Christgau enjoyed the album's central theme of sex and wrote: [...] "when she gets all soprano on your ass you could accuse her of spirituality". A more lukewarm review came from Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber, who felt that: [...] "while undeniably beautiful, Vespertine fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk's preceding albums". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "her lyrics occasionally dive into the deep end" [...] and [...] "her voice is at times stiff", although he also wrote [...] "when it all comes together, [...] Björk and her electronica collaborators create moving interplanetary chorals". Almost Cool wrote: [...] "if there's one question to be raised with the album, it's that it's all simply so lush and <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> on some levels it fails to excite". Various reviews named Vespertine Björk's best album to date, including The A.V. Club, Rolling Stone, About.com, and PopMatters.|$|E
25|$|The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<b>NICE)</b> {{concluded}} <b>that</b> {{while it}} is important to acknowledge the body of academic literature which raises controversies and criticisms surrounding ADHD for the purpose of developing clinical guidelines, {{it is not possible to}} offer alternative methods of assessment (i.e. ICD 10 and DSM IV) or therapeutic treatment recommendations. <b>NICE</b> stated <b>that</b> this is because the current therapeutic treatment interventions and methods of diagnosis for ADHD are based on the dominant view of the academic literature. <b>NICE</b> further concluded <b>that</b> despite such criticism, ADHD represented a valid clinical condition, with genetic, environmental, neurobiological, and demographic factors. The diagnosis has a high level of support from clinicians and medical authorities.|$|R

500|$|Ned Flanders, who was {{designed}} by Rich Moore, {{first appeared in the}} season one episode [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". The episode was the series premiere, but not the first episode produced. The first episode in which Flanders and his family were prominent is season two's [...] "Dead Putting Society", which also contained the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders. The character was named after Flanders Street in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Groening described the inspiration for Flanders as [...] "just a guy who was truly <b>nice,</b> <b>that</b> Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe, but then did". It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian. Mike Scully noted that Flanders is [...] "everything Homer would love to be, although he'll never admit it". Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but Harry Shearer used [...] "such a sweet voice" [...] and Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer. Flanders is known for his nonsensical jabbering. His first use of the word [...] "diddly" [...] was in [...] "The Call of the Simpsons".|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} ninth season, the {{producers}} decided to drastically change the show. The {{style of the}} opening credits in [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today" [...] were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been {{the same for the}} previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, [...] "The Truth", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up." [...] He expounded on the idea, saying, [...] "Frank [...] and I [...] it was probably time to go [...] it was strange to be writing these things knowing {{it was the last time}} we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things." [...] Spotnitz explained, [...] "What was kind of <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> Chris made the announcement in January is that we had times to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due." [...] Gish later said, [...] "I have a great respect for the elegant in which they're closing the curtain". Bruce Harwood called the finale the [...] "passing of a generation".|$|E
500|$|After {{the inaugural}} race, {{organizers}} improved the marking {{of the trail}} for the first contest held in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks direction. Musher Bill Cotter said, [...] "The trail was so <b>nice</b> <b>that</b> {{it was difficult to}} keep from going too fast." [...] The race grew in popularity over the next few years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race—the most that have ever finished it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26minutes. The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter because of an outbreak of a canine disease called the [...] "Healy Virus". Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems {{in the first half of}} the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was replaced after she offered canine acupuncture to several mushers. Though not then forbidden by any rule, this violated equal-treatment guidelines because she did not offer the treatment to every musher. At the end of that race, George Cook became the first musher since 1984 to finish short of Whitehorse when open water on the Yukon River prevented him from continuing. Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.|$|E
