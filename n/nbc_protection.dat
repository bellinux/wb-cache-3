25|$|The {{weight of}} the BMD-4 is {{achieved}} by using aluminum alloy for the hull instead of steel as armor. This armor protects the BMD-4 from 30mm weapons like its own 2A72 autocannon towards the front, and small arms fire and shell splinters towards the side. To counter infrared guidance and weapons, six 81mm ZD6 smoke grenade dischargers in two banks of three are mounted towards {{the sides of the}} turret. An <b>NBC</b> <b>protection</b> system and automatic fire suppression systems are provided to the entire crew and passengers to ensure survivability in an environment with nuclear fallout.|$|E
25|$|The M113 chassis is {{enlarged}} {{to accommodate}} several modifications {{and to allow}} for more armor to be added. The hull of the EIFV is of all-welded 5083 aluminum armour which provides protection from small arms fire and shell splinters, able to defeat armour-piercing projectiles up to 14.5mm in calibre over a 360° arc of attack. Aluminum provides protection {{similar to that of}} steel armor while keeping the vehicle lightweight. An armor upgrade package produced by the AOI can significantly enhance the armor on the EIFV even further, allowing it to withstand armor-piercing 23mm rounds, without sacrificing the vehicle's mobility. Optional upgrades for the vehicle include air conditioning, <b>NBC</b> <b>protection</b> and firing ports.|$|E
50|$|The AMX-10RC {{has been}} the {{recipient}} of numerous upgrades over its lifetime. Most notably, newer systems include battlefield-management system terminals. For its part in the 1991 Gulf War, the AMX-10RC was provided with extra add-on armour and anti-tank missile decoy systems. One improvement considered was the installation of a NATO 105mm gun, as the GIAT model was not compatible with NATO munitions, but this was ultimately not done. Thermal imaging systems have also been installed, using units taken from decommissioned AMX-30B2 MBTs. A central tyre-inflation system is available for added traction over soft terrain. The AMX-10RC is equipped with an <b>NBC</b> (Nuclear/Biological/Chemical) <b>protection</b> system and may conduct reconnaissance in a radioactive environment.|$|R

25|$|Dailly was {{the scene}} of an {{ammunition}} explosion on 28 May, 1946, when about 5500 105mm shells, amounting to 449 tons, exploded in three separate magazines successively. The blast threw four 105mm guns from their emplacements and damaged six more. Six construction workers were killed, part of a crew working on a funicular shaft linking Dailly to the upper part of Savatan. The explosion was attributed to decomposition of nitrocellulose propellant. Two similar explosions happened at Grisons in June 1946 and at Blausee-Mitholz in 1947, without loss of life. The damage to Dailly resulted in a comprehensive modernization of the fort, with additions of 81mm and 120mm mortars, removal of obsolete weapons and the installation of two modern 150mm gun turrets. An underground caserne for 650 men was built at this time, with <b>NBC</b> <b>protection.</b> The four 105mm guns of the northern casemates and the two 105mm guns of the central casemate were repaired and upgraded, but the four guns of the south battery were never replaced. The new 150mm gun turrets were mounted on barbettes deep, with an individual rate of fire of 22 rounds per minute in bursts, or 15 rounds per minute sustained. Design began in 1949, with the first test firings in 1960.|$|E
40|$|Available online xxxx The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of a novel oxygen-coordinated niacin-bound chro-chromium(III) complex (NBC) in attenuating insulin resistance and lowering plasma cholesterol levels, increasing cardioprotective potential and lean body mass [6, 7, 13 – 16]. Studies have also shown that NBC is useful in overcoming sucrose-induced hypertension and has been shown to lengthen the life span of rats [16 – 19]. NBC has been demonstrated to prevent the increases in protein of vascular inflammation in diabetes [22]. A recent study using the model of STZ-induced diabetic rats after ischemia–reperfusion in-jury has revealed that <b>NBC</b> enhances myocardial <b>protection</b> [23]. This cardioprotective effect is mediated by increased activation of AKT, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) resulting in an enhanced translocation of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter (Glut- 4) to the caveolar raft [23]. The major forms of chromium(III) dietary supplements include chromium(III) chloride (CrCl 3), chromium(III) picolinate (CrPic), and NBC [16, 24].

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the present situation in the concern of the public protection against modern toxics by using the light type of shelters. The object of laboratory tests in the chemical agents’ environment is the complete light shelter (tent), called No- 1 which is designed for the military purpose as the mobile command post at the brigade level. The point of concern is given to characteristics of the tent construction and its tactical-technical parameters. After the tests, there was discovered that the light type shelter provides the personnel protection against chemical or biological agents that could be find in the air as the BC agents or industrial toxics. The air inside the tent shelter is pressurized and decontaminated by the special NBC filters and the device is called UFW- 900 - 2 C.
