5|$|Over {{the last}} 150 years, this layout has been {{replaced}} by the usual Spanish colonial architecture of large square blocks with internal patios. Remnants of the initial design can still be seen in San Miguel de Velasco, San Rafael de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, places that were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> exposed to modernization as the other settlements.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial amount of water was detected spectroscopically, it was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|Neptune (30.1 AU), though {{slightly}} smaller than Uranus, is more massive (equivalent to 17 Earths) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton {{is the only}} large satellite with a retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E
5|$|The Dreamcast {{version of}} the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay, and {{translation}} of the original arcade experience. Due to the PlayStation's limited RAM capacity, Capcom removed tag team battles {{in an attempt to}} preserve the game's speed and graphical integrity. Consequently, the PlayStation port received positive reviews, just <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the Dreamcast version. A sequel to Clash of Super Heroes, , was released in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles {{of weapons and}} raw materials such as copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as during World War I. Greece experienced famine {{in the first year of}} occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E

5|$|To {{art critic}} Robert Hughes, the {{painting}} represents {{the theme of}} family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian Lizabeth Cohen says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> a government responsibility as something born from participation in the mass consumer economy.|$|E
5|$|Although Body Language was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of a {{commercial}} success as Fever, it performed well nonetheless. In Minogue's native Australia, Body Language entered and peaked at number two on the albums chart and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the album double-platinum for shipping 140,000 units in the country. In the United Kingdom, the album entered and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. It remained inside the top 10 for one week, and for {{two weeks in the}} top 20. In total, it stayed on the chart for a total of 30 weeks. Body Language was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 28 November 2003, and had sold 398,035 copies by December 2007.|$|E
5|$|As Saomai {{approached}} South Korea, the typhoon {{forced the}} cancellation of flights beginning on September12. Four airports had their air service suspended. Other suspensions of transportation included the refuge of 362fishing boats in ports and the closure of 10national parks and 43mountain paths. As a result, about 16,600campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas. As {{a result of the}} inclement weather, the operation of 149passenger ships were cancelled. On September13, the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province. The administration anticipated heavy rainfall, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as what had taken place in Japan. Offshore, an Indonesian freighter with 39crewmen became stranded by the typhoon in waters south of Pusan. The crew were rescued by maritime police, but 270tons of oil spilled into the ocean from a broken oil container.|$|E

5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition {{is similar to that}} of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to know for certain.|$|E
5|$|Commander Martin Brooke (played by Alex Ferns) {{is the son}} of a car {{mechanic}} and his naval {{background is}} based on piloting, rather than commanding a ship. He is assisted by Lt Cdr Jenny Howard (played by Emily Hamilton), who is initially his temporary XO, but eventually accepts Brooke's offer to stay on the ship. Lieutenant Commander William Lewis, the Marine Engineering Officer (played by Ian Bartholomew), is the superior of Charge Chief Marine Engineering Artificer (CCMEA) Andy Fellows (played by Steve Speirs) and Lewis's refusal to give the engines full maintenance regularly infuriates him, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as LMEA Dave Finnan (played by Paul Chequer) who has just had a baby with his daughter Teresa (played by Chloe Howman). New Operator Mechanic Rosie Bowen (played by Joanna Page) settles into her first posting and attracts the attention of OM Mickey Sobanski (played by Lee Turnbull), who is contemplating his future in the Navy after an incident in the first episode.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E

5|$|Mercyful Fate {{were a part}} of {{the first}} wave of black metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped {{establish}} the style upon which future black metal artists would later build. Unlike the other first wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal, although their musical style was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> an influence as that of other first wave bands.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the grey sharpnose shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian sharpnose shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that {{brought them to the}} continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of the}} world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as some other species.|$|E
