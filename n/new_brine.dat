50|$|The {{feed water}} carries away the latent {{heat of the}} {{condensed}} steam, maintaining the low temperature of the stage. The pressure in the chamber remains constant as equal amounts of steam is formed when <b>new</b> warm <b>brine</b> enters the stage and steam is removed as it condenses on the tubes of the heat exchanger. The equilibrium is stable, because if at some point more vapor forms, the pressure increases and that reduces evaporation and increases condensation.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 From 1925 to 1930, Ernest H. Wiegand, a {{professor}} of Horticultural Products at Oregon State Agricultural College, developed an improved brining process for cherries. Brined cherries {{are used in the}} production of maraschino and glacé cherries, which already had a sizable market in the United States by the 1920 s. This thesis examines the scientific, economic, and geographic circumstances that {{played a role in the}} development of the new process. The institutionalization of agricultural science in the Land-Grant Colleges and experiment stations in the United States created a favorable context for the development of a <b>new</b> <b>brining</b> process. The scientists associated with these institutions were "service-oriented," both in ideology and practice. They generally tailored their research programs to meet the needs of their agricultural lay-constituency. This service-orientation has been present in agricultural science since its origins in the eighteenth century. Oregon State Agricultural College and its associated experiment station exemplified this dedication to service. In developing a brining process more suitable to large-scale commercial production, Wiegand was responding to the needs of local cherry growers, whose needs were determined by the demands and problems inherent in specialized agriculture. As a result of the improved brining process and tariff protection, Northwest cherry growers were able to successfully compete in the brined cherry market, a market previously closed to them...|$|R
50|$|Evaporites: Large {{evaporite}} {{reserves are}} present in the Sandling mountain, formed {{as a result of a}} major period of marine lowstand, when the sea level was low and the sea dried out. Panning and surface-level drift mining of the deposits dates back to Roman times, thanks to evidence from archaeological excavations in the 1990s, followed by similar local works from 200-400 AD. By 1147 the mines had become a commercial venture, controlled by the Rein Abbey near Graz. In 1211 the mines were nationalised by Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, who transferred control to Unterlupitsch. With operations later transferred to Bad Aussee, investment in 1319 allowed the opening of the Steinberg tunnel. Followed by further periods on investment, by 1334, the mines were operated under license by the private Hallinger Union who employed 120 people, producing about 10,000 tonnes of product per annum. Renationalised by Frederick III in 1445, 120 people produced circa 10,00 tonnes of product per annum until the early 20th century.

40|$|Metalliferous ediment precipitated in the Atlantis II Deep brine pool is finely {{laminated}} and undisturbed {{except in}} the area of the southwest basin. In this part of the Deep massive bedding, resedimentation, and brecciation are common. In addition, some sediment cores contain vein minerals precipitated in open fissures which crosscut unlithified metalliferous sediments. These veins are the conduits by which <b>new</b> hot <b>brine</b> vents into the Deep. Vein mineralogy is dominated by anhydrite, talc, smectite, pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. The mineralogy and mineral chemistry of the veins show a vertical zonation due to cooling and reaction of the incoming brine as it rises through the metalliferous ediment. Talc and mag-nesium-rich smectites dominate deep veinlets, and mote iron-rich smectite and anhydrite dominate veins nearer the sediment-water interface. Near the southwest basin-west basin transition, metalliferous ediment has been locally recrystallized to a hematite-magnetite-py-roxene assemblage, probably due to the intrusion of basalt into the metalliferous sediments...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{increase}} {{in demand for}} lithium {{has led to the}} development of <b>new</b> <b>brine</b> prospects, particularly in the Central Andes. The brines are hosted in closed basin aquifers of two types: mature, halite dominant, and immature, clastic dominant. The estimate of elemental resources in these salars depends on a detailed knowledge of aquifer geometry, porosity, and brine grade. The geometry of the aquifers can be evaluated by classical geophysical and drilling techniques, but because the resource is a fluid, with the attendant problems of in-aquifer mixing and reorganization, existing codes for filing resource and reserve estimates need modification. Total porosity is relatively straightforward to measure, but effective porosity and specific yield, which are required to estimate the resource, are more difficult. Recovery factors are low compared with most metalliferous and industrial mineral deposits due to reliance on pumping of the brine from wells for extraction. These and related issues lead us to believe that modifications to the existing standards for reporting mineral resources and reserves are required for these prospects. ...|$|E
40|$|In the laboratory, we have {{investigated}} the growth and composition of frost flowers. Their ionic composition has shown little difference from those of field measurements. Young frost flowers grown on sea ice are saline, leading us to speculate that wicking occurs continually during their growth on sea ice. The surface area of frost flowers is only a little larger than the area of ice underneath, consistent with recent field measurements from the Arctic. Time-lapse photography has allowed us to observe the extreme mobility of freshly forming sea ice, at the stage at which the mush has become rather solid, and continuing while the flowers grow. This mobility results in <b>new</b> <b>brine</b> being expelled to the surface, which therefore remains wet. During various stages of frost flower growth, we observed their freshly formed dendritic parts rapidly diminishing in size after contacting the surface, consistent with repeated wicking. Frost flowers proved to be very stable {{in the presence of}} wind, such that no aerosol was observed when wind was blown across them in the laboratory chamber. This is consistent with recent field observations of frost flowers coexisting with wind-blown sno...|$|E
40|$|The Oriskany Sandstone of the Appalachian basin is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} saline aquifer which has produced large quantities of hydrocarbons. Currently the Oriskany is host to numerous gas storage fields and is a potential target for large-scale geologic storage of CO 2. Published and unpublished data of rock characteristics, pressure, temperature, and formation water geochemistry along with <b>new</b> <b>brine</b> samples were integrated within a geographical information system {{to better understand the}} regional-scale hydrogeological regime and its relation to the migration of hydrocarbons and geologic CO 2 sequestration potential. The topographically driven up-dip flow of the Oriskany Sandstone formation waters is generally controlled by outcrops at high elevation to the east and at low elevation to the west. The up-dip flow is opposed by increased salinity induced buoyancy forces down-dip. The flow pattern is substantiated by the salinity distributions, with relatively lower salinity at recharge to the east and discharge to the west due to mixing with fresh meteoric water and higher salinity between the recharge and discharge zones. This flow pattern is also substantiated by the distribution of Oriskany gas fields that occur in the Central Appalachian basin; the major productive gas fields occur at the boundary between lower salinity and are typically absent in areas of higher salinity. It is believed that hydrocarbon distribution is influenced by basinal variations in buoyancy and entrainment by the formation water flow. Improved containment of large-scale CO 2 injection appears to be associated in the Oriskany with convergent flow located in the eastern Appalachian basin. STUDY ARE...|$|E

Changes in the polychaete assemblage was analysed using univariate and multivariate techniques. We compared a transect in front of the discharge with two controls. At each transect we sampled at three depths (4, 10 and 15 m) during winter and summer. We have observed different sensitivity of polychaete families to brine discharges, Ampharetidae being the most sensitive, followed by Nephtyidae and Spionidae.

In addition, the process time affects at the formation of big crystals in the product that cause injuries in the cellular fabric of the shrimp and consistently the increase of the exudation of fluids intra celular of the product. On the other hand, when these times of process are very short it is not achieved to obtain a satisfactory freezing of the final product.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to better {{quantify}} the solubility of CO 2 in <b>brines.</b> <b>New</b> experimental data on the solubility of CO 2 in a mixed salt solution at CO 2 sequestration pressure and temperature conditions are presented. A thermodynamic model for calculation of the phase equilibria of CO 2 –H 2 O–NaCl system is briefly described; notably, the solubility of the carbon dioxide in the aqueous phase. This model was used to check his validity by comparing the calculation results with new experimental measurements, available experimental observations and other models CO 2 solubility results. Comparison with experimental data indicates that the model can predict accurately CO 2 solubility in pure water and in aqueous NaCl solutions of ionic strengths up to 3 molal from 1 to 300 °C and from 1 to 300 bar. This model has been applied to CO 2 storage at Sleipner, North Sea. The salinity of the porewater within the Utsira Formation (the CO 2 host formation) is approximately the same as seawater. Predicted CO 2 solubility is in good agreement with new experimental measurements. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{three year}} {{research}} project involving four research institutes from Germany and Norway was initiated by DEMINEX {{to plan for}} such a polymer flood project using the Veslefrikk oilfield in the Norwegian North Sea as reference field. Chemicals must withstand temperatures of up to 120 C and be compatible with seawater and reservoir <b>brine.</b> <b>New</b> experimental technique has had to be developed and new products {{have had to be}} investigated. Seven water-base polymers were selected and their suitability for the Veslefrikk conditions investigated. The criteria upon which the selection was made were solubility in water, injectability, salt tolerance and long-term temperature stability. Only one polymer, GLUCAN WLF from WINTERSHALL, was able to satisfy all these criteria. Further laboratory work was devoted to describing the behaviour of GLUCAN WLF seawater solutions under flood conditions and estimating its adsorption characteristics in relation to the Veslefrikk reservoir rock. Results obtained were used in reservoir simulation studies.

40|$|Polarimetric {{backscattering}} {{from sea}} ice is presented. Theoretical models for backscattering are first presented for various ice types. Then, theoretical results are compared with experimental data for new thin ice, first-year ice, and multi-year ice. Sea ice is modeled as a layer medium containing random scatterers and rough interfaces. For multi-year sea ice with snow cover, the sea ice layer is modeled as an ice background with embedded spheroidal air bubbles {{and the snow}} layer as air with ice grains. The hummocky topography on multi-year ice {{is characterized by a}} Gaussian distribution which has an averaging effect on backscattering coefficients. First-year sea ice is described by an ice medium hosting ellipsoidal brine inclusions. These inclusions are oriented preferentially in the vertical direction due to the columnar structure of first-year sea ice. Azimuthally, the orientation of the brine pockets are random corresponding to the random c-axes in sea ice, unless the axes are oriented by sea currents. For thin ice in newly opened leads, it has been observed that there exists a thin brine layer with very high salinity on the top surface of the <b>new</b> ice. This <b>brine</b> layer is depicted as a medium with high permittivity which can significantly affect electromagnetic scattering signatures from the lower thin ice layer, with a higher fractional volume of brine inclusions due to higher salinity as compared to thick first-year sea ice. The rough medium interfaces are described as Gaussian rough surfaces characterized by root-mean-square heights and surface correlation lengths. The contribution from rough surface, calculated under the Kirchhoff approximation or small perturbation method, is assumed to be independent from volume scattering. The total loss including absorption and scattering losses in the scattering media is represented by the imaginary part of effective permittivity obtained from the strong fluctuation theory. The polarimetric scattering coefficients for different ice types are then derived under the distorted Born approximation...|$|R
