5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E

Inspired by their experiences of multicultural cooperation in international educational institutions, the founders decided that a fast-paced, intensive program in technology would be an ideal medium to bridge the divide. With this vision, they created MEET in the summer of 2004.|$|E

My missus could have scored that one." [...] On 31 January, Bent scored two goals in the period of two minutes against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium after coming on as a second-half substitute, in a match that eventually finished as a 3–2 defeat. Following the return of striker Robbie Keane at Tottenham, Redknapp assured Bent of his future at the club. He finished the season as Tottenham's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 43 matches.|$|E

Shaun, [...] "apprehensive about being slighted, is on his guard, and the placating narrators <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> straight answer out of him."

500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you could <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E

Over the next two years, he created sound effects for , Final Fantasy V, The 7th Saga, Secret of Mana, and Romancing SaGa 2. In 1994, realizing that he would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay, he gave Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, an ultimatum: let him compose, or he would quit. Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on Chrono Trigger, telling him that [...] "after you finish it, maybe your salary will go up". Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game, in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release. Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score, frequently working until he passed out, and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game. He worked himself so hard that he developed stomach ulcers {{and had to be}} hospitalized, which led Uematsu to finish the remaining tracks for him.|$|E
500|$|An {{editorial}} by {{the staff}} of The Hindu highlighted a different narrative in India and the Indian diaspora regarding her win and colorism. The editorial suggested that rather than hold a pageant title in India, [...] "the dark complexioned 24-year-old [...] would not have stood a chance…had she been in India, far from entering a beauty contest, {{it is more likely}} that Ms Davuluri would have grown up hearing mostly disparaging remarks about the colour of her skin; she would have been — going by the storyline of most “fairness” cream advertisements — a person with low self-esteem and few friends." [...] Dean Asha Rangappa (Yale Law School) echoed these sentiments when she stated that [...] "Davuluri is following in the footsteps of other darker-skinned Indian women who have been recognized in America for their talent and beauty, like The Office’s Mindy Kaling or ER's Parminder Nagra — women who’d <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> second glance in India." [...] Similar remarks appeared in social media and in numerous editorials. Davuluri also discussed the subject with reporters in the American media, stating that she was interested in becoming involved in the [...] "Dark is Beautiful" [...] campaign.|$|E
500|$|Following post-production, the {{programme}} was shelved by ITV Network Centre until 1997, when it {{was placed}} on the Easter weekend schedule as part of the network's [...] "Comedy Premieres" [...] programming strand. The broadcast, scheduled for a 9pm start on 30 March, went head-to-head with launch night of Channel 5, Britain's last terrestrial television channel, and {{the second part of the}} BBC1 drama The Missing Postman. Also broadcast on 30 March was ITV's coverage of the Brazilian Grand Prix. The race was restarted due to an accident and threw ITV's evening schedules into disarray. Broadcast of Cold Feet eventually began 40 minutes later than originally advertised and the overnight ratings reflected this; it recorded viewing figures of just 3.5million. Harries wrote it off as a failure, telling Langan that they would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> series. Some critical success came though; writing in The Times the day after it aired, Matthew Bond called it [...] "an enjoyable one-off comedy aimed at anybody who's ever been single, married, or had children. With such catholic appeal further heightened by Helen Baxendale heading a talented cast, it showed just what ITV can do when it is trying to win awards, such as the Golden Rose of Montreux." [...] The Suns Tim Ewbank echoed Bond's reaction, expressing surprise that a [...] "fast, funny, convincing" [...] comedy had appeared on ITV, calling it [...] "a treat" [...] and [...] "sharply observed", and Baxendale and Nesbitt [...] "terrific".|$|E

500|$|At 2:27p.m., Reagan {{exited the}} hotel through [...] "President's Walk" [...] and its T Street NW exit toward his waiting {{limousine}} as Hinckley waited within {{the crowd of}} admirers. The Secret Service had extensively screened those attending the president's speech. In a [...] "colossal mistake", the agency allowed an unscreened group to stand within [...] of him, behind a rope line. Unexpectedly, Reagan passed {{right in front of}} Hinckley. Believing he would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better chance, Hinckley fired a Röhm RG-14 [...]22LR blue steel revolver six times in 1.7 seconds, missing the president with all six shots. The first bullet hit White House Press Secretary James Brady in the head and the second hit District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty {{in the back of his}} neck as he turned to protect Reagan. Hinckley now had a clear shot at the president, but the third bullet overshot him and hit the window of a building across the street. As Special Agent In Charge Jerry Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, the fourth bullet hit Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy in the abdomen as he spread his body over Reagan to make himself a target. The fifth bullet hit the bullet-resistant glass of the window on the open side door of the limousine. The sixth and final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25mm) from his heart. [...] Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.|$|E

Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, {{with the help of a}} solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{government}} {{witnesses were}} {{called by the}} prosecution. Army Captain Robert Snyder, John Threadcraft, a former army officer, and FBI agent John Jefferson testified first.

If {{you were in a}} secret prison... or your children were tortured... Give me a little credit, this is not a list of targets against New York. I was never planning to bomb it. You're lying." [...] The court also heard from FBI agent John Jefferson and Ahmed Gul, an army interpreter, who recounted their struggle with her. The judge disallowed as evidence her possession of chemicals and terror manuals and her alleged ties to al-Qaeda because they could have created an inappropriate bias.|$|E

Stone played a major part in the success of the event. Rockefeller knew that if he bought out the weak refiners first, he'd generate opposition and <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to take on the larger, more profitable ones. So he tackled his strongest competitor, the firm of Clark, Payne & Co., led by Oliver Hazard Payne and backed by the wealthy J. G. Hussey family.

Stone and Stillman Witt were both officers in the bank. Payne swiftly agreed to a merger of his interests with Rockefeller's, and the transaction closed in early January 1872.|$|E

2500|$|Future Spice Girl Emma Bunton {{auditioned for}} the role of Bianca, however, it was actress Patsy Palmer who was {{eventually}} cast. Hester Lacey of The Independent has described Palmer's casting as an [...] "accident", as she did not formally audition {{for the role}}. EastEnders casting director Jane Deitch and writer–director McHale visited her drama class at the Anna Scher Theatre looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as she was older, but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line [...] "I can't believe you just said that." [...] The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day. In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: [...] "I've been a lucky girl. I always used to say I'd love to get in EastEnders, because I used to think 'God, I'll <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> part where I have to speak really posh', – I'm not very good at accents." [...] Palmer was 21 when she first appeared on-screen as 16-year-old Bianca.|$|E

It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
