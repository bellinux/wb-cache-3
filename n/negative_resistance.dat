25|$|A {{change to}} 24GHz has been {{suggested}} as microwave emitters similar to LEDs have been made with very high quantum efficiencies using <b>negative</b> <b>resistance,</b> i.e., Gunn or IMPATT diodes, {{and this would be}} viable for short range links.|$|E
25|$|For simple, low-powered loads {{such as a}} {{neon lamp}} or a LED, a fixed {{resistor}} is commonly used.

Because of the high carrier concentration, tunnel diodes are very fast, may be used at low (mK) temperatures, high magnetic fields, and in high radiation environments. Because of these properties, they are often used in spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} life, {{fluorescent}} lamps can start flickering at a frequency lower than the power frequency. This {{is due to a}} dynamic instability inherent in the <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> of the plasma source, which can be from a bad lamp, a bad ballast, or a bad starter; or occasionally from a poor connection to power.|$|E
25|$|In early 1920s Russia, Oleg Losev was {{experimenting with}} {{applying}} voltage biases to {{various kinds of}} crystals for manufacture of radio detectors. The result was astonishing: with a zincite (zinc oxide) crystal he gained amplification. This was <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> phenomenon, decades before {{the development of the}} tunnel diode. After the first experiments, Losev built regenerative and superheterodyne receivers, and even transmitters.|$|E
25|$|A {{lighting}} ballast is {{a device}} to provide proper starting and operating electrical conditions to light one or more fluorescent lamps, while also limiting the amount of current. A familiar and widely used example is the traditional inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps, to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube's <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> characteristic. A disadvantage of using an inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor power factor.|$|E

As a well known example, long Josephson junctions of the BSCCO type have been considered {{as a source of}} THz radiation in recent experiments. Numerical results for the dynamics of the fluxon system have demonstrated that a cavity induced <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance</b> plays a crucial role for the emission of electromagnetic radiation. We consider the case of a <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance</b> region in the McCumber curve itself of a single junction and found that it has an effect on the emission of electromagnetic radiation.

[...] Points on the IV curve located in the 2nd or 4th quadrants, for which {{the slope of}} the chordal line is negative, have <b>negative</b> static <b>resistance.</b> [...] Passive devices, which have no source of energy, cannot have <b>negative</b> static <b>resistance.</b> [...] However active devices such as transistors or op-amps can synthesize <b>negative</b> static <b>resistance</b> with feedback, and it is used in some circuits such as gyrators.|$|R
25|$|Each cathode {{can be made}} to glow in the {{characteristic}} neon red-orange color by applying about 170 volts DC at a few milliamperes between a cathode and the anode. The current limiting is normally implemented as an anode resistor of a few tens of thousands of ohms. Nixies exhibit <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> and will maintain their glow at typically 20 V to 30 V below the strike voltage. Some color variation can be observed between types, caused by differences in the gas mixtures used. Longer-life tubes that were manufactured later in the Nixie timeline have mercury added to reduce sputtering resulting in a blue or purple tinge to the emitted light. In some cases, these colors are filtered out by a red or orange filter coating on the glass.|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} {{interpretation of}} this is that the reflection cannot be greater than the incident wave when only passive elements are involved (but see <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> amplifier for an example where this condition does not hold).

2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E
2500|$|A {{semiconductor}} diode's current–voltage characteristic can {{be tailored}} by selecting the semiconductor {{materials and the}} doping impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture. These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions. [...] For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage (Zener diodes), to protect circuits from high voltage surges (avalanche diodes), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers (varactor diodes), to generate radio-frequency oscillations (tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, IMPATT diodes), and to produce light (light-emitting diodes). Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT diodes exhibit <b>negative</b> <b>resistance,</b> which is useful in microwave and switching circuits.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the turn}} of the century it was found that <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> mercury lamps could amplify, and were also tried in repeaters. The {{concurrent}} development of thermionic valves starting ca. 1902, provided an entirely electronic method of amplifying signals. The first practical version of such devices was the Audion triode, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. [...] In analogy to previous types of relays in telegraphy and telephony, the amplifying vacuum tube was first called an electron relay. In the first extensive commercial use of the vacuum tube, such repeaters powered the first transcontinental telephone line for commercial service in 1915.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{electronic}} devices operate under effect of quantum tunneling. It even {{exists in the}} simple light switch. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as resonant tunneling diode. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by resonant tunneling through two or more potential barriers (see right figure). Its <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to Fermi level, tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum [...] mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such {{electronic devices}}.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{they are}} nonlinear, <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> devices {{have a more}} {{complicated}} behavior than the positive [...] "ohmic" [...] resistances usually encountered in electric circuits. Unlike most positive resistances, <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> devices can have <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range. Therefore, {{there is no real}} [...] "negative resistor" [...] analogous to a positive resistor, which has a constant <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> over an arbitrarily wide range of current.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> {{oscillator}} {{model is}} not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with two-port amplifying devices such as transistors and tubes also have <b>negative</b> <b>resistance.</b> [...] At high frequencies, transistors and FETs do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> due to internal feedback, causing them to oscillate. [...] So high frequency oscillators in general are designed using <b>negative</b> <b>resistance</b> techniques.|$|E
2500|$|If the IV {{curve is}} nonmonotonic (with peaks and troughs), the curve has a {{negative}} slope in some regions—so in these regions the device has <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance.</b> [...] Devices with <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance</b> can amplify a signal applied to them, and are used to make amplifiers and oscillators. [...] These include tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, IMPATT diodes, magnetron tubes, and unijunction transistors.|$|R

The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude. This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.|$|R
40|$|<b>Negative</b> {{differential}} <b>resistance</b> - {{a decrease}} in current with increasing bias voltage - is a counter-intuitive effect that is observed in various molecular junctions. Here, we present a novel mechanism that {{may be responsible for}} such an effect, based on strong Coulomb interaction between electrons in the molecule and electrons on the atoms closest to the molecule. The Coulomb interaction induces electron-hole binding across the molecule-electrode interface, resulting in a renormalized and enhanced molecule-electrode coupling. Using a self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we show that the effective coupling is non-monotonic in bias voltage, leading to <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance.</b> The model is in accord with recent experimental observations that showed a correlation between the <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance</b> and the coupling strength. We provide detailed suggestions for experimental tests which may help to shed light on the origin of the <b>negative</b> differential <b>resistance.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that the interface Coulomb interaction affects not only the I-V curves but also the thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions...|$|R
