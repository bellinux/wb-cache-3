40|$|As {{a result}} of {{criminal}} activity, human bodies are sometimes dismembered and concealed within sealed, plastic waste sacks. Consequently, due to the inhibited ingress of insects and dismemberment, the rate of decomposition of the body parts within may be different to that of whole, exposed bodies. Correspondingly, once found, an estimation of the postmortem interval may be affected and lead to erroneous inferences. This study set out to determine whether insects were excluded and how rate of decomposition was affected inside such plastic sacks. The limbs, torsos and heads of 24 dismembered pigs were sealed using <b>nylon</b> <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> within plastic garbage sacks, half of which were of a type claimed to repel insects. Using a body scoring scale to quantify decomposition, the body parts in the sacks were compared to those of ten exposed, whole pig carcasses. Insects {{were found to have}} entered both types of plastic sack. There was no difference in rate of decomposition in the two types of sack (F 1, 65 = 1. 78, p = 0. 19), but this was considerably slower than those of whole carcasses (F 1, 408 = 1453, p < 0. 001), with heads showing the largest differences. As well as a slower decomposition, sacks resulted in formation of some adipocere tissue as {{a result of}} high humidity within. Based upon existing methods, postmortem intervals for body parts within sealed sacks would be significantly underestimated...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to dramatic losses of reef-building corals and ongoing lack of recovery, a small-scale coral transplant project was initiated in the Caribbean (U. S. Virgin Islands) in 1999 and was followed for 12 years. The primary objectives were to (1) identify {{a source of}} coral colonies for transplantation that would not result in damage to reefs, (2) test the feasibility of transplanting storm-generated coral fragments, and (3) develop a simple, inexpensive method for transplanting fragments that could be conducted by the local community. The ultimate goal was to enhance abundance of threatened reef-building species on local reefs. Storm-produced coral fragments of two threatened reef-building species [Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis (Acroporidae) ] and another fast-growing species [Porites porites (Poritidae) ] were collected from environments hostile to coral fragment survival and transplanted to degraded reefs. Inert <b>nylon</b> <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> were used to attach transplanted coral fragments to dead coral substrate. Survival of 75 reference colonies and 60 transplants was assessed over 12 years. Only 9 % of colonies were alive after 12 years: no A. cervicornis; 3 % of A. palmata transplants and 18 % of reference colonies; and 13 % of P. porites transplants and 7 % of reference colonies. Mortality rates for all species were high and were similar for transplant and reference colonies. Physical dislodgement resulted {{in the loss of}} 56 % of colonies, whereas 35 % died in place. Only A. palmata showed a difference between transplant and reference colony survival and that was in the first year only. Location was a factor in survival only for A. palmata reference colonies and after year 10. Even though the tested methods and concepts were proven effective in the field over the 12 -year study, they do not present a solution. No coral conservation strategy will be effective until underlying intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors driving high mortality rates are understood and mitigated or eliminated. Rev. Biol.

40|$|A spayed {{crossbred}} {{female dog}} was presented due to progressive weight loss, emesis and anorexia over the preceding month. A complete blood count, urinalysis, serum biochemical panel, and ultrasound were initially performed. Computed tomography urography was performed as a complementary exam. Based on ultrasound and CT findings an exploratory celiotomy {{was performed to}} remove hyperdense structures {{that could be the}} cause of the hydronephrosis and hydroureter in both kidneys. An extensive granulomatous reaction was found near the caudal pole to the left kidney. A <b>nylon</b> <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> adhering firmly to this tissue was removed during surgical excision. On the dorsal surface of the bladder an extensive granulomatous reaction that had entrapped the right ureter was also noted. Another <b>nylon</b> <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> was removed and the ureter was released. Eight months postoperatively, the dog was in good general physical condition, showing appetite and vigour. Abdominal ultrasonography showed improvement of the hydronephrosis in both kidneys. The urea ratio was normal, but the creatinine level was slightly elevated, suggesting a guarded prognosis. Thus, bilateral hydronephrosis as observed in the present study should be considered as a major complication after elective ovariohysterectomy...|$|R

2500|$|As police {{began to}} conduct {{thorough}} inquiries into Taylor's background, {{they discovered that}} he was a frequent user of lonely hearts advertisements. Through his telephone records they identified the women he had contacted in this way and began to interview them. One woman who had dated Taylor disclosed that Taylor told her he liked tying women up and locking them in a cupboard. Another said that Taylor had told her that he had a fetish for [...] "bondage, whips and ties", and [...] said that he wanted to tie her daughter up with <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> and have sexual intercourse with her. A former girlfriend, who had briefly lived with Taylor, told police that she had often visited Lindley Woods with him while they were dating, and that she had eventually broke off the relationship with him because of his bondage fetish and the feeling [...] "that she was being raped". When asked by police to describe how Taylor would tie her, she described his practice of securing a plastic <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> around each of her wrists, then tying her hands behind her back by using a third <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> to link them. This was exactly how Tiernan had been found. She also said that Taylor kept a bundle of the <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> in a drawer next to his bed. Two other women also said that Taylor enjoyed bondage during sex, and had bound their breasts and hands with <b>cable</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> (also {{known as}} a hose tie, steggel tie, zap strap or zip tie, and by the brand names Ty-Rap and Panduit strap) {{is a type of}} fastener, for holding items together, {{primarily}} electrical cables or wires. Because of their low cost and ease of use, <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> are ubiquitous, finding use {{in a wide range of}} other applications. Stainless steel versions, either naked or coated with a rugged plastic, cater for exterior applications and hazardous environments.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it {{is prevented from being}} pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.|$|R

25|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> {{also known}} as a zip tie or tie-wrap, is a type of fastener, {{especially}} for binding several electronic cables or wires together and to organize cables and wires. They have also been commonly used as makeshift handcuffs, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Panama. The <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts. Logan filed U.S. patent #3,022,557 on June 24, 1958 which was issued to him on February 27, 1962.|$|R

When asked why he had abducted Tiernan, he replied: [...] "I have no idea". When police challenged his version of taking the body to Lindley Woods soon after the murder, he claimed that he had first kept the body hidden underneath pallets in his back garden, and then stored her inside his sofa.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} form {{of plastic}} handcuffs are <b>cable</b> <b>ties,</b> with either two interlocking straps, {{or a single}} <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> around both wrists. More recently, plastics-manufacturing companies have started to produce special devices comprising two interconnected straps as one item. These are generally injection moulded nylon items, selling for tens of cents each. Various innovations on the plastic handcuff theme have been developed, including models which can be released using a regular handcuff key, and extremely lightweight restraints made from nylon cord, using a plastic device to hold the cord tight.|$|R
