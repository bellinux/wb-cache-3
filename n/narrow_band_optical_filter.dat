Precise and continuous ethylene monitoring is very advantageous since low ethylene concentrations are produced by the fruit itself and are indicative of its ripeness, and on other occasions, ethylene is externally added when ripeness or degreening of the product must be promoted. In this work, a multichannel mid-infrared spectrometer for ethylene measurement is built and characterized. The instrument contains additional channels to reject potential cross-interferences like ammonia and ethanol. Additionally, these channels are useful for monitoring a potential malfunction of the cooling system and possible fouling of the fruit, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of using UV spectroscopy for a simple detection system for formaldehyde gas in the indoor environment. Formaldehyde gas is hazardous to human health causing irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, headaches, limited pulmonary function and is a potential carcinogen. Formaldehyde derivatives are used in plywood and fibre board, carpeting, fabrics and some paints. The gas can be emitted from these materials and can build up in the indoor environment. Current methods for detecting formaldehyde gas that are simple, reliable and inexpensive are limited. A literature study of chemicals common to the indoor environment was carried out, and their UV absorption spectra compared to that of formaldehyde. 85 substances and substance groups were considered, 11 of which had absorption spectra that overlapped with the formaldehyde UV absorption band. A region was found between 320 and 360 nm with very little spectral interference. Given the number of gases considered, this was a surprising result. Formaldehyde has several strong absorption peaks between regions of very low absorption, allowing for low resolution detection using a single LED source. Two prototype detection systems were developed. The first used a UV LED light source and used a beam splitter to provide one detection channel and one reference channel.

The first describes a 3 year measurement campaign of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, carbonyl sulfide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde total column amounts over Wollongong, in New South Wales, Australia (34. 4 °S, 150. 9 °E). The measurements were made by the examination of the intensity of characteristic absorption features observed in infrared spectra obtained by ground-based solar spectrometry. Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and hydrogen cyanide total column amounts increased over the campaign whilst a decrease was observed for carbon monoxide and formaldehyde. A larger than expected decrease in the carbonyl sulfide total column was also observed. The second part of the thesis describes the investigation of the above methods suitability as a possible measurement tool for trace gases in the remote marine boundary layer. Spectra were collected at solar zenith angles greater than 90 o above the marine horizon on 4 days. Enhanced absorption features were observed for a large number of species and a spectral region for the possible observation of hypochlorous acid was identified. The experimental setup allowed for transmission of some infrared radiation but not enough to generate a sufficient signal to noise ratio for meaningful calculations to be made. Almost all absorption features were partially saturated or had low signal to noise. Despite these problems, some simple changes to the experimental setup may prove this to be a useful method with preliminary calculations indicating high information content for the marine boundary layer in solar spectra observed at zenith angles greater the 88 o with signal to noise ratios of 100. The use of <b>narrower</b> <b>optical</b> <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> for the collection of the dawn spectra is recommended in a bid to increase the signal to noise ratio required for meaningful observations of the marine boundary layer to be made...|$|R
40|$|Bragg microcavities (BMs) {{formed by}} the {{successive}} stacking of nanocolumnar porous SiO 2 and TiO 2 layers with slanted, zig-zag, chiral and vertical configurations are prepared by physical vapor deposition at oblique angles (PV-OAD) while azimuthally varying the substrate orientation during the multilayer growth. The slanted and zig-zag BMs act as wavelength selective optical retarders when they are illuminated with linearly polarized light, while no polarization dependence is observed for the chiral and vertical cavities. This distinct optical behavior is attributed to a self-nanostructuration mechanism involving a fence-bundling association of nanocolumns as observed by Focused Ion Beam- Scanning electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) in the slanted and zig-zag microcavities. The outstanding retarder response of the optically active BMs can be effectively modulated by dynamic infiltration of nano- and meso-pores with liquids of different refraction indices acting as a switch of the polarization behavior. The unprecedented polarization and tunable optofluidic properties of these nanostructured photonic systems have been successfully simulated with a simple model that assumes a certain birefringence for the individual stacked layers and accounts for the light interference phenomena developed in the BMs. The possibilities {{of this type of}} self-arranged nanostructured and optically active BMs for liquid sensing and monitoring applications are discussedThe last innovations in the field of optofluidics have {{led to the development of}} highly versatile optical systems with a wide range of applications both at the micro and macroscales and a high impact in fields such as energy, 1 photonics, 2 microfluidics, 3 or sensors and biosensors. 4 Outstanding examples relying on the light control by means of liquids flowing through devices include adaptive and tunable microlenses, 5, 6 optofluidic dye lasers 7 or advanced optofluidic microscopes. 8 Light polarization by liquids containing chiral molecules or by anisotropic solids is a classical optical principle widely used in advanced technologies for chemical analysis, communications, displays and photonics that, except for very recent works using complex polymer particles, 9 has not been addressed merging in a single device optics with microfluidics or nanofluidics. 3 In the present work we report about the development of a series of nanostructured planar Bragg microcavities (BM) devices prepared by physical vapor oblique angle deposition (PV-OAD) where a singular association of individual nanostructural units in the form of long asymmetric ensembles confers outstanding optical properties and a peculiar polarization activity that can be used for different applications including liquid monitoring. In particular, we have found that light polarization can be effectively controlled by liquid circulation and filling of the nano and mesopores existing in this type of structures. The liquid-mediated control of the activity of planar BMs constitutes a first case of polarizer thin films optofluidics with high impact prospects for the fabrication of polarization active systems, wavelength retarders, photonic sensors or liquid monitoring devices. In addition, the singular association of nanocolumns responsible for the peculiar polarization properties of these systems constitutes a prominent example of the interplay between structural effects at the nano-scale and their correlation in the form of new properties at the macroscale. Thin films fabrication by PV-OAD, also known as Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD), 10, 11 is a straightforward procedure to tailor film porosities while achieving a strict control over optical properties such as refraction index 12, 13 or optical anisotropy and birefringence. 14, 15 In the called “sculptured thin films”, 16, 17 a class of nanostructured GLAD materials, their singular topography, geometry and in-depth architecture permits an effective control of their refractive index and birefringence and the development of optically active photonic structures 18 – 23 or helicoidally bi-anisotropic media acting for example as <b>narrow</b> <b>band</b> pass <b>optical</b> <b>filters,</b> 24 selective circularly polarized light transmitters 25 or selective linearly polarized transmitters. 26 In this regard, although polarization inactive SiO 2 -TiO 2 one dimensional photonic crystals (1 DPC) 27, 28 and Bragg microcavities (BM) 29 have been also prepared by PVD-OAD, no polarization activity is known for such two-oxide layered systems. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that two-oxide BMs prepared by PVD-OAD can be manufactured as polarization active systems behaving as wavelength dependent retarders. We also show that this polarization activity can be systematically and continuously controlled adjusting the refractive index of the liquids circulating through these porous layer nanostructures. To account for this behavior, we have developed a simple optical model where each particular layer in the stack is taken as birefringent in a degree that varies with the refraction index of the liquid filling the pores. Moreover, the analysis of the optical and optofluidic properties is sustained on a systematic study by Focus Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) of the nanostructural features and association mechanisms at the nanoscale responsible for the polarization activity of these porous BMsPeer reviewe...|$|R

We observed 15 Mon, an O 7 Ve-type star, using five different pointings to position the star at different locations on three WFPC 2 chips (PC 1, WF 2, and WF 3) to study possible filter inhomogeneities. We also observed g Gem, a K 4 III-type star, with WF 3 as a follow-up to further study selected filters. Our results for F 160 BW, F 170 W, F 300 W, and F 336 W show good agreement (within 20 %) between the observed off-band count rates and those predicted by SYNPHOT. Filters F 185 W, F 218 W, and F 255 W showed significant discrepancies between the observed and predicted values (20 % to 250 %); we derived new throughput curves for these filters, and delivered them to CDBS. The F 122 M filter shows evidence for a long-term throughput decline and will require additional studies {{beyond the scope of}} this report. 1...|$|R
