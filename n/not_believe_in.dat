5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist he did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable {{fate of the}} prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned {{the theme of the}} crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong is a multi-faith society. A {{majority}} of residents of Hong Kong have no religious affiliation, professing {{a form of}} agnosticism or atheism. According to the United States Department of State 43 {{percent of the population}} practises some form of religion. According to a Gallup poll, 64% of Hong Kong residents do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> any religion.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt still owned a {{house in}} Tombstone with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, but she waited for him in Colton, where his parents and Virgil were living. During the summer of 1882, she sent Wyatt a letter saying she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he {{had asked her to}} marry him. Wyatt, who did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|As a critic, Willis did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> {{including}} {{discussions of}} personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, {{they should not}} express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when}} many publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness {{does not seem to}} make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E

5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul {{was one of three}} U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{took over}} the Georgia Tech {{football}} program in 1945 following Coach Alexander's retirement as head football coach. Dodd's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development. He did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd's philosophy translated to winning; he set the record for career wins at Tech with 165, including a 31-game unbeaten streak from 1951–1953. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and the 1952 national title, which concluded a perfect 12–0 season and Sugar Bowl conquest of Ole Miss. Under Dodd's leadership, Tech played in 13 major bowl games, winning 9, including six in a row. Bobby Dodd compiled a 165–64–8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Loucks Devers {{was born}} on 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, a small {{industrial}} town in the southeastern corner of the state. His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks Devers, a homemaker. He {{was the first of}} the couple's four children. He had two younger brothers, Frank and Phillip, and a younger sister, Catherine, known as Kitts. The Devers, of Irish and German-Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> smoking or drinking. While providing a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple taught them to value dependability, integrity and industriousness.|$|E

5|$|Marshall did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> rule by the masses, {{frequently}} {{expressing his}} {{disdain for the}} common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most {{of the members of}} his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in.</b> The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at the company did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> it and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. In the end they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees started Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season. He {{was again}} named an All-Star during the 1938 season. Yankees' manager Joe McCarthy, who managed the AL {{team in the}} All-Star Game, chose {{teammate}} Lefty Gomez as the starting pitcher. As McCarthy did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> pitching two players from the same team in an All-Star Game, Ruffing did {{not appear in the}} game. He led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season. He also tied for the AL lead in shutouts during with three, while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the league, behind only Grove. Ruffing pitched the opening game of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs. He won two games in the series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs. Ruffing finished fourth in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him.

As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E
