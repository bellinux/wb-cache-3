50|$|Indian {{independence}} and Partition in 1947 {{had brought with}} it a choice for South Asians in Mozambique: <b>Pakistani</b> <b>nationality,</b> or that of the Republic of India. Most of the Hindus, {{as well as some}} of the Muslims, chose Indian citizenship. Some of the larger traders also took advantage of a third option, retention of British nationality. Finally, many registered their Mozambican-born children as Portuguese citizens. These choices would soon come to have large political significance. In response to the 1961 Indian annexation of Goa, the Portuguese interned all the Indian nationals in Mozambique in concentration camps, and froze their bank accounts by order of Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar. Though ostensibly done for their protection, in fact, the Portuguese hoped to use their freedom as a bargaining chip in exchange for the freedom of 3,200 Portuguese who had been captured in Goa. Among other effects, this spurred many of the Muslims who had initially chosen Indian nationality to switch their allegiance to Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|Khan {{concurrently}} holds <b>Pakistani</b> <b>nationality</b> and British National (Overseas) status. His {{father came}} to Hong Kong in 1915, {{when the city}} was still ruled by the British Empire. His uncle served in the Hong Kong Police Force, and {{was killed in a}} bombing in 1944 during World War II. After the war, his father settled in Diamond Hill, where he ran a dairy farm. Khan himself was born in Hong Kong in 1962 and studied at the former Mansfield College in Knutsford Terrace, Tsim Sha Tsui; he was the only member of his class not of Chinese ethnicity, and thus became fluent in Cantonese. He graduated in 1976. During the 1980s, when the wave of emigration from Hong Kong was reaching its peak, Khan made the decision to remain in Hong Kong, stating that he saw it as his home. He runs a trading company, due to which he travels frequently to Shenzhen for business and speaks Mandarin Chinese as well.|$|R
40|$|Background: Data {{on the use}} of {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) analgesics comparing different adolescent {{ethnic groups}} is scarce. In Oslo, almost one quarter of the adolescent population come from an immigrant background. 	 Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} describe possible differences in the use of OTC analgesics between Norwegian adolescents (15 - 16 year olds) and adolescents with Muslim and Other immigrant background. Methods: A survey on health and medication use was undertaken among 10 graders (15 - 16 year olds) in all Secondary Schools in Oslo, Norway. This was the youth part of the Oslo Health Study in 2000 - 2001. There were 7343 participants in the survey, 3612 boys and 3695 girls. Results: Norwegian adolescents were more likely to report use of OTC analgesics during the past four weeks, 24, 4 % of the boys and 57, 5 % of the girls reported using such medication. In the Muslim group, 17, 9 % of the boys and 34, 5 % of the girls reported use of OTC analgesics. Similar figures for Other immigrant background were 21, 8 % and 32, 9 %. Use within the Muslim group depended on <b>nationality,</b> among <b>Pakistani</b> girls only 24, 0 % had used these preparations, while 60, 4 % of Iranian girls reported the same. The differences were not as striking for boys. Conclusions: A difference exists across ethnicity in adolescents’ use of OTC analgesics. Adolescents from Muslim and Other immigrant background countries used less OTC analgesics than ethnic Norwegians. The use within the Muslim group further depends on nationality...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{research}} performance of Pakistani library and information science (LIS) scholars, using the altmetrics provided by ResearchGate (RG). Design/methodology/approach: Purposive sampling was used to collect profiles between 15 January 2015 and 30 April 2016 of all members of RG who had self-identified as being an LIS scholar of <b>Pakistani</b> <b>nationality.</b> Additional demographic data were obtained through a small survey administered via Google Docs. Resultant data were analysed in SPSS Version 21. Findings: Study results were broadly consistent in terms of demographical data with previous studies of this cohort. There was a positive correlation between publications, reads, and citations for scholars who had recorded at least one publication. The majority of publications had not been published in a high impact factor journal. Academic networking site profiles create the potential for collaboration, building connections, and exchanging information. Research limitations/implications: Some scholars eliminated from this study may have published at least one output but neglected to upload details to RG. It is a purposive, exploratory study that provides insights into future research. Practical implications: The paper produces findings of relevance to researchers in other countries and/or disciplines who may wish to conduct a similar study of a defined cohort. Originality/value: There have been no previous published research studies on altmetrics associated with Pakistani LIS scholars. Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{national}} population census {{began on}} 15 March 2017 and end on 25 May 2017. This census {{will be held}} {{after a period of}} 19 years. The transgender community will be included in the national population census.Census of 2017 is of very important due to the social-economical position of Pakistan after the flagship contact of One Belt One Road project and also the distribution of resources among the provinces and the new constituencies will be decided on these statistical information collected by this census for the elections of 2018.After completion of many military operations and some are still being operated in the North Waziristan and in the whole country against the terrorist and the some groups affiliated with the ISIS and Al-QAEDA. Entertaining the Afghan refugees for the last 12 years in the country after the Afghan-US war, will also affect the census. Many afghan refugees have the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>nationality</b> and are now the citizens of Pakistan and earn their living here.Rest of the unregistered refugees will be sent back to their mother land (Afghanistan). Many political parties have the concern regarding the transparency of census being conducted due to the issues of the internally displaced persons (IDP's) and some have concerns related to the new constituencies and the transfer of voters from one particular area to any other constituency.|$|R
40|$|Based on the Theory of Contrastive Analysis and Inter-language Theory, {{this paper}} investigates the common initial errors of Korean {{fundamental}} Chinese learners in different groups. The {{data were analyzed}} by listening to it and were described with IPA. 7 initial errors were found in this paper, such as a) errors of recognizing and pronouncing “b” and “p”; b) errors of “z/c/s” and “zh/ch/sh” c) errors in pronouncing “r” and so on. In order to avoid contributing all the errors {{to the impact of}} first language transfer, the students were chosen with 3 different <b>nationalities,</b> including Korean, <b>Pakistani</b> and Brazilian. The participants are all at the same age without any experience of learning a third language. This research analyzed the errors’ reasons in terms of interlanguage transfer, intralingual transfer, students’ learning attitudes and the impact of target language. Softwares called Praat and Cooledit were used to analyze the data. The reasons were analyzed {{with the help of the}} format, burst and VOT of the spectrograms. The results indicated that some errors made by all the students from different countries are due to the difficulties of the target language. As for these mistakes, even some native speakers may make them in their daily life. The reasons for these errors can be traced back to the target language itself, rather than relating them to the negative transfer of the first language. At last, some useful pedagogical recommendations were mentioned to facilitate the Chinese language education. 本文以对比分析理论与中介语理论为理论基础，以调查分析法为研究方法对 韩国初级汉语学习者的汉语声母偏误进行了分组对比研究。语音资料以由经过专 业训练的母语者听辨的方式进行统计，并得出韩国学生声母偏误共 7 个，例如： 送气音与不送气音混淆；舌尖前音与舌尖后音混淆；舌尖后浊擦音闪音化，舌面 音尖音化等。 为了避开当前研究将偏误原因完全归结于母语负迁移的错误，笔者通过对比韩国、巴基斯坦、巴西三类同等水平、无第三外语、年龄相同的汉语学习者的不同偏误情况，对偏误产生原因进行了细致分析。本文从语际迁移、语内迁移、学习者学习态度和目的语语言本体角度；以Praat、Cooledit 等语音软件为分析手段；通过观察共振峰、冲直条、嗓音起始时间等元素来分析韩国初级汉语学习者声母偏误产生的原因。 经过分析，本文得出结论：即某些所有国家学生都出现发音偏误的声母，其自身都有相当的难度，母语学习者在学习的时候也会出现种种错误。这种情况下，偏误则是由目的语本身的难度等级影响而来。母语负迁移只是影响了学生声母偏误的形式。另外，笔者还针对韩国学生出现的不同偏误提出了针对性的教学方法，希望可以对对韩汉语声母教学方面有所启示。published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R
40|$|Short tandem Repeats (STRs) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} genetic markers used in forensic human identification. However, {{in some cases they}} are not able to yield complete profiles because of DNA degradation and/or inhibition. The STR profiling of the degraded/inhibited DNA samples can result in allelic drop-outs and even no profile at all. Alternatively, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used to address the issues of DNA degradation and inhibition due to their smaller amplicons. But their use in regular forensic case work is limited due to additional steps (sequencing based) and time consuming process. To bridge the gap between STRs and SNPs by combining their characteristics, another type of genetic marker, insertion deletion polymorphisms (INDELs), offer an effective way to analyze challenged DNA sample (degraded and inhibited ones). INDELs have short amplicons, low mutation rates, no stutter peaks and are analyzed using the same equipment and protocols as STR polymorphisms. In this study, the forensic efficiency of 30 autosomal INDELs contained within the Qiagen™ Investigator™ DIPplex kit were tested by using 500 samples from individuals belonging to five different <b>nationalities</b> (Qatari, <b>Pakistani,</b> Sudanese, Tunisian and Yemeni) based in Qatar. Population indices and forensic parameters were calculated. The results showed no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and no evidence of linkage disequilibrium for all of 30 markers was found after applying Bonferroni’s correction (P < 0. 00166). The Combined Power of Discrimination (CPD) for the 30 INDEL loci was 0. 9999999 for all of five populations which shows that these 30 markers are very efficient and suitable for forensic casework. The Combined Probability of Match (CPM) was calculated in the order of 10 - 13 which is a satisfactory value for forensic purposes. In addition to assess forensic efficiency of 30 autosomal INDELs, an effort was also made to derive ancestry information by using different statistical systems (Arlequin, Snipper and STRUCTURE). The results indicated that 30 INDELs contained in Qiagen™ Investigator® DIPplex kit, although useful for forensic identification, poorly differentiate five population groups of Qatar. The reason of failure in differentiating the populations, lies in the selection of INDEL markers, which were chosen for identification purpose (i. e. they have similar allele frequencies in different populations) rather than deriving the ancestry information (i. e. iii ancestry informative markers are chosen on the basis that their allele frequencies need to be different for different populations). In order to recover genetic information lost during DNA degradation, the concept of reduced sized PCR products (mini amplicons) has been developed. MiniFiler® kit (Applied Biosystems™) containing 8 mini-STRs (developed by re-designing the primers of 8 STRs contained in Identifiler Plus® kit) provide a possible solution of DNA degradation. By using similar mini-plex approach, a multiplex PCR assay for INDELs (named as mini-INDELs) has been developed in this research. A total of 14 autosomal INDEL markers were selected and short amplicons were designed for them keeping in view that they could perform efficiently on degraded samples. The multiplex of 14 INDELs was designed and optimized successfully in a single tube reaction. All the markers were amplified adequately with good peak balance and expected amplicon sizes. The sensitivity of mini-INDELs was found upto 0. 03125 ng of genomic DNA with complete and balanced profile. The concordance between mini-INDELs kit and Qiagen™ Investigator™ DIPplex kit (for the common loci) was observed in 99. 7...|$|R
