40|$|Implementations of mini hydro schemes with {{conventional}} hydraulic, electrical equipment's and controllers have proven very expensive and uneconomical. Many developing {{countries that are}} in need of rural electrification have encountered economical problem when setting up these mini hydro schemes. To address this problem, alternative options and <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> of these equipment's have been explored by many researchers around the world. The application of these <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> would reduce the overall cost of mini hydro development and would help in making it a cost effective technology. These <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> will also help developing countries to provide electricity to rural areas or remote regions where interconnection of transmission line from the electrical grid is uneconomical. The <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> can also be an enabling factor in boosting up electricity generation using a renewable energy source. This paper provides survey of all these alternative options and <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> in the controller, hydraulic turbine and generators that have been implemented in different countries of the world...|$|R

5|$|Just as the <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created {{a problem that}} was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the <b>new</b> <b>design</b> was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
