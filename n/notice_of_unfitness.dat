50|$|The {{warranty}} {{of fitness}} for a particular purpose is implied when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request.

This implied warranty can also be expressly disclaimed by name, thereby shifting the risk <b>of</b> <b>unfitness</b> back to the buyer.|$|R

Studies from real-world practice 1 and experimental clinical trials 2 – 4 have documented that age and frailty are prime predictors of outcome in AML. Accordingly, a proper assessment of patient’s fitness represents a critical step in the therapeutic decision-making process of AML. 5, 6 Notwithstanding, physicians lack a common framework for esta-blishing unfitness to different therapies in AML. A comprehensive evaluation of geriatric domains is time consuming and costly, and it measures characteristics that are not independently predictive of treatment toxicity, early mortality and overall survival in AML patients. More simple indexes, like the adapted Charlson comorbidity index 7 and the hematopoietc cell transplantation co-morbidity index, 8 have an inherent risk of overemphasizing the measure of frailty of the patient with AML at diagnosis, being developed for patients in advanced stages of the disease. In view of the clinical relevance of having a uniform and feasible definition <b>of</b> <b>unfitness</b> in AML, we sought to provide such a definition by using the group and consensus methodologie...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for designing classifiers for a-class (2) problem using genetic programming (GP). The proposed approach takes an integrated view of all classes when the GP evolves. A multitree representation of chromosomes is used. In this context, we propose a modified crossover operation and a new mutation operation that reduces the destructive nature of conventional genetic operations. We use a new concept <b>of</b> <b>unfitness</b> <b>of</b> a tree to select trees for genetic operations. This gives more opportunity to unfit trees to become fit. A new concept of OR-ing chromosomes in the terminal population is introduced, which enables us to get a classifier with better performance. Finally, a weight-based scheme and some heuristic rules characterizing typical ambiguous situations are used for conflict resolution. The classifier is capable of saying “don’t know” when faced with unfamiliar examples. The effectiveness of our scheme is demonstrated on several real data sets...|$|R

Morgan, had since moved to New Zealand, and initially refuses to play the match. It is later revealed that {{this is because of}} a love triangle which had developed between the two and Llewellyn's fiancée Bronwen. He is persuaded to play, {{for the sake of his}} country, but there is considerable acrimony between the two players which threatens to disrupt the team's performance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A user {{modeling}} server {{is an important}} part of modern distributed E-Learning architectures. The {{user modeling}} server CUMULATE has two main levels: the event storage and multiple inference agents. To evaluate adaptive systems functioning as components of the common distributed architecture and using CUMULATE as the central user modeling server we need to evaluate the adaptation provided by those agents. Unfortunately, there are no commonly accepted approaches to the evaluation of the universal user modeling server. This paper describes the results of layered evaluation of our recent topic-based adaptation engine based on the activity students performed using the system QuizGuide. User modeling and adaptation processes are evaluated separately. While previous evaluation experiments of QuizGuide based on the traditional “with-and-without ” approach showed that students like the system and benefit from it, this paper provides evidence <b>of</b> <b>unfitness</b> <b>of</b> large topics as knowledge assessment units used for adaptation, which challenges the reasonableness of the entire adaptation performed by the system. ...|$|R

Current estimates of the cost of comprehensive renewal are said to run into billions of pounds. There is also a genuine concern that the number of unfit dwellings will continue to increase regardless of the steady pace of renewal programmes. Arguably this concern has greatly influenced the dynamics of primary maintenance attributes of property owners. The primary attributes are recognised to be a product of increased owner-maintenance awareness; enhanced owner-maintenance skills and knowledge; and the owner-maintenance management abilities. These attributes are interwoven, and therefore cannot be left out of current initiatives to improving the backlog of under-maintenance in the owner-occupier sector...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination. The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.
