5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive. The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff noted his {{enjoyment}} of the storyline, but he mostly enjoyed the episode's inclusion and voice work of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. He also commented favorably on the gags that describe Russia as filled with bears on unicycles and that Adam West {{turns out to be}} the Russian sleeper agent. He criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets. He graded the episode a B, tying with The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show. IGN Television critic Ahsan Haque gave the episode a mixed review, stating that he did not like the improv storyline, and he was <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> with Peter's usage of Joe's American flag as toilet paper. However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel to Russia, and he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.|$|E

25|$|It was in 1785 that WCC first {{appeared}} in an important match. White Conduit Fields was an open area allowing members of the public, including the rowdier elements, to watch the matches and to voice their opinions on the play and the players. The White Conduit gentlemen were <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> by such interruptions and decided {{to look for a}} more private venue of their own.|$|E

25|$|The {{losses on}} the Franco-Batavian side far outweighed the British losses: 1,876 {{dead and wounded}} against 184. The defeat did not miss {{its effect on the}} morale of the Batavian troops. During the night a false rumor of a British attack caused panic among the troops of Daendels' division. Their flight was stopped at Daendels' {{headquarters}} in St. Pancras, {{but a few of the}} fleeing troopers reached Alkmaar where they caused more panic. Some even fled as far as Haarlem. Brune was <b>not</b> <b>amused.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{rebellion}} became entangled {{with the}} Kumul rebellion, when a Chinese Muslim and Uyghur army under Ma Zhancang and Timur Beg marched on Kashgar against the Chinese Muslim Daotai Ma Shaowu and his garrison of Han Chinese troops. Ma Shaowu began to panic and started raising Kirghiz levies under Osman Ali {{to defend the}} city. The Kirghiz were <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> at how their rebellion was crushed the previous year by Ma Shaowu, and now {{he wanted them to}} defend the city. They defected en masse to the enemy. However, Ma Zhancang also entered into secret negotiations with Ma Shaowu; he and his troops soon defected to the Han Chinese garrison in the city.|$|E
500|$|Offenbach {{was well}} known for parodying other composers' music. Some of them saw the joke and others did not. Adam, Auber and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach's parodies of their scores. Meyerbeer {{made a point of}} {{attending}} all Bouffes-Parisiens productions, always seated in Offenbach's private box. Among the composers who were <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> by Offenbach's parodies were Berlioz and Wagner. Offenbach mocked Berlioz's [...] "strivings after the antique", and his initial light-hearted satire of Wagner's pretensions later hardened into genuine dislike. Berlioz reacted by bracketing Offenbach and Wagner together as [...] "the product of the mad German mind", and Wagner, ignoring Berlioz, retaliated by writing some unflattering verses about Offenbach.|$|E

500|$|In January 1646, amid ongoing peace negotiations, Charles {{attempted}} {{to separate the}} Independents from other factions by proposing in letters to Vane an alliance with his faction against the Presbyterians. [...] Vane was <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> by this, and responded {{by pointing out that}} he preferred the rights of [...] "tender consciences" [...] to be granted by Parliament than by the duplicitous king (papers exposing the king's negotiating positions as facades had been captured at Naseby, and had largely silenced the Royalist elements in Parliament). [...] The Vane estates were not spared in the maelstrom of war; Vane's father reported that Raby Castle had been [...] "visited four times", suffering damages of £16,000. [...] In September 1645, the Vanes succeeded in getting Parliamentary approval to fortify Raby.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Naomi sold a {{valuable}} painting to Paul {{in order to}} pay off her debts. However, the painting was given to her by Charles Tranner (David Whiteley), the married man she had an affair with, and his wife, Polly (Michelle O'Grady), soon turned up to reclaim the artwork. O'Reilly explained that as Charles was away on business, there was definite answer as to who the painting belonged to. She continued, [...] "Naomi says it was a gift, and belongs to her – but Polly argues that Charles used family money to buy it, so she is the owner." [...] Polly and Naomi later ended up in a scrag fight, which had to be broken up the police. O'Reilly enjoyed filming the fight, saying she had [...] "a great time". The police eventually confiscated the painting and Paul demanded his money back. When Naomi was unable to pay him back, Paul asked her to spend the night with him and he would forget the debt. O'Reilly said while Naomi was <b>not</b> <b>amused,</b> part of her admired Paul's tenacity.|$|E
500|$|The {{critics who}} {{did not like the}} film were <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of San Antonio Express-News noting that [...] "this ambitious, {{scratched}} and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the film a high rating, but noted that [...] "the Rodriguez segment is terrific; the Tarantino one long-winded and juvenile." [...] Others considered Death Proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment. Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "t a certain point in Death Proof the scratches and bad splices disappear, and you find yourself watching not an arch, clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert was divided. He gave Grindhouse as a whole {{two and a half stars}} out of four, awarding Planet Terror two stars and Death Proof three stars. Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big-budget R-rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence.|$|E

500|$|The {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock thriller Dial M for Murder. At the beginning of the episode, Stewie rhetorically asks whether or not he can call the television magazine TV Guide [...] "The Guide". In the scene where Brian spies on Meg for the Teen People article, Stewie quickly warns Brian that [...] "not all dogs go to heaven", cutting to a quick scene with the Disney character Goofy from the Mickey Mouse shorts in hell with Satan claiming Goofy was part of the plotting of 9/11. Goofy justified his part in the attacks by pointing out the United States' support for Israel. Goofy is then thrown to the pit of fire, using his famous laugh. In one scene Stewie refers to Meg as [...] "one of those crazy chicks, who hooks up with an even crazier guy," [...] with a photograph of Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey then being shown. The song [...] "The Ballad of Billy the Kid" [...] by singer and performer Billy Joel is used in depicting Peter's flashbacks about being a cowboy. Meg mentions meeting Wesley Snipes in the episode, and mentions his movie Passenger 57. The ending of the episode includes {{a reference to}} The Simpsons, in which Meg makes an unfunny joke, with Peter announcing he is <b>not</b> <b>amused,</b> responding by sarcastically stating [...] "Always end on a strong joke." [...] The start of the closing credits that follow the statement is styled to match those used in The Simpsons credits.|$|E
500|$|Three months later, Meg {{returns home}} with the mind and {{attitude}} of a hardened criminal, complete with a new thuggish and rebellious look. She immediately begins abusing her family, retaliating to the many years of abuse she had endured under them, such as curb-stomping Peter, raping him in the shower with a loofah, and using her mother's shirts as toilet paper (while also keeping a [...] "poop bucket" [...] next to her bed and refusing to empty it until it gets full). In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make fun of her at school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full soda cans which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended. Wanting {{to start a new life}} away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and threatens him with a gun to drive to Mort's Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than the typical American girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is {{notified}} by TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{that he has}} received a promotion as [...] "junior-in-charge-boy of the entire NBC page program" [...] but {{that he will have}} to move out to Los Angeles, which does not sit well with Kenneth. Kenneth tells Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) about this, but Tracy advises him to do a lousy job so that he loses the promotion. While giving a tour around the 30 Rock building, Kenneth does a terrible job, {{and as a result of}} his behavior, Pete is forced to dismiss him. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is shocked to see her boyfriend and Jenna impersonator, Paul (Will Forte), dressed as singer Cher. At Feyoncé (Susan Heyward) and Grizz Griswold's (Grizz Chapman) wedding, which is being held at the TGS set, Jenna is <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> that Paul showed up dressed as Cher, but is surprised that Paul is dressed as her on his left side and Cher on his right, and as a result, the two make-up. Later, at Grizz's wedding, Jack tells Liz that Carol is looking for her. Carol tells Liz that he would like to give her a chance so that the two can have a relationship. At the same time, Kenneth, who is drunk, gets on stage, and gives a ranting speech to his former co-workers, ultimately telling them that he loves them all and hopes that they get everything they want in life.|$|E

500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was <b>not</b> <b>amused</b> by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera." ...|$|E
