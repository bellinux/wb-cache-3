50|$|A knob which rotates {{is usually}} not {{considered}} a fader, although it is electrically and functionally equivalent. Some small mixers use knobs rather than faders, as do {{a small number of}} DJ mixers designed for club DJs who are creating seamless mixes of songs. A fader can be either analogue, directly controlling the resistance or impedance to the source (e.g. a potentiometer); or digital, <b>numerically</b> <b>controlling</b> a digital signal processor (DSP). Analogue faders are found on mixing consoles. A fader can also be used as a control for a voltage controlled amplifier, which has the same effect on the sound as any other fader, but the audio signal does not pass through the fader itself.|$|R

25|$|Instructions for {{manufacturing}} a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, {{or through the}} use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings, but this is becoming an increasing rarity, with the advent of computer <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> (CNC) manufacturing. Engineers primarily manually manufacture parts in the areas of applied spray coatings, finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.|$|E
2500|$|Holes {{through a}} PCB are {{typically}} drilled with small-diameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide. Coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high RPM and high feed to be cost effective. Drill bits must also remain sharp {{so as not}} to mar or tear the traces. Drilling with high-speed-steel is simply not feasible since the drill bits will dull quickly and thus tear the copper and ruin the boards. The drilling is performed by automated drilling machines with placement controlled by a drill tape or drill file. These computer-generated files are also called <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> drill (NCD) files or [...] "Excellon files". The drill file describes the location and size of each drilled hole.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of <b>numerically</b> <b>control</b> and digital drive, it is a trend to put the Electronic Line-Shaft (ELS) technology into printing machine instead of the Mechanical Line-Shafting (MLS). After the shaftless reform of a printing machine for a factory, {{it was found that}} the printing accuracy and speed of most printing units was improved observably except the folding ripple. The paper analyzes the formation reason of folding ripple and the different characteristics between ELS and MLS. The research result shows that also there are many advantages in using ELS the synchronous capability is less than MLS when a periodic disturbance act on them under the same transmission stiffness. Therefore it is proposed that the AC motors must connect directly to the main printing roller to decrease the periodic disturbance and to increase the stiffness during the shaftless reform of printing machine...|$|R

40|$|Lê {{numbers were}} {{introduced}} by Massey {{with the purpose}} of <b>numerically</b> <b>controlling</b> the topological properties of families of non-isolated hypersurface singularities and describing the topology associated with a function with non-isolated singularities. They are a generalization of the Milnor number for isolated hypersurface singularities. In this note the authors investigate the composite of an arbitrary square-free f and z^ 2. They get a formula for the Lê numbers of the composite, and consider two applications of these numbers. The first application is concerned with {{the extent to which the}} Lê numbers are invariant in a family of functions which satisfy some equisingularity condition, the second is a quick proof of a new formula for the Euler obstruction of a hypersurface singularity. Several examples are computed using this formula including any X defined by a function which only has transverse D(q,p) singularities off the origin. Comment: 14 page...|$|R

In vector mode, the navigation processor controls the code and carrier <b>numerically</b> <b>controls</b> oscillators (NCOs) replacing the track-ing loops. A major advantage of this method is that after once a good position, velocity and time (PVT) solution is available, all GPS signals are continuously tracked even under weak (or no) signal conditions. Two different C/N 0 estimators (squaring and differen-tial) are introduced and discussed. They allow signal power estima-tion even below 10 dBHz for GPS C/A code signals. Altogether the presented method allows characterizing the highly variable C/N 0 values in bad signal conditions.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} and <b>numerically</b> <b>control</b> high-harmonic generation (HHG) by time delaying variable {{segments of}} a few-cycle driving laser spectrum. In this configuration combs of fractional high harmonics {{can be produced}} by interference of two temporally spaced attosecond pulse trains. We explain the observed beating of the high-harmonic intensity with the time delay and study {{the influence of the}} spectral segmentation on the high harmonics. By the implementation of additional carrier-envelope phase (CEP) control, we extend the control configuration and demonstrate independent multi-parameter controllability of HHG purely enabled by the CEP and the time delay between two spectral segments. We present how specific properties of the fractional harmonics can be optimized. Analyzing the measured fractional harmonic combs by a spectral interferometry method, we find that the relative phase between the two contributing attosecond pulse trains can be freely set by the CEP of the driving laser field. We also discuss how, in the future, this method can be applied to simultaneously measure transient dispersion and absorption in the extreme ultraviolet spectral region...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} binary droplet collisions in a gaseous phase has been conducted. A {{volume of fluid}} (VOF) based interface capturing method, which is characterized by introducing an extra artificial compression term into the volume-fraction transport equation, is employed to capture the liquid-gas interface. The full Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the volume-fraction transport equation are discretized on a fixed, uniform grid using the finite volume method. The solution of the volume-fraction transport equation is bounded by an explicit universal multidimensional limiter. The simulations cover five major regimes of binary droplet collisions: (I) coalescence with minor deformation, (II) bouncing, (III) coalescence with major deformation, (IV) reflexive separation and (V) stretching separation. A ghost cell method is introduced in order to simulate bouncing and retarded coalescence in head-on collisions. Especially, for retarded coalescence collisions, the volume-fraction boundary condition on the symmetry plane is switched to <b>numerically</b> <b>control</b> coalescence at a critical time which is determined by tracking the interface front. The simulated results are compared with the attainable experimental data and provide detailed pictures exhibiting the droplet collision processes.

40|$|The ideal invariants {{present in}} the {{formalism}} of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), i. e. global quantities that are conserved {{in the absence of}} sources and dissipative effects, {{play an important role in}} various theoretical and numerical studies of MHD turbulence. The fluxes of these ideal invariants represent separate channels that transfer the information across different scales in a turbulent system. Once a statistically stationary state of turbulence is reached, the amount of any ideal invariant quantity introduced in the system by a forcing mechanism equals the amount of the same quantity removed by the dissipative effects from the system. For highly developed turbulence, these two mechanisms act predominantly at different scales that are largely separated. Since the ideal invariant quantities cascade between scales, a constant flux is generated with great implication on the state of the system. <b>Numerically,</b> <b>controlling</b> the ideal invariant fluxes levels for a turbulent MHD system is important for the analysis of fundamental MHD turbulence properties. We propose a forcing mechanism that controls the three ideal invariants of MHD turbulence: the total energy, the cross-helicity and the magnetic helicity. This forcing is implemented in the freely available TURBO solver, that is also briefly presented. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
