40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of productive safety net program (PSNP) on asset accumulation and sustainable land management (SLM) practices in eastern Hararghe, Haramaya district. To this effect primary and secondary data was collected from the rural households of the study area. Both descriptive analysis and econometrics models were used for data analysis. The study has two main impact indicators, i. e, asset holding and sustainable land management. Under asset the livestock asset is converted to the Tropical Livestock Unit (TLU) while the non-livestock assets are measured based on their current market value as reported by the respondents. Under the land management there are two groups: soil conservation (stone and soil bunds, in meter per timad) and fertility improvement practices (chemical and natural fertilizer application, in kg and quintal per timad respectively). Based on the econometrics estimation results selection (participation in the productive safety net programs) was significantly influenced by household demographic characteristics, such as household head gender, family size, number of active female labor, and housing condition and number of food gap months per year experienced by the household. The second stage outcome that is the impact of program participation was found to be positive and significant for both asset formation (livestock, productive and <b>non-productive)</b> and <b>land</b> management (soil and stone bund, and chemical and natural fertilizer). Generally the result indicated that, due to program participation beneficiary households have higher asset size and more involved in land management as compared to non-beneficiary households...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Agricultural {{expansion}} {{driven by}} growing demand {{has been a}} key driver for carbon stock change {{as a consequence of}} land-use change (CSC-LUC). However, its relative role compared to non-agricultural and non-productive drivers, as well as propagating effects were not clearly addressed. This study contributed to this subject by providing alternative perspectives in addressing these missing links. A method was developed to allocate historical CSC-LUC to agricultural expansions by land classes (products), trade, and end use. The analysis for 1995 – 2010 leads to three key trends: (i) agricultural land degradation and abandonment is found to be a major (albeit indirect) driver for CSC-LUC, (ii) CSC-LUC is spurred by the growth of cross-border trade, (iii) non-food use (excluding liquid biofuels) has emerged as a significant contributor of CSC-LUC in the 2000 's. In addition, the study demonstrated that exact values of CSC-LUC at a single spatio-temporal point may change significantly with different methodological settings. For example, CSC-LUC allocated to ‘permanent oil crops’ changed from 0. 53  Pg C (billion tonne C) of carbon stock gain to 0. 11  Pg C of carbon stock loss when spatial boundaries were changed from global to regional. Instead of comparing exact values for accounting purpose, key messages for policymaking were drawn from the main trends. Firstly, climate change mitigation efforts pursued through a territorial perspective may ignore indirect effects elsewhere triggered through trade linkages. Policies targeting specific commodities or types of consumption are also unable to quantitatively address indirect CSC-LUC effects because the quantification changes with different arbitrary methodological settings. Instead, it is recommended that mobilising <b>non-productive</b> or under-utilised <b>lands</b> for productive use should be targeted as a key solution to avoid direct and indirect CSC-LUC...|$|R

Barren, <b>non-productive</b> <b>land</b> (Costa and Moraise 2011), {{brackish}} water and waste water (Ashokkumar et al. 2014) {{can be used to}} culture some of the algal species. On top of that, the oil content and the growth rate of the algae are also very high (Chisti 2007, 2008) compared to many other crops that are used for biodiesel production. In this study, cultures of algae from different canals in Punjab (India) were used as the feedstock for production of biodiesel, for the following reasons. These algae (1) remain unused and taken away followed by being thrown in vats (which are used for waste disposal) and dumped in waste disposal sites at the end, (2) cause pollution of the water-body when growing very abundantly and become a threat to aquatic life and (3) are not used as food. The aim of this research was to characterize the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) produced from the oil of those unused algae with standard methods (Ragit et al. 2012) and to study the emission characteristics of the fuel by running a CI engine with that biodiesel.|$|E

40|$|The {{introductory}} part of {{this thesis}} identifies developments in world financial markets, and then focuses upon the financial crisis that afflicted East Asia and Thailand in particular. The crisis in Thailand that began in mid 1997 occurred due {{to a loss of}} intemational and domestic confidence in the Thai economy arising from the weakness of its financial sector. This in tum is attributed to madequate pmdential regulation that resulted in an excessive stock market boom and a real estate bubble, in which foreign loans were used to finance <b>non-productive</b> investment in <b>land</b> and properties. A dynamic macroeconomic model for the Thai economy was constmcted by emphasizing the impact aspect of the Thai crisis: namely the impact of a jump in the perceived financial risk in investing in the Thai economy; the impact of an increase of short-term flows in financing non-productive investments; and the impact of a collapse in aggregate supply resulting from financial and corporate sector insolvencies. In addition, government policy advocated by the IMF in response to the Thai financial crisis in the initial stage is explicitly analyzed and compared with the Radelet and Sachs (RS) policy approach. The major conclusion from the simulation results presented is that an exogenous shock arising from a temporary increase in the perceived risk of Thai financial assets during the onset of the crisis period, in conjunction with the collapse in aggregate supply as a result of financial and corporate sector insolvencies, can lead to a Severe temporary economic contraction both in domestic demand and supply. Implementing the IMF approach, by tightening monetary and fiscal policies in the initial stage of the crisis, could strengthen the real exchange rate in the short mn but at a potentially high cost. Such a policy contraction contributes to a more protracted decline in aggregate supply and private capital stock, the latter being detrimental for long-term economic growth and aggregate demand. The IMF approach produces more favorable effects in terms of external developments (more stabilized exchange rate), while the RS approach brings about favourable effects upon domestic demand and supply. The simulation results suggest that adopting the RS approach is an appropriate policy option in the short-term, particularly in dealing with such a crisis in the early stage. The RS policy approach eases the crisis in its initial stages arising from the abmpt and severe contraction in domestic demand and supply, but it comes at the cost of the larger depreciation of the real exchange rate than that for the IMF approach. Restmcturing of the financial sector is important but needs a more comprehensive and well-thought-out financial restmcturing plan, otherwise it may lead to a more protracted contraction in economic activities. Encouraging long-term flows is also essential because they can generate a larger accumulation of private capital stock and a higher level of aggregate supply relative to short-term flows...|$|R
5000|$|The Occupation of Alcatraz {{began on}} November 20, 1969 {{when more than}} 80 young, mostly college aged American Indians, who {{identified}} themselves as Indians of All Tribes(IAT) boarded boats to approach and occupy Alcatraz Island overnight. The young American Indians settled with the legal backing of a Sioux Treaty that named any federal [...] "out of use" [...] land available for Indians. The US federal government had closed the Alcatraz federal prison and the island {{was no longer in}} use as of 1962. This treaty was used to send the message that treaties are still relevant and should be honored. [...] The occupation had been planned ahead of time by Adam Norwall, a successful Indian businessman, and Richard Oakes, a San Francisco State student. The two agreed to and told sympathetic media outlets about their plan to take over Alcatraz at a dinner party hosted by San Fransisco Chronicle reporter Tim Findley. They threatened that if there were any leaks of the story early, the plan to occupy Alcatraz would be called off. Their first attempt, on November 9, 1969—the date the media had been told—resulted in circling the island in a boat with media coverage from all over the Bay Area. Although they did not begin the occupation that night, Oakes jumped off of the circling boat as others followed and swam to Alcatraz. After making it to Alcatraz, the young Indians were removed by Coast Guard that night but would be back in much larger numbers on November 20. We feel that this so-called Alcatraz Island is more than suitable as an Indian Reservation, as determined by the white man's own standards. By this we mean that this place resembles most Indian reservations, in that:1. It is isolated from modern facilities, and without adequate means of transportation.2. It has no fresh running water.3. The sanitation facilities are inadequate.4. There are no oil or mineral rights.5. There is no industry and so unemployment is very great.6. There are no health care facilities.7. The soil is rocky and <b>non-productive</b> and the <b>land</b> does not support game.8. There are no educational facilities.9. The population has always been held as prisoners and kept dependent upon others. Alcatraz Proclamation: To the Great White Father and All His People During the occupation, IAT released a statement called the Alcatraz Proclamation which explained that the Indians had the right to Alcatraz Island due to the right to discovery. The Proclamation continued onto describing the deserted prison island as comparable to the conditions of the Indian Reservations. IAT was also joined by National Indian Youth Council(NIYC) during the Alcatraz movement and the growing group of young, educated, and passionate American Indians made their presence known in the media. Richard Oakes became the public figure for the occupation and participated in the press conferences for releases of documents such as the Alcatraz Proclamation and goals for the island which included building cultural centers, educational facilities, and recreational spaces for Indians to be together as Indians.|$|R

Recently, the Egyptian government is interested in developing low desert zone areas which are located between the recent Nile flood plain and the limestone plateau, from {{the east and west}} sides, and represent an important source of aggregate materials. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the potentiality of El-Galaba basin soils which are located {{in the western part of}} the Aswan Governorate and are characterized by Wadi El-Kubbaniya for the horizontal agricultural expansion and their optimum agricultural use. The investigated area was remotely sensed to identify the landscape and its land resources. Terrain units were identified using draped Landsat 8 satellite image over Digital Terrain Model (DTM) to express the landscape and the associated soil mapping units. Fifteen mapping units were identified and grouped. Land capability evaluation was performed using Cervatana capability model. The results of capability modeling revealed about 3. 33 % of land with good use capability, 76. 06 % land with moderate use capability, and 0. 08 % marginal or <b>non-productive</b> <b>land.</b> The main capability limitations were soil and erosion risks. The Almagra model was used to produce the optimum cropping pattern and limitations of soil units.

40|$|Bamboo {{products}} {{have been proven}} to be a good altemative to hardwoods in the production of building materials, thus reducing the risk of deforestation primarily in tropical areas. Furthermore, bamboo also benefits from a very fast growing capacity when cultivated under adequate conditions, the ability to grow in <b>non-productive</b> <b>land</b> (e. g. eroded slopes) and the capacity to resprout from its stump due to its resilient root structure. Furthennore, its extensive root network promotes carbon sequestration, facilitates protection against soil erosion and reduces water depletion. Besides, from a social and economic point of view, cultivation and comercial utilization of bamboo materials support local economies in rural areas of developing countries. Bamboo stems have excellent mechanical properties that allow its use as supporting structures replacing conventional construction materials such as hardwood, steel or precast concrete. The environmental benefits of usi ng this material need to be quantified. This paper investigates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy performance of bamboo stems (guadua angustifolia) produced in Colombia under semi industrial conditions and utilized in Spain. These sustainability indicators are obtained using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology considering the following stages: stem harvesting in sustainably managed plantations, transport to processing plant, preservation/drying, transport to harbor, transport from harbor to harbor (from Colombia to Spain), transport to warehouse and storage. The functional unit considered in this assessment is a 6 meter-long stem, and the scenarios anal yzed include steam diameters 6, lO and 12 cm (weighing 1 O, 14 and 17 kg respectively, dry matter basis). The calculations have been performed using Simapro 8 software and applying LCI databases from Ecoinvent v 3 and ELCD v 3.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{framework}} to understand how coping mechanisms and livelihood diversification strategies were used to mitigate the coffee leaf rust?s (CLR) effects on the food security and livelihoods of Guatemalan smallholder coffee farmers. This research used a qualitative instrumental case study methodology to develop a grounded theory based on the rich description and analysis of how one Guatemalan smallholder coffee cooperative was affected by the 2012 - 2013 CLR epidemic. The cooperative members perceived the CLR epidemic as one crisis of many they faced in their lives. The CLR epidemic brought significant changes to the members? livelihoods strategy and increased food insecurity. Members reported production declines of 50 to 90 percent. Members chose to forgo organic production, borrow money, seek off-farm employment, diversify into food crops, and make major investments into renewing coffee fields infected with the CLR. The cooperative members reported ameliorating the effects of food insecurity by eating less food, skipping meals, eating less desirable foods, generating income from off-farm employment to purchase food, and borrowing money to purchase food. Despite continual crises, and the threat of another CLR outbreak, the cooperative remained committed to producing high quality Arabica coffee. Members perceived using <b>non-productive</b> <b>land</b> to grow food crops as beneficial to improve food security. Diversifying coffee fields to produce other cash crops was not perceived as an advantageous strategy to strengthen food security or livelihoods. Despite a history of assistance from external organizations before, during, and after, the CLR epidemic, members? livelihoods remained vulnerable. In light of the damaging effects that the CLR had on incomes, livelihoods, and food security, the cooperative?s main objective remained exporting high quality Arabica coffee. The smallholder coffee producer vulnerability framework was developed during the course of the research. The framework is intended to be used to understand coping mechanisms and analyze changing livelihood strategies resulting from coffee production disruptions. It is recommended that future research further explore perceptions of crop diversification, coffee production, and the CLR...|$|E
40|$|Rural regions once {{dominated}} by productive agriculture in many post-industrial nations are experiencing an increasing transition towards <b>non-productive</b> <b>land</b> use. This transition has raised community and academic concern over potential environmental impacts to rural land. However, {{strong interest in}} conservation issues amongst rural-amenity in-migrants has supported a counter narrative of positive ecological implications. I argue there is a gap in this debate on the ecological implications of rural-amenity migration; limited {{attention has been paid}} to how amenity in-migrants actually practice land management on their property. To address this gap, the key question of my research is ‘How do social and landscape interactions shape the practices and outcomes of land management in rural-amenity landscapes?’ This work has implications for environmental policy amidst the changing land use and social dynamics of rural-amenity landscapes. This is particularly important in the face of increasing policy attention to conservation issues on private land. I concentrate on the growing political emphasis on voluntary conservation initiatives, addressing the limited understanding of how these programs are actually operationalised by landholders on the ground. To investigate the primary research question, an ethnographically-inspired case study project was undertaken in the hinterland regions of Melbourne, Australia. Narrative interviews and property-walks comprised the primary data collection methods. Interviews with staff involved in conservation policy, and reviews of policy documents provided supporting material. Landholders involved in three different voluntary conservation schemes (representing three distinct policy approaches) were targeted, as well as a non-participant cohort. My research found that the strong amenity values held by participants underscored individualised, property-centric management aspirations. This resulted in preferred channels for knowledge generation that favoured experiential learning and communities of practice. Little knowledge for informing management was shared between neighbours in an effort to avoid neighbourly conflict. Over time, this knowledge settled into a durable disposition for stewardship that reflected a prevailing tendency for either ‘active’ or ‘passive’ management. Dynamic ecologies were being created on private land as landholders navigated the tensions between their diverse aspirations for management and land use. This dynamism was seen in the way ecologies were spatially and temporally enacted; boundaries around the home were created through ornamental nature plantings, while the ‘bring back’ of indigenous nature through revegetation was mediated by non-conservation amenity values. In adopting voluntary conservation schemes, landholders were pursuing creative conservation outcomes that accord with existing practices and ecologies, often departing from the biodiversity-centric objectives of the schemes. Of key interest was the adoption of market-based schemes to enhance regulatory protection for vegetation, rather than for financial reward. In exposing landholders’ desires for social and ecological outcomes through program participation, I suggest the need for a more humanistic approach to conservation policy in rural-amenity landscapes. Overall, my research shows how the ecologies of rural-amenity landscapes embody a negotiation of amenity values and stewardship, as landholders come to establish a new rural lifestyle. Advancing nature conservation policy in this context requires consideration of the diverse and multiple ways in which landholders create and value these ecologies...|$|E
40|$|In 1998, the Swedish {{standard}} for forest certification according to FSC's principles and criteria was approved (Anon. 1998). During {{a short period}} following this approval, all major forest companies in Sweden adopted the standard and modified their management practices. The overall aim of the standard is to outline management principles that maintain the ecosystem productivity and biodiversity, secure local people's livelihood, and promote long-term valuable wood­ production. In particular, the standard comprises many detailed regulations regarding how forests should be managed. For example, 5 percent of forest areas should be set aside for free development or be managed to promote biological values, certain areas must be managed to promote deciduous forests, boundary zones to streams, lakes, and <b>non-productive</b> <b>land</b> should be left, as should also a certain minimum number of trees (10 ha- 1) during harvesting operations (Anon. 1998). Compared to management practices of most companies before adoption of the FSC standard, the new management regimes imply lower levels of potential harvests. Some analyses {{have been made to}} quantify the effects on the harvesting levels of the new management (e. g., Lundstrom et al. 1997, Anon. 2000). In these studies, the range of harvesting reduction due to the FSC standard {{has been found to be}} in the order 10 to 20 percent. Similar results are presented by V erkaik and Nabuurs (2000) in a study of the consequences of adopting "nature-orientated" management in Scandinavian forests. It should be noted that in the latter study no attempts were made to follow the FSC standard specifically. The long-term sustainable harvesting levels in Sweden, before the adoption of the FSC criteria, have been assessed to be slightly more than 100 mill. m 3 per year (Anon. 2000). The annual cutting levels during the last decade have been about 70 - 75 mill. m 3 per year. There are several reasons for the relatively large difference between the two figures. Firstly, many forests in Sweden are still comparably young, and thus not mature for final felling. Secondly, we are here dealing with different concepts. The level around 100 mill. m 3 is what, from a biological point of view, would be possible to sustainably take out from the forests -it is reflecting a potential. In this calculation no considerations to restrictions of technical, social or economic kind are taken. The factual figure of 70 - 75 mill. m 3 is reflecting the real supply of wood, given the economic setting and restrictions on forestry of different kinds. In most of the above studies of the effect of FSC' s standard on the harvesting levels, the modelling approach has been to let the management activities be controlled by a set of rules formulated to mimic certain forest management practices. These rules are followed, even if a deeper analysis (which is typically not made) for some forestry activities would imply negative results from an economical point of view. Together this implies that these studies are dealing with the "potential" discussed above. A different approach is to put forestry into an economical framework, letting the activities largely be controlled by economical considerations. The result of such an analysis most likely would be a different round-wood supply, leading to lower harvesting levels as compared to the levels that correspond to the biological potential. It can be argued that this kind of analysis in a better way would be able to assess the actual consequences on the harvesting levels of new demands on forestry, e. g. those caused by FSC certification. The objective of this study was to analyse the implications of the FSC standard on the supply of round-wood in Sweden. This is done with respect to both the effects on current supply relationships and the long-term harvest level. Two different assumptions about the rigor of the FSC-standard are analysed. These two scenarios are contrasted to a modified version of the environmental restrictions of the recent SKA study (Anon. 2000) which is used as a baseline case. The constraints are less restrictive than in the SKA study and are intended to reflect forest management under the current Forestry Act, though with no adherence to the particular stipulations of the FSC standard. Furthermore, an extreme case with no environmental considerations is included in order to assess the maximum economic potential. The different levels of environmental objectives form the basis for four scenarios. The scenarios differ with respect to the amount area that can be used for production and how much is allocated for modified management and into reserves. Except for the distribution of the forest area on permissible management, the economic and other conditions remain the same. The analysis was performed with a method for modelling the forest and the forest manager decisions developed by SaUnas and Eriksson (1989). The method derives economically optimal harvesting regimes for all types of forests given certain assumptions regarding prices and costs...|$|E
