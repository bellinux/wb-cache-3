5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water.</b> Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{is home to}} more 300 {{privately owned}} beach-huts, which {{are some of the}} UK's most expensive. In 2015 five of the huts were put on the market for a {{combined}} asking price of £1 million. On average the huts measure around five by three metres, have <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> and the occupants may only stay overnight from March to October. Despite the relative lack of amenities, the area {{has become one of the}} UK's most desirable; huts are rented out for up to £600 a week.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began {{to send their children}} to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, Dawson's {{population}} rose further to 30,000 as stampeders arrived over the passes. The centre of the town, Front Street, was lined with hastily built buildings and warehouses, together with log cabins and tents spreading out across {{the rest of the}} settlement. There was <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water</b> or sewerage, and only two springs for drinking water to supplement the increasingly polluted river. In spring, the unpaved streets were churned into thick mud and in summer the settlement reeked of human effluent and was plagued by flies and mosquitoes. Land in Dawson was now scarce, and plots sold for up to $10,000 ($8 million) each; prime locations on Front Street could reach $20,000 ($16 million) while a small log cabin might rent for $100 ($2,700) a month. As a result, Dawson's population spread south into the empty Hän village, renaming it Klondike City. Other communities emerged closer to the mines, such as Granville on Dominion Creek and Grand Forks on Bonanza Creek.|$|E
5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water.</b> All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water</b> (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

5|$|Though Ross was {{concerned}} about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him, he announced he would accept the position. As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. Many of the men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander, and 500 students attempted to enroll {{at the beginning of the}} 18901891 school year. Three hundred and sixteen students were admitted, though the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars. When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2, the campus had <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> faced a housing shortage, was taught by disgruntled faculty, and many students were running wild.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water</b> or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was simply not enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats or develop a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water</b> or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E

25|$|By 1945, ten {{districts in}} Brunswick had a student {{population}} of 313 between first and ninth grades. Due to the added expenses of small districts (in an era becoming increasingly {{dominated by the}} automobile) and sometimes crumbling school facilities, the idea of consolidating smaller districts into one larger district (centralization) became a legitimate issue. By 1953, fourteen districts in Brunswick, Grafton, Pittstown, and Poestenkill were proposed for centralization. Eight of the districts were serviced by one-room schoolhouses with <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

25|$|By the 1880s, most Germans {{were moving}} out of Kleindeutschland and {{relocating}} Uptown, to the Yorkville section of the Upper East Side. Eastern Europeans replaced Germans as the dominant ethnic group in Alphabet City during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During this time, the area was {{considered part of the}} Lower East Side, and it became home to Eastern European Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrants. It consisted of tenement housing with <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water,</b> and the primary bathing location for residents in the northern half of the area was the Asser Levy bath house located on 23rd Street and Avenue C, north of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town.

25|$|Luxury {{spending}} in China has skyrocketed, {{an indicator of}} the country's newfound wealth. For example, the Chinese bottled water industry is forecast to more than double in size in 2008, becoming a $10.5 billion industry. Meanwhile, as those who once had no recourse but low-quality tap water take advantage of its availability in supermarkets, those who had little or <b>no</b> <b>running</b> <b>water</b> are now capitalising on its availability. Tap water production and supply is expected to grow by 29.3% in 2008, to $11.9billion. China's automotive industry is expected to expand by 29.5% to nearly $200billion. Also, consumption of chocolate and other confectionery is to increase by 24.3%, as the industry expands to $4.6billion. Additionally China's fast food industry has been growing at a 20.8% annual rate as major players such as McDonald's enter the market. The LVMH Group, who own major luxury brands including Louis Vuitton apparel, Moët & Chandon wines and champagne and Hennessy cognacs, reported earnings growth of over 25% in 2007 in China, with the country accounting for around 16% of LVMH's global business.|$|E
