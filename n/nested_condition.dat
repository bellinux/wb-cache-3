To resolve this problem, hierarchical and nested approaches were proposed, which used sub-models of lower dimensions {{to construct the}} joint Copula function [27, 28]. However, these techniques faced the compatibility problem. Strict limitations were imposed on the selected types and parameters to satisfy the <b>nested</b> <b>condition</b> [28]. On this basis, the Pair-Copula construction method was proposed to build flexible multivariate distributions.|$|E

Concretely, we provide a method to synthesize from an NCR Graph and any distribution of its events a set of local process graphs communicating by shared events, such that the dis-tributed execution of the local processes is equivalent to executing the original process. The technique is based on our recent similar work on safe distribution of Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) Graphs applied to cross-organizational case management. The contributions {{of this paper is}} to adapt the technique to al-low for nested processes and milestones and to apply it to a healthcare workflow identified in a previous field study at danish hospitals. ...|$|E

A move consists of altering one of the sets S_i, 1 < i < m- 1, in a manner so that the <b>nested</b> <b>condition</b> still holds and #(S_i) is still i. Our goal {{is to find a}} sequence of moves that exhausts through all subsets of S_m (other than the initial sets S_i) with no repeats. We call this "Gray-coding through nested sets" because of the analogy with Frank Gray's theory of exhausting through integers while altering only one bit at a time. Our main result is an efficient algorithm that solves this problem. As a byproduct, we produce new families of cyclic Gray codes through binary m-bit integers. Comment: 16 pages.

Introduction Natural splines are piecewise polynomials where {{a number of the}} highest derivatives vanish {{at the end of the}} range. A natural cubic spline models a thin flexible rod (the mechanical spline) in having minimal linearized bending energy of all interpolants to given data. A B-spline basis for natural splines was introduced in [7] and was later used in [14] to compute smoothing splines. See also [22]. An extensive treatment of natural splines can be found in the books [1, 19]. There are however some gaps in the theory.

It has been revealed {{that there are three}} different superconducting phases with different Fermi surface (FS) topologies and thus with possibly different pairing glues. One of them is well understood as spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity within a FS nesting scenario. Another one with the FSs in a bad <b>nesting</b> <b>condition</b> must be explained in a different context such as orbital or spin fluctuation in strongly correlated electronic system. In both phases, T-linear resistivity was commonly observed when the superconducting transition temperature T_ c becomes the highest value, indicating that the strength of bosonic fluctuation determines T_ c. In the last superconducting phase, the <b>nesting</b> <b>condition</b> of FSs and the related bosonic fluctuation are moderate.

By comparing spin excitations of LiFe 0. 88 Co 0. 12 As with a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculation, we conclude that wave-vector correlated low energy spin excitations are mostly from the dxy orbitals, while high-energy spin excitations arise from the dyz and dxz orbitals.

40|$|Abstract only availableSince the 1990 's {{scientists}} have become {{concerned about the}} declining population of migratory birds. A reduction in available habitat in wintering grounds and stop-over sites during migration {{may contribute to the}} decline in migratory bird populations. Another hypothesis for this decline in population is overwhelming nest predation on breeding grounds. This may be due to forest fragmentation which increases depredation of nests. Even though we understand why landscapes affect the bird population, knowledge of what types of predators are affected by fragmentation would determine how to manage land effectively. In this study, I test the hypothesis that <b>nest</b> <b>condition</b> would predict predator types by the amount of damage caused to the nest. To do this I found and monitored nests in Missouri and took pictures from different angles. I then set up video cameras to monitor the nest continuously.

Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge (SPNWR), St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, hosts a leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea nesting colony that has increased exponentially in the past 2 decades, {{due in part to}} an ongoing egg relocation program. We characterized the influence of <b>nest</b> environment <b>conditions</b> (e. g. partial pressures of oxygen, pO 2, and carbon dioxide, pCO 2, and temperature) on hatching success of relocated eggs at 3 different sites at SPNWR to evaluate potential intra-beach variation in <b>nest</b> environment <b>conditions</b> and hatching success.
