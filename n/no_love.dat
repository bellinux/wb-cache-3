The next day, Rahul, Anjali Khanna and his mom head to Faridabad where they meet Mr. Malhotra for Tina's death anniversary, where Anjali shows them, except for Rahul, her mother's letters..|$|E

25|$|The murder remains unsolved. Under torture, the {{surviving}} Hashshashin claimed that Richard {{was behind the}} killing, though this is impossible to prove. A less likely suspect was Humphrey IV of Toron, Isabella's first husband. Saladin's involvement has also been alleged, but as Conrad {{was in the middle}} of negotiations with him, but this also seems unlikely as Saladin himself apparently had <b>no</b> <b>love</b> for the Hashshashin. In 1970, Patrick A. Williams argued a plausible case for Henry of Champagne's guilt, but if so, it is difficult to imagine him taking such a bold step without his uncle Richard's approval.|$|E
25|$|Rumours about {{a hidden}} liaison began to emerge, {{although}} their relationship {{is a mystery}} to this day and {{it is unclear whether}} or not they were more than just friends. Except for a brief reference to marriage, the surviving work of Isabella includes <b>no</b> <b>love</b> poem addressed to a man, while Diego's lyrics described his feelings towards his beloved, possibly referring to a specific woman, or simply conventional laments, following the poetic style of the era. However, Isabella's brothers, after being informed of the letters, suspected an extra-marital affair and, in order to redeem the family honour, prepared a cruel plan of punishment.|$|E

25|$|Until early 1943, the Soviet partisans focused {{primarily}} on survival deep behind enemy lines, with their activity limited mostly to sabotage and diversion rather than armed struggle against German forces and collaborationist police units. During this early period various Soviet partisan groups also collaborated with the local Polish resistance of ZWZ, later renamed the AK. The Polish underground {{was established in the}} area in the fall 1939. Polish resistance was both anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet; their attitude represented the fact that both powers had invaded Poland, and Polish citizens suffered from Soviet terror just as they did from Nazi terror. There was <b>no</b> <b>love</b> lost between Polish and Soviet resistances, as Joseph Stalin's goal was to prevent a reemergence of an independent Poland after the war.|$|E
25|$|Stewart had <b>no</b> <b>love</b> for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and in January 1770, he led thirty-nine militiamen from Lancaster County to the Wyoming Valley. At the time, {{settlers}} from Connecticut were contesting {{the possession}} of the area with the Pennsylvanians, in a struggle that became {{the first of the}} Pennamite Wars. Captain Zebulon Butler was able to recruit Stewart and his men for the Connecticut, or Yankee, side, encouraging them with the promise of land in Hanover Township. Stewart's band, reinforced by ten Yankees, recaptured Fort Durkee from the Pennamites on February 12, 1770. One of his soldiers, Baltzer Stage or Stagard, was the first man to be killed in the conflict, when the Pennamites under Captain Ogden unsuccessfully attempted to retake the fort in March.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} of Ripple Field (13 April 1643) and his defeat by Prince Maurice, Sir William Waller retreated to Tewkesbury, and on to Gloucester. When there he found orders {{to go to his}} {{headquarters}} which were located in Bristol. This he delayed to do, the historian J.W. Willis-Bund stated that Waller was probably thinking it was necessary to do something to maintain his reputation as there was <b>no</b> <b>love</b> lost between him and Essex. His bad luck in the operations against Maurice rendered it necessary for him to achieve something really brilliant before he returned to Bristol. He accordingly did not obey his orders, stating it would not be safe for him to leave Gloucester until Hereford and Worcester were reduced. He, therefore, set to work to carry out this out.|$|E

25|$|When {{speaking}} about all future Shady Records releases president Paul Rosenberg said that Eminem's next album {{would be released}} post-Memorial Day 2013 and to expect new music from it soon. He also went on to discuss the other acts saying 50 Cent's Street King Immortal would be released {{in the first half}} of 2013, with Yelawolf's second album, Love Story, currently being recorded. Rosenberg would also state that all four members of Slaughterhouse would release solo projects prior to them returning to the studio as a group to record their second album under Shady Records. The first album released would be Joe Budden's <b>No</b> <b>Love</b> Lost on February 5, 2013 under E1 Music. The second would be Kxng Crooked's Apex Predator released under Treacherous C.O.B and Empire Distribution. However, Royce and Joell Ortiz of Slaughterhouse would confirm in May 2013 that they had put their solo projects on hold, and had begun working on their third studio album.|$|E
500|$|In Ovid’s work <b>no</b> <b>love</b> is [...] "taboo" [...] {{unless it}} arises {{out of a}} need for power and control.

500|$|American band Death Grips has {{released}} six studio albums, one compilation album, three extended plays (EPs), one mixtape, seven singles, eight promotional singles, three remixes, and 42 music videos. The band {{was formed by}} MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy [...] "Flatlander" [...] Morin in Sacramento {{during the winter of}} 2010. In March 2011, they released their eponymous debut EP. The mixtape Exmilitary followed a month later and was praised by contemporary music critics. Death Grips signed a record deal with Epic Records in early 2012 and their debut studio album The Money Store was released in April to critical acclaim, peaking at number 130 on the Billboard 200 chart. Because Epic Records would not confirm a release date for their second studio album <b>No</b> <b>Love</b> Deep Web before 2013, Death Grips self-released the album in November 2012. As a result of this and the ensuing conflict between the band and the record label, Death Grips was dropped by Epic Records. <b>No</b> <b>Love</b> Deep Web received positive reviews and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.|$|E

The ensuing refrain provides what Leng terms [...] "cathartic release" [...] with the repeated phrase [...] "So sad / So bad".|$|E

500|$|... "So Sad" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison {{that was}} released on his 1974 album Dark Horse. Harrison originally recorded the song for his previous album, Living in the Material World, before giving it to Alvin Lee, the guitarist and singer with Ten Years After. Lee recorded it – as [...] "So Sad (<b>No</b> <b>Love</b> of His Own)" [...] – with gospel singer Mylon LeFevre for their 1973 album On the Road to Freedom. The latter recording includes contributions from Harrison and marked {{the first of many}} collaborations between him and Lee.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} on Lee and LeFevre's On the Road to Freedom album in November 1973, and as the A-side of a single the following month. The album was critically well received, and Billboard included [...] "So Sad" [...] among its recommended singles for the week of 22 December 1973. Writing in Rolling Stone, Bud Scoppa paired the track with the Wood-composed [...] "Let 'Em Say What They Will" [...] as [...] "two non-originals [...] are beauties", adding: [...] "George Harrison's 'So Sad (<b>No</b> <b>Love</b> of His Own)' {{sounds to me like}} one of his best songs." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1951 Adeline died, aged eighty. In {{the same}} year Vaughan Williams's last opera, The Pilgrim's Progress, was staged at Covent Garden {{as part of the}} Festival of Britain. He had been working {{intermittently}} on a musical treatment of John Bunyan's allegory for forty-five years, and the 1951 [...] "morality" [...] was the final result. The reviews were respectful, but the work did not catch the opera-going public's imagination, and the Royal Opera House's production was [...] "insultingly half-hearted" [...] according to Frogley. The piece was revived the following year, but was still not a great success. Vaughan Williams commented to Ursula, [...] "They don't like it, they won't like it, they don't want an opera with no heroine and <b>no</b> <b>love</b> duets—and I don't care, it's what I meant, and there it is." ...|$|E
