40|$|Abstract — With the {{extensive}} {{expansion of the}} Information and Communication Technologies in the learning, business and home environments it is becoming apparent that there is considerable opportunity for increasing collaborative interaction if a framework is developed to coordinate {{the activities of the}} individuals across the different sectors. As a possible way of achieving this objective, we present the online Community of Practice developed and presently being in trial at the Institute for Work Based Learning, Middlesex University. In this paper, we describe our approach for developing and utilising of this Community of Practice. We will describe the benefits of the educational software tools we have used in the implementation process. Through case studies we will present two ways in which the online Community of Practice is being currently applied. We will outline the main advantages and some challenges of using the <b>newly</b> <b>create...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} {{to engage in}} systems thinking is often viewed as being a product {{of being able to}} understand complex systems due to one’s facility in mastering systems theories, methods, and being able to adeptly reason. Relatively little atten-tion is paid in the systems literature to the processes of learning from experience and creating knowledge as a direct consequence of individuals engaging systems thinking itself over time. In fact, the potential efficacy of systems thinking to improve performance normally seen as only contingent on a priori knowledge, rather than knowledge created via learning from experience. Such <b>newly</b> <b>create</b> knowledge often results from engaging in modeling efforts and systemic forms of inquiry. This article proposes a model for creating new knowledge by cou-pling systems modeling with a pragmatic approach to knowledge-creation. This approach is based on a foundation of the pragmatic concepts first proposed by the American philosopher/scientist Charles Sanders Peirce over a century ago. This model offers systems practitioners a framework to engage in knowledge-intensive systems thinking (KIST) for addressing complex problematic issues...|$|R
