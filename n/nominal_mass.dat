50|$|The <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> for {{an element}} is the mass {{number of its}} most {{abundant}} naturally occurring stable isotope, and for an ion or molecule, the <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> {{is the sum of}} the nominal masses of the constituent atoms. Isotope abundances are tabulated by IUPAC: for example carbon has two stable isotopes 12C at 98.9% natural abundance and 13C at 1.1% natural abundance, thus the <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> of carbon is 12. The <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> is not always the lowest mass number, for example iron has isotopes 54Fe, 56Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe with abundances 6%, 92%, 10%, and 2%, respectively, and a <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> of 56. For a molecule, the <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> is obtained by summing the nominal masses of the constituent elements, for example water has two hydrogen atoms with <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> 1 and one oxygen atom with <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> 16, therefore the <b>nominal</b> <b>mass</b> of H2O is 18.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − The {{physical}} {{model for the}} subdivision of the kilogram into the decade from 1 kg to 100 g was adapted for the measurement system where weight support plates have to be used. That is the case when combinations of weights with different <b>nominal</b> <b>masses</b> are compared. For this purpose the calibration procedure was modified to eliminate the unknown masses of the support plates. The equation was derived {{to take into account}} various influences on the measured mass differences. The influence of the plates on the measurement uncertainty budget and on the estimates of unknown masses of weights was studied into the decade. The analysis of results shows that the application of the support plates influences the measurement uncertainty to a small extent and also confirms the adequacy of the used model...|$|R

The principle of operation of the Hydrostatic Weighing Apparatus (HWA-NIS) depends mainly on measure the masses of the standard and the under test objects both in air and in liquid.
