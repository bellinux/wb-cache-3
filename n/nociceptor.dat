25|$|<b>Nociceptor</b> neuron {{sensitivity}} is modulated {{by a large}} {{variety of}} mediators in the extracellular space. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the <b>nociceptor.</b> The <b>nociceptor</b> can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This {{is commonly known as}} hyperalgesia. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a <b>nociceptor</b> is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.|$|E
25|$|The {{somatosensory}} cortex decodes <b>nociceptor</b> info {{to determine the}} exact location of pain and is where proprioception is brought into consciousness; inferior cerebellar peduncle is all unconscious proprioception.|$|E
25|$|Although each <b>nociceptor</b> {{can have}} a variety of {{possible}} threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury actually has occurred. These are typically referred to as silent or sleeping nociceptors since their response comes only on the onset of inflammation to the surrounding tissue.|$|E
50|$|Pain receptors {{are known}} as <b>nociceptors.</b> Two main types of <b>nociceptors</b> exist, A-fiber <b>nociceptors</b> and C-fiber <b>nociceptors.</b> A-fiber receptors are myelinated and conduct {{currents}} rapidly. They are mainly used to conduct fast and sharp types of pain. Conversely, C-fiber receptors are unmyelinated and slowly transmit. These receptors conduct slow, burning, diffuse pain.|$|R
50|$|Rainbow trout {{also have}} corneal <b>nociceptors.</b> Out of 27 receptors {{investigated}} in one study, seven were polymodal <b>nociceptors</b> and six were mechanothermal <b>nociceptors.</b> Mechanical and thermal thresholds {{were lower than}} those of cutaneous receptors, indicating greater sensitivity in the cornea.|$|R
50|$|Following sensory neurogenesis, {{differentiation}} occurs, and {{two types}} of <b>nociceptors</b> are formed. They are classified as either peptidergic or nonpeptidergic <b>nociceptors,</b> each of which express a distinct repertoire of ion channels and receptors. Their specializations allow the receptors to innervate different central and peripheral targets. This differentiation occurs in both perinatal and postnatal periods. The nonpeptidergic <b>nociceptors</b> switch off the TrkA and begin expressing Ret, which is a transmembrane signaling component that allows the expression of glial-cell-derived growth factor (GDNF). This transition is assisted by Runx1 which is vital {{in the development of}} nonpeptidergic <b>nociceptors.</b> On the contrary, the peptidergic <b>nociceptors</b> continue to use TrkA, and they express a completely different type of growth factor. There currently is a lot of research about the differences between <b>nociceptors.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>nociceptor</b> {{is a type}} of {{receptor}} {{at the end of a}} sensory neuron's axon that {{responds to}} damaging or potentially damaging stimuli by sending possible threat signals to the spinal cord and the brain. If the brain thinks the threat is credible, it creates the sensation of pain to direct attention to the body part, so the threat can hopefully be mediated. This process is called nociception.|$|E
25|$|Using {{this method}} {{it has been}} {{observed}} that significantly higher stimulus strength is needed to obtain referred pain relative to the local pain. There is also a strong correlation between the stimulus intensity and the intensity of referred and local pain. It is also believed that this method causes a larger recruitment of <b>nociceptor</b> units resulting in a spatial summation. This spatial summation results in a much larger barrage of signals to the dorsal horn and brainstem neurons.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} terminal of {{the mature}} <b>nociceptor</b> {{is where the}} noxious stimuli are detected and transduced into electrical energy. When the electrical energy reaches a threshold value, an action potential is induced and driven towards {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the high threshold only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the high threshold has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered. The majority of nociceptors are classified by which of the environmental modalities they respond to. Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal. Other nociceptors respond to none of these modalities (although they may respond to stimulation under conditions of inflammation) and are referred to as sleeping or silent.|$|E
50|$|Two major {{classes of}} human C-fibre <b>nociceptors</b> exist: mechano-responsive <b>nociceptors</b> and mechano-insensitive <b>nociceptors.</b> Mechano-responsive <b>nociceptors</b> {{have been shown}} in studies to respond to mostly pain, and mechano-insensitive receptors respond mostly to itch induced by histamine. However, it does not explain {{mechanically}} induced itch or when itch is produced without a flare reaction which involves no histamine. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} pruritoceptive nerve fibres have different classes of fibres, which is unclear in current research.|$|R

25|$|Potentially {{damaging}} mechanical, thermal, {{and chemical}} stimuli are detected by nerve endings called <b>nociceptors,</b> which {{are found in}} the skin, on internal surfaces such as the periosteum, joint surfaces, and in some internal organs. The concentration of <b>nociceptors</b> varies throughout the body; they are found in greater numbers in the skin than in deep internal surfaces. Some <b>nociceptors</b> are unspecialized free nerve endings that have their cell bodies outside the spinal column in the dorsal root ganglia. <b>Nociceptors</b> are categorized according to the axons which travel from the receptors to the spinal cord or brain.|$|R
25|$|Thermal nociceptors are {{activated}} by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific <b>nociceptor</b> transducers {{that are responsible}} for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was TRPV1, and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42°C. Other temperature in the warm–hot range is mediated by more than one TRP channel. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm–hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by TRPM8 channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.|$|E
2500|$|Repeated topical {{applications}} of capsaicin, {{are followed by}} a prolonged period of reduced skin sensibility referred to as desensitization, or <b>nociceptor</b> inactivation. [...] Capsaicin not only depletes substance P but also results in a reversible degeneration of epidermal nerve fibers. [...] Nevertheless, benefits appear modest with standard (low) strength preparations, and topical capsaicin can itself induce pain.|$|E
2500|$|Headaches often {{result from}} {{traction}} to or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. [...] The nociceptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumors and cause headaches. Blood vessel spasms, dilated blood vessels, inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate nociceptors and cause pain. Once stimulated, a <b>nociceptor</b> {{sends a message}} up {{the length of the}} nerve fiber to the nerve cells in the brain, signaling that a part of the body hurts.|$|E
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} opioids {{is that they}} inhibit pain that persists from previous injuries without eliminating either the initial pain of a new injury or the protective reflexes triggered by it. Here we ask whether selective expression of the �-opioid receptor (MOR) gene in primary <b>nociceptors</b> (pain-sensing neurons) might contribute to this aspect of opioid specificity. We quantified single-cell levels of MOR mRNA and measured opioid inhibition of Ca channels on identified <b>nociceptors</b> and low-threshold mechanosensors (non-nociceptors) isolated from rats. Negligibly few non-nociceptors express MOR mRNA, thereby rendering nonpain sensations insensitive to opioids. Nearly half of <b>nociceptors</b> of all size classes also fail to express MOR mRNA or to respond to opioids. Among the opioid-responsive <b>nociceptors,</b> a gene dose–response relationship exists such that maximal opioid inhibition occurs when the MOR mRNA concentration of a cell is � 15 pM. Almost all large, myelinated <b>nociceptors</b> express MOR mRNA below this level, whereas small, unmyelinated <b>nociceptors</b> are likely to express above it. Because myelinated <b>nociceptors</b> mediate anti-nociceptive reflexes, the data suggest that fine control of the MOR mRNA level contributes to a complex neural trait: the ability of opioids to suppress persistent pain without preventing response t...|$|R
40|$|Clinical studies {{implicate}} adenosine {{acting on}} esophageal nociceptive pathways in {{the pathogenesis of}} noncardiac chest pain originating from the esophagus. However, the effect of adenosine on esophageal afferent nerve subtypes is incompletely understood. We addressed the hypothesis that adenosine selectively activates esophageal <b>nociceptors.</b> Whole cell perforated patch-clamp recordings and single-cell RT-PCR analysis were performed on the primary afferent neurons retrogradely labeled from the esophagus in the guinea pig. Extracellular recordings were made from the isolated innervated esophagus. In patch-clamp studies, adenosine evoked activation (inward current) in a majority of putative nociceptive (capsaicin-sensitive) vagal nodose, vagal jugular, and spinal dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons innervating the esophagus. Single-cell RT-PCR analysis indicated {{that the majority of}} the putative nociceptive (transient receptor potential V 1 -positive) neurons innervating the esophagus express the adenosine receptors. The neural crest-derived (spinal DRG and vagal jugular) esophageal <b>nociceptors</b> expressed predominantly the adenosine A 1 receptor while the placodes-derived vagal nodose <b>nociceptors</b> expressed the adenosine A 1 and/or A 2 A receptors. Consistent with the studies in the cell bodies, adenosine evoked activation (overt action potential discharge) in esophageal nociceptive nerve terminals. Furthermore, the neural crest-derived jugular <b>nociceptors</b> were activated by the selective A 1 receptor agonist CCPA, and the placodes-derived nodose <b>nociceptors</b> were activated by CCPA and/or the selective adenosine A 2 A receptor CGS- 21680. In contrast to esophageal <b>nociceptors,</b> adenosine failed to stimulate the vagal esophageal low-threshold (tension) mechanosensors. We conclude that adenosine selectively activates esophageal <b>nociceptors.</b> Our data indicate that the esophageal neural crest-derived <b>nociceptors</b> can be activated via the adenosine A 1 receptor while the placodes-derived esophageal <b>nociceptors</b> can be activated via A 1 and/or A 2 A receptors. Direct activation of esophageal <b>nociceptors</b> via adenosine receptors may contribute to the symptoms in esophageal diseases...|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>nociceptors</b> in cephalopods has occurred relatively recently. In 2011, {{it was written}} that <b>nociceptors</b> {{had yet to be}} described in any cephalopod. [...] However, in 2013, <b>nociceptors</b> responsive to mechanical and electrical stimuli, but not thermal stimuli, were described in the longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) (note - {{it is highly unlikely that}} squid encounter temperatures greater than 30 °C making it very improbable that the nervous system will have evolved <b>nociceptors</b> to detect such high temperatures.) This study also provided evidence that these receptors, as in vertebrates, undergo both short-term and long-term sensitization (30 min and 24 h, respectively). [...] Similarly, low-threshold mechanoreceptors and cells considered to be <b>nociceptors</b> in the algae octopus (Abdopus aculeatus) are sensitised for at least 24 hrs after a crushing injury.|$|R
2500|$|Nociceptors develop from neural-crest stem cells. The {{neural crest}} is {{responsible}} for {{a large part of}} early development in vertebrates. [...] It is specifically responsible for development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The neural-crest stem cells split from the neural tube as it closes, and nociceptors grow from the dorsal part of this neural-crest tissue. They form late during neurogenesis. Earlier forming cells from this region can become non-pain sensing receptors, either proprioceptors or low-threshold mechanoreceptors. All neurons derived from the neural crest, including embryonic nociceptors, express the TrkA, which is a receptor to nerve-growth factor (NGF). However, transcription factors that determine the type of <b>nociceptor</b> remain unclear.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies of learning and memory using <b>nociceptors</b> in the sea hare, Aplysia. Many of these have focused on mechanosensory neurons innervating the siphon and having their somata (bulbous end) in the abdominal ganglion (LE cells). These LE cells display increasing discharge to increasing pressures, with maximal activation by crushing or tearing stimuli that cause tissue injury. Therefore, they satisfy accepted definitions of <b>nociceptors.</b> They also show similarities to vertebrate Aδ <b>nociceptors,</b> including a property apparently unique (among primary afferents) to <b>nociceptors</b> — sensitization by noxious stimulation.

40|$|SummaryLung <b>nociceptors</b> {{initiate}} {{cough and}} bronchoconstriction. To elucidate if these fibers {{also contribute to}} allergic airway inflammation, we stimulated lung <b>nociceptors</b> with capsaicin and observed increased neuropeptide release and immune cell infiltration. In contrast, ablating Nav 1. 8 + sensory neurons or silencing them with QX- 314, a charged sodium channel inhibitor that enters via large-pore ion channels to specifically block <b>nociceptors,</b> substantially reduced ovalbumin- or house-dust-mite-induced airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We also discovered that IL- 5, a cytokine produced by activated immune cells, acts directly on <b>nociceptors</b> to induce the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP then stimulates CD 4 + and resident innate lymphoid type 2 cells, creating an inflammatory signaling loop that promotes allergic inflammation.

[...] Later experiments with Lawrence Kruger and Mathius [...] "Skip" [...] J.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a link between fabric fiber features responsible for prickle and peripheral nervous responses. According to the anatomical mapping of <b>nociceptors</b> and their physiological property, a neuromechanical model coupling fiber-skin-nociceptor property is developed to stimulate the process of coarse fibers prickling human forearm skin. This model focuses on the content of coarse edge of fiber ends protruding from fabric surfaces, and the spatial distribution of these fibers is random. For fiber ends, their diameter and length are assumed to be normally distributed. By systematically changing the fibers ends per unit fabric surface area, or the distribution of their diameter or their length, we turn to three variables to measure the resulting neural activity of <b>nociceptors.</b> The results firstly confirmed the highly correction between firing rates of <b>nociceptors</b> and density of coarse fiber ends. Meanwhile, the firing rates of populations of <b>nociceptors</b> fluctuate with the density of fiber ends, as implies the probability of coarse fibers triggering <b>nociceptors.</b> Furthermore, the summation of firing rates over active <b>nociceptors</b> changes with the features of fiber ends in a power law, and closely correlates the subjective estimate. In theory, therefore, the firing rates of populations of Aδ <b>nociceptors</b> at periphery encode fiber-ends features responsible for prickle sensation by the spatial and probability integration.

The cell bodies of these neurons are located in either the dorsal root ganglia or the trigeminal ganglia.

40|$|Mechanical {{and thermal}} {{hyperalgesia}} (pain hypersensitivity) are cardinal signs of inflammation. Although the mechanism underlying thermal hyperalgesia is well understood, the cellular and molecular basis of mechanical hyperalgesia is poorly described. Here, {{we have identified}} a subset of peptidergic C-fiber <b>nociceptors</b> that are insensitive to noxious mechanical stimuli under normal conditions but become sensitized to such stimuli when exposed to the inflammatory mediator nerve growth factor (NGF). Strikingly, NGF did not affect mechanosensitivity of other <b>nociceptors.</b> We show that these mechanoinsensitive “silent” <b>nociceptors</b> are characterized by {{the expression of the}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha- 3 (CHRNA 3) and that the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO 2 mediates NGF-induced mechanosensitivity in these neurons. Retrograde tracing revealed that CHRNA 3 + <b>nociceptors</b> account for ∼ 50 % of all peptidergic nociceptive afferents innervating visceral organs and deep somatic tissues. Hence, our data suggest that NGF-induced “un-silencing” of CHRNA 3 + <b>nociceptors</b> significantly contributes to the development of mechanical hyperalgesia during inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that nerve growth factor (NGF) {{is an important}} mediator in inflammatory pain states: NGF levels increase in inflamed tissue, and neutralization of endogenous NGF prevents the hyperalgesia which normally develops during inflammation of the skin. Here we asked whether NGF contributes to sensitization of primary afferent <b>nociceptors,</b> which are {{an important component of}} pain and hyperalgesia in inflamed tissue. An in vitro skin nerve preparation of the rat was used to directly record the receptive properties of thin myelinated (Adelta) and unmyelinated (C) <b>nociceptors</b> innervating normal hairy skin, carrageenan-inflamed skin and carrageenan-inflamed skin where endogenous NGF had been neutralized by application of a trkA-IgG (tyrosine kinase Aimmunoglobulin G) fusion molecule. Following carrageenan inflammation, there was a marked increase in the proportion of <b>nociceptors</b> which displayed ongoing activity (50 % of <b>nociceptors</b> developed spontaneous activity compared to 4 % of <b>nociceptors</b> innervating normal uninflamed skin), and this was reflected in {{a significant increase in the}} average ongoing discharge activity. Spontaneously active fibres were sensitized to heat and displayed a more than twofold increase in their discharge to a standard noxious heat stimulus. Furthermore, the number of <b>nociceptors</b> responding to the algesic mediator bradykinin increased significantly from 28 % to 58 %. By contrast, the mechanical threshold of nociceptive afferents did not change during inflammation. When the NGF-neutralizing molecule trkA-IgG was coadministered with carrageenan at the onset of the inflammation, primary afferent <b>nociceptors</b> did not sensitize and displayed essentially normal response properties, although the inflammation as evidenced by tissue oedema developed normally. We therefore conclude that NGF is a crucial component for the sensitization of primary afferent <b>nociceptors</b> associated with tissue inflammation...|$|R
