5|$|In Florida, {{above normal}} tides in the panhandle caused erosion, damaged several boats, and drowned two people. Tropical storm force winds left about 20,000people without electricity, while {{flooding}} from heavy rainfall damaged vehicles and roads. Property {{damage in the}} state reached about $5.9million (1994USD). Farther inland, Beryl spawned many tornadoes and resulted in flooding as far <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> England. In South Carolina, the state suffering the most damage, a total of 23tornadoes were spawned, including three rated F3 on the Fujita scale. One tornado in Lexington damaged or destroyed 200homes and 40 to 50buildings and caused about 15,000people to lose power after damaging five electrical substations. The state of New York experienced {{the worst of the}} flooding, with flash flooding in the Susquehanna and western Catskills regions. Two deaths and $12million in damage occurred in New York. Overall, Beryl left five fatalities and at least $74.22million in damage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, Rockefeller {{expanded}} into iron ore and ore transportation, forcing {{a collision with}} steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and their competition became a major subject of the newspapers and cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out. Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller {{began to think of}} retirement. The daily management of the trust was turned over to John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of modern}} NY144 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY10 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY10 joined what is now NY144 at Coeymans and followed it north through Bethlehem to Albany, where NY10 continued into the city on modern NY32. When U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927, all of NY10 south of Albany became part of US9W. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US9W was realigned through the towns of New Baltimore and Coeymans to use modern NY144 instead. At the same time, the portion of what is now US9W from New Baltimore to Albany was designated as NY144. The alignments of US9W and NY144 <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Baltimore were flipped in April1935.|$|E

5|$|Much of DE 9 is {{designated}} {{as part of}} the Delaware Byways system. From the southern terminus north to New Castle, DE 9 is {{designated as}} the Delaware's Bayshore Byway (formerly Route 9 Coastal Heritage Byway), a road that is noted for following the Delaware River and Delaware Bay shoreline. The sections of the route between DE 299 east of Odessa and 7th Street southwest of New Castle, Wilmington Road <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Castle and A Street in Wilmington, and along 4th Street in Wilmington between Swedes Landing Road and US 13 Bus. and Market and West streets are part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway. DE9 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 19,064vehicles at the intersection between East 6th Street and New Castle Avenue in New Castle to a low of 258vehicles at the intersection with Cedar Swamp Road in southeastern New Castle County. The portion of DE9 concurrent with DE 273 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans {{and most of the}} seas. They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. The seas <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E
5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{alignment}} of the Route 92 Freeway, proposed in the 1950s, was to begin at an interchange with Interstate 95, known as the Somerset Freeway {{in the community of}} Skillman (in Montgomery Township). The route was supposed to head eastward, crossing an interchange with U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township before crossing over County Route 518 in Rocky Hill and interchanging with New Jersey Route 27 in Kingston. The route would then turn to the south and interchange with U.S. Route 1 and County Route 522 in the community of Monmouth Junction. From there, Route 92 would cross over the Pennsylvania Railroad to the <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey Route 64 in Plainsboro, turning to the southeast along the Millstone River. After crossing the Millstone, Route 92 was to interchange with County Route 535 in Cranbury before entering East Windsor, where it would interchange with U.S. Route 130. From there, the route would meet the New Jersey Turnpike at Interchange 8 before reaching its eastern terminus at an interchange with New Jersey Route 33 in the Twin Rivers community in East Windsor.|$|E
5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E
