5|$|The navy {{sees the}} battleships as prohibitively expensive, {{and is working}} to persuade Congress {{to allow it to}} remove Iowa and Wisconsin from the Naval Vessel Register by {{developing}} extended-range guided munitions and a <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> to fulfill marine corps requirements for naval surface fire support (NSFS).|$|E
5|$|A new , a Type 22 Frigate, was {{launched}} on 7 October 1987. She carried the ship's bell {{from the first}} Campbeltown which was rescued during the raid and had been presented {{to the town of}} Campbelltown, Pennsylvania {{at the end of the}} Second World War. In 1988 the people of Campbelltown voted to lend the bell to the <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> for as long as she remained in Royal Navy service.|$|E
5|$|Cementco {{continued}} to transport coral until the mid-1980s, when QCL {{was acquired by}} the firm Holderbank and another ship was purchased to transport clinker to the company's new factory at Gladstone. She was subsequently laid up at Mary Street Wharf while {{attempts were made to}} sell her; during this period she was renamed Crusader II to avoid confusion with a <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> named Cementco. A buyer was not found, and in 1986 Cementco was sunk at Flinders Reef off Cape Moreton where she later became a popular dive wreck.|$|E

500|$|Political {{opposition}} to the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> was significant. The Reichsmarine therefore decided to delay ordering the ship until after the Reichstag elections in 1928. The question over whether to build the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> was {{a major issue in}} elections, particularly with the Social Democrats, who strongly opposed the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> and campaigned with the slogan [...] "Food not Panzerkreuzer." [...] In May 1928, the elections were concluded and enough of a majority in favor of the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> was elected; this included twelve seats won by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party. An October 1928 attempt by the Communist Party of Germany to initiate a referendum against the construction failed. The first of the <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> was authorized in November 1928 ...|$|R
50|$|A feature {{which will}} {{distinguish}} {{her from her}} new fleet mate, , is her more angled sloping stern, {{as compared to the}} <b>newer</b> <b>ship's</b> vertical one. In addition to this she lacks the covered games deck above the bridge, a feature which is present on the <b>newer</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} voyage Morrell {{took charge of}} a <b>new</b> <b>ship,</b> Tartar, which sailed from New York on July 19, 1824 for the Pacific Ocean. In {{the next two years}} Tartar first {{explored}} the American coastline from the Straits of Magellan to Cape Blanco (now in Oregon). He then sailed westward to the islands of Hawaii, known at that time as the Sandwich Islands, where Captain James Cook had met his death nearly 40 years earlier. Thereafter Tartar returned to the American coast and tracked slowly southwards back to the Straits of Magellan.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company took {{delivery}} of two more new ships – the President Warfield and the Yorktown. The President Warfield, built by Pusey and Jones Corp. in Wilmington, Delaware, {{was named for}} the Old Bay Line's president of the time, S. Davies Warfield. She {{would be the last}} <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> built for the Old Bay Line.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2013, CSAV {{operated}} 50 container {{ships and}} 32 line services (plus feeder lines) across five continents, with approximately 2 million TEUs transported during 2013 [...] CSAV invested about U.S. $1 billion in <b>new</b> <b>ships,</b> which entered into service within the past three years. [...] Recently the company ordered the construction of seven <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> of 9,300 TEUs each at an additional investment of U.S. $600 million.The last of these <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> will be delivered in 2015. Its new, expanded own fleet will allow CSAV to significantly reduce fuel costs and replace leases.|$|R
5|$|On 22 June, {{the liner}} hosted a press luncheon, and, the next afternoon, hosted some 3,000 {{members of the}} Daughters of the American Revolution who {{presented}} a commemorative bronze tablet. Stewart L. Woodford, a former Congressman and ambassador, spoke at the ceremony dedicating the tablet, which was placed {{at the base of}} the staircase in the first-class smoking room. Beginning 24 June, the North German Lloyd opened George Washington to the public for five days of viewing of the <b>new</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sparrow {{returns in}} the fifth film, portrayed once again by Johnny Depp. Five years after {{the quest for the}} Fountain of Youth, Jack has {{reassembled}} a small crew, but the Black Pearl is still trapped in a bottle, his <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> the Dying Gull has never left berth, and his latest plans have met with failure, while his rival, Barbossa, has became the richest and most powerful pirate of the seven seas.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} this ship, Rivoli, was launched, the Royal Navy had {{achieved}} dominance over the French in the Adriatic Sea. Not only had the regional commander Bernard Dubourdieu been killed and his squadron destroyed at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky. This was demonstrated by {{the destruction of a}} well-armed convoy from Corfu to Trieste at the Action of 29 November 1811. Rivoli's launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> of the line outgunned the British frigates that operated within the Adriatic and would be able to operate in the Adriatic without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on Lissa.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the Nanyang fleet {{continued}} to acquire <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> after the Sino-French War, some of reasonable quality. The {{first of the}} <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> was the steel cruiser Baomin, completed at the Kiangnan Arsenal in 1885. The next additions were the composite cruisers Jingqing and Huantai, both products of the Foochow Navy Yard (1886 and 1887).|$|R

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 {{at the behest}} of the Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate decided to have a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former name {{had been given to}} a <b>new</b> <b>ship.</b> En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E

5|$|In 1905 the Kirkhill was wrecked {{on a rock}} {{near the}} Falkland Islands. Stuart survived the sinking and {{returned}} to England to continue his training. He was posted to a <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> upon his return but she too was wrecked by a cyclone off the Florida coast. Eventually, after several years service he achieved his mariner's qualifications and gained {{a job with the}} Allan Line as a junior officer. He then served in a variety of sailing and steam ships traveling across most of the world. In 1910, the Allan Line was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Line and he continued working with the company's new owners as a junior ship's officer.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1789, {{he enlisted}} as a {{volunteer}} on the 700-ton Aurore, under Captain Tardivet, a slave ship bound for India. Aurore sailed to Pondicherry and ferried troops bound for Isle de France. On her next journey, seeking to purchase slaves on the Horn of Africa, Aurore was wrecked in Mozambique Channel, drowning 400 black slaves chained in the orlop. Tardivet chartered the Portugues San Antoine in October 1790 to return to Port-Louis, but had to divert to Sumatra because of the weather, and only returned to Port-Louis in late 1790, on a French ship via the French colony of Pondicherry. Promoted to officer, Surcouf enlisted on the Courrier d'Afrique, another slave ship, bound for Mozambique under Captain Garnier. Captain Tardivet then brought him over as Lieutenant on his <b>new</b> <b>ship,</b> Revanche. On Revanche, Surcouf made several expeditions off Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Paramount Pictures {{commissioned}} the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to The Wrath of Khan. Nimoy directed the film, {{becoming the first}} Star Trek cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended {{the destruction of the}} Enterprise to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house Industrial Light & Magic to develop storyboards and <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day of location shooting, all of the film's scenes were shot on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer James Horner returned to expand his themes from the previous film.|$|E

5|$|Rivadavia was {{commissioned}} into the Armada de la República Argentina on 27 August 1914 at the Charlestown Navy Yard, {{although it was}} not fully completed until December. On 23 December 1914, Rivadavia left the United States for Argentina. It arrived in its capital, Buenos Aires, on 19 February 1915. Over 47,000 people came out to see the <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> over the next three days, including the President Victorino de la Plaza. In April 1915, Rivadavia was put into the training division of the Navy, remaining there until 1917, when the navy transferred the ship into the First Division. In 1917, Rivadavia sailed to Comodoro Rivadavia when communist oil workers went on strike.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A <b>new</b> <b>ship</b> lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{ship was}} built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company as a {{specialist}} research vessel designed for work in Antarctic waters, {{and was one of}} the last three-masted wooden sailing ships built in Britain. The construction cost was £34,050 (2009 = £2.7 million), plus £10,322 (£830,000) for the engines, and the final cost after all modifications was £51,000 (£4.1 m). The name had historic naval associations, most recently as one of the ships used in the Nares expedition, and certain features of this older vessel were incorporated into the design of the <b>new</b> <b>ship.</b> She was launched by Lady Markham on 21 March 1901 as S.Y. Discovery (the Royal Research Ship designation was acquired in the 1920s).|$|E

5000|$|When Congress did not {{authorize the}} {{construction}} of <b>new</b> <b>ships,</b> Robeson used monies meant for the repair of older <b>ships</b> to make <b>newer</b> <b>ships</b> from almost completely new materials, keeping {{the name of the}} older ships, and often making ships larger and replacing wooden hulls with iron. Congress and reformers were critical of Robeson overstreching the law in terms of making <b>new</b> <b>ships</b> by [...] "repairing" [...] older ships. Although he was criticized for overhauling 15 to 16 ironclads costing $4,000,000, navy historian Charles Oscar Paullin stated that under the circumstances of the Virginius Incident that took place in 1873, Robeson's overhauls were [...] "proper and advisable".|$|R
