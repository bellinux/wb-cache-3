Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E

25|$|The jhamatun of Papak and Ruzukana was hewn in 1288 on {{a second}} level, north of the Proshians’ burial-vault, by way of an {{external}} staircase (<b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the gavit). Also carved into the rock, its form reproduces that of a gavit. It contains the tombs of the princes Merik and Grigor, and others {{are known to have}} been there but have now disappeared.

25|$|As the killer's epithet implies, {{the victims}} usually were {{attacked}} with an axe, which often {{belonged to the}} victims themselves. In most cases, a panel on a back door of a home was removed by a chisel, which were both left on the floor <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> followed by an attack on {{one or more of}} the residents with either an axe or straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims' homes.|$|E
25|$|The Orissa Gazette of 1956 {{mentions}} some occasions {{where the}} devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would {{dance at the}} Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, after breakfast, would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar). This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badashringhar, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. After they would leave, a Bhitar Gaauni would then enter the room, stand <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> (Jaya Vijay) and sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. After a while, she would come out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and then the guard would close the main gate.|$|E

500|$|Caroline Read-Burns, {{president}} of the Lisbon Historical Society and Jerome Zuckerbraun, {{a member of the}} synagogue, discussed the Orthodox congregation's rules and noted that some rules were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World. As an Orthodox congregation, members were to walk to the synagogue, but some distant members would drive and [...] "walk the last mile or so." [...] The synagogue did not use curtains to separate men and women, as was the norm for Orthodox services in Poland and Russia. The women's seating was at a table {{on the right side of}} the sanctuary, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The structure is well-preserved, but not currently in use.|$|E
500|$|Justice Kennedy {{rejected}} Drayton's {{argument that}} officers coerced passengers by showing their badges, {{noting that the}} sight of police officers should be a [...] "cause for assurance, not discomfort". Likewise, he rejected the argument that placing an officer <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the bus constituted a seizure, because the officer [...] "did nothing to intimidate passengers" [...] and [...] "left the aisle clear". Justice Kennedy also held {{that the nature of}} the encounter did not change after Brown was arrested, because [...] "he arrest of one person does not mean that everyone around him has been seized by police". Rather, witnessing Brown's arrest [...] "should have put Drayton on notice of the consequences of continuing the encounter by answering the officers' questions".|$|E
500|$|Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, and {{his company}} of 200men besieged Holbeche House at about 11:00am on 8November. While {{crossing}} the courtyard Thomas Wintour {{was hit in the}} shoulder. John Wright was shot, followed by his brother, and then Rookwood. Catesby and Percy were reportedly both dropped by a single lucky shot, while standing <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Catesby managed to crawl inside the house, where his body was later found, clutching a picture of the Virgin Mary. This and his gold crucifix were sent to London, to demonstrate what [...] "superstitious and Popish idols" [...] had inspired the plotters. The survivors were taken into custody and the dead buried near Holbeche. On the orders of the Earl of Northampton however, the bodies of Catesby and Percy were exhumed and decapitated. John Harington, 2nd Baron Harington of Exton, made an opportune study of the heads while en route to London, and later reflected: [...] "more terrible countenances were never looked upon". Placed on [...] "the side of the Parliament House", Catesby's head became one of the [...] "sightless spectators of their own failure".|$|E

2500|$|The pillory's politico-administrative and {{judicial}} importance was made obvious in 1507. Owing to the nuisance {{resulting from the}} custom of exhibiting the dismembered body parts of sentenced peasants on the pillory, D. Manual ordered that these artifacts be moved to another area of the town. As was noted: [...] "it was near the settlement and did very great damage because the square was very small and the pillory was near the main door of the church...and so <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the fortress". As noted, D. Manuel ordered that the hands, feet, ears and dismembered heads of the convicted should be moved to the archway gate of São Bendito, which was the old city gate, along the main road.|$|E
2500|$|He {{would tell}} stories to {{children}} and spread The New Church gospel to the adults, receiving a floor to sleep on for the night, and sometimes supper, in return. [...] "We can hear him read now, {{just as he did}} that summer day, when we were busy quilting upstairs, and he lay <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> his voice rising denunciatory and thrillin—strong and loud as the roar of wind and waves, then soft and soothing as the balmy airs that quivered the morning-glory leaves about his gray beard. His was a strange eloquence at times, and he was undoubtedly a man of genius," [...] reported a lady who knew him in his later years.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the planting season or when a hunter failed to kill animals, the people of a village gathered at [...] fetish poles (vimbundi) marked or coloured with red and white [...] clay placed in the appropriate place, often outside the house just <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> directly against the bed where the heads point when people are asleep, to worship and pray to their ancestors, before the field activities start. This is also done when making offerings to there ancestors, during sicknesses or deaths where evil spirits were suspected, when bad dreams have been experienced and when summoning rains during a drought. Offerings are made {{in the form of a}} sacrifice such as killing an animal, a chicken, goat, cow, pig or sheep or any living thing with the exception of a human being. The blood of the animal was rubbed against the fetish poles (vimbundi) as respect, praise and honour to God and the spirits.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reason for}} the Hanukkah lights {{is not for the}} [...] "lighting of the house within", but rather for the [...] "illumination of the house without," [...] so that passersby should see it and be {{reminded}} of the holiday's miracle (i.e. the triumph of the few over the many and of the pure over the impure). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, {{as was the case in}} Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians, or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so that when one passes through the door s/he is surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).|$|E
