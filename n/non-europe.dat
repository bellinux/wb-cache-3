50|$|Although {{formal and}} {{explicit}} colonization {{ended with the}} decolonization of the Americas {{during the nineteenth century}} and the decolonization of much of the global south in the late twentieth century, its successors, Western imperialism and globalization perpetuate those inequalities. The colonial matrix of power produced social discrimination eventually codified as “racial”, “ethnic”, “anthropological” or “national” according to specific historic, social, and geographic contexts (Quijano 2007: 168). Decoloniality emerged at the moment when the colonial matrix of power was put into place during the sixteenth century. It is, in effect, a continuing confrontation of, and delinking from, Eurocentrism : the idea that the history of human civilization has been a trajectory that departed from nature and culminated in Europe, also that differences between Europe and <b>non-Europe</b> are due to biological differences between races, not to histories of power (Quijano 2000: 542).|$|E

Europe has never presented itself as a single bordered entity supported by a constitution and a clear definition of Europe and <b>non-Europe.</b> The contemporary forceful abduction by the European Union re-creates Europe as a bounded political entity institutionalised through treaties and acts. It is made a socio-political cultural construction embedded in its own created geography, history and culture. We will argue that European Union {{is not the same as}} Europe and that Europe is not a people. Europe is neither finite nor restrictive.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ie, Crohn&# 39;s disease and ulcerative colitis, is putatively also influenced by sunshine. Recent availability of worldwide IBD rates and lactase distributions allows more extensive comparisons. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the extent to which modern day lactase distributions interact with latitude, sunshine exposure, and IBD rates. National IBD rates, national distributions of LP/LNP, and population-weighted average national annual ultraviolet B exposure were obtained, estimated, or calculated from the literature. Negative binomial analysis was used to assess the relationship between the three parameters and IBD rates. Analyses for 55 countries were grouped in three geographic domains, ie, global, Europe, and <b>non-Europe.</b> In Europe, both latitude and ultraviolet B exposure correlate well with LP/LNP and IBD. In <b>non-Europe,</b> latitude and ultraviolet B exposure correlate weakly with LP/LNP, but the latter retains a more robust correlation with IBD. In univariate analysis, latitude, ultraviolet B exposure, and LP/LNP all had significant relationships with IBD. Multivariate analysis showed that lactase distributions provided the best model of fit for IBD. The model of IBD reveals the evolutionary effects of the human lactase divide, and suggests that latitude, ultraviolet B exposure, and LP/LNP mimic each other because LP/LNP follows latitudinal directions toward the equator. However, on a large scale, lactase patterns also follow lateral polarity. The effects of LP/LNP in disease are likely to involve complex interactions.

40|$|Published to Oxford Scholarship Online: February 2017 This chapter {{challenges}} Bull and Watson’s 1984 {{account of}} the nature and impact of European imperialism on the so-called periphery. In contrast to a membership narrative, which analyses who became part of the expanding ‘core’ of international society and when, it draws on theories of interaction to demonstrate how the development of states in the colonial world emerged through political processes that engaged both the colonizers and the colonized. Two main claims follow from this. The first concerns the limited capacity of European imperial powers to master the colonial spaces that they encountered. The power of local agency meant that the boundaries of European empires were often ill-defined, and their legal authority was enmeshed with the law and customs of indigenous subjects. Second, the outcome of interaction between Europe and <b>non-Europe</b> was a diversity of political and legal forms, ranging from quasi-sovereignty to full territorial rule by the metropole...|$|E

40|$|The {{belief that}} {{immigrants}} generate beneficial externalities in their host countries, {{specifically in the}} form of an increased opportunity and ability of firms to expand their foreign trade, has recently been challenged by George Borjas in Heaven?s Door (1999, p. 97) as having no empirical support. Borjas? assertion ignores several recent papers that provide precisely that evidence of a powerful pro-trade effect of international migration. Here we extend that body of evidence by looking to history. We show that immigration, primarily from Europe between 1870 and 1910, had an important pro-trade effect on American exports. Our data set spans the exports of 44 commodities to 17 countries observed at 5 year intervals. We use a modified gravity model to examine the migrant stock-export relationship and find that United States exports to a country were positively related to the size of the migrant stock of immigrants from that country. The estimated strength of the effect varied across ?Old? Europe, ?New? Europe, and <b>non-Europe</b> groupings of the trading partner countries. Exports were also found to have been greater to English-speaking countries, and to countries with per capita incomes similar to the United States.

The thesis is based on in-depth interviews with women travellers and analyze how these journeys are important to them. The thesis tries to point out that women's solo travelling directly effects their biography as well as career and status of these female travellers. Women independent travelling is introduced as the dynamic process, by means of which they acquire or verify the gender power and abilities, applicable to their personal life and work. Using the concepts of feminist theories implemented on women's travelling, I try to show that this type of travelling is affected by history and prefers male travelling, which displaces the individual women's travelling {{on the edge of the}} social and scientific interest.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} late Ottoman modes of {{perceptions}} and conceptions of the non-European world and their own Arab provinces. It is based on a systematic comparison of the Ottoman perceptions and conceptions with the European colonial discourses and its rhetorical modalities. The main argument {{of this study is that}} the Ottoman response to the Western discourses in the context of the non European world and the Ottoman Arab periphery were dualistic in nature. It was the internalization of the fundamental aspects of the European colonial discourses while resisting many aspects of it. The sources used in this study are the late Ottoman travelogues and memoirs. In the course of this study the main characteristics of the orientalist discourse as a fundamental part of the colonial discourses and the rhetorical tools of the colonial discourses are discussed in order to render a systematic comparison with the European discourses possible. Then, it was respectively followed by a systematic comparison between the Ottoman perceptions of the non-European world and the European visions on the <b>non-Europe</b> and between the Ottoman perceptions of the Arab periphery and the European visions on the Orient.

40|$|Urban forests provide many environmental, {{social and}} {{economic}} benefits and contribute to {{quality of life of}} people in urban areas. Taking into consideration constantly growing population in urban areas all around the world, and all what comes with it, we cannot but to agree that urban forests are our urban future. Therefore the way how we treat them and how we make decisions about them becomes very important. With the aim to highlight the importance of the urban forests and to present it to the wider scientific and professional audience, Croatian Forest Research Institute together with IUFRO (Division 6 – Social Aspects of Forests and Forestry; unit 6. 07. 00 - Urban Forestry) and FOPER project of the European Forest Institute organised conference “Forests for cities, forests for people: perspectives on urban forest governance”. The idea for the Conference came from the ongoing South East European regional project FORCITY (“Citizens and urban forest governance in SEE: case studies in selected cities”) that addresses urban forest governance and satisfaction of citizens with their urban forests. The Conference was held on 27 th and 28 th of October 2012 in Zagreb and has attracted many scientists and experts that deal with urban forestry. On the behalf of the organizers the Conference was opened by the welcoming words of the Director of Croatian Forest Research Institute, Dr. Dijana Vuletić, and then followed by keynotes of Prof. Dr. Margaret A. Shannon, Prof. Dr. Maureen McDonough and Prof. Dr. Cecil C. Konijnendijk. During two days, 20 oral and 14 poster presentations were presented. In total, the Conference was attended by 80 participants from 20 countries, 15 European and 5 <b>non-Europe</b> (USA, Turkey, India, Iran, Colombia). After the official part of the Conference, attendees had opportunity to visit The Green Horseshoe of Zagreb, a series of parks and tree-lined squares that run from Zagreb’s main station, up to the city’s main square and loop around in the shape of horseshoe. Once again, on behalf of organizers we use the opportunity to thank all those who contributed in any way to the successful organization of the Conference. Since many interesting and meaningful research on urban forests were presented at the Conference, we decided to publish this thematic issue of SEEFOR Journal. All presenters have been invited to prepare their paper for publishing in SEEFOR Journal. After standard procedure of peer-reviewing, we brought you seven accepted papers and truly hope that they will occupy your interest...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This work {{examines}} {{the experiences and}} mobility of the Irish community, an ambiguous catch-all term, in Belgium. The Irish people {{are thought to be}} well acquainted with emigration, particularly during the Great Irish Famine (1845 - 1851), but less is known about where these emigré’s land and of the kinds of lives they lead after their departure from Ireland. This work seeks to redress this imbalance by focussing on the dual manners through which Europe is thought to have been influenced by the emigré’s as well as the manner through which the specific circumstances of their host countries caused their composition to change over time. The often cited success story of the Irish in America, as well as of their 40 million strong diaspora, seems to be the only one written about and observing {{the manner in which the}} Irish in Belgium encounter foreign languages, including their own, foreign landscapes and peoples is the present work’s point of departure. 	There are two groups whose experiences are specifically focussed upon; the Irish in Brussels are examined first in order to understand the way that they experience Europe (which is closely aligned with the project of European Union integration). This is aided and abetted by the common association of Brussels with the European institutions housed there. The second group concerns the historically embedded Irish college, founded 1608, and concerns the historical component of Irish identity and how it has oriented itself over time in its new-found landscape. The two are complementary, the latter as a historical touchstone for understanding the Irish abroad over time and the former for giving insight into the process of Irish Europeanisation since their accession in 1973. 	One unexpected group who featured prominently during the research was the hibernophiles, who identify very strongly with Ireland and many of whom can even speak the language, who live and work in Belgium. Their experiences are invaluable to understanding the ethnic composition of the Irish in Belgium. The final section deals with the manner in which we might treat the very concept of Europe in future works- such that any anthropologists might adopt it in order to examine the ways through which different ethnic enclaves encounter and interpret Europeanisation.
