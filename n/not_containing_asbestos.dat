40|$|The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) {{assessed}} {{the safety of}} talc for use in cosmetics.

Therefore, the large amount of available animal and clinical data the Panel relied on in assessing the safety of talc only included those studies on talc that did <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> The Panel concluded that talc is safe for use in cosmetics in the present practices of use and concentration (some cosmetic products are entirely composed of talc).

40|$|Forty-one {{public schools}} in Colorado were drawn at random and {{surveyed}} for asbestos-containing materials. After bulk samples of possible asbestos materials from the schools were collected and analyzed, the K 2 asbestos screening {{test was used to}} eliminate samples that did <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Samples with positive results on the K 2 test were analyzed by an outside laboratory by polarized light microscopy. The risk of potential exposure presented by these materials was then assessed for each site from which a sample was taken. Of 113 samples collected, results were negative for asbestos for only 10. 6 percent by the K 2 test. Of the 101 samples for which results were positive, 56 actually contained 1 or more forms of asbestos. Twelve of these 56 samples were from sprayed material; the remaining 44 were from other materials <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Of the 41 schools sampled, 31 had asbestos materials in one of more locations. The potential exposure values for these materials ranged from very low to very high, but the majority had high-exposure potentials. Estimates based on the survey of the 41 schools indicated that 63 to 89 percent of the {{public schools in}} Colorado have asbestos materials that present potentially serious hazards, not only to the children, teachers, and staff, but also to members of the community who use the school buildings after regular school hours...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people use}} {{products}} during their daily routines, which contain different chemicals and minerals, {{some of which}} are harmful. Of the approximate 650, 000 different chemicals in use today, only a handful (that are hazardous) have limits assigned (called permissible exposure limits - PEL) that indicates to boundaries of safe exposure. Still, these PEL limits were mostly calculated over 30 years ago. Has nothing changed regarding these chemicals since the 1980 s? Don’t we have better and faster scientific methods to test chemicals? This paper provides some basic information regarding industrial hygiene and identifies and defines key terms and provides some insight on how to read and understand various those terms in relation to human health. This paper also includes research on four hazardous chemicals. These four chemicals and are asbestos, beryllium, silica, and trichloroethylene. Regarding the identified hazardous chemicals and minerals, I will discuss various topics of each including history and usage to name a few. Regarding asbestos as an example, asbestos is “A mineral fiber that can pollute air or water and cause cancer or asbestosis when inhaled” (Lee, 1992). There are materials that do <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos</b> {{that can be used in}} its place...|$|R
50|$|Some steam tunnels have dirt floors, poor {{lighting}} and temperatures upwards of 45 C. Others have concrete floors, bright light, and more moderate temperatures. Most steam tunnels have large intake fans {{to bring in}} fresh air and push the hot air out the back, and these fans may start without warning. Most active steam tunnels do <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> airborne <b>asbestos,</b> but proper breathing protection may be required for other respiratory hazards. Experienced explorers are very cautious inside active utility tunnels, since pipes can spew boiling hot water or steam from leaky valves or pressure relief blowoffs. Frequently there are puddles of muddy water on the floor, making slips and falls a special concern near hot pipes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research project that focused on evaluating the potential use of processed tear-off shingles in road works. The project was conducted in attempts to promote construction sustainability through recycling more construction wastes into roads. The targeted applications were road base and unpaved gravel roads. Two different sizes of tear-off shingles were investigated: ground shingles with 100 % of the particles passing sieve 4. 75 mm and processed shingles with a maximum size of 75 mm and 40 % passing 4. 75 mm. Petrogrpahic examination confirmed that the investigated shingles did <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Five types of granular materials were investigated to determine the type of material that benefits the most from using the shingles. The five types of materials were quarried crushed limestone, crushed natural gravel with 72 % crushed particles, and three recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). California Bearing Ratio (CBR) results showed that ground shingles provided better results compared to processed shingles. The use of an optimum amount of shingles (5 %) increased the stability of the granular materials. This was the case for two of the RCAs and the natural gravel material investigated in this study. On the other hand, one of the tested RCA and the crushed limestone were adversely affected by the addition of shingles. The response of a granular material to shingle modification was found {{to be related to the}} amount and quality of fines in the materials. In terms of permeability, the addition of shingles did not have a significant impact on the drainage characteristics of the tested materials...|$|R
50|$|New {{innovative}} {{methods for}} asbestos removal {{have been used}} as well. One example is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) B238 building, where a track mounted wet cutting saw with a diamond blade was used in order to cut the building into small sections. These small sections were then double wrapped in plastic, the minimum requirement when transporting asbestos material, and driven to a landfill. This method <b>not</b> only <b>contained</b> the <b>asbestos</b> material within the gunite and metal layers of the walls, but also kept workers at a safe distance since the saw was controlled remotely.|$|R
