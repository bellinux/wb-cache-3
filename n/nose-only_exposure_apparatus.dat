40|$|Inhalation {{exposure}} {{models are}} becoming the preferred method for the {{comparative study of}} respiratory infectious diseases due to their resemblance to the natural route of infection. To enable precise delivery of pathogen to the lower respiratory tract {{in a manner that}} imposes minimal biosafety risk, <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> systems have been developed. Early inhalation exposure technology for infectious disease research grew out of technology used in asthma research where predominantly the Collison nebulizer is used to generate an aerosol by beating a liquid sample against glass. Although infectious aerosol droplets of 1 - 5 &# 181;m in size can be generated, the Collison often causes loss of viability. In this work, we evaluate a gentler method for aerosolization of living cells and describe the use of the Sparging Liquid Aerosol Generator (SLAG) in a rat pneumonic plague model. The SLAG creates aerosols by continuous dripping of liquid sample on a porous metal disc. We show the generation of 0. 5 to 1 &# 181;m Y. pestis aerosol particles using the SLAG with spray factors typically ranging from 10 - 7 to 10 - 8 with no detectable loss of bacterial viability. Delivery of these infectious particles via <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> led to the rapid development of lethal pneumonic plague. Further, we evaluated the effect of restraint-stress imposed by the <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> chamber on early inflammatory responses and bacterial deposition. Elevated serum corticosterone which peaked at 2 hrs post-procedure indicated the animals experienced stress as a result of restraint in the nose-only chamber. However, we observed no correlation between elevated corticosterone and the amount of bacterial deposition or inflammation in the lungs.

40|$|Much {{is known}} about the chronic effects of {{cigarette}} smoke (CS) on lung function and inflammation and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to the short-term exposure to CS are not fully understood. Here, we assessed the effect of CS generated by nine consecutive cigarettes per day for four days in a <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> system on airway resistance measured using forced oscillation technique, lung inflammation and oxidative stress in BALB/c mice. Control mice were exposed to air. Mice exposed to CS showed a significant increase of neutrophils and lymphocytes numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The total protein and endothelin levels in BAL fluid were significantly augmented suggesting an increase of alveolar–capillary barrier permeability. Similarly, airway resistance was significantly increased in the CS group compared with controls. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation levels in lung tissue were significantly increased. The antioxidant activities of reduced glutathione, glutathione S transferase and superoxide dismutase were all significantly increased following CS exposure, indicating that CS could trigger adaptive responses that counterbalance the potentially damaging activity of oxygen radicals induced by CS exposure.

40|$|Animal {{model of}} {{cigarette}} smoke (CS) -induced {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is the primary testing methodology for drug therapies and studies on pathogenic mechanisms of disease. However, researchers have rarely run simultaneous or side-by-side tests of whole-body and <b>nose-only</b> CS <b>exposure</b> in building their mouse models of COPD. We compared and evaluated these two different methods of CS exposure, plus airway Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) inhalation, in building our COPD mouse model. Compared with the control group, CS exposed mice showed significant increased inspiratory resistance, functional residual capacity, right ventricular hypertrophy index, and total cell count in BALF. Moreover, histological staining exhibited goblet cell hyperplasia, lung inflammation, thickening of smooth muscle layer on bronchia, and lung angiogenesis in both methods of CS exposure. Our data indicated that a viable mouse model of COPD can be established by combining the results from wholebody CS <b>exposure,</b> <b>nose-only</b> CS <b>exposure,</b> and airway LPS inhalation testing.

Exposure concentrations were assessed by both real-time aerosol monitor and gas chromatograph analysis of chamber filter pack samples. Exposures were run for 10 minutes in duration with 4 animals per test. An “up and down ” paradigm was used to sequentially select target agent concentration levels from one exposure run to the next based on the resulting 24 hour lethality fraction. Chamber sampling results indicated that over the concentration range tested, the agent existed primarily in the aerosol phase most likely because of the brief transit time between the atomizer and the chamber exposure ports which did not allow sufficient time for vapor equilibration. The resulting LCt 50 for neat VX aerosol in the mouse via the inhalation route was significantly lower than anticipated based on another recent nose-only study in which mice were challenged with saline aerosols laced with VX.

The tritium used in each loading experiment is approximately 6000 Ci (22 TBq). The process entails transferring the tritium inventory from the uranium storage bed to the cryogenically cooled (77 K) molecular sieve chamber.

There is limited work describing FP effects on host defenses against bacterial pneumonia. Methods C 57 BL/ 6 mice received daily, <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> to nebulized FP or vehicle for 8 [*]days, followed by pulmonary challenge with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacterial burden, phagocytosis, leukocyte recruitment, cytokine expression, nitric oxide release, and survival were measured. Results Inhaled FP increased bacterial burden in lungs and blood 48 [*]h after infection but affected neither in vivo phagocytosis of bacteria by alveolar macrophages (AM) nor alveolar neutrophil recruitment. AM from FP-treated mice showed impaired expression of infection induced TNF-alpha, IP- 10 (CXCL- 10), and interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and AM also showed a trend towards impaired intracellular pathogen control following in vivo infection. In vitro FP treatment resulted in a dose-dependent impairment of cytokine expression by AM. Furthermore, infection-induced nitric oxide (but not hydrogen peroxide) production was impaired by FP in vivo and in vitro. FP decreased survival in this model. Conclusions Exposure to inhaled FP impairs pulmonary clearance of K. pneumoniae in mice, an effect associated with greater systemic bacteremia and death. Decreased AM cytokine and nitric oxide expression parallel the failure to control infection. These results support the study of ICS effects on human pulmonary host defenses. </p...|$|R

The pharmacokinetics of verapamil was enantioselective in the control group, with a higher plasma proportion of the S-verapamil (AUC 250. 8 versus 120. 4 ng. h. mL(- 1); p <= 0. 05, Wilcoxon test) and S-norverapamil (AUC 72. 3 versus 52. 3 ng. h. mL(- 1); p <= 0. 05, Wilcoxon test). <b>Nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> to toluene at 25, 50, or 100 ppm resulted in a lack of enantioselectivity for both verapamil and norverapamil.

40|$|Inhalation {{toxicology}} {{studies with}} chrysotile asbestos {{have in the}} past been performed at exceed-ingly high doses without consideration of fiber number or dimensions. As such, the exposures have exceeded lung overload levels, making quantitative assessment of these studies difficult if not impossible. To assess the cellular and pathological response in the rat lung to a well-characterized aerosol of chrysotile asbestos, a 90 -day subchronic inhalation toxicology study was performed using a commercial Brazilian chrysotile (CA 300). The protocol was based on that established by the European Commission for the evaluation of synthetic vitreous fibers. The study was also designed to assess the potential for reversibility of any such changes and to permit association of responses with fiber dose in the lung and the influence of fiber length. Wis-tar male rats were randomly assigned to an air control group and to 2 CA 300 exposure groups at mean fiber aerosol concentrations of 76 fibers L> 20 µm/cm 3 (3413 total fibers/cm 3; 536 WHO fibers/cm 3) or 207 fibers L> 20 µm/cm 3 (8941 total fibers/cm 3; 1429 WHO fibers/cm 3). The animals were exposed using a flow-past, <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> system for 5 days/wk, 6 h/day, during 13 consecutive weeks (65 exposures), followed by a subsequent nonexposure period last-ing for 92 days. Animals were sacrificed after cessation of exposure and after 50 and 92 days o...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies have}} shown that {{increased}} concentrations of ambient particles are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have revealed that particulate air pollution exposure is associated with indicators of autonomic function including heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rate variability. However, this association has not been clearly demonstrated in animal studies. To overcome the problems of wide variations in diseased animals and circadian cycles, we adopted a novel approach using a mixed-effects model to investigate whether ambient particle exposure was associated with changes in heart rate and blood pressure in pulmonary hypertensive rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices and exposed to concentrated ambient particles generated by an air particle concentrator. The rats were held in <b>nose-only</b> <b>exposure</b> chambers for 6 hr per day for 3 consecutive days and then rested for 4 days in each week during the experimental period of 5 weeks. These animals were exposed to concentrated particles during weeks 2, 3, and 4 and exposed to filtered air during weeks 1 and 5. The particle concentrations for tested animals ranged between 108 and 338 µg/m 3. Statistical analysis using mixed-effects models revealed that entry and exit of exposure chamber and particle exposure were associated with changes in heart rate and mean bloo...|$|R
30|$|Accelerate light aging {{has been}} tested {{for all types of}} samples of {{printing}} and writing paper exposed to a xenon-arc <b>exposure</b> <b>apparatus,</b> Xenotest S 150 from Atlas Instruments. The exposure was done with an air-cooled xenon lamp at an irradiance of 42  W/m 2 (wavelength in the range: 300 – 400  nm), at 35  °C temperature in the test chamber, at relative humidity 50 %, for 48  h [25]. The light flux causes photochemical reactions in wood that change its reflectance (brightness) and color. By comparing initial and final levels of these parameters against different criteria, a measured of optical stability is obtained.|$|R
