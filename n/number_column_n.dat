40|$|In {{a typical}} {{communications}} problem, Toeplitz matrices Φ arise when modeling {{the task of}} determining an unknown impulse response a from a given probe signal φ. When a is sparse, then whenever Φ formed from the probe signal φ satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a can be robustly recovered from its measurements via ℓ 1 -minimization. In this paper, we derived the RIP for compressive Toeplitz matrices whose number of rows of the matrices J is {{much smaller than the}} <b>number</b> of <b>columns</b> <b>N.</b> We show that J should scale like J ∼ S 2 log(N), where S is the sparsity of the impulse response. While this is marginally worse than the state-of-the-art scaling currently achieved in the literature, the novelty of this work comes from making the relation between the Toeplitz matrix of interest to a block diagonal matrix. The proof of the RIP then follows from using recent results on the concentration of measure inequalities of block diagonal matrices, together with a standard covering-and-counting argument. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} for the project {{discusses}} the attempts to model, using different methods, microwave image reconstruction. Maximum Entropy Method was not successful. Attempts to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) got some good results after initial failure. SVD is based upon a theory of linear algebra, {{to the effect that}} any M X N Matrix A whose number of rows M is {{greater than or equal to}} its <b>number</b> of <b>columns,</b> <b>N</b> can be written as the product of an M X N column-orthogonal matrix U, an N X N diagonal Matrix, W, with m positive or zero elements (the singular values) and the transposition of an N X N orthogonal matrix V. In microwave imaging, the scattered fields can be expressed by the induced current distribution. The SVD method required more contiguous computer memory than was available. Work was also done on the Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM), which didn't work well when tried earlier. It was found that separation of the imaginary part and the real part during calculation may work. This work was considered incomplete as of the end of the grant period...|$|R

Our algorithm is a Las Vegas type randomized algorithm and the expected running time is ln N) where n is the <b>number</b> of <b>columns</b> and <b>N</b> {{is the total}} sum of whole entries in a table. The algorithm is based on monotone coupling from the past (monotone CFTP) algorithm and new Markov chain for sampling two-rowed contingency tables uniformly. We employed the path coupling method and showed that the mixing rate of our chain is bounded by n(n- 1) ²(1 + ln(nN)). Our result indicates that uniform generation of two-rowed contingency tables is easier than the corresponding counting problem, since the counting problem {{is known to be}} #P-complete...|$|R
40|$|An unknown m by n matrix X_ 0 {{is to be}} {{estimated}} from noisy measurements Y=X_ 0 +Z, where the noise matrix Z has i. i. d. Gaussian entries. A popular matrix denoising scheme solves the nuclear norm penalization problem min_XY-X_F^ 2 / 2 +λX_*, where X_* denotes the nuclear norm (sum of singular values). This is the analog, for matrices, of ℓ_ 1 penalization in the vector case. It has been empirically observed that if X_ 0 has low rank, it may be recovered quite accurately from the noisy measurement Y. In a proportional growth framework where the rank r_n, number of rows m_n and <b>number</b> of <b>columns</b> <b>n</b> all tend to ∞ proportionally to each other (r_n/m_n→ρ, m_n/n→β), we evaluate the asymptotic minimax MSE M(ρ,β) =_m_n,n→∞_λ_rank(X) ≤ r_nMSE(X_ 0,X̂_λ). Our formulas involve incomplete moments of the quarter- and semi-circle laws (β= 1, square case) and the Marčenko-Pastur law (β< 1, nonsquare case). For finite m and n, we show that MSE increases as the nonzero singular values of X_ 0 grow larger. As a result, the finite-n worst-case MSE, a quantity which can be evaluated numerically, is achieved when the signal X_ 0 is "infinitely strong. " The nuclear norm penalization problem is solved by applying soft thresholding to the singular values of Y. We also derive the minimax threshold, namely the value λ^*(ρ), which is the optimal place to threshold the singular values. All these results are obtained for general (nonsquare, nonsymmetric) real matrices. Comparable results are obtained for square symmetric nonnegative-definite matrices.

Strong correlations between the δ 15 N of skeletal organic material and that of coral tissue in two scleractinian corals (Porites lutea and Favia stelligera) across a tropical coral reef flat support the use of CS-δ 15 N in reconstructing coral biomass δ 15 N changes. However, we observed a consistent and species-specific offset between the coral tissue δ 15 N and the skeletal CS-δ 15 N. As such, the CS-δ 15 N is not an absolute measure of tissue δ 15 N. The CS-δ 15 N of both coral species and three species of macroalgae increased across the reef flat in response to a natural gradient in water <b>column</b> δ 15 <b>N.</b> There was an apparent dampening of the water <b>column</b> δ 15 <b>N</b> gradient recorded in the coral tissue δ 15 N and the CS-δ 15 N, possibly caused by shifting trophic status of corals across the reef flat. The CS-δ 15 N therefore appears to robustly reflect the δ 15 N of the coral tissue, and the coral system is responsive to the δ 15 N of the water <b>column</b> <b>N</b> pools.
