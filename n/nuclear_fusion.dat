In this mechanism, electron currents play an important role, which are induced by an externally applied field or counterstreams of free electrons which naturally exist inside, surface and outside of bulk metals. At places of electron currents, the electric potential becomes negative and there relevant nuclei gather and collide. Then, if electrons exist in close vicinities in addition, there the electric potential barriers are lowered further and the tunneling effects which bring about <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusions</b> drastically increase.

40|$|<b>Nuclear</b> {{membrane}} <b>fusion</b> is {{the last}} step in the mating pathway of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We adapted a bioinformatics approach to identify putative pheromone-induced membrane proteins potentially required for <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fusion.</b> One protein, Prm 3 p, {{was found to be}} required for nuclear membrane fusion; disruption of PRM 3 caused a strong bilateral defect, in which nuclear congression was completed but fusion did not occur. Prm 3 p was localized to the nuclear envelope in pheromone-responding cells, with significant colocalization with the spindle pole body in zygotes. A previous report, using a truncated protein, claimed that Prm 3 p is localized to the inner nuclear envelope. Based on biochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy and live cell microscopy, we find that functional Prm 3 p is a peripheral membrane protein exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the outer nuclear envelope. In support of this, mutations in a putative nuclear localization sequence had no effect on full-length protein function or localization. In contrast, point mutations and deletions in the highly conserved hydrophobic carboxy-terminal domain disrupted both protein function and localization. Genetic analysis, colocalization, and biochemical experiments indicate that Prm 3 p interacts directly with Kar 5 p, suggesting that <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fusion</b> is mediated by a protein complex...|$|R
5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core.

Previous work suggested that Ca 2 + mobilization is required for <b>nuclear</b> vesicle <b>fusion</b> and implicated IP 3 receptor activity. To test the involvement of IP 3 receptors using selective reagents, we obtained three distinct polyclonal antibodies to the type 1 IP 3 receptor.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} {{is divided into three}} {{independent}} chapters. The first chapter demonstrates the role of importin beta in regulating nuclear assembly. The second chapter furthers the understanding of importin beta's regulatory role through the analysis of potential targets of importin beta in nuclear assembly. Finally, the third chapter identifies and investigates the function of Xenopus gp 210, a transmembrane nuclear pore protein. Toward the end of mitosis in higher eukaryotes, nuclear assembly involves the precise targeting of nucleoporins and membranes to the surface of chromatin. This process encapsulates the genome in two nuclear membranes perforated with nuclear pore complexes, which allow transport through the nuclear envelope. Nuclear assembly is a complex process, and thus regulatory mechanisms must be in place. In studies reported here, importin beta was found to be a negative regulator of nuclear assembly. Specifically, it negatively regulates <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fusion</b> and, separately, the subsequent step of nuclear pore assembly. The small GTPase Ran was demonstrated to be an opposing positive regulator of importin beta in <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fusion</b> but, surprisingly, not in nuclear pore assembly. To identify the regulatory targets of importin beta, proteins it interacted with were investigated. One potential target for importin beta in its block to <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fusion</b> is p 97, a protein implicated in <b>nuclear</b> membrane <b>fusion.</b> The two proteins proved not to interact. Given the strong nature of the block to nuclear pore assembly by importin beta, it was hypothesized that importin beta would bind to and inhibit many of the nuclear pore subunit interactions involved in assembly. Instead, only a small subset of interactions between nucleoporins was perturbed. Thus, importin beta regulates the assembly of key distinct nucleoporin subunits, but may cooperate with other proteins to regulate complete nuclear pore assembly. gp 210 is a transmembrane nucleoporin, and as such, has been hypothesized to be involved in nuclear pore assembly. To understand the role of gp 210 in the nuclear pore, gp 210 was studied in the Xenopus egg extract nuclear reconstitution system. Xenopus gp 210 was shown not to be involved in nuclear assembly, but may instead be involved in nuclear disassembl...|$|R
