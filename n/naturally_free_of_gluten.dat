5000|$|For Europe, the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 41/2009 of 20 January 2009 {{concerning}} {{the composition and}} labelling of foodstuffs suitable for people intolerant to gluten has laid down harmonised rules on the content and labelling of these foodstuffs, setting out {{the conditions under which}} foods may be labelled as [...] "gluten-free" [...] or [...] "very low gluten". Having entered into force on 10 February 2009 and taken effect on 1 January 2012, these rules have been repealed with effect as of 20 July 2016. The background is that, in line with the Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 on food for specific groups, gluten-free foods shall, in future, be legislated for under the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011). Furthermore, the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 828/2014 of 30 July 2014 on the requirements for the provision of information to consumers on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in food extends the rules of Regulation (EC) 41/2009 on [...] "gluten-free" [...] and [...] "very low gluten" [...] statements also to non pre-packed foods such as those served in restaurants. The implementing regulation also clarifies how consumers are to be informed of the difference between foods that are <b>naturally</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and products that are specially formulated for gluten-intolerant persons.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{worldwide}} {{prevalence of}} ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) {{during the last}} few years is increasing. The association between diet <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein and improvement of autistic behaviors is still under questions. Objective: To study the association between the consump 6 tion <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein and the score of Childhood Autistic Rating Scale (CARS) in children with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder). The study also aimed at understanding mothers’ attitude toward the diet. Methods: This was a cross sectional study on 10 mothers of children suffering from ASD in a clinic in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A dietician measured the consumptions <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein with scored food frequency questionnaire while experts in the clinic measured CARS. In-depth interviews were performed to capture the mothers’ attitude toward the diet. Result: There was a decrease in the mean score <b>of</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein before and after diagnoses of ASD, mean difference of 156. 6 (125. 2; 187. 9), p< 0. 001). There was no significant correlation between the consumption score <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein and the decrease in the score of CARS (r= 0. 274, p= 0. 82). Mothers thought diet <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein was associated with improvement of behaviors. Conclusion: Consumption <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and casein decreased after diagnosis of ASD.

40|$|We {{find that}} general {{relativity}} can be <b>naturally</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> cosmological singularities. Several nonsingular models are currently available that either assume ad hoc matter contents, or are nonsingular only over a sector of solution space of zero measure, or depart drastically from general relativity at high energies. After much uncertainty over whether cosmological inflation could {{help solve the}} initial-singularity problem, the prevailing belief today is that general relativistic cosmology, with inflation or without, is endemically singular. This belief was reinforced by recent singularity theorems that take account specifically of inflation. Here, a viable inflationary cosmology is worked out that is <b>naturally</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> singularities {{despite the fact that}} 1) it uses only classical general relativity, 2) it assumes only the most generic inflationary matter contents, and 3) it is a theory of the chaotic-inflation type. That type of inflation is the most widely accepted today, as it demands the least fine-tuning of initial conditions. It is also shown how, by dropping the usual simplification of minimal coupling between matter and geometry, the null energy condition can be violated and the relevant singularity theorems circumvented.

Sassafras root is still used to flavor traditional root beer, but since sassafras was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to the controversially claimed carcinogenicity of its constituent safrole, most commercial recipes do not contain sassafras.

30|$|Many {{services}} {{relied on}} the one-way communication of rules with little rationale or explanation provided such as outlawing cake despite some perhaps being <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>gluten,</b> dairy, sugar or low fat. Communication of rules, regulations and preferences need to be articulated {{in an environment of}} a trusting relationship between educator and parent. The lack of specificity around infant feeding in policies may also describe the reliance on the environmental norms of the service or the individual/collective agency or training of educators detached from the passive policy (Wood and Bandura 1989). There needs to be high educator knowledge, a belief for intentions and a high self-efficacy for communication to enact outcome expectancies outlined in policies. Detail and rationale in the NQF and subsequently service infant feeding policies will increase educator knowledge, belief and, therefore, support the development of self-efficacy and quality practice (Bandura 1977). This development of self-efficacy will support developing partnerships with parents contributing to a collective agency towards improved curriculum implementation and outcomes. The research clearly identifies opportunities to strengthen policy pertaining to infant feeding, thereby positively impacting practice in ECEC.|$|R

These textures exhibit obviously hierarchical breaking of S_N permutation symmetry among fermion generations. Since we have now multiple textures for the fermion mass matrices, allotting different textures to up- and down-type fermions suitably will bring about complex CKM matrices.

50|$|Pinker claims {{these fears}} are non sequiturs, {{and that the}} blank slate view of human nature would {{actually}} be a greater threat if it were true.

He also argues that grounding moral values in claims about a blank slate opens them {{to the possibility of}} being overturned by future empirical discoveries. He further argues that a blank slate is in fact inconsistent with opposition to many social evils since a blank slate could be conditioned to enjoy servitude and degradation.|$|R

The designed product recipe consisted only of white sorghum, powdered grape seeds, honey, and dark chocolate. This essential composition was formulated in order to boost nutritional added value such as presence of polyphenols, high fiber content, low level of sodium, and a low caloric intake, all within an organic product, <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>gluten</b> and preservatives. A selected variety of white sorghum was the basic ingredient of the product: versatile, with nutritional properties similar to corn, sorghum has lower water requirements and withstands high temperatures brilliantly.
