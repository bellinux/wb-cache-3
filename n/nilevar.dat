50|$|Norethandrolone (INN, BAN) (brand names <b>Nilevar,</b> Pronabol), {{also known}} as 17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone or 17α-ethyl-19-norandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, as well as ethylnandrolone or ethylnortestosterone, is a {{synthetic}} anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and progestogen of the 17α-alkylated and 19-nortestosterone groups. It was synthesized at G. D. Searle & Company in 1953 and was originally studied as a progestin, along with norethisterone and noretynodrel, but ultimately was not marketed as such. In 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity and {{was found to have}} similar anabolic activity to testosterone but only one-sixteenth the androgenic potency.|$|E
50|$|Norethandrolone was {{introduced}} in the United States as an AAS in 1965 under the trade name <b>Nilevar</b> but was withdrawn from the market in the 1980s due to concerns of cholestatic jaundice. Norethandrolone is now only marketed in Australia, France, and Switzerland, and as with all 17α-alkylated oral steroids, long-term use in high doses may result in elevated liver enzymes and consequently cirrhosis. It is used in the treatment of muscle wasting, patients with severe burns, after severe trauma, and for certain forms of aplastic anemia.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 {{he joined}} Searle {{as a senior}} {{research}} chemist. In 1952 Colton synthesized the progestin noretynodrel (an isomer of norethisterone), which combined with the estrogen mestranol as Enovid {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1956 for menstrual disorders and in 1960 as the first oral contraceptive. In 1953 he synthesized norethandrolone, which as <b>Nilevar</b> was approved in 1956 as the first oral anabolic steroid. In 1954 Colton and Paul D. Klimstra synthesized the progestin etynodiol diacetate, which combined with the estrogen mestranol as Ovulen was approved in 1965 as Searle's second oral contraceptive, and combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol was approved in 1970 as Demulen. Colton retired from Searle in 1986 as research adviser. In 1988 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.|$|E
40|$|Lowering of lipids in {{patients}} with chronic renal failure is advantageous but cannot be done by calorie restriction. In a controlled study the anabolic steroid norethandrolone (<b>Nilevar)</b> was found to lower triglycerides by 50 %, while D-thyroxine (Choloxin) lowered the cholesterol by 25 %. Both drugs increased the activity of lipoprotein lipase in spite of uraemic inhibition. Norethandrolone also reduced basal serum insulin levels. Norethandrolone seems appropriate for underweight patients and D-thyroxine for overweight patients, but side effects are more frequent than in non-uraemic patients...|$|E
