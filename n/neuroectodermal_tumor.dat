40|$|The antitumorigenic {{effects of}} {{endogenous}} opioid peptides and {{their presence in}} extracerebral tumors are well documented. In this study, methionine-enkephaline (met-enkephalin) was measured by radioimmunoassay in 108 glial and nonglial brain tumors and in 44 associated cyst fluids. By immunohistochemistry, {{the distribution of the}} peptide and its precursor, preproenkephalin A, was also analyzed. Met-enkephalin and preproenkephalin were detected in the cytoplasm and cell processes of all <b>tumors.</b> Moreover, for <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> (i. e., gliomas, gangliogliomas, and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors), a strong inverse correlation (P < 0. 0001) was observed between the met-enkephalin levels and the degree of malignancy (242. 9, 148. 3, 55. 3, and 30. 3 pg/mg protein for grade 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). When compared to normal tissue, this differential expression mainly results from a decrease in the opioid peptide content in high-grade <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors.</b> Meningiomas and cerebral metastases displayed low met-enkephalin levels, similar to those of grade 4 <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors.</b> Large amounts of met-enkephalin were found in all cyst fluids. These data suggest that the endogenous opioid system is an integral component of brain tumors and that met-enkephalin may represent a useful malignancy marker in <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Medulloblastomas are prototypical of {{primitive}} <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> which {{are some of}} the most frequent malignant brain tumors of childhood. The cell biology of medulloblastomas is still poorly understood, but recent studies of the expression of trophic factors and their receptors in medulloblastomas and the development of animal models {{of primitive}} <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> may provide clues as to the induction or progression of these tumors.

40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} and cell death play critical roles in embryonic development, postnatal tissue maintenance, and tumor formation. To understand {{the interplay between}} cell {{proliferation and}} death in tumor formation, we studied these two processes in nascent primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> that arose postnatally from neuroepithelial cells ventral to the median eminence of transgenic mice (designated rTH-Tag mice) carrying a Simian virus 40 large T antigen transgene driven by a rat tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. Cell proliferation continued in the neuroepithelium of the ventral median eminence in wild-type and transgenic animals for the first 2 weeks of postnatal life but subsided completely in the wild-type mice after 2 weeks of age. In contrast, mitotic activity persisted in these progenitor cells of the rTH-Tag mice, {{and there was a}} dramatic increase in mitotic activity after 10 weeks leading to the formation of primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> despite sustained cell death activity. We conclude that primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> originate from progenitor cells in the ventral median eminence of rTH-Tag mice in early postnatal life when progenitors fail to respond to signals to exit the cell cycle. Thus, the disruption of mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation and cell death in the developing brain may underlie the emergence of primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> in the rTH-Tag mice...|$|R

40|$|The present article {{reports for}} the first time a case of an extrarenal teratoid Wilms tumor in the uterus of a 62 -year-old woman. It had {{triphasic}} histology with epithelial areas composed of metanephric tubules harboring glomerular structures, adamantine patterns, neural type rosettes, blastema, and a primitive, myxoid type stroma. Abundant heterologous elements such as cartilage, striated muscle, squamous epithelium, and an alpha fetoprotein and TTF 1 -positive early endodermal epithelium were also present. Immunohistochemistry in Wilms tumor areas showed positivity for markers also indicative of peripheral primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> such as neuron-specific enolase, CD 99, and CD 56. However, nuclear positivity for Wilms tumor antigen together with the presence of glomeruli and the absence of endometrioid tumor areas and the organoid arrangement of tissues excluded peripheral primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors,</b> carcinosarcoma, and teratoma, respectively. Although the diagnosis of female genital tract Wilms tumors is difficult in cases where glomerular structures are lacking, it should be considered because these neoplasms have a better therapeutic response than peripheral primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> and carcinosarcoma...|$|R

40|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) is {{important}} to the survival, development, and differentiation of neurons. Its action is mediated by a specific cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein, nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). In this study, NGFR expression by human fetal and adult adrenal medullary tissue, peripheral nervous system (PNS) <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma), pediatric primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> (PNETs) of the central nervous system (CNS), and CNS gliomas was examined by an immunohistochemical technique. Sixty-nine tumors in total were probed in this manner. Nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity was confined to nerve fibers and clusters of primitive-appearing cells in the fetal adrenal, and to nerve fibers and ganglion cells of the adult adrenal medulla; adrenal chromaffin cells were negative. In PNS <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors,</b> there was NGFR expression in tumor cells of 6 of 11 neuroblastomas and 6 of 6 ganglioneuroblastomas or ganglioneuromas. Thirteen of thirty-five CNS PNETs showed NGFR positivity. In most CNS PNETs, NGFR was restricted to scattered single or small groups of cells, but two tumors with astroglial differentiation showed much more extensive immunoreactivity. Most astrocytomas (11 of 14) and all ependymomas (3 of 3) were intensely NGFR positive...|$|R
40|$|Immunohistochemical {{staining}} intensity for ganglioside GD 1 b {{was determined}} for 108 human <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors.</b> Most {{of the tissue}} elements that immunostained were tumor cells; only a few axons and occasional neurons reacted in some specimens. All pilocytic astrocytomas stained very positively, whereas none of the ependymomas and only 11 % of primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors,</b> 20 % of glioblastomas, and 28 % of anaplastic astrocytomas showed more than faint staining. A similar association between grade and immunostaining was seen in tumors containing an oligodendrogliomatous component, but reactivity was {{not as strong as}} in astrocytic <b>tumors</b> or primitive <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors.</b> Results of Cox regression showed significant associations between immunostaining intensity and survival for all cases taken together (P = 0. 007); for the group consisting of astrocytomas, oligoastrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas (P = 0. 002); and for astrocytomas alone (P = 0. 04). Results were also significant using a proportional hazards model controlling for patient age (all cases P = 0. 005; astrocytomas only P = 0. 02), but not when controlling for tumor grade. Our results indicate that immunohistochemical staining for GD 1 b is correlated with tumor grade and that it may be of prognostic utility in some primary human brain tumors, especially astrocytomas...|$|R
40|$|The N-glycolylated {{ganglioside}} NeuGc-GM 3 {{has been}} described in solid tumors such as breast carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and melanoma, but is usually not detected in normal human cells. Our aim was to evaluate the presence of NeuGc-GM 3 in pediatric <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> by immunohistochemistry. Twenty-seven archival cases of neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) were analyzed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were cut into 5 [*]μm sections. The monoclonal antibody 14 F 7, a mouse IgG 1 that specifically recognizes NeuGc-GM 3, and a peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to secondary antibodies were used. Presence of NeuGc-GM 3 was evident in 23 of 27 cases (85 %), {{with an average of}} about 70 % of positive tumors cells. Immunoreactivity was moderate to intense in most tumors, showing a diffuse cytoplasmic and membranous staining, although cases of ESFT demonstrated a fine granular cytoplasmic pattern. No significant differences were observed between neuroblastoma with and without NMYC oncogene amplification, suggesting that expression of NeuGc-GM 3 is preserved in more aggressive cancers. Until now, the expression of N-glycolylated gangliosides in pediatric <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors</b> has not been investigated. The present study evidenced the expression of NeuGc-GM 3 in a high proportion of <b>neuroectodermal</b> <b>tumors,</b> suggesting its potential utility as a specific target of immunotherapy...|$|R
