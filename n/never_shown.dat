5|$|Although <b>never</b> <b>shown,</b> Laika is {{prominently}} {{mentioned in}} the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a pilot in the ranks of the Galactic Terran–Vasudan Alliance (GTVA). While the {{appearance}} and name of the pilot can be customized by the player, the player never gets to personally interact with other characters in the game. The pilot is also <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> in the game's cinematics or any other media.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, MGM/UA {{contracted}} the distribution {{rights to the}} film. One Way Productions came to an agreement with MGM {{that it would take}} care of the costs associated with advertising and distributing the film, if MGM agreed to distribute Inchon for a profit share of only 15 percent. The normal fee for the film distributor was thirty percent of profits. The film, cut to 105 minutes, was released in the United States on the weekend of September 17, 1982. It was swiftly pulled from theater distribution because of its poor performance at the box office, and was <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E
5|$|Because Pride and Prejudice was {{a period}} drama, the design {{required}} more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while {{trying to make the}} clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.|$|E
25|$|The {{severing}} of Brother Jonathan's ear {{was eventually}} accepted because the wound itself is <b>never</b> <b>shown.</b>|$|E

25|$|Contrary to some allegations, {{including}} the oft-reported comments of Donald Rumsfeld on 4 June 2005, Al Jazeera has <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> beheadings (beheadings {{have appeared on}} numerous non-Al Jazeera websites and have sometimes been misattributed to Al Jazeera).|$|E
25|$|Granny and Grandpa: Charlie and Lola's grandparents. Granny paints for a hobby, {{while it}} appears that Grandpa is good with horses. Like Charlie and Lola's parents and other character's parents, they are {{referred}} to but are <b>never</b> <b>shown.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jim Rockford's {{mother is}} <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> or named, {{and is very}} seldom {{referred}} to. Although never directly stated, the way Jim and Rocky talk about her would seem to indicate she had died (before the series' start).|$|E

His first flight {{in command of}} the aircraft took place on 6 February 2011, four days prior to the accident. The captain had flown into Cork 61 times; his logbooks had <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> any diversions.|$|E
25|$|Indo-Scythian coins {{essentially}} {{continue the}} Indo-Greek tradition, {{by using the}} Greek language on the obverse and the Kharoshthi language on the reverse. The portrait of the king is <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> however, and is replaced by depictions of the king on horse (and sometimes on camel), or sometimes sitting cross-legged on a cushion. The reverse of their coins typically show Greek divinities.|$|E

25|$|Frequently, {{when friends}} or {{relatives}} of the show's guests enter the stage having heard backstage what has been said, strong language and fights break out on the show regularly, although the latter are <b>never</b> <b>shown,</b> instead the camera gives {{a view of the}} audience and Jeremy until his security team restores order. This has led to the show being compared with Roman gladiatorial combat in its brutality.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} New Zealand on June 28, 2004, shooting in primarily chronological order. Adamson did this {{in order to}} naturally {{create a sense of}} mature development from his young actors, which mirrored their real life development. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes were <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia, nor had Henley seen James McAvoy in his Mr. Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{are first}} {{seen in the}} {{original}} movie. They often are covered in decorative frills, and have glowing eye-beads. They are designed for show rather than functionality. Four versions of these have been seen: Pharaoh Mask (worn by Ra), Horus Mask (Ra's Horus Jaffa and Heru-ur's Jaffa), Jackal mask (Leader of Ra's Jaffa, originally Anubis), and Serpent Mask (Apophis and his Jaffa). Seth Masks (worn by Seth and his Jaffa) have been mentioned, though <b>never</b> <b>shown.</b>|$|E

25|$|In August 1978, Stein was {{appointed}} manager of Leeds United. The players at Leeds received the news well, but {{were concerned that}} Stein had <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> any previous interest in managing in England. Early results were mixed, although the Leeds chairman Manny Cussins detected some improvement from the previous few seasons, when Leeds had slipped from their dominant position in English football. Attendances at Elland Road were low and Stein apparently missed the pressure of big games against foreign opposition.|$|E
25|$|One running gag has Sergeant Snorkel hanging helplessly from a {{small tree}} branch after having fallen off a cliff (first time August 16, 1956). While he is <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> falling off, or even walking {{close to the edge}} of a cliff, he always seems to hold on to that same branch, yelling for help. This gag may have spawned the segment of the children's show Between the Lions {{featuring}} a person named Cliff Hanger, who, like Sergeant Snorkel, is hanging from a cliff in each feature.|$|E
25|$|Although Zhou's {{subsequently}} cautious military {{approach was}} distrusted by hardliners, he was again {{appointed to the}} position of vice chairman of the Military Commission. Zhou was accepted as leader largely because of his organizational talent and devotion to work, and because he had <b>never</b> <b>shown</b> any overt ambition to pursue supreme power within the Party. Within months, the continuing orthodox tactics of Bo and Braun led to a serious defeat for the Red Army, and forced the leaders of the CCP to seriously consider abandoning their bases in Jiangxi.|$|E
