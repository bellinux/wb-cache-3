25|$|The Valemax size ships, all ordered for Vale, have a {{deadweight}} of {{just over}} 400,000 tonnes and the Chinese government probably considers them too large to enter Chinese ports. Because of that the ships are now slimmed down to 380,000 tonnes deadweight, although it seems that this is only on paper: <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> to the design but it would mean that ships to China cannot be loaded to capacity.|$|E
25|$|After the Arcobaleno battle, Tsuna {{refuses to}} become the tenth head of the Vongola Family and Reborn leaves. A week after his departure, Tsuna realises that he is still his no-good self; <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> Reborn returns to train Tsuna as Neo-Vongola Primo, similar to Vongola Decimo; Tsuna remembers that he now has friends he can rely on and has been changed by his experiences, thanks to his tutor and partner Reborn.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust from Pan, hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E
500|$|No {{song from}} this album has been {{performed}} {{on any of}} Bowie's tours after 1987. However, Bowie had Mario J. McNulty remix the track [...] "Time Will Crawl" [...] in 2008 for his compilation of self-selected favourite songs, iSelect, and later included the same mix on his career-spanning 50th anniversary compilation, <b>Nothing</b> <b>Has</b> <b>Changed.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} series finale {{during the}} sixth season garnered a generally negative critical response. Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly {{described it as}} [...] "probably a bit confusing" [...] for the series' earlier viewers, {{in light of the}} casting adjustments in later seasons. A writer for Gawker criticized that [...] "as the camera zooms out into the South California nothingness, <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> and neither audience nor cast is for the better". However, a writer from People was more positive, feeling that the conclusion was a [...] "surprise twist".|$|E
500|$|New {{information}} {{was released in}} September 2014 regarding his next compilation album, <b>Nothing</b> <b>Has</b> <b>Changed,</b> which was released in November.

In May 2015, [...] "Let's Dance" [...] was announced to be reissued as a yellow vinyl single on 16 July 2015 in conjunction with the [...] "David Bowie is" [...] exhibition at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, Australia.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A {{critical}} point in time? “Forever constant ” {{used to be}} the preferred adjective for describing Korean security. 1 For decades one could assert without fear of contradiction that, since the Panmunjom armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953, the Cold War standoff between the major powers in the region and the spectacular estrangement between the two Koreas meant that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed...</b>|$|R

She {{closed her}} eyes and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of Sunday dinner, the big silver soup tureen {{catching}} the sun, the flowered china with the gilt edges, and even a glimpse of lace paper when the closet door opened; Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, with Peter between them. And these, strangely, were the only tangible things and immutable.|$|R
500|$|From {{the text}} itself, the ending is ambiguous: {{according}} to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, [...] "The Killing Joke" [...] is {{in reference to the}} ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill The Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who have been fighting for years, end all of their disputes by having a good laugh about it all. Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> except for the two parties' respect for each other.|$|E
500|$|While {{speaking}} of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that [...] "practically <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, {{and they do not}} want to apologize for all their actions in the past." [...] Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: [...] "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power." [...] According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there. She says we have a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! <b>Nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E
5000|$|In either case, {{the song}} {{became one of}} the band's most popular songs. As Hell states, [...] "After I left the Heartbreakers, they kept playing 'Chinese Rocks' and then ended up {{recording}} it" [...] for the band's 1977 debut album, L.A.M.F.. [...] "And they put all of their names on it, though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> about the song--they just added their names to it. Johnny Thunders... <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with 'Chinese Rocks' at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> in the meantime, in 1993, 110 {{indigenous}} people from Chimalapas moved to Mexico City where {{they made an}} international complaint.

2500|$|In December 2013, the two Chief Rabbis of Israel, David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef, {{reiterated the}} ban on Jews {{entering}} the Temple Mount.

5000|$|Meanwhile, the Dutch West India Company, Bartels' nominal employer, {{had been}} {{dissolved}} in 1792, with the possessions reverting to {{rule of the}} States-General of the Dutch Republic. Furthermore, by the time Bartels was appointed [...] "President of the Council", the Dutch Republic itself {{had been replaced by}} the Batavian Republic. These revolutionary developments in Europe did not bring much changes to the government of the colony, which were governed like <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
50|$|History of Magic is {{the study}} of magical history. Cuthbert Binns' lessons are {{depicted}} as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin rebellions, giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only class at Hogwarts that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Chalk, {{with his}} mind {{full of the}} story he had just heard, walked homewards like {{a man in a}} dream. The air was {{fragrant}} with spring and the scent of lilac revived memories almost forgotten. It took him back forty years, and showed him a small boy treading the same road, passing the same houses. <b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> so much as the small boy himself; <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> been so unlike the life he had pictured as the life he had led. Even the blamelessness of the latter yielded no comfort; it savoured of a lack of spirit.|$|R

Later, refusing to bow to York, Clifford exclaims [...] "May that ground gape and swallow me alive/Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father" [...] (1.1.162–163). The murder of Rutland is particularly important in terms of Clifford's pursuit of vengeance, as the scene is punctuated with a debate about the limits and moral implications of exacting revenge on someone who did no wrong in the first place; ...|$|E
2500|$|In France, David Bowie {{had three}} singles enter the top 10, {{including}} [...] "Space Oddity" [...] which peaked at number one and gave Bowie his first chart-topping {{single in the}} country.

Easton continued his attack on vessels as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> In so doing, he had crossed the line into piracy.|$|R
