5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and her family in Walford, including her son Morgan Jackson-King, whom he has adopted. It is revealed {{that he is a}} paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Romeo and Julie, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter {{as a result of his}} growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.|$|E

25|$|Berlioz was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> prodigy, {{unlike some}} other famous composers of the time; he began {{studying}} music at age 12, writing small compositions and arrangements. As {{a result of}} his father's discouragement, he never learned to play the piano, a peculiarity he later described as both beneficial and detrimental. He became proficient at guitar, flageolet and flute. He learned harmony from textbooks alone—he was not formally trained. The majority of his early compositions were romances and chamber pieces.|$|E
25|$|Poventud {{wrote his}} first {{composition}} at age 14 titled Ya No Soy Un Niño. (I'm <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Child</b> Anymore). His primary inspirations were his deceased mother, his new reality in New York, a growing romanticism, and the melancholy of diaspora - a {{nostalgia for the}} island {{and the people that}} he'd left behind. In 1956, still at the age of 14, Poventud was invited to sing in the wedding of Grace Kelly and Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.|$|E

25|$|The {{adopted child}} {{can be either}} male or female. The adopted child must fall under the Hindu category. The adoptee {{also needs to be}} unmarried; however, if the {{particular}} custom or usage is applicable to the involved parties then the adoptee can be married. The child cannot be the age of sixteen or older, unless again it is custom or the usage is applicable to the involved parties. An adoption can only occur if there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of the same sex of the adopted child still residing in the home. In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or mother must not have a legitimate or adopted son still living in the house.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part}} to her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
25|$|In November 1893 {{headmaster}} George Stanley Farnell {{was arrested}} and charged with assault following an incident in which he beat, by means of a cane, a 17-year-old student. On 5 December 1893 the magistrate heard evidence from the prosecuting Centenier, a doctor, the student's father, and the student himself, among others. The doctor gave evidence of the severity of the beating. The magistrate decided that since the student's father had been assured that corporal punishment would not be inflicted, there could be no justification in law for the caning, especially given that the student was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> but of military age. He reprimanded the defendant, bound the headmaster over to act with less severity in future and released him. The headmaster's cane was confiscated by the court. This case sparked controversy. The use of corporal punishment at the college was represented among French speakers as an imposition of English culture and an attack on the liberties of the Jerseyman as enjoyed up until then at the college. The introduction of corporal punishment to Jersey on the model of English public schools was contrasted with the absence of such punishments in French schools. The magistrate's decision was attacked by the Solicitor-General. The governing body (of which the Solicitor-General was a member) supported the headmaster, who was able to produce a petition signed by his students, supporting the continued use of corporal punishment. All this was in contrast to the tradition established by the first headmaster, Dr Henderson, who had never resorted to the cane. The Constable of Saint Helier (also a member of the governing body) immediately lodged an amendment to the law on compulsory education then under debate, to outlaw corporal punishment in schools subsidised by the States. On 8 January 1894 the States debated the amendment. The Constable of Saint Helier stated that he had felt obliged to put forward the amendment in the light of the recent incident at Victoria College, and that corporal punishment was a barbaric relic. The amendment was rejected by 14 votes to 12.|$|E

500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{desires to}} have a baby, but her {{adoption}} process is taking a long time. She begins to act [...] "baby-crazy" [...] when she is around little children. While outside of 30 Rock, Liz pats a boy {{in front of her}} [...] on the head, only to discover that it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> but a dwarf man, Stewart LaGrange (Peter Dinklage). To cover up, Liz lies to Stewart, telling him that the reason she pat his head was to get his attention, which he accepts and the two go on a date. During their date, Liz tries to pick Stewart up to stop him from touching fire. Stewart asks Liz if she first thought he was a child when they first met, [...] and she admits this is true, displeasing him. The next day, she calls him to apologize and asks that he give her a second chance and meet her at the Brooklyn Bridge. At the bridge, however, Liz mistakenly thinks a boy is Stewart, which prompts him to realize this will never work between them.|$|E
500|$|On August 18, the Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit began a {{criminal}} investigation on Jackson. The same day, Jordan Chandler's mother told police {{that she did not}} believe Jackson had molested her son. On August 21, a search warrant was issued, allowing police to search Jackson's Neverland Ranch. Police questioned 30 children who were friends of Jackson, with all stating that Jackson was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> molester. A police officer involved in the investigation told The Los Angeles Times that no evidence (medical, photographic or video) could be found that would support {{a criminal}} filing. The same day the allegations were made public, Jackson began the third leg of his Dangerous World Tour in Bangkok. On August 24, Jackson's investigator held a press conference accusing Chandler of trying to extort $20 million from the singer, although the investigator failed to mention that Jackson had given several counter-offers. On August 25, Jackson's young friends, Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in the same bed as Jackson, but nothing sexual in nature had occurred. Jackson's family soon held a press conference of their own to show support, saying it was their [...] "unequivocal belief" [...] that Michael had been made a victim of a cruel and obvious attempt to take advantage of his fame and wealth. The police then began an investigation into Evan Chandler's prior actions and found that he was $68,400 behind in his child support payments, even though he was well-paid as a dentist. On November 8, police searched the Jackson family home, Hayvenhurst, but found nothing of importance to add to their investigation. According to internal reports from the LA County DCFS at the time, Chandler's story remained largely consistent but dates, places, times and some details were inconsistent. According to reports, the DCFS had investigated Jackson beginning in August 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E

2500|$|In Dune, Lady Jessica is {{pregnant}} when she undergoes the spice agony while among the Fremen; her resulting daughter, Alia, is born a full Reverend Mother, {{the mind of}} an adult in a child's body. She pretends to be a child, but others notice that she is different. The Bene Gesserit are eventually outraged and horrified by Alia's existence, but she is out of their control. Mohiam says, [...] "I've said too much, {{but the fact remains}} that this child who is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> must be destroyed.

2500|$|Another legend {{involves}} {{a group of}} teenagers who, while drunk and/or tripping {{on some sort of}} hallucinogen, find what they perceive to be a gnome (sometimes a dwarf, hobgoblin or smurf), capture it, and bring it home. [...] They sleep off the drug's effects, and the next morning they find out that the [...] "gnome" [...] was really a lost (and very frightened) child. [...] Though the story may be told by some tellers in a negative light, it may also have a positive spin in that the teens become unwitting heroes in finding a missing child whose parents (as well as the police) had been unable to find. [...] According to Snopes.com, the legend had first surfaced in 2004, and as of 2007 the legend's truth status remains undetermined and unverifiable. [...] In some versions of a legend the [...] "gnome" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> but a midget or a person with Down Syndrome; some have even gone as far to say it was a dead baby.|$|E
2500|$|Specific archaeological {{findings}} {{have confirmed that}} pets were mummified. The most famous {{example of this is}} the Theban Queen Makare’s adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops). [...] When her tomb was discovered, there was a small, mummified bundle present at her feet, which was initially believed to be her child. This puzzled archaeologists because Queen Makare was a High Priestess who had taken a serious vow of celibacy. If this had been her child, it would have meant that she had, at some point, broken the oath she had taken as High Priestess, raising a slew of other questions regarding her life. Finally, in 1968, an x-ray was done on the small mummy, and it was determined to be an adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Similarly, Makare’s half sister, Esemkhet, was discovered buried with a mummified pet—she had a mummified gazelle in her tomb. Prince Tuthmosis of the Dynasty XVIII was also buried with a beloved animal—his pet cat was mummified and placed in a stone coffin in his tomb. Another Egyptian, named Hapymen, had his pet dog mummified, wrapped in cloth, and placed at the side of his coffin. At the tomb KV 50 in the Valley of Kings, a mummified dog and baboon were discovered buried together, though the owner is unknown.|$|E
