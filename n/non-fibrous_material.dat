Much {{of the thousands of}} tons of debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers was pulverized concrete, which is known to cause silicosis upon inhalation. The remainder consisted of more than 2,500 contaminants, more specifically: 50% <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>material</b> and construction debris; 40% glass and other fibers; 9.2% cellulose; and 0.8% of the extremely toxic carcinogen asbestos, as well as detectable amounts of lead and mercury. There were also unprecedented levels of dioxins and PAHs from the fires which burned for three months. Many of the dispersed substances (asbestos, crystalline silica, lead, cadmium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are carcinogenic; other substances can trigger kidney, heart, liver and nervous system deterioration. This was well known by the EPA at the time of collapse. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) funded case report performed by Mt Sinai observed carbon nanotubes in dust samples and in the lungs of several 9/11 responders.|$|E

The lung burden of non-fibrous particulate was so pronounced (> 2 µl/lung) that macrophage clearance collapsed and considerable inflammation occured.

A fibre (RCF) with the same composition as the particles accumulated to a similar mass/volume level but had less effect. Amosite fibres accumulated {{more than the other}} test materials investigated, mostly in the interstitial tissue, but produced only a small effect on clearance of labelled particles, however, amosite had the highest effect on cell proliferation.

The negative influence of significant amount of pith, or parenchymatous tissue, present in sugarcane bagasse is discussed. Since this <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>material</b> does not give any desired properties in the pulp and paper, agglomerated boards and polymer productions, it is remarked the importance of its maximum removal. A brief historical review in the development of bagasse depithers and depithing systems is presented in this paper. Further results in the development of depither, named S. M. Caribe by its author, are described. The mechanical performance of first prototypes was evaluated in a test installation where vibration control values and temperatures in the upper and lower rotor bearings were monitored. For comparison it was made a vibrational analysis of other depithers that were in operation. For the technological evaluation the input capacity, the bagasse fiber quality obtained and the influence on the produced paper quality were controlled during two sugar cane crop seasons, as well. The results obtained were superior of those reached by most of depithers currently available in the market...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePlant fibers with nonzero {{microfibril}} angle show no plane reflection symmetries, {{the groups of}} spatial symmetry transformations consisting of rotations only. The spatial point symmetry group of any material made of such fibers is of order which is half {{of the order of}} the symmetry group of the corresponding orthotropic material. However, materials consisting of fibers show similar degeneracies of stiffness eigenvalues as the <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>materials.</b> Stiffness degeneracies appear to be controlled by the integer exponents of dicycle conditions applied on products of vectors generating symmetry groups. It is found that flat orthotropic sheets always retain their planar shape in eigen deformations, whereas those made of fibers with microfibrils do not. Features of the out-of-plane deformations are clarified. Orthotropic material elements experience normal on-axis eigen strains only, whereas fibrous bodies with orthotropic fiber alignment may experience on-axis shear strains as eigen strains.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} quantification methods for binary mixtures containing a new polypropylene/polyamide 6 - based bicomponent fibre, for which a new generic fibre name has been requested to the European Commission. Application of such methods is requested by EU legislation (Directive 96 / 73 /EC) to enable market surveillance regarding the textile composition data on labels that are compulsory. The methodology for quantification of fibre mixtures is usually based either on manual separation or on chemical dissolution methods. In both cases, a sample pre-treatment, able to remove <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>material,</b> is needed. The key experimental parameters {{that need to be}} established for the novel fibre are: its moisture regain in standard atmosphere (agreed allowance), its mass loss due to pre-treatment (b coefficient) and its mass losses in the methods where it is insoluble (d correction factors). Results of this study showed that the b coefficient for the new fibre, using the normal pre-treatment, is equal to 0 %. As expected from the chemical composition and synthetic character of the novel fibre, the experimental value for the agreed allowance was low and equal to 0. 54 %. The new fibre was insoluble in ten out of the 14 dissolution methods tested and the correspondent ten d correction factors were evaluated. Three of them were also validated through a collaborative trial organised at European level following the internationally accepted guideline ISO 5725 - 2 : 1994. The d correction factors obtained throughout the study were in the range of 1. 00 - 1. 01, meaning that the fibre was completely insoluble or at maximum 1 % soluble in the dissolution reagent. Based on the results of this study, laboratories across the EU and beyond have now at their disposal methods to quantify the new fibre in binary mixtures with polyester, elastomultiester, polyamide, chlorofibres, certain acrylic and modacrylic fibres, acetate, triacetate, polylactide, certain cellulose fibres and certain protein fibres.

40|$|MWCNTs have {{excellent}} technological features {{and there is}} rapid growth in MWCNT development and production. However, concerns of asbestos-like toxic effects of certain MWCNTs exist due to their length and fiber-like shape. Therefore, potential adverse biological effects of MWCNTs are investigated in vivo (rat) and in vitro (human peritoneal mesothelial LP 9 /TERT- 1 cells) in a project funded by the BMBF (contract No. 03 X 0109 A). Custom made MWCNTs with different lengths and diameters were synthesized and suspended in artificial lung-like or culture medium by ultrasonic treatment. For both the in vivo and the in vitro experiments, long amosite asbestos served as the positive control and milled MWCNTs and Printex 90 ® were used as <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>material</b> controls. For two in vivo studies, separated MWCNTs were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) in rats (low dose: 1 × 109, high dose: 5 × 109 MWNTs with WHO fiber definition). Cell proliferation in the diaphragmatic peritoneum was investigated as a short-term screening test, 3, 6 and (12) months after i. p. injection, using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry. An i. p. carcinogenicity and a subchronic inhalation study were also initiated with {{the same set of}} MWCNTs. Distribution and size of the MWCNTs were monitored by SEM. In vitro, LP 9 /TERT- 1 cells were incubated with the custom made MWCNTs, Baytubes®, or the respective controls for 24 h. Relative increase in cell count (RICC) was calculated to estimate the direct cytotoxic potential. The i. p. study revealed mesotheliomas and a dose-dependent increase in BrdU-positive-cells in the diaphragmatic peritoneum of rats treated with MWCNT 1 high (length: 7. 9 µm; diam. : 37 nm), MWCNT 2 low/high (length: 10. 2 µm; diam. : 40 nm), and MWCNT 3 low/high (length: 8. 6 µm; diam. : 85 nm). Additionally, MWCNT 2 high, MWCNT 3 low/high, and amosite (length: 14. 0 µm; diam. : 390 nm) treatment caused a significant, dose-dependent thickening of the diaphragmatic peritoneum after 3 and 6 months, compared to the non-fibrous and verhicle controls. In vitro, at 5 µg/cm 2 MWCNT 1, 2, 3, and 3 a (length: 9. 3 µm; diam. : 62 nm) inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell death comparable to amosite. In conclusion, MWCNT tested were cytotoxic in mesothelial cells in vitro, and enhanced cell proliferation in rat diaphragmatic peritoneum and induced mesotheliomas after i. p. application in rats...|$|E
40|$|When {{nanomaterials}} enter biological fluids, {{they are}} immediately covered by biomolecules, particularly proteins, forming the so-called protein corona. The dynamic nature {{and complexity of}} the protein corona can impact upon the biological effects and distribution of nanomaterials with an organism. Therefore, the protein corona {{is an important factor in}} determining the biological impact of any nanomaterials. The protein adsorption pattern is determined by various factors, including the bio-fluids’ protein composition, the nanomaterials’ physicochemical properties, as well as the time and type of exposure. Predominantly, research has focused upon spherical nano-objects, however, due to their ever-increasing potential use within human based applications, and, therefore, heightening and inevitable exposure to the human body, little is known regarding how proteins interact with nanofibers. Therefore, the present review focuses on the current knowledge as to how the geometry of man-made (nano) fibers, carbon nanotubes (in comparison with asbestos fibers), affects their interaction with proteins within biological fluids. Summarizing state-of the art methodologies applied to dissect protein-binding signatures, it is further discussed whether the protein corona composition of fibrous and <b>non-fibrous</b> <b>materials</b> differ, as well as what impact the protein corona has on (nano) fiber uptake, intracellular distribution and their subsequent toxicity...|$|R

We also find that inter alia women, younger, higher income, higher educated, drop-off recycling users, and non-participants in the pilot program {{are willing to pay}} more for a CRP patterned after the pilot program. We also find that if curbside recycling is bundled with more options under a variable pricing scheme for garbage pickup, a large percentage of households would choose a smaller garbage container size. ...|$|R

40|$|Fibers are {{materials}} {{in the form of}} elongated threads. They can possess elastic features that are relevant to the integrity and bonding of cells. These features also give man-made fibers a wide range of applications. The large ratio of length to width (aspect ratio), which defines fibers, strongly influences their physical and chemical properties. This quality gives them a relatively large surface area, which can lead to powerful tensile and absorptive characteristics, which are remarkably different from, and cannot be predicted by study of the <b>non-fibrous</b> parent <b>materials.</b> An example of this is asbestos, where the toxicity of the material is heavily influenced by its structural anatomy. Distinctive chemical processes can take place on fibrous surfaces that may themselves seem to be chemically inert. Certain commonalities result from the distinctive geometry of fibers, and lie behind the apparently great diversity of fiber types and materials. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} contains several {{reports on}} the fine structure of isolated myofibrils (1 - 5). From these {{it is clear that}} the extended fibril is composed, in part, of longitudinally arranged filaments which in the dry state are about 200 /~. thick and which show nodosities and densities arranged at regular intervals of about 400 /~. In the intact fibril these densities are likely to be in perfect phase or register and thus give to the fibril a fine cross-banding quite distinct from the relatively macroscopic striations. There is some evidence (3, 4) that these filaments are arranged along the periphery of the fibril, thus making of it a tubular structure. From electron microscopy the major striations, the A and Z bands, seem to result from concentrations of a <b>non-fibrous,</b> amorphous <b>material.</b> The association, if any, between this and the filaments has not been clarified. In contraction, the major part of the amorphous material within the A band moves into the I and Z band regions. That more attention has not been given the phenomenon is doubtless due to difficulty in controlling contraction of small muscle units and obtaining intermediate stages in the process...|$|R

Their in-depth analyses {{are essential for}} the development of advanced noise control solutions. In this thesis, a package of efficient numerical modeling tools is developed based on the sub-structuring approach, {{in order to deal with}} complex structural-acoustical couplings among various subsystem components in a wide range of applications. A Compound Interface-Patch Transfer Function (CI-PTF) approach is proposed, highlighting its ability in handling mixed separations, such as those composed of rigid or flexible structures and apertures. Typical structural and acoustical subsystems are characterized as a few versatile subsystem modules, serving as the building blocks for constructing complex system configurations. The convergence, accuracy, and efficiency of the developed numerical tools are thoroughly validated. As an important <b>non-fibrous</b> sound absorbing <b>material,</b> micro-perforated panels (MPPs) and their in-situ sound absorption in coupled vibroacoustic systems are investigated. The MPP is modeled as an integral component of the system using the proposed CI-PTF approach. Numerical studies show that the actual sound absorption performance of the MPPs strongly depends on the surrounding environment, which unequivocally demonstrates that MPP cannot be simply considered as a locally reactive element in a complex vibroacoustic environment. For sound transmission control inside a duct, acoustic silencers are considered whose modeling is systematically tackled by the proposed numerical tools. Reactive silencers with rigid internal partitions are studied for their parametric influences and noise attenuation mechanisms. With the introduction of MPPs as dissipative elements, a unit cell treatment is proposed to model the complex side-branch configuration, and investigations reveal the hybrid attenuation mechanism of such device, which combines the reflection and absorption effects. Benefiting from the modular nature of the sub-structuring approach, the size of the perforated hole and the perforation ratio can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving a desired Transmission Loss (TL) within a prescribed frequency range. The calculation accuracy for both reactive and hybrid MPP silencers using the proposed approach have been confirmed with finite element method (FEM) simulations and experiments. For the tuning and optimization of a silencer, the broadband TL performance realized by a number of cascade-connected sub-chambers is investigated. A theoretical basis for the description of the overall system TL is presented. The characteristics of the sub-chambers, along with the understandings of influences of the parameters, provide guidelines for their optimizations, and a desired broadband performance is achieved by connecting sub-chambers with optimized TLs to tackle different frequency regions. Based on the sub-chamber strategy, a multi-level approach for the design, analysis and optimization of acoustic silencers with cascaded sub-chambers is proposed. Through numerical case studies and a retrofitted design of a mining truck muffler, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, which greatly reduces the design variables and computational costs compared with global design and optimization.
