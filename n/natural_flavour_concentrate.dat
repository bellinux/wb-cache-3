40|$|A new {{combination}} of membrane-based processes was studied {{in order to}} produce a <b>natural</b> <b>flavouring</b> <b>concentrate</b> from shrimp cooking juice. The process associates a pre-concentration step by nanofiltration (NF) until a Volume Reduction Ratio (VRR) of 10 and a final concentration by osmotic evaporation (OE). Thanks to NF, the juice was partially concentrated and desalinated, allowing the further OE step to be run in optimal conditions: reduction of the quantity of water to be evaporated and of the production of brine, limitation of the loss of volatile compounds and improvement of sensory acceptability. During OE step run at pilot-scale, a 52 % dry matter concentrate was obtained with aroma loss lower than 35 %. Products were characterised by sensory and chemical analyses all along the process. With sensorial characteristics matching the expectancies, the concentrate could be incorporated at 2. 5 % in food preparations...|$|R

40|$|In the two Higgs doublet model, <b>natural</b> <b>flavour</b> {{conservation}} can {{be achieved}} {{through the use of}} a discrete Z 2 symmetry. A less restrictive condition is the requirement of alignment in the Yukawa sector. So far, alignment has been an anzatz, not rooted in a specific model. In this letter we present a model for alignment, which starts with 2 +N Higgs doublets, with <b>natural</b> <b>flavour</b> conservation imposed by a discrete symmetry. Only two of these scalars couple to the fermions, the other N scalars are in a hidden sector. Assuming that the two scalar doublets coupled to fermions are heavy, their decoupling leads to an effective Yukawa interaction. The latter connects the fermions and the scalars of the hidden sector, and exhibits the same Yukawa coupling matrix for each of the N scalars. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
