Here, we evaluated the density and diversity of <b>non-symbiotic</b> diazotrophic <b>bacteria</b> in soils taken from diverse land use systems (LUS) in Amazonia using nitrogen-free media. A total of 30 soil samples were collected from the following LUS: pristine forest, young secondary forest, old secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture and pasture. Bacterial density was evaluated by the most probable number (MPN) method utilizing N-free semi-solid media with varied compositions (JNFb, NFb, LGI and Fam). Individual isolates were characterized by colony and cellular morphology as well as total protein profiles and nitrogenase activity. Isolate genotypes were determined by partial 16 S rDNA sequences. No typical diazotrophic growth in the JNFb medium was observed. Bacterial densities in the NFb medium {{were higher in the}} agriculture and agroforestry soil samples. In LGI and Fam media, bacterial densities were highest in the pasture soil samples. Overall, 22 isolates with high phenotypic diversity were obtained. Eleven isolates exhibited nitrogenase activity.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of inoculation and co-inoculation of common beans with Rhizobium tropici and Azospirillum brasilense under two irrigation depths. The experiment was carried out in the winter of 2012 and 2013, in Selvíria, state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The experimental design was composed of randomized blocks in split-plot scheme with two irrigation depths in the plots (recommended for common beans and 75 % of the recommended) and five forms of nitrogen (N) supply in the split-plots (control non-inoculated with 40 kg ha- 1 of N in topdressing, 80 kg ha- 1 of N in topdressing, A. brasilense inoculation with 40 kg ha- 1 of N in topdressing, R. tropici inoculation with 40 kg ha- 1 of N in topdressing, and co-inoculation of A. brasilense and R. tropici with 40 kg ha- 1 of N in topdressing) with four repetitions.

40|$|Abstract. Nitrogen {{fixation}} by symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria</b> can be {{a significant}} source of nitrogen in cropping systems. However, contributions from non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation (NSNF) are dependent on available carbon in the soil and environmental conditions (soil moisture and temperature). In Australia, measurements of NSNF {{have been made in the}} field by quantifying nitrogenase activity. These studies have included determinations of the moisture and temperature requirements for NSNF and for crop residue decomposition that supplies carbon to NSNF bacteria. Other studies have determined the N input by NSNF using N budget calculations. These data together with information about carbon supply and environmental conditions were used to estimate potential NSNF in the cropping zones of southern Australia. Using the ArcviewGIS Spatial Analyst (v 3. 1), maps of Australia showing estimates of NSNF in different cropping zones as determined by rainfall and temperature or carbon availability were generated. In Western Australia (represented by Wongan Hills) and South Australia (represented by Avon), where summers are dry, estimates of NSNF were generally low (10 – 15 kg N/ha from January to June) due to limitations of soil moisture. In New South Wales, particularly in the north where summer rainfall patterns develop (represented by Gunnedah), the warm, moist conditions produced higher estimates of NSNF (totaling 32 – 38 kg N/ha from January to June). In this region, the majority of estimated NSNF occurred in January and February leading to the depletion of carbon supplies and reduced NSNF in autumn (March–June).

As a result, the ecological controls of the rate of nitrogen fixation by <b>non-symbiotic</b> nitrogen-fixing <b>bacteria</b> living on decaying leaf litter are poorly understood. The nitrogenase enzyme activity of free-living bacteria in a long-term leaf litter manipulation experiment in a lowland tropical rain forest in Panama was measured. Bacteria growing in plots with artificially doubled standing litter fixed nitrogen, on a per gram of litter basis, at a marginally higher rate than bacteria on control litter plots, indicating that physical or chemical changes associated with increased litter mass encourage N-fixation. There was, however, substantial micro- geographic variation indicating the potential for extremely localized "hot-spots" of N- fixation. In addition, C:N ratio and leaf chemistry may directly influence heterotrophic N- fixation. To investigate this, we measured nitrogenase enzyme activity of bacteria living on leaf litter of four common tree species: Oenocarpus panamanus, Aspidosperma cruenta, Tetragastris panamensis, and Prioria copaifera, N-fixation by bacteria growing on A. cruenta leaves was {{an order of magnitude}} higher than other species. A. cruenta is an evergreen canopy tree with unique alkaloid compounds and extremely long-lived leaves. Elemental analysis of A. cruenta leaves revealed that high C:N ratio, and, specifically, low N levels were driving rates of N-fixation on this species of leaf.

Current evidence suggests that the host’s cellular innate immune system, in the form of macrophage-like hemocytes, helps to mediate host tolerance of V. fischeri. To begin to understand the role of hemocytes in this association, we analyzed these cells by high-throughput 454 transcriptomic and liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analyses. 454 high-throughput sequencing produced 650, 686 reads totaling 279. 9 Mb while LC-MS/MS analyses of circulating hemocytes putatively identified 702 unique proteins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Insertion {{sequences}} (ISs) {{are approximately}} 1 kbp long "jumping" genes found in prokaryotes. ISs encode the protein Transposase, which facilitates the excision and reinsertion of ISs in genomes, making these sequences {{a type of}} class I ("cut-and-paste") Mobile Genetic Elements. ISs are proposed {{to be involved in}} the reductive evolution of symbiotic prokaryotes. Our previous sequencing of the genome of the cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, living in a tight perpetual symbiotic association with a plant (the water fern Azolla), revealed the presence of an eroding genome, with a high number of insertion sequences (ISs) together with an unprecedented large proportion of pseudogenes. To investigate the role of ISs in the reductive evolution of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, and potentially in the formation of pseudogenes, a bioinformatic investigation of the IS identities and positions in 47 cyanobacterial genomes was conducted. To widen the scope, the IS contents were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in 20 other genomes representing both free-living and symbiotic bacteria. RESULTS: Insertion Sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes and were found to transpose short distances from their original location ("local hopping") and pseudogenes were enriched in the vicinity of IS elements. In general, symbiotic organisms showed higher densities of IS elements and pseudogenes than <b>non-symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> A total of 1108 distinct repeated sequences over 500  bp were identified in the 67 genomes investigated. In the genome of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, IS elements were apparent at 970 locations (14. 3 %), with 428 being full-length. Morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large genomes showed higher frequencies of IS elements, irrespective of life style. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent co-location of IS elements and pseudogenes found in prokaryotic genomes implies earlier IS transpositions into genes. As transpositions tend to be local rather than genome wide this likely explains the proximity between IS elements and pseudogenes. These findings suggest that ISs facilitate the reductive evolution in for instance in the symbiotic cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708 and in other obligate prokaryotic symbionts...|$|E

The results showed that all locations observed were less suitable for soybean development, indicated by low pH values (4. 35 – 6. 00), nutrient contents (N < 0. 1 % and C-organic < 2. 0 %), and low soil microbial populations.

Similarities between the strategies adopted by pathogenic and symbiotic Rhizobiales have been described, as well as high variability related to events of horizontal gene transfer. Although {{it is well known that}} chromosomal rearrangements, mutations and horizontal gene transfer influence the dynamics of bacterial genomes, in Rhizobiales, the scenario that determine pathogenic or symbiotic lifestyle are not clear and there are very few studies of comparative genomic between these classes of prokaryotic microorganisms trying to delineate the evolutionary characterization of symbiosis and pathogenesis. Results <b>Non-symbiotic</b> nitrogen-fixing <b>bacteria</b> and bacteria involved in bioremediation closer to symbionts and pathogens in study may assist in the origin and ancestry genes and the gene flow occurring in Rhizobiales. The genomic comparisons of 19 species of Rhizobiales, including nitrogen-fixing, bioremediators and pathogens resulted in 33 common clusters to biological nitrogen fixation and pathogenesis, 15 clusters exclusive to all nitrogen-fixing bacteria and bacteria involved in bioremediation, 13 clusters found in only some nitrogen-fixing and bioremediation bacteria, 01 cluster exclusive to some symbionts, and 01 cluster found only in some pathogens analyzed. In BBH performed to all strains studied, 77 common genes were obtained, 17 of which were related to biological nitrogen fixation and pathogenesis. Phylogenetic reconstructions for Fix, Nif, Nod, Vir, and Trb showed possible horizontal gene transfer events, grouping species of different phenotypes. Conclusions The presence of symbiotic and virulence genes in both pathogens and symbionts does not seem to be the only determinant factor for lifestyle evolution in these microorganisms, although they may act in common stages of host infection. The phylogenetic analysis for many distinct operons involved in these processes emphasizes the relevance of horizontal gene transfer events in the symbiotic and pathogenic similarity. </p...|$|R

40|$|The squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, form {{a highly}} {{specific}} relationship {{that is used}} to study how beneficial bacteria interact with animal hosts. Even though the light organ of E. scolopes is exposed to the outside marine environment, it can only be colonized by V. fischeri. For this reason E. scolopes must carefully control the light organ microenvironment. One mechanism that the squid utilizes to regulate this symbiosis is a daily expulsion of V. fischeri from the light organ. The squid expels the symbiont, in addition to some host tissue, as a thick exudate that was collected and analyzed by high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics. As expected, many of the V. fischeri proteins identified exemplify the lifestyle of the symbiont in the light organ including quorum sensing and the management of oxidative stress. The function of one of the V. fischeri proteins identified, a bacterial immunoglobulin-like surface protein, was further characterized by creating a mutant deficient in this protein. Host proteins within the light organ also highlighted the oxidative microenvironment, but proteins associated with innate immunity were prominent as well. The innate immune response, including macrophage-like hemocytes, of E. scolopes is considered to provide an additional regulatory component to this host-microbe relationship. In the absence of adaptive immunity, the hemocytes still have the ability to differentiate V. fischeri from <b>non-symbiotic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> To get {{a better understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms involved in determining host-symbiont specificity, two quantitative proteomic techniques (iTRAQ and label-free spectral counting) were used to characterize the influence of light organ colonization on the squid hemocytes. These studies demonstrated that the presence of V. fischeri in the light organ can alter the composition of the hemocyte proteome by affecting proteins related to the cytoskeleton, adhesion, and innate immunity. Further characterization of symbiont recognition by the host involved the analysis of the transcript distribution and protein localization of two carbohydrate-binding galectins. These studies represent the first application of a variety of MS-based proteomic techniques to the squid-vibrio symbiosis.

40|$|Biserrula pelecinus is a {{productive}} pasture legume with potential for replenishing soil fertility and providing quality livestock feed in Southern Australia. The experience with growing B. pelecinus in Australia suggests {{an opportunity to}} evaluate this legume in Ethiopia, due to its relevance to low-input farming systems such as those practiced in Ethiopia. However, the success of B. pelecinus is dependent upon using effective, competitive, and genetically stable inoculum strains of root nodule bacteria (mesorhizobia). Mesorhizobium strains isolated from the Mediterranean region were previously reported to be effective on B. pelecinus in Australian soils. Subsequently, {{it was discovered that}} these strains transferred genes required for symbiosis with B. pelecinus (contained on a “symbiosis island’ in the chromosome) to <b>non-symbiotic</b> soil <b>bacteria.</b> This transfer converted the recipient soil bacteria into symbionts that were less effective in N 2 -fixation than the original inoculant. This study investigated selection of effective, stable inoculum strains for use with B. pelecinus in Ethiopian soils. Genetically diverse and effective mesorhizobial strains of B. pelecinus were shown to be present in Ethiopian and Eritrean soils. These strains were shown to belong to the genus Mesorhizobium and carry highly mobile symbiosis islands, with a novel integration hotspot (ser-tRNA). In vitro, the transfer of the symbiosis island from these strains to a non-symbiotic recipient strain resulted in novel bacteria with a poorly effective phenotype, except for one highly effective strain. By deleting a relaxase gene, which is involved in the conjugative transfer of the symbiosis island, a more stable strain was created containing an immobile symbiosis island. The study highlights the presence of taxonomically and symbiotically distinct B. pelecinus-nodulating Mesorhizobium strains in East African soils. In these Mesorhizobium strains, the rate of symbiosis island transfer was as high as 3 x 10 - 3 in vitro. It is suggested that island transfer has {{a significant role in the}} rapid evolution of poorly effective strains. Further, it is likely that this transfer contributes to one of the most intractable problems compromising N 2 -fixation in agricultural systems - that of poorly effective but competitive background rhizobia. In this study, the management of symbiosis island transfer through inactivation of the relaxase gene without affecting the symbiotic phenotype was found to be a viable approach for tackling this problem...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{extensive}} development of drug resistance in pathogens against the available antibiotic arsenal, antimicrobial resistance {{is now an}} emerging major threat to public healthcare. Anti-virulence drugs are {{a new type of}} therapeutic agent aiming at virulence factors rather than killing the pathogen, thus providing less selective pressure for evolution of resistance. One promising example of this therapeutic concept targets bacterial quorum sensing (QS), because QS controls many virulence factors responsible for bacterial infections. Marine sponges and their associated bacteria are considered a still untapped source for unique chemical leads {{with a wide range of}} biological activities. In the present study, we screened extracts of fourteen sponge species collected from the Red and Mediterranean Sea for their quorum-quenching (QQ) potential. Half of the species showed QQ activity in at least 2 out of 3 replicates. Six out of the 14 species were selected for bacteria isolation, to test for QQ activity also in isolates, which, once cultured, represent an unlimited source of compounds. We show that approximately 20 % of the isolates showed QQ activity based on a Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 screen, and that the presence or absence of QQ activity in a sponge extract did not co-relate with the abundance of isolates with the same activity from the same sponge species. This can be explained by the unknown source of QQ compounds in sponge-holobionts (host or symbionts), and further by the possible <b>non-symbiotic</b> nature of <b>bacteria</b> isolated from sponges. The potential symbiotic nature of the isolates showing QQ activity was tested according to the distribution and abundance of taxonomically close bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in a dataset including 97 sponge species and 178 environmental samples (i. e., seawater, freshwater and marine sediments). Most isolates were found not to be enriched in sponges, and may simply have been trapped in the filtration channels of the sponge at the time of collection. Our results highlight potential for QQ-bioactive lead molecules for anti-virulence therapy both from sponges and the bacteria isolated thereof, independently on the symbiotic nature of the latter...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at Kao-Changum Royal Project, Rachaburi Province, Nakhornayok Province and Kalasin Province which the ecotypes of vetiver grass had grown in Tha Yang, Ongkharak and Roi-Et saline variant series respectively, comparing to non-planting vetiver grass area. One year of planted vetiver grass, the results were indicated significantly increase soil fertility which included soil microbial activities, chemical and physical properties change in 0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm of soil depth. For suitable growing vetiver ecotypes Phrarachatan, Sri Lanka, Surat Thani and Songkhla 3 in the normal soil as Tha Yang series, the dense root system produced some organic substances to stimulate <b>non-symbiotic</b> nitrogen fixing <b>bacteria</b> in rhizospheres which increased from 1. 00 and 1. 06 to 3. 16 - 4. 17 and 2. 81 - 4. 59 log no. /gm of soil. Phosphate solubilizing microorganisms also changed from 1. 04 and 1. 47 to 2. 17 - 3. 84 and 3. 00 - 3. 63 log no. /gm of soil, and phosphatase activity in soil increased from 10. 75 and 11. 75 to 17. 79 - 20. 58 and 18. 16 - 21. 40 milli unit/gm of soil. Nevertheless chlamydospore number of endo-mycorrhizal fungi were increased from 1. 1 and 4 to 511 and 18 - 39 spore/ 100 gm soil and also appeared the dense arbuscule inside the fibrous root cells of vetiver which absorb and accumulate of plant nutrients, especially phosphorus indicated from 2. 07 and 2. 39 to 4. 29 - 5. 02 and 3. 18 - 6. 11 ppm. Furthermore decomposed leaves residue and dead cells of vetiver fibrous root had effect on soil organic matter content from 0. 58 and 0. 42 to 1. 01 - 1. 03 and 0. 92 - 0. 93 percent. In acid sulfate soil as Ongkharak series, vetiver growth 6 ecotypes: Phrarachathan, Surat Thani, South India, Sri Lanka, Ratchaburi and Fiji had specially effected to decrease quantitive iron from 91 and 107 to 56 - 75 and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{management}} of eco-system in Pakistan {{is the main}} source of environmental degradation, the major being soil and water. Massive use of agro-chemicals involves the risk of interfering with the quality of eco-system, dangerous from fertility and pollution point of viewTo cope with the situation, and to overcome environmental harzards within our own resources, the research on neem cake (a product left-after oil extraction from neem seeds) was initiated to find its property as a fertilizer. General observation revealed that neem cake is a good nitrogen source; when experiments were conducted in-vitro. Paddy soil supplemented with neem cake (n-hexane extracted) at the rate of 1 % and 5 % (W/W) produced two and four times higher ammonia nitrogen than un-supplemented soil, respectively after 10 days of application. However nitrogen release was delayed if the soil was supplemented with the ground neem cake. The expeller extracted neem cake gave a slight and slow formation of ammonia nitrogen after 10 days with 5 % & 10 % amendment, neem seed powder after 15 days & the water extracted neem cake after 30 days, whereas no response of ammonia nitrogen production was observed with neem oil, amendment. The studies on the effect of both type of neem cakes (n-hexane extracted & expeller extracted) on symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> nitrogen fixing <b>bacteria</b> have revealed that it had n-adverse effect on its growth with the exception that n-hexan extracted neem cake stimulated the growth of certain species of Rhizobium-in vitro. Investigations regarding the effect on the inhibition degradation of insecticides (Carbofuran 3 G, Thiodan 35 EC and Basudin 10 G) revealed that neem cake amendment alongwith insecticide fortification increased the persistence of all the three insecticides from their normal are responsible for the degradation of these insecticides. The natural balance of some micro-organisms is disturbed by the addition of neem cake which helps in avoiding degradation of these insecticides, ultimate the persistent percentage increases. Keeping in view of the various aspects studies in vitro, neem cake if used in field will not have any adverse effect in the environment. The utilization of this product must be made aware to the farmers as neem tree is a native of Indo-Pak Sub-Continent. Use of neem products in agriculture will be a step toweads self-help and minimize environmental pollution due to the indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers. It is better to switch over to organic matter as fertilizer which is over to organic matter as fertilizer which is the basis of green revolutio...|$|R
