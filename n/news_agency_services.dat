The specific domains news publishing and news distribution are facing significant performance requirements in information handling while transferring {{hundreds of thousands of}} articles daily to their auditorium. Additionally, the business application of electronic publishing technologies in the specific news domain is confronted with the fact that European business today is highly segmented and widely unrecognized beyond national borders, mainly due to language differences and economical gaps. This paper discusses a project that integrates <b>news</b> <b>agency</b> <b>services</b> from existing European organizations supported by University research in the are of electronic publishing, distributed information management and AI in order to form an intelligent multinational and multilingual business news publishing and distribution network, based on Web Services and a peer-to-peer inter-agency communication network.

Contents are distributed in any language the provider chooses and the vector space model has been utilized to provide easy access to related and most relevant business news articles within a multilingual and multinational context...|$|E

In 1925, The Press Association (PA) of Great Britain acquired a majority interest in Reuters and became full owner some years later. During the world wars, The Guardian reported that Reuters [...] "came {{under pressure from}} the British government to serve national interests. In 1941 Reuters deflected the pressure by restructuring itself as a private company." [...] The new owners formed the Reuters Trust. [...] In 1941, the PA sold half of Reuters to the Newspaper Proprieters' Association, and co-ownership was expanded in 1947 to associations that represented daily newspapers in New Zealand and Australia. The Reuters Trust Principles were put in place to maintain the company's independence.

In addition, we identify that the heightened status of <b>news</b> <b>agency</b> copy, coupled with the "not wrong for long" approach which permeates online news, is a combination which increases the potential for error and inaccuracy.

25|$|Many newspapers, besides {{employing}} journalists {{on their}} own payrolls, also subscribe to <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> (wire <b>services)</b> (such as the Associated Press, Reuters, or Agence France-Presse), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the content to the various newspapers. This {{is a way to}} avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55million copies). The late 2000s–early 2010s global recession, combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses. Worldwide annual revenue approached $100billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.|$|R

The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and economic globalization. [...] "It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of the Eurovision News Exchange (EVN) as a source for foreign TV news {{coverage}} for the Danish and Norwegian public service broadcasters: DR and NRK. With the theoretical approach of political economy, I have sought to expose existing structures in international news distribution that are influencing the broadcasters’ coverage and the EVN’s distinct features within the field. A central point of the analysis has been the particular logics of the EVN, as a cooperation of member broadcasters based on public service principles, opposed to the commercial logics of the major TV <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> The investigation showed that the EVN supplies a fair share of the sources of the investigated broadcasters’ foreign news coverage, but also that this share does not represent a factual alternative to the share of the commercial <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> Certain tendencies in what kinds of themes and geographical areas the broadcasters use the two image suppliers for in their coverage are apparent, and the implications of the broadcasters’ approach to the different sources are discussed. The public service background of the EVN, and its contributing members, was examined with regard to the content in the supplied news material, and a further possible democratizing role of the cooperation in foreign TV news coverage. The analysis found that the role the EVN has to the broadcasters’ foreign news coverage depends on the individual broadcasters’ financial situations. The cooperation also emerged as a necessary supplement to the commercial <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> The public <b>service</b> background further proved to both strengthen and weaken the EVN, and a partly unused potential of holding a democratizing factor in the international news flow, was largely connected to this dynamic...|$|R

Different cases give evidence that these differences exist in internationally operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> We argue with two claims accessing the contemporary situation: a) we rely on the perspective of classic analysis of the sender and receiver(s) of a message in a communication model and b) special interest groups as connected segments of subnetworks {{in the mass media}} industry.
