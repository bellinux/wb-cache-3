30|$|In a {{study that}} more closely resembles the current one, Antman (2012) {{examines}} the <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> of siblings to their families of origin for the case of Mexico. The results reveal that an increase in sibling <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to their parents leads {{to an increase in}} the <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> of the individual sibling migrant. However, only a few studies have investigated remittance motives for the case of Kenya. For example, Hoddinott (1992, 1994) finds evidence that in western Kenya, parents can use inheritable assets to influence the level of assistance that they receive from their sons.|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits {{political}} economy {{effects on the}} rate of growth. Taxes are growth enhancing if they finance public services but reduce growth when used for redistribution. Special interests may affect the policymaking by creating a bias in voter perceptions {{as well as by}} <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to politicians. It is shown that a complementary between information provision and <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> to politicians is possible. This implies that when <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> are present rent-seeking is less probable to be a hindrance to growth. This could serve as one explanation to recent empirical findings suggesting a positive relation between inequality and growth...|$|R

40|$|Through {{the use of}} the {{standard}} tools of poverty analysis, this paper attempts to firstly measure the minimum <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> required from the state to eliminate poverty in the society. Secondly, we measure the absolute and relative household poverty impact of instituting a universal income grant, set at different monthly values. Finally, a brief costing exercise of such a grant is undertaken. The minimum <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> simulations are very useful insights into the scale and nature of the poverty challenge in South Africa. The universal income grant numbers testify to the importance of balancing the undoubted need for poverty alleviation as against the pressure on the fiscus. Such interventions are likely to induce.
