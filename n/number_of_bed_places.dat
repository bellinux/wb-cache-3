40|$|The {{accomodation}} in Lodz Voivodeship in refernce to its significant tourist {{resources as}} well as economic potential (business tourism) is not sufficient, both - analyzing the number of tourist accommodation establishments and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> as well. Providing the analyzis of varoius factors and indicators Lodz Voivodeship closes the top ten of the 16 th polish voivodeships, which is highly insufficient. In 2012, in the region existed 373 tourist accommodation establishents, providing 23237 bed places. Hotels constituted over a third of the accomodation (103 accommodation establishments/ 9963 bed places). Lodz as the capital of the vivodeship, despite remarkable tourism, economic and business potential, while analyzing the structure of accommodation stands out from other comparable in population city centers in Poland. Although hospitality in the region overcame unfavorable trends associated with global economic crisis, which afflicted also tourism-related industries (especially hospitality), it seems controversial to invest in accommodation – the rate of use of bed places is hardly over 30 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of Rural Development Program (RDP) measures focusing on tourism have on the growth of tourism and on the economy in rural areas. We first explored tourism in NUT 2 regions in the EU with a spatial data analyses and then we applied spatial econometric analyses on tourism where we {{take into account the}} RDP spending on the measures that encourage tourism. For the spatial regression analyses, we use the indicators of the CMEF framework. The data were collected from Eurostat. The spending on the RDP measure 313 encouragement of tourism is not uniformly distributed over the NUTS 2 regions in the EU. The spatial analyses of tourism measured by the number of nights spent by non-residents showed the presence of spatial dependencies in tourism. Based on the spatial dependency tests of the classical regression model, a spatial error model is estimated. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> positively affected the total number of night spent by non-residents. RDP spending on encouraging tourism did not {{have a significant impact on}} tourism.

40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to make an {{empirical}} investigation on necessary hotel accommodation. Moreover, the research attempts to calculate optimum hotel accommodation supply in terms <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hotel <b>bed</b> <b>places</b> and bedrooms. In this line, the case of Macedonia is examined by employing standard formulas and by calculating several alternative specifications. The research covers the period 2000 - 2012 and addresses total tourist arrivals. The results point to discrepancy between calculated optimal hotel capacity and the current ones, posing some relevant recommendations for capacity enlargement. Additionally, the research urges the need for introducing significant efforts for enhancing the up-to-date modest tourism development in Macedonia...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Although {{mental health}} {{reforms in the}} 20 th century were {{characterized}} by deinstitutionalization, previous research suggested {{a new era of}} reinstitutionalization in six European countries between 1990 and 2002. This study aimed to establish whether there has been a trend in Europe toward more institutionalized care since 2002. Methods: Primary data sources were used to collect data on conventional inpatient beds, involuntary hospital admissions, forensic <b>beds,</b> <b>places</b> in residential care and supervised and supported housing, and the prison population in nine countries: Austria, Denmark, England, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. Results: Between 2002 and 2006 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> conventional psychiatric inpatient beds tended to fall and changes in involuntary admissions were inconsistent. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> forensic <b>beds,</b> <b>places</b> in supervised and supported housing, and the prison population increased in most, but not all, of the countries studied. Conclusions: The findings suggest an ongoing although not consistent trend toward increasing provision of institutionalized mental health care across Europe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} decades mental health {{services}} in most industrialised countries have been characterised by de-institutionalisation and different kinds of redistribution of patients. This article will examine the historical trends in Norway over the period 1950 - 2007, identify the patterns of change in service settings and discuss why the mental health services have been dramatically transformed in less than sixty years. Methods: The presentation of the trends in the Norwegian mental health services and {{the outline of the}} major changes in the patterns of inpatient care over the period 1950 - 2007 is founded on five indicators: The average inpatient population, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> discharges during a year, the average length <b>of</b> stay, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> or <b>places,</b> and the occupancy rate (average inpatient population/ beds). Data are reported by institutional setting. Multiple sources of data are used. In some cases it has been necessary to interpolate data due to missing data. Results: New categories of institutions were established and closed during the 57 years period. De-hospitalisation started in Norway in the early 1970 s, de-institutionalisation in general 15 years later.

Methods The presentation of the trends in the Norwegian mental health services and {{the outline of the}} major changes in the patterns of inpatient care over the period 1950 - 2007 is founded on five indicators: The average inpatient population, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> discharges during a year, the average length <b>of</b> stay, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> or <b>places,</b> and the occupancy rate (average inpatient population/beds). Data are reported by institutional setting. Multiple sources of data are used. In some cases it has been necessary to interpolate data due to missing data. Results New categories of institutions were established and closed during the 57 years period. De-hospitalisation started in Norway in the early 1970 s, de-institutionalisation in general 15 years later. Six distinct periods are identified: The asylum period (- 1955), institutionalisation and trans-institutionalisation (1955 - 65), stabilisation and onset of de-hospitalisation (1965 - 75), de-hospitalisation (1975 - 87), from nursing homes to community-based services (1988 - 98), and the national mental health program (1999 - 2007). There has been a significant reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> and in the average in-patient population. The average length of stay in institutions has been continuously reduced since 1955. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients actually treated in psychiatric institutions has increased significantly. Accessibility, quality of care and treatment for most patients has improved during the period. The mental health system in Norway has recently been evaluated as better than the systems in USA, England and Canada. Conclusions De-institutionalisation means fewer beds but not fewer patients treated, neither in institutions in general nor in psychiatric hospitals. The periods represent different kinds of de-, trans-, and even re-institutionalisation. Expansion of the welfare state, increased professional focus on active treatment and increased focus on patients' preferences are the factors that best explain de-institutionalisation in Norway. </p...|$|R

The aims of the survey were: (a) to assess the reaction of elderly residents in LA Homes to their present environment and to interpret the practical implications this may have for planners and architects; (b) to explore the attitudes of old people to residential care and identify consumer preferences, or aspirations for environmental improvement; (c) to investigate attitudes and experiences of staff and {{to look at the}} impact of physical environment of the home on working life; (d) to determine the way in which quality of life may be influenced by a range of factors relating to the physical environment, institutional environment and resident mix (e) to determine the importance of locational factors. An associated qualitative dataset, Consumer Study in Old People's Homes : Four Homes Studied in Detail, is available via Qualidata at the University of Essex. Main Topics : The main variables studied were: (a) Physical environment, e. g. building features, floors, facilities, room sizes, etc. (b) Resident characteristics, e. g. age, sex, mental/physical state, length of stay, reasons for admission, residents' preferences for aspects of the physical environment, measures of well-being, resident views on staff. (c) Staff characteristics, e. g. age, sex, position, reasons for taking job, qualifications, job satisfaction, measures of well-being, preferences for aspects of physical environment, working practice, routines. Nine files of data are held. In addition to the description of the physical environment (2 files) and the resident and staff interviews, others include: (i) Interviewer schedule (questions concerning home atmosphere, answered by interviews; (ii) Population and (iii) Sample files containing information from 872 homes (Population) and 100 homes (Sample) in 29 Local Authority areas (data on <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds,</b> daycare <b>places,</b> short-stay group living, location, resident characteristics, regime measures; (iv) Resident listing containing data concerning characteristics of all residents in the 100 homes; (v) Staff listings with characteristics of all senior and care staff in the sample of 100 homes. Measurement Scales Adjustment to ageing, worry and dissatisfaction since coming to the home, mental/physical state was measured using Crichton Royal Behavioural Rating Scale. (Wilkin, D. and Jolley, D., Behavioural problems among old people in geriatric wards, psychogeriatric wards and residential homes, 1976 - 78, University Hospital of South Manchester Psychogeriatric Unit Research Section Research Report 1). Other Scales used were: (i) a modified version of Abrams' Adjustment to Ageing Scale (Abrams, M., Beyond three score and ten published by Age Concern, England, 1978); (ii) measures of anxiety after Srole, L. et al in Mental health in the metropolis : the midtown Manhattan study (New York: McGraw Hill, 1962); (iii) Bradburn's Affect Balance Scale from Bradburn, N.
