25|$|Sociologist David Gibson has {{explored}} the ExComm's deliberations from a discourse-analytic, or conversation-analytic, perspective. He argues that inasmuch as Kennedy's decisions were {{shaped by the}} ExComm's deliberations, they hinged on the group <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dangers that awaited around every corner—such as the danger that the U.S. would have to bomb operational nuclear missiles were the blockade to fail to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles.|$|E

This was brought out by Datta in his book Kathamrata when he stated : [...] "He (Ramakrishna) did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> renouncer disciples {{in the presence of the}} householder disciples, and he did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> householder disciples in the presence of the renouncer disciples. But sometimes he would criticize both groups when both were present. They would chastise one another. In this way there was a feeling of hostility (virabhava) between these two groups." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the names of the hijackers were released. There was some confusion regarding who Mohamed Atta was, and cases of mistaken identity. Initially, Mohamed Atta's identity was confused with that of a native Jordanian, Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta, who bombed an Israeli bus in the West Bank in 1986, killing one and severely injuring three. Mahmoud Atta was 14 years older than Atta. Mahmoud Atta, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was subsequently deported from Venezuela to the United States, extradited to Israel, tried and sentenced to life in prison. The Israeli Supreme Court later overturned his extradition and set him free. After 9/11, there also were reports stating that Mohamed Atta had attended International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. The Washington Post quoted a United States Air Force official who explained, [...] "discrepancies in their biographical data, such as birth dates 20 years off, indicate we are probably <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same people." ...|$|E

The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church.

They can express their opinions, but they may {{have nothing to do with}} this ministry... This does not mean that I ask you to stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church... I am <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul’s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Thallus, of whom {{very little}} is known, and none of whose {{writings}} survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which Eusebius referred. Julius Africanus, writing c 221, links a reference in the third book of the History to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts {{in three of the}} Gospels [...] It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain. The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49-52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89-92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112-109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD. [...] All we know is Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion of Jesus at all.|$|E

But I have taken the trouble to find out, from unquestioned sources, the truth about the Consolidated Tractions Company--I shall not go into the details at length--they are doubtless familiar to you. I know that the legal genius of Mr. Langmaid, one of my vestry, made possible the organization of the company, and thereby evaded the plain spirit of the law of the state. I know that one branch line was bought for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and capitalized for three millions, and that most of the others were scandalously over-capitalized. I know that while the coming transaction was still a secret, you and other, gentlemen connected with the matter bought up large interests in other lines, which you proceeded to lease to yourselves at guaranteed dividends which these lines do not earn. I know that the first large dividend was paid out of capital. And the stock which you sold to poor Garvin was so hopelessly watered that it never could have been anything but worthless. If, in spite of these facts, you do not deem yourself responsible for the misery which has been caused, if your conscience is now clear, it is my duty to tell you that there is a higher bar of justice." ...|$|E
