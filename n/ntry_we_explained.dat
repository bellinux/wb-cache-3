30|$|There exist {{two types}} of feature-based methods in the literature: filter-based and BA-based methods. In this section, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> both methods and provide the comparison. Even {{though some of the}} methods were {{proposed}} before 2010, <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> them here because they can be considered as fundamental frameworks for other methods.|$|R
30|$|We {{discuss these}} {{patterns}} in three points. First, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{in what sense}} the fit is actually surprisingly good. Second, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the selection mechanism in our model {{that leads to the}} simulated wage pattern. Third, we discuss how introducing fixed effects could provide a better fit—but at a cost.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the two Wai-Menyuk models of birefringence in periodically spun fibers, and {{we show that}} the differential group delay differs significantly for the two models when the spin period approaches or exceeds the fiber beat length. When the fiber correlation length is large, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> this difference quantitatively, and <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> it qualitatively for any fiber correlation length...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a written}} {{version of a}} series of lectures aimed at {{graduate}} students in particle theory/string theory/particle experiment familiar with the basics of the Standard Model. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> the many reasons for the interest in flavour physics. We describe flavour physics and the related CP violation within the Standard Model, and explain how the B-factories proved that the Kobayashi- Maskawa mechanism dominates the CP violation that is observed in meson decays. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> the implications of flavour physics for new physics. We emphasize the “new physics flavour puzzle”. As an explicit example, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> how the recent measurements ofD 0 −D 0 mixing constrain the supersymmetric flavour structure. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> how the ATLAS and CMS experiments can solve the new physics flavour puzzle and perhaps shed light on the standard model flavour puzzle. Finally, we describe various interpretations of the neutrino flavour data and their impact on flavour models...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> linear {{secret sharing}} schemes, in {{particular}} multiplicative threshold linear secret sharing schemes, over fields and rings in a compact and concise way. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> two characterisations of linear secret sharing schemes, and in particular, we characterise threshold linear secret sharing schemes. We develop an algorithm to generate all multiplicative $(t+ 1) $-out-of-$n$ threshold linear secret sharing schemes over a field $mathbb{Z}sb{p}$. For the ring $mathbb{Z}sb{ 2 sp{ 32 }}$, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> {{the generation of}} secret sharing schemes for threshold access structures and prove the non-existence of $(t+ 1) $-out-of-$n$ threshold linear secret sharing schemes with $n > t+ 1 $. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{survey work}} by the author and Ralf Meyer on equivariant KKtheory. Duality {{plays a key role}} in our approach. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> duality, and how duality {{naturally}} gives rise to an invariant called the Lefschetz map. With the objective of computing the Lefschetz map in explicit terms, we construct a topological model of equivariant KK-theory by way of a theory of correspondences, building on ideas of Paul Baum, Alain Connes and Georges Skandalis in the 1980 ’s. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> when the topological and analytic models agree, and give an example of equivariant correspondences related to the Borel-Bott-Weil theorem. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the relationship between the Lefschetz map and a global homological invariant using traces on appropriate K-theory groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin based on the notion of Airy structure, which we introduce in the paper. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> why Airy structure is a more fundamental object than the one of the spectral curve. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> how the concept of quantization of Airy structure leads naturally to the formulas of topological recursion as well as their generalizations. The notion of spectral curve is also considered in a more general framework of Poisson surfaces endowed with foliation. <b>We</b> <b>explain</b> how the deformation theory of spectral curves is related to Airy structures. Few other topics (e. g. the Holomorphic Anomaly Equation) are also discussed from the general point of view of Airy structures...|$|R

In Automatic verification steps, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the automatic verification steps. The figure shows OpenStack, but OpenStack {{is not a}} precondition of the proposed method. In Test case extraction method, <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the process of selecting automatic test cases, which is a core process of the verification steps.|$|R
