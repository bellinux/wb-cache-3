Saul Zaentz also had an ongoing dispute with <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> Cinema over profits from The Lord of the Rings films.

He also served as CMO for Time Warner and President of AOL - Interactive Marketing, TV, and Ad Sales.

5|$|Having a {{majority}} shareholding, the GPK {{was able to}} stall any plans to proceed with construction of the Hurlet line, but on 9 October a special GPK Shareholders' Meeting reviewed the financial commitments made by their Board in the frenzied days of 1845 and 1846, when support to numerous <b>new</b> <b>lines</b> had been committed; the meeting left the directors in no doubt as to their disapproval.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} daily ridership of {{the whole}} network of all phases, ater the compleiton of Phase-II, is 4 million passengers. The communication based train control (CBTC) is being used which enables trains to run at a short headway of 90 seconds. Keeping this in mind and other constraints, DMRC changed its decision to build 9-car-long stations for <b>new</b> <b>lines</b> and instead opting for shorter stations which can accommodate 6-car trains.|$|E
5|$|The future {{expansion}} outlined in Law 670 sees {{the addition of}} three <b>new</b> <b>lines.</b> These lines' routes have already {{been approved by the}} Legislature of the City in Law 670. 39.3km will be added to the network, expanding it to about 97km in total length and providing several stations with various interchanges. This will also create new north-south routes, resulting in an appropriate network to avoid the city centre.|$|E

5|$|The network {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the}} early decades of the 20th century; by 1944 its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s expansion resumed at a quicker pace, and four <b>new</b> <b>lines</b> were planned for the network. Despite this, the network's expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 <b>new</b> <b>lines,</b> F, G and I; and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the I line is postponed for future expansion, plus several other route amendments.|$|E

5|$|There are 22 {{stations}} in the Copenhagen Metro, a driverless rapid transit system serving Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Tårnby in Denmark. Nine of these metro stations are underground, twelve are elevated, and one is street-level. Christianshavn Station offers transfer between the system's two metro lines (M1 and M2), which share track between Vanløse and Christianshavn stations. From Christianshavn, M1 branches south traveling to Vestamager Station, while M2 heads southeast to Lufthavnen Station, which serves Copenhagen Airport. Flintholm, Nørreport and Vanløse stations offer transfer to the S-train, the city's other rapid transit system which the Copenhagen Metro was built to supplement. Transfer from the Copenhagen Metro to regional trains is possible at Lufthavnen, Nørreport and Ørestad stations. The City Circle Line, which is under construction and {{scheduled to open in}} 2019, is planned to have 17 stations, with transfer between the current and <b>new</b> <b>lines</b> at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv stations. The <b>new</b> <b>lines</b> will have a stop at Copenhagen Central Station (København H), the largest train station in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Though most of {{the routes}} {{proposed}} over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the proposals for the Second Avenue Subway.

The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other <b>new</b> <b>lines</b> proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, {{a number}} of {{expansions}} {{were made to the}} tram network. The disused line from Storo via the depot at Grefsen to Sinsen opened for revenue traffic in 1993.

For these <b>new</b> <b>lines,</b> 32 SL95 low-floor trams were delivered from 1996 to 2004, replacing all but the SL79 units. The voltage was increased from 600 to 750volts on 4 June 2000, once all non-articulated trams had been retired.|$|E
