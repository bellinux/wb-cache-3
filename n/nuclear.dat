5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with <b>nuclear</b> power today are much the same as in the 1970s. <b>Nuclear</b> reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing {{solution to the problem of}} long-lived radioactive waste. <b>Nuclear</b> weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian <b>nuclear</b> operations. The alternatives to <b>nuclear</b> power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|In <b>nuclear</b> energy studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and {{in other}} areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of <b>nuclear</b> weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with <b>nuclear</b> test ban treaties, and to confirm <b>nuclear</b> tests by states such as North Korea.|$|E
5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of <b>nuclear</b> weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on <b>nuclear</b> policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 <b>Nuclear</b> Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US <b>Nuclear</b> posture review the number of US <b>nuclear</b> weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War <b>nuclear</b> sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance <b>nuclear</b> policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nuclear</b> {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of <b>nuclear</b> testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American <b>nuclear</b> efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on <b>nuclear</b> policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on <b>nuclear</b> power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any <b>nuclear</b> accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing <b>nuclear</b> power.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nuclear</b> weapon designs could {{intentionally}} incorporate 59Co, some {{of which}} would be activated in a <b>nuclear</b> explosion to produce 60Co. The 60Co, dispersed as <b>nuclear</b> fallout, creates what is sometimes called a cobalt bomb.|$|E
5|$|Operation Crossroads {{was a pair}} of <b>nuclear</b> weapon tests {{conducted}} by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. They were the first <b>nuclear</b> weapon tests since Trinity in July 1945, and the first detonations of <b>nuclear</b> devices since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. The purpose of the tests was to investigate the effect of <b>nuclear</b> weapons on warships.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian <b>nuclear</b> agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed <b>nuclear</b> weapons at the time and was not party to the <b>Nuclear</b> Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the <b>Nuclear</b> Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's <b>nuclear</b> technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto <b>nuclear</b> weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian <b>nuclear</b> energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland made {{detailed}} {{plans to}} acquire and test <b>nuclear</b> weapons during the Cold War. Less {{than two weeks}} after the <b>nuclear</b> bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building <b>nuclear</b> weapons, and continued its military <b>nuclear</b> program for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <b>Nuclear</b> Weapons. Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nuclear</b> envelope's {{structure}} {{is determined by}} a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the <b>nuclear</b> lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other <b>nuclear</b> components along the inner surface of the nucleus. The <b>nuclear</b> lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the <b>nuclear</b> pores and in {{the disintegration of the}} <b>nuclear</b> envelope during mitosis and its reassembly {{at the end of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|When the Cold War {{ended in}} 1991, {{there were more}} than 500 US <b>nuclear</b> weapons in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were Ground Launched Cruise Missiles, and {{approximately}} 100 were B57 <b>nuclear</b> depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155mm <b>nuclear</b> artillery shells. The cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991 {{under the terms of the}} 1987 Intermediate-Range <b>Nuclear</b> Forces Treaty. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range <b>nuclear</b> weapons. The last US warheads, including the B57s and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American <b>nuclear</b> weapons then remaining in the UK were 110 or so B61 <b>nuclear</b> bombs stored at RAF Lakenheath for USAF F-15E Strike Eagles, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British WE.177 <b>nuclear</b> bombs used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British <b>nuclear</b> weapons were British warheads on the Trident missiles of the s.|$|E
5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with <b>nuclear</b> explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received {{the endorsement of the}} Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any <b>nuclear</b> weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have <b>nuclear</b> weapons, from a US <b>nuclear</b> sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for <b>nuclear</b> energy development, a strong <b>nuclear</b> arsenal, and a vigorous <b>nuclear</b> testing program, he had helped to develop <b>nuclear</b> reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a <b>nuclear</b> meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{describes}} how a North Korean underground <b>nuclear</b> test on 25 May 2009 was detected {{and the source}} located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting <b>nuclear</b> explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive <b>Nuclear</b> Test Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Australia has no <b>nuclear</b> power {{stations}} {{and the former}} Gillard Labor government was opposed to <b>nuclear</b> power for Australia. Australia has three operating uranium mines at Olympic Dam (Roxby) and Beverley – both in South Australia's north – and at Ranger in the Northern Territory. Australia has no <b>nuclear</b> weapons. Australia operates a research reactor which produces medical radioisotopes at OPAL.|$|E
5|$|Australia's only <b>nuclear</b> energy {{education}} facility, {{the former}} School of <b>Nuclear</b> Engineering at the University of New South Wales, closed in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Constrain {{worldwide}} <b>nuclear</b> proliferation by vastly limiting a country's {{ability to}} make <b>nuclear</b> advancements that only testing can ensure.|$|E
5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield <b>Nuclear</b> Power Plant from the <b>Nuclear</b> Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a <b>nuclear</b> meltdown even though there was no <b>nuclear</b> material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in <b>nuclear</b> physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss <b>nuclear</b> bomb. Leading <b>nuclear</b> physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the <b>Nuclear</b> Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building <b>nuclear</b> weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{provided}} {{universities and colleges}} with grants to acquire small <b>nuclear</b> reactors for research programs. The University of Washington began <b>nuclear</b> engineering classes {{as part of the}} College of Engineering in 1953, and formed a Department of <b>Nuclear</b> Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from Boeing and the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The <b>Nuclear</b> Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a <b>nuclear</b> reactor to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent <b>nuclear</b> reactor on the campus, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium {{is important not}} only for maintaining the <b>nuclear</b> chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first <b>nuclear</b> reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for <b>nuclear</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. <b>nuclear</b> bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed <b>nuclear</b> materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in <b>nuclear</b> weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for <b>nuclear</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|For Sarah's <b>nuclear</b> {{nightmare}} scene, Robert and Dennis Skotak of 4-Ward Production {{constructed a}} cityscape of Los Angeles using large-scale miniature buildings and realistic roads and vehicles. The pair, after having studied actual footages of <b>nuclear</b> tests, then simulated the <b>nuclear</b> blast by using air mortars to knock over the cityscape, including the intricately built buildings.|$|E
5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, the <b>nuclear</b> {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located}} in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the <b>nuclear</b> envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their <b>nuclear</b> envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Rabi {{returned}} to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm {{the properties of the}} atomic nucleus. His techniques for using <b>nuclear</b> magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and <b>nuclear</b> spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. <b>Nuclear</b> magnetic resonance became an important tool for <b>nuclear</b> physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} <b>nuclear</b> reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors, with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American <b>Nuclear</b> Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary <b>nuclear</b> reactors. The main LWR types are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial <b>nuclear</b> power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's <b>Nuclear</b> Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the French {{physicist}} Francis Perrin discovered fifteen {{ancient and}} no longer active natural <b>nuclear</b> fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained <b>nuclear</b> fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the <b>nuclear</b> waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent <b>nuclear</b> fuel at the Yucca Mountain <b>nuclear</b> waste repository.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 the Ikata <b>Nuclear</b> Power Plant began {{operation}} as {{the first}} <b>nuclear</b> power plant {{on the island of}} Shikoku.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 the <b>Nuclear</b> Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive (NIREX) was {{established}} {{with responsibility for}} disposing of long-lived <b>nuclear</b> waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal 200–1,000 meters underground. NIREX developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site. A <b>Nuclear</b> Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve British <b>Nuclear</b> Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield reprocessing plant.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base failed its <b>nuclear</b> surety {{inspection}}. The 90th Missile Wing at F. E. Warren Air Force Base failed its <b>nuclear</b> surety inspection {{one month}} later. In November 2009 at Kirtland Air Force Base the 377th Air Base Wing, commanded by Colonel Michael S. Duvall, and 498th <b>Nuclear</b> Systems Wing, commanded by Colonel Richard M. Stuckey, failed their <b>nuclear</b> surety inspections.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, in {{response}} to a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the <b>Nuclear</b> Energy Institute, the US court of appeals ruled that <b>nuclear</b> utilities may stop paying into the <b>nuclear</b> waste recovery fund until either the DOE follows the <b>Nuclear</b> Waste Policy Act, which designates Yucca Mountain as the repository, or Congress changes the law. The fee ended May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In animal cells, two {{networks}} of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The <b>nuclear</b> lamina forms an organized meshwork {{on the internal}} face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the <b>nuclear</b> envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and <b>nuclear</b> pores.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Bradbury {{branched}} out, {{constructing the}} Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility {{to develop the}} laboratory's role in <b>nuclear</b> science. During the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on Project Rover, developing the <b>Nuclear</b> Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of <b>nuclear</b> rocket propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these <b>nuclear</b> tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> tests, and became an advocate of underground <b>nuclear</b> testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 <b>nuclear</b> artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest <b>nuclear</b> artillery, and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have <b>nuclear</b> shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of <b>nuclear</b> weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its <b>nuclear</b> artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the US <b>nuclear</b> artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Hatfield co-sponsored <b>nuclear</b> freeze {{legislation}} with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, {{as well as}} co-authoring {{a book on the}} topic. He also {{advocated for}} the closure of the N-Reactor at the Hanford <b>Nuclear</b> Site in the 1980s, though he was a supporter of <b>nuclear</b> fusion programs. The N-Reactor was used for producing weapons grade plutonium while producing electricity.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of China, <b>nuclear</b> {{waste storage}} {{facility}} was {{built at the}} Southern tip of Orchid Island in Taitung County, offshore of Taiwan Island. The facility was built in 1982 and it is {{owned and operated by}} Taipower. The facility receives <b>nuclear</b> waste from Taipower's current three <b>nuclear</b> power plants. However, due to the strong resistance from local community in the island, the <b>nuclear</b> waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves.|$|E
