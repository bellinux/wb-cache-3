5|$|Arriving at Mauritius on 29 April 1836, Darwin was {{impressed}} by the civilised prosperity of the French colony which had come under British rule. He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor-general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on the island to see an elevated coral plain. By then FitzRoy was writing the official <b>Narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin’s diary he proposed incorporating it into the account, a suggestion Darwin discussed with his family.|$|E

5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} examines different {{processes of}} constructing, conveying, and <b>the</b> personal assimilation <b>of</b> Israeli and Palestinian <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. I depart from other scholars who employ the term "national narratives" and use "narratives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation" {{as a way}} to emphasize both the national and literary components of these national stories. <b>Narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation are constructed by a wide variety of nation people and are not simply narrated by the state for its own purposes, as is often implied by scholars. <b>Narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation are the many political, economic, social and religious stories that nations tell about themselves. By incorporating narrative theory and tracing <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> construction, I argue that <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation act similarly to what we consider to be more conventional <b>narratives.</b> <b>Narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation are aesthetic stories that are suspenseful, driven forward by a plot, and have a moral to the story. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> this dissertation traces in the Israeli media how the Israeli nation narrates the Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian population ratio. This "demography" narrative is so fundamental that if Jewish-Israelis were to comprise less than sixty percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total population in Israel, the Israeli nation would collapse as it is presently constructed. <b>The</b> next part <b>of</b> my dissertation reveals a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power dynamics between Israelis and Palestinians that are instrumental in shaping the narrative construction process at the individual level in an Israeli Hebrew immersion course called an ulpan. The main argument put forward is that a history of unequal power relations between Palestinians and Israelis has led to a silencing <b>of</b> Palestinians during <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> construction process in the classroom. Once an everyday performance <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation begins, newly formed narratives can emerge.; These narratives provide belief structures for participants that can impact their personal beliefs about <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Finally, I consider how social suffering experiences in Palestine can impact Palestinian and Israeli <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Most importantly, Israel must narrate Palestinian social suffering experiences in a way that reinforces the idea that it has a moral army...|$|R

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E
5|$|Ianto Jones is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BBC television series Torchwood, played by Welsh actor Gareth David-Lloyd. A series regular, Ianto appears in every episode of the programme's first three seasons, {{as well as two}} crossover episodes of Torchwoods parent show, Doctor Who. Additionally, Ianto appears in Expanded Universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks, comic books and radio plays. Within the <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, Ianto begins as general support officer for Torchwood Three, a team of alien hunters stationed in Cardiff, and develops into an active field agent. Initially the regular character with the least screen time, Ianto's role expanded in response to growing cult appeal.|$|E

5|$|In {{promoting}} the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted {{her down to}} earth qualities and quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction noted that the character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose—including two National Television Awards—and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the battle, the fighting around Isurava has come to form {{a key part of}} the Australian <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign. The Japanese were victorious in capturing Isurava, but Australian accounts in the early years after the war characterised the battle as a successful delaying action by a heavily outnumbered force that inflicted more casualties than it sustained, highlighting the bravery of Australian troops in an epic and desperate action of national survival. In this regard, the Battle of Isurava has come to form {{a key part of the}} Anzac legend, although recent accounts have re-examined the battle. As the size of the Japanese force committed to the fighting has been re-evaluated, the magnitude of the Australian defensive feat has also been reinterpreted. Recent analysis, while acknowledging the individual bravery of both Australian and Japanese soldiers, highlights tactical deficiencies on both sides, and now characterises the battle as one in which Australian forces were able to withdraw largely due to tactical errors from the Japanese commanders.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village.

Ruining the scenic <b>narrative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E
