5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for the diversification of venom {{is thought to be}} the duplication of gene coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom. These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include 3FTx, ancestrally a neurotransmitter found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin that binds and blocks acetylcholine receptors. Another example is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with inflammatory processes in <b>normal</b> <b>tissue,</b> which has evolved into venom capable of triggering lipase activity and tissue destruction. The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene duplication events, often associated with the origin of new snake species. Non-allelic homologous recombination (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not alleles) has been proposed as the mechanism of duplication of PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution. These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes. Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.|$|E

40|$|Background: Deregulation of {{biological}} pathways {{has been shown}} to be involved in the turmorigenesis of a variety of cancers. The co-regulation of pathways in tumor and <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> has not been studied in a systematic manner. Results: In this study we propose a novel statistic named AR-score (average rank based score) to measure pathway activities based on microarray gene expression profiles. We calculate and compare the AR-scores of pathways in microarray datasets containing expression profiles for a wide range of cancer types as well as the corresponding <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> We find that many pathways undergo significant activity changes in tumors with respect to <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> AR-scores for a small subset of pathways are capable of distinguishing tumor from <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> or classifying tumor subtypes. In <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> many pathways are highly correlated in their activities, whereas their correlations reduce significantly in tumors and cancer cell lines. The co-expression of genes in the same pathways was also significantly perturbed in tumors. Conclusions: The co-regulation of genes in the same pathways and co-regulation of different pathways are significantly perturbed in tumors versus <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> Our method provides a useful tool for better understanding the mechanistic changes in tumors, which can also be used for exploring other biological problems...|$|R
40|$|Effective local {{hyperthermia}} {{for cancer}} requires selective elevation of intratumoral temperature without overheating of surrounding <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> Temperature elevation {{depends upon the}} balance between absorbed power density, which heats the treated tissue, and blood perfusion, which cools it. Selectivity {{can be achieved by}} manipulations of vascular physiology to increase blood cooling of <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> or to decrease blood cooling of tumor tissue. Creation of a favorable normal-to-tumor blood flow ratio is possible because the small blood vessels supplying most tumors are structurally and functionally different from the microvasculature of <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> <b>Normal</b> arterioles dilate in heated tissues to raise local blood flow; whereas tumor vessels generally do not. This difference in vascular responsiveness provides a target for selective drug action that can be exploited to enhance local heat therapy of tumors. Vasodilator drugs, in particular, have profound effects upon the distribution of blood flow between tumor and adjacent <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> Dilation of <b>normal</b> arterioles improves blood flow in <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> and may also shunt blood away from the tumors. These effects have been demonstrated in small animals, in large animals, and in humans to varying degrees. Further clinical exploitation of the microvascular differences between tumors and adjacent <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> may lead to improved effectiveness of hyperthermia therapy for a variety of tumor types...|$|R

25|$|Corneal {{transplant}} surgery {{may be difficult}} due to the peripheral thinning of the cornea, even with large and off-center grafts. Therefore, surgery is usually reserved for patients that do not tolerate contact lenses. Several different surgical approaches may be taken, and no one approach is currently established as the standard. Examples of surgical procedures used for PMD include: wedge resection, lamellar crescentic resection, penetrating keratoplasty, lamellar keratoplasty, epikeratoplasty and intracorneal segments. Transplantation of the entire thickness of the cornea (penetrating keratoplasty) may be performed if there is enough <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> present. However, {{if there is not}} enough <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> present, then attaching the graft is difficult.|$|E

25|$|All {{scarring}} {{is composed}} of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but {{the composition of the}} scar tissue, compared to the <b>normal</b> <b>tissue,</b> is different. Scar tissue also lacks elasticity unlike <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> which distributes fiber elasticity. Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and keloid scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.|$|E
25|$|Often, the {{multiple}} genetic changes {{that result in}} cancer may take many years to accumulate. During this time, the biological behavior of the pre-malignant cells slowly change from the properties of normal cells to cancer-like properties. Pre-malignant tissue can have a distinctive appearance under the microscope. Among the distinguishing traits are an increased number of dividing cells, variation in nuclear size and shape, variation in cell size and shape, loss of specialized cell features, and loss of <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> organization. Dysplasia is an abnormal type of excessive cell proliferation characterized by loss of <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> arrangement and cell structure in pre-malignant cells. These early neoplastic changes must be distinguished from hyperplasia, a reversible increase in cell division caused by an external stimulus, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation.|$|E

A pharmacologically important aspect of the contraction-reducing properties of ingested salvinorinA on gut tissue is that it is only pharmacologically active on inflamed and not <b>normal</b> <b>tissue,</b> thus reducing possible side-effects.|$|E
40|$|Using DNA {{microarray}} and {{cluster analysis}} of expressed genes in a cloned line (M 1 -t-p 53) of myeloid leukemic cells, we have analyzed {{the expression of}} genes that are preferentially expressed in different <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> Clustering of 547 highly expressed genes in these leukemic cells showed 38 genes preferentially expressed in <b>normal</b> hematopoietic <b>tissues</b> and 122 other genes preferentially expressed in different <b>normal</b> non-hematopoietic <b>tissues</b> including neuronal tissues, muscle, liver and testis. We have also analyzed the genes whose expression in the leukemic cells changed after activation of wild-type p 53 and treatment with the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL- 6) or the calcium mobilizer thapsigargin (TG). Out of 620 such genes in the leukemic cells that were differentially expressed in <b>normal</b> <b>tissues,</b> clustering showed 80 genes that were preferentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues and 132 genes in different <b>normal</b> non-hematopietic <b>tissues</b> that also included neuronal tissues, muscle, liver and testis. Activation of p 53 and treatment with IL- 6 or TG induced different changes in the genes preferentially expressed in these <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> These myeloid leukemic cells thus express genes that are expressed in <b>normal</b> non-hematopoietic <b>tissues,</b> and various treatments can reprogram these cells to induce other such non-hematopoietic genes. The results indicate that these leukemic cells share with normal hematopoietic stem cells the plasticity of differentiation to different cell types. It is suggested that this reprogramming to induce in malignant cells genes that are expressed in different <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> may be of clinical value in therapy...|$|R

25|$|In {{their early}} stages, soft-tissue sarcomas {{usually do not}} cause symptoms. Because soft tissue is {{relatively}} elastic, tumors can grow rather large, pushing aside <b>normal</b> <b>tissue,</b> before they are felt or cause any problems.
