5|$|Lt Col Newman {{aboard the}} MGB <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> landed, {{but he was}} one of the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.|$|E
5|$|The Faraway Trees Dame Slap, {{who made}} regular use of {{corporal}} punishment, {{was changed to}} Dame Snap who no longer did so, {{and the names of}} Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea that girls <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is provoking, dear," [...] said Mrs. Wilkinson to her, [...] "and I am {{sure you}} will think it very uncivil, but Arthur went off to Oxford yesterday. And it was uncivil. I am sure he <b>needs</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> gone at this very moment." ...|$|R

25|$|Tragedy {{deals with}} affairs of state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a {{work to be}} tragic, it <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a tragic ending.|$|E

50|$|On May 25, 1991, Billboard premiered the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. The {{criteria}} for this chart were albums {{that were more}} than 18 months old and had fallen below position 100 on the Billboard 200. An album <b>needed</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> charted on the Billboard 200 at all to qualify for catalog status.|$|R
25|$|Junius J. Johnson left Colorado {{after the}} Cripple Creek strike to avoid arrest. He <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done so: Mass arrests of miners did occur, but only four strikers were ever tried {{and all were}} pardoned.|$|E
25|$|NP-hard {{problems}} are those {{at least as}} hard as NP problems, i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP, i.e., they <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> solutions verifiable in polynomial time.|$|E
25|$|Verdi <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> worried: Otellos debut {{proved to}} be a resounding success. The audience's enthusiasm for Verdi was shown by the 20 curtain calls that he took {{at the end of the}} opera. Further stagings of Otello soon {{followed}} at leading theatres throughout Europe and America.|$|E
60|$|EDGAR. A {{struggle}} {{like this}} finds out the weak spots in everybody. Any child knows that. If it hadn't been for this cut-throat policy, she <b>need</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> died like this; {{and there would}} n't be all this misery that any one who is n't a fool can see is going on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] asked Libby, {{in quite}} a {{different}} tone. If she recognized the difference, she was meekly far from resenting it; he, however, must have wished to repair his blunder. [...] "I think you <b>need</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> given up the case to him. I think you're too conscientious about it." ...|$|R

25|$|He was the {{founding}} {{president of the}} Transaction Society, whose Transaction Publisher has been an international publisher of scholarly monographs, including academic monographs that <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been viewed as profitable. He was {{the founding}} editor of Society, which published articles on sociology, politics, and social criticism. It has been purchased by Springer.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{analysis}} happens in some metric space; {{the most commonly}} used are the real line, the complex plane, Euclidean space, other vector spaces, and the integers. Examples {{of analysis}} without a metric include measure theory (which describes size rather than distance) and functional analysis (which studies topological vector spaces that <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any sense of distance).|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, young Earth creationist Robert V. Gentry {{proposed}} that radiohaloes in certain granites represented {{evidence for the}} Earth being created instantaneously rather than gradually. This idea has been criticized by physicists and geologists on many grounds including that the rocks Gentry studied were not primordial and that the radionuclides in question <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been in the rocks initially.|$|E
60|$|I {{shall not}} trouble the world any farther {{with an answer}} to the rest of your books: The books are public to the world: let men read and judge. And <b>had</b> it <b>not</b> been for your endeavouring to stigmatize me with reproach and scandal, a thing that doth not become you, I <b>needed</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> given you two lines in answer.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have very}} good eyes, Miss Gertrude," [...] said Mr. Brand. She {{perceived}} that he meant something; but {{for a long time}} past Mr. Brand had constantly meant something, and she had almost got used to it. She felt, however, that what he meant had now a renewed power to disturb her, to perplex and agitate her. He walked beside her in silence for a moment, and then he added, [...] "I have had no trouble in seeing that you are beginning to avoid me. But perhaps," [...] he went on, [...] "one <b>need</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> had very good eyes to see that." ...|$|R
25|$|So, what Arrow's theorem really {{shows is}} that any majority-wins electoral system is a non-trivial game, and that game theory {{should be used to}} predict the outcome of most voting mechanisms. This could be seen as a {{discouraging}} result, because a game <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> efficient equilibria; e.g., a ballot could result in an alternative nobody really wanted in the first place, yet everybody voted for.|$|E
25|$|Weak {{reliance}} is {{not required}} where the authority failed to apply the general policy {{at the time to}} the individual case at hand. This exception is prompted by the overriding imperative of equality. Thus, the applicant <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had detailed knowledge or the existence of the policy in order for a legitimate expectation to arise where the public authority had departed from the existing policy in deciding the individual case.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of Test matches, the winner is the team that wins the most matches. Test series can be drawn, with both sides having {{the same number of}} wins (since match draws are a {{distinct}} possibility with Test cricket; a series <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> all games on record coming to a decision). However, in the Ashes (the series played between England and Australia), the Ashes only change hands if the holder clearly loses; the Ashes remain with the current holder if the series is drawn.|$|E
50|$|Of course, a {{polyphase}} matrix {{can have}} any size, it <b>need</b> <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> square shape. That is, the principle scales well to any filterbanks, multiwavelets, wavelet transforms based on fractional refinements.|$|R
50|$|A tragedy {{does not}} {{necessarily}} involve massive death. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, {{may be seen as}} a tragedy. The person <b>need</b> <b>not</b> necessarily <b>have</b> been famous before death.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you did {{not find}} it so!" [...] cried his hostess. [...] "It {{was a matter of}} course, perhaps, that Mr. Leavenworth, who seems to be going about Europe with the sole view of picking up {{furniture}} for his 'home,' as he calls it, should think Miss Blanchard a very handsome piece; {{but it was not a}} matter of course--or it <b>need</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> been--that she should be willing to become a sort of superior table-ornament. She would have accepted you if you had tried." ...|$|R
25|$|Sites often possess {{significance}} for their potential to yield {{information in the}} future, though they {{are added to the}} Register under all four of the criteria for inclusion. A sites <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> actual physical remains if it marks the location of a prehistoric or historic event, or if there were no buildings or structures present {{at the time of the}} events marked by the site. Site determination requires careful evaluation when the location of prehistoric or historic events cannot be conclusively determined.|$|E
25|$|Such {{evidence}} {{has come from}} two areas: amino acid sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> identical amino acid sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several codons (DNA triplets) that code for the same amino acid. Thus, if two species use the same codon {{at the same place}} to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for a recent common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{four other}} applicants, CTL {{submitted}} their licence {{application to the}} Australian Broadcasting Control Board in April 1959. The company went public in September of the same year, on the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney, offering 100,000 shares which were immediately oversubscribed, ending up with a total subscribed capital of A£300,000 (A$600,000). The two key shareholders in CTL made an agreement with all other shareholders that all shares were to be bought back {{in the event that}} they were unsuccessful in their licence bid— they <b>need</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> worried, since after a hearing of considerable length, the ABCB decided to grant CTL the licence in November 1960. The callsign for the station was to be CTC and the new service was to transmit on VHF channel 7.|$|E

60|$|I {{dismissed}} {{my old man}} here, {{and stayed}} incognito {{for three or four}} days in Colchester, and then took a passage in a waggon, because I would not venture being seen in the Harwich coaches. But I <b>needed</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> used so much caution, for there was nobody in Harwich but the woman of the house could have known me; nor was it rational to think that she, considering the hurry she was in, and that she never saw me but once, and that by candlelight, should have ever discovered me.|$|R

In this case, they can therefore also {{be considered as a}} form of investment.|$|R
