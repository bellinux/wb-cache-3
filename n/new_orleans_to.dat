5|$|In {{their first}} trip to a bowl {{sponsored}} by the newly formed Bowl Championship Series—which had replaced the Bowl Alliance—the No. 2 Hokies returned to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> face Bobby Bowden's No. 1 1999 Florida State Seminoles football team for the national championship.

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort Wayne, and connected to the Wabash River. This new canal made water transport possible from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Lake Erie on an internal route rather than sailing around {{the whole of the}} Eastern United States and entering through Canada. Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north where the state came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E
5|$|The year 1955 saw further {{changes to}} the {{division}} and more changes of assignment for subordinate elements. On 1 January 1955, the 291st Regiment was again assigned to the 75th Infantry Division from the 95th and was subsequently inactivated on 31 January 1955. On 30 January, the 377th Regiment was reassigned to the 95th from the 75th and its headquarters moved from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Tulsa, Oklahoma. The same date saw the relocation of the 379th Regimental headquarters from Hot Springs, Arkansas {{where it had been}} since 1947, to Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the Yorktown Sesquicentennial {{celebrations}} in October 1931, marking the 150th anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown. She embarked President Herbert Hoover and his entourage on 17 October, and {{took them to the}} exposition, and returned them to Annapolis on 19–20 October. She then went into drydock for an extensive refit in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which lasted until January 1932. During this time, she was under the command of George Landenberger. Arkansas was transferred to the Pacific Fleet after completing the refit; while en route, she stopped in <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Mardi Gras celebration. She operated off the west coast through early 1934, at which point she was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the Training Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Between 1899 and 1902, four Manchester {{ships and}} their crews were requisitioned by the United Kingdom {{government}} to transport troops, horses, and supplies to South Africa during the Boer War and its aftermath. Collecting points for horses and mules included Galveston and New Orleans (USA) and Buenos Aires and Montevideo in South America. Manchester Port made its second voyage to the Cape in 1900, then continued to Australia to bring {{troops to the}} conflict. On the first voyage after her return to ML, in January 1903, the first Manchester Merchant was lost while on passage from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Manchester. A serious fire developed in her cotton cargo, and she was scuttled in Dingle Bay {{on the west coast}} of Ireland to douse the flames, but subsequently broke up in bad weather.|$|E
5|$|From 1722 to 1724, brief armed {{conflicts}} between the Natchez and French were settled through negotiations between Louisiana governor Bienville and Natchez war chief Tattooed Serpent. In 1723, Bienville had been informed that some Natchez had harassed villagers, and he razed the Natchez village of White Apple and enslaved several villagers, {{only to discover that}} the alleged harassment had been faked by the colonists to frame the Natchez. One of the later skirmishes in 1724 consisted of the murder of a Natchez chief's son by a colonist, to which the Natchez responded by killing another Frenchman named Guenot. Bienville then sent French soldiers from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> attack the Natchez at their fields and settlements, and the Natchez surrendered. Their plea for peace was met following the execution of one of their chiefs by the French.|$|E
5|$|His {{funeral was}} {{one of the largest in}} the South. Davis was first entombed at the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. In 1893, Mrs. Davis decided to have his remains reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. After the remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly {{organized}} Louisiana Historical Association, with many mourners passing by the casket, including Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. The body was placed on a Louisville and Nashville Railroad car and transported to Richmond, Virginia. A continuous cortège, day and night, accompanied his body from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Richmond. He is interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.|$|E

5|$|In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks {{replaced}} Butler {{in command}} at New Orleans. Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow {{by refusing to}} repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to return to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> {{take part in the}} planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed following Hurricane Katrina {{because of the}} devastation caused by the storm {{and the collapse of}} the levees. Many of the exteriors were set to be shot in New Orleans, including a key sequence involving the Canal Street Ferry across the Mississippi River. After the city was reopened, the cast and crew returned to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> continue filming. Some scenes of the post-Katrina devastation were worked into the plot, including those in the Lower 9th Ward; additionally, evidence of Katrina's impact on the city was worked into the script.Deja Vu starts production in New Orleans|work= USA Today|date= February 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-19|quote= |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-02-02-deja-vu_x.htm}} The filming crew spent two weeks filming a scene at the Four Mile Bayou in Morgan City, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Spain had, since 1763, {{controlled}} the lands {{west of the}} Mississippi River, Spanish Louisiana, plus New Orleans on its east bank. Great Britain, between 1763 and 1783, {{controlled the}} lands east of the Mississippi, British Florida, north from the Gulf of Mexico. Spain gained possession of British Florida south of 31° N and claimed the rest of itnorth to 32° 22′ (the junction of the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers). Thereafter, Spain attempted to slow the migration of American settlers into the region, and to lure those already there to secede from the United States. Toward this end, in 1784 the Spanish closed <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> American goods coming down the Mississippi, which was the only viable outlet for the goods produced by many American settlers, and also began selling weapons to the Indian tribes in the Yazoo.|$|E

5|$|Such {{restrictions}} dated back {{to colonial}} times, and were {{found throughout the}} United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North {{and later in the}} South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public accommodations and public transportation.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore {{also charged}} the paratroopers to {{straighten}} out the evacuation situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> participate in Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.|$|E
5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E
