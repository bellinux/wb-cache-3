40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> in contemporary society. The thesis focuses particularly on grasping this phenomenon by three important narratologists (Tomaševskij, Schmid, Doležel). The aim of this thesis is the analysis and comparison of their models, the evaluation of their approaches and the identification of their benefits to understanding the <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction.</b> I focus on the more general features of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction,</b> which {{can be applied to}} any type of media. The subtopics of the thesis are presentation of theoretical concepts on which these models are being drawn, and the significance of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> in our everyday lives. The paper will also try to point out some shortcomings in the overall approach of this narratologists and to emphasize the need to apply also other approaches in order to understand {{the phenomenon of}} <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to show the {{mechanisms}} intrinsic to <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> that explain the pervasiveness, until recently rarely acknowledged, of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> in organizational life and manage-ment education. Our hasic hypothesis is that the key for understanding that perva-siveness is the role of the faculty of imagination in hoth <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> and organizational action. The central part of the paper ex-amines how <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> is hoth the result of the faculty of imagination and a way of developing imagination for action, the sort of imagination that, as the last section poses, is specific to manage-ment. <b>Narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> and postmodernism The very close connection hetween narrative and postmodemism may not appear to he immediately evident. Narrative, defined hy Ricoeur (1984) as "the discourse of a narrator recounting the discourse of the characters, " arises from the natural human need to give meaning to things. Because it allows the constitution of an identity, it is, in fact, the very condition of possihility of individual and social existenc...|$|R

40|$|Dr Seuss's children's story The Lorax is {{introduced}} {{as a novel method}} to teach management ethics within management education. The use of narrative literature for organisational study is examined. It {{is suggested that}} narrative literature can provide non-traditional cases for organisational studies. The 'case' is analysed using an ethical decision-making framework. As part of this analysis a number of theoretically based ethical issues are discussed. These illustrate the range and depth of ethical issues that can be raised by such a simple narrative. It is concluded that although The Lorax is not a novel, it contains many of the features of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> which make it very apt for management education. Arguments for the legitimisation of the use of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction</b> in conjunction with traditional cases for management education are presented.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the interdependency between politics, ideology, and <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction.</b> First, I offer a brief survey of important {{ways in which the}} notions of ideology and politics have been conceptualized. I then go on to suggest that a Foucaultian notion of discourse {{is one of the most}} powerful critical tools for the analysis of ideology and politics, and perhaps the one most suitable for linking the two concepts to the realm of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction.</b> While I agree that ideology and politics should never be seen as entirely separate domains, I also propose that we must maintain some distinction between them if we want to use the terms productively in a critical analysis of fictional narratives. Consequently, I suggest that the opposition between politics and ideology can be seen as analogous to the utterance-grammar distinction; while politics is concerned with individual, socially and historically localized instance of power struggles, ideology refers to an entire "underlying" system of such moves for power. Building on these theoretical premises, the article concludes with a discussion of hegemonic and/or marginal discourses, hopefully providing the reader with the sense that a clearer distinction between politics and ideology leads to more precise and exciting interpretations of <b>narrative</b> <b>fiction...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{introduces}} a post-Meadian concept useful for contemporary ethnography. Emergent ideal types capture the imaginary (that {{which is not}} bound to space and time coordinates) in the doing ethnography and making empirical claims (the empirical is considered that which is limited to space and time coordinates). She uses a heuristic device, grounded <b>narrative</b> <b>fictions,</b> as one way of depicting the imaginary for ethnographic audiences. The exploration draws on the ethnography of a kindergarten/Grade 1 class. The author does not use many scholarly references. Instead, she tries to develop two innovations to ethnographic analysis (emergent ideal types and grounded <b>narrative</b> <b>fictions)</b> from within an ethnographic example. She tries in this thought piece to explicate the linguistic mechanisms through which ethnographers draw on the imaginary to link empirical patterns with interpretive analyses...|$|R
