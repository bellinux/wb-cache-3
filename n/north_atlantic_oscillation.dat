5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>oscillation</b> is an {{atmospheric}} phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>oscillation</b> events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times.

5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation,</b> which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} {{exceptional}} activity. A strong El Niño observed in 2009 rapidly transitioned into a strong La Niña by mid-summer 2010, projecting anomalously low vertical wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean. Ocean temperatures reached record levels across the basin, averaging at 0.82°C above the 1981–2010 average. Not only did ocean temperatures surpass 2005 {{to break the}} record overall, averaged water temperatures across the Main Development Region (MDR) of the Atlantic set monthly records from February to October 2010. This was aided by a strongly negative <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation</b> that contributed to weaker trade winds and thus anomalous warming of ocean temperatures {{in the months leading}} up to the hurricane season. Lower sea level pressures were prevalent throughout much of the season, trailing only 1955 for the lowest average values across the MDR during the August to October period. In spite of the high number of tropical cyclones, mid-level dry air dominated the tropical Atlantic throughout the peak of the season, perhaps hindering the season from being even more active.|$|E
5|$|On December7, 2011, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), {{a public}} {{consortium}} consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast predicting an above-average hurricane season. In its report, TSR noted that tropical cyclone activity could be about 49% above the 1950–2010 average, with 14.1 (±4.2) tropical storms, 6.7 (±3.0) hurricanes, and 3.3 (±1.6) major hurricanes anticipated, and a cumulative ACE index of 117 (±58). Later that month on December21, Weather Services International (WSI) issued an extended-range forecast predicting a near average hurricane season. In its forecast, WSI {{noted that a}} cooler <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation</b> not seen in a decade, combined with weakening La Niña, {{would result in a}} near-average season with 12named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. They also predicted a near-average probability of a hurricane landfall, with a slightly elevated chance on the Gulf Coast of the United States and a slightly reduced chance along the East Coast of the United States. On April 4, 2012, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their updated forecast for the season, calling for a below-normal season due to an increased chance for the development of an El Niño during the season. In April 2012, TSR issued their update forecast for the season, slightly revising down their predictions as well.|$|E
40|$|Climatic infl uences {{on animal}} populations, {{mediated}} {{by changes in}} condition-dependent survival or reproduction, have long intrigued ecologists. We analyzed links between winter <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillations</b> (NAO), a large scale climatic phe-nomenon aff ecting weather conditions over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and the Arctic, and average pre-laying body mass in com-mon eiders. Body mass is a good proxy for condition-dependent reproductive output in this species.

50|$|Anomalies in {{oscillations}} sometimes {{occur when}} they coincide, {{as in the}} Arctic dipole anomaly (a combination of the Arctic and <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>oscillations)</b> and the longer-term Younger Dryas, a sudden non-linear cooling event that occurred {{at the onset of}} the current Holocene interglacial. In the case of volcanoes, large eruptions such as Mount Tambora in 1816, which led to the Year Without a Summer, typically cool the climate, especially when the volcano is located in the tropics. Around 70 000 years ago the Toba supervolcano eruption created an especially cold period during the ice age, leading to a possible genetic bottleneck in human populations. However, outgassing from large igneous provinces such as the Permian Siberian Traps can input carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, warming the climate. Triggering of other mechanisms, such as methane clathrate deposits as during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, increased the rate of climatic temperature change and oceanic extinctions.|$|R

25|$|Seasonal {{temperature}} {{trends are}} positive {{over most of}} the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern Canada in spring because of strengthening of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation.</b> Warming is stronger over northern Europe, China and North America in winter, Europe and Asia interior in spring, Europe and north Africa in summer and northern North America, Greenland and eastern Asia in autumn.|$|E
25|$|Atmospheric forcings {{also have}} a strong impact on Arctic Sea Ice export through the EGC. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation</b> (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO) has a {{profound}} impact on the wind field over the Arctic. During high NAO/AO indexes the cyclonic wind field over the Arctic becomes very strong, this transports more ice out through Fram Strait and into the EGC. During low NAO/AO indexes the cyclonic wind field is quite small and thus the transport out of the Fram Strait diminishes greatly.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{potential}} causes of this shift in the northern hemisphere circulation may {{have been associated with}} a shift in tropical weather patterns. In particular, this may have been caused by a strong Madden–Julian oscillation which occurred in the tropics in March. This is a large-scale tropical phenomenon which leads to disturbed weather patterns over a timescales of typically 30–60 days. These changes originate over the Indian Ocean and may have influenced the northern hemisphere weather regimes, as the Madden–Julian oscillation can be an important predictor {{of the state of the}} <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} atmospheric cycling and fate {{of persistent}} organic pollutants {{under the influence of}} a changing climate is a concern.

Regions of import and export maxima into the Arctic are identified along the Arctic Circle. It is found that, under future climate conditions, the net export of PCB 153 out of the Arctic will increase. The meridional net flux pattern of this substance is expected to become independent of AO and NAO. For DDT, a trend of decreasing net Arctic import will reverse to an increasing trend 100 years after peak emission, which is partly due to more frequent AO and NAO positive phases.

25|$|Natural climate {{variability}} {{can appear}} {{to slow down}} surface warming over short periods, but does not refute long-term climate change trends. Short-term hiatus periods of global warming are compatible with long-term climate change patterns. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation</b> (NAO) leads to multidecadal variability in Northern Hemispheric mean surface temperature by 15–20 years through a delayed effect on the North Atlantic Ocean, and can be a useful predictor of multidecadal periods of warming and cooling in both AMO and Northern Hemispheric mean surface temperature. A study published in January 2015 proposed that the hiatus resulted from a 60-year oscillatory pattern of natural variability ssociated with the AMO and PDO, interacting with a secular warming trend due mainly to human caused increases in greenhouse gas levels.|$|E
25|$|Another pathway of {{pollution}} occurs through the atmosphere. Wind-blown dust and debris, including plastic bags, are blown seaward from landfills and other areas.

Dust can also {{be attributed to a}} global transport from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts across Korea, Japan, and the Northern Pacific to the Hawaiian Islands. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year; however, the flux is greater during positive phases of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillation.</b> The USGS links dust events to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeciphering {{the effects}} of climatic {{conditions}} on population dynamics is of major importance in understanding how organisms {{are likely to be}} affected by climate changes. Using data from broad-scale annual censuses between 1990 and 2007, we show that winter and summer <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Oscillations</b> affect several breeding success indicators of the Black Grouse () in the French Alps. We did not find any trend in hen counts or breeding indexes over the study period. Surprisingly for a bird specialised in cold climates, we show that Black Grouse optimise their reproductive output for positive values of the winter NAO corresponding to the average NAO index of the last 30  years. Extreme NAO values lead to lower breeding success, indicating that the grouse may be more able to track trends in climate than an increase in the frequency of extreme years. Our result show that, at least from a short-term perspective, Black Grouse productivity is not threatened by a trend towards warmer climatic conditions in the Alps, but may be affected by an increased frequency of extreme years. We advocate the use of the NAO as a climate proxy rather than using heavily noised and biased local climate descriptors in studies focusing on the global response to climate over a large spatial scale...|$|R

To explore the physical mechanisms of these droughts and floods, influences exerted by the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the mid-latitude <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> on the wetness and dryness in the Yellow River basin have been investigated. The drought/flood index (DFI), derived from a reconstructed dataset covering the last five centuries, is used.

It is found that DFI in the entire Yellow River basin experienced oscillations at about 50 - 60 years {{during the past five}} centuries. Droughts and floods have inconsistent patterns in different areas of the Yellow River. The periodic variation of DFI in Xi'an, a station in a semi-humid subarea, is in contrast to the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST (10 °N- 55 °N and 70 °W- 10 °W) oscillation in spring and summer; the periodic variation of the Yinchuan DFI in a semi-arid subarea (the upper reaches of Yellow River) correlates with the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST <b>oscillation</b> variation in spring and summer.

We examine the differences between the instruments (wavelengths,satellite’s altitudes, telescope fields of view, multiple scattering processes, spatial resolutions) and theirability to detect the same clouds consistently. Then, we define a set of cloud detection thresholds for ATLID,CALIOP, CloudSat and EarthCARE-CPR and test against synthetic cloud scenes (cirrus and shallowcumulus) over small areas (about 200 km) produced by a lidar and radar instrument simulator (ECSIM) running on Large Eddy Simulations. Doing so, we verify that the fourth instruments will be able to detect thesame clouds despite their differences (e. g. their sensitivities to noise). Finally, we use the COSP lidar andradar simulator to predict the global scale cloud cover that ATLID, CALIOP, CloudSat and EarthCARE CPRwould observe if they were overflying the same atmosphere predicted by a GCM. Our results suggest that amerged CALIOP/ATLID and CloudSat/CPR cloud climatology could be to be useful for clouds inter-annualstudies, if the post-launch sensitivity of EarthCARE instruments is in line with what is predicted today...|$|R

Atmospheric teleconnections through changes in wind-driven ocean circulation modify this basin-scale pattern regionally.
