5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E

40|$|Rape {{survivors}} who speak out about their assault experiences are often punished {{for doing so}} when they are subjected to <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> from support providers. These <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> may thereby serve a silencing function, leading some rape survivors to stop talking about their experiences to anyone at all. The current study sought to examine this worst case scenario. Focusing on the qualitative narratives of eight rape {{survivors who}} initially disclosed the assault but then stopped disclosing for a significant period of time, this study sought to provide an in-depth description of how <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> silenced these survivors. Three routes to silence were identified: 1) <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> from professionals led survivors to question whether future disclosures would be effective; 2) <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> {{from friends and family}} reinforced feelings of self-blame; and 3) <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> from either source reinforced uncertainty about whether their experiences qualified as rape. Implications for future research and practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} college women’s (N = 405) reactions to body image and eating disorder research as well as predictors of <b>negative</b> <b>reactions.</b> Results suggested that the majority of women (94 %) did not experience <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> and reported benefits to participating. Regression analyses revealed that disordered eating and poorer body esteem were predictive of <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to research participation. Additional analyses were conducted to better understand those participants (N = 26; 6 %) who reported <b>negative</b> <b>reactions.</b> Overall, results indicated that body image and eating disorder research is not distressing for the vast majority of participants...|$|R
40|$|Results {{obtained}} from 1887 sera using three serological tests for bovine brucellosis {{were compared with}} a serological classification of sera described as the 'probable infection status'. Sera showing apparent false positive and apparent false <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> were identified, and were subjected to supplementary testing as appropriate. The serum agglutination test (SAT) gave 35 % apparent false <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> and 5 % apparent false positives. The complement fixation test (CFT) gave 12 % apparent false <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> using warm fixation (CFTW) and at least 5 % using cold fixation (CFTC). The routine diagnostic system used in Victoria, in which the CFTW is supplemented by the CFTC and the SAT, gave 9 % apparent false <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> and 2 % apparent false positive reactions. The radioimmunoassay gave 1 % or 6 % apparent false <b>negative</b> <b>reactions,</b> depending on the minimum diagnostic value used.

5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction,</b> and 30% had received a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, White Dog was {{edited for}} a direct-to-television {{broadcast}} and made available purchase by cable channels. The following year, NBC bought broadcast rights for $2.5 million and slated {{the film to}} air during the February sweeps, then canceled the broadcast two days later due to pressure from the continuing NAACP campaign and concerns of a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> by both viewers and advertisers. The film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel sporadically and without fanfare. It was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from the local fishermen.|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> of older women with {{osteoarthritis}} to the receipt of instrumental support (i. e., physical assistance) from their husbands {{and the effects of}} such <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> on the women’s psychological well-being and self-care. Applying a person–environment fit model, the authors predicted that women’s <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to spousal support would be determined by the fit between this support and the personal centrality (importance) of being functionally independent. Consistent with this prediction, women who received high levels of support from the husband and for whom being functionally independent was not highly central reacted less negatively to this support. More <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to spousal support were related to greater concurrent depressive symptomatology and fewer self-care behaviors. In addition, <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> were predictive of the women’s increased depressive symptomatology and decreased life satisfaction. Findings illustrate a useful theoretical approach to the examination of support from family caregivers. Key words: spousal support, person–environment fit, <b>negative</b> <b>reactions,</b> osteoarthritis The vast majority of community-residing older adults who need assistance with personal or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) receive this care from family members (Boaz & Hu...|$|R

After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened to walk off the team following the all-star break if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.|$|E
5|$|One mine-awareness {{campaign}} involving {{billboard advertising}} attracted {{criticism from the}} Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB) because the signs were placed in tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas. The Ministry of Tourism and the CNTB welcomed the effort's humanitarian aspect, but considered the signs a potential source of unwarranted <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from tourists. Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include warnings about the danger posed by mines in the country, and provide general information about their location.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{has been}} dubbed into several other languages, {{including}} Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese.

The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from the lifelong Simpsons fans in the area.|$|E

5|$|DraftKings and FanDuel {{also became}} {{known for their}} use of direct {{response}} advertising on television, especially during sports telecasts. Capitalizing on the start of football season, iSpot.tv estimated that DraftKings and FanDuel collectively spent over $107 million on television advertising in September 2015 alone—with nearly half being spent on advertising during National Football League telecasts ($23.6 million by DraftKings, and $26.7 million spent by FanDuel). Of the total, $60.1 million was spent by DraftKings, with $7.95 million spent during college football games, $2.05 million during ESPN's sports news program SportsCenter, and $1.36 million during South Park episodes. The marketing push was met with a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from viewers on social networks such as Twitter, who considered the repetitive airplay of DFS commercials during football games to be an annoyance.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Challenging {{views that}} perfectionism is a maladaptive factor {{in sport and}} that it is related to a preoccupation with {{performance}} goals and a neglect of mastery goals, the present article argues that perfectionism in athletes is not generally maladaptive, but shows differential relationships with mastery and performance goals depending on which facets of perfectionism are regarded. Method: Going beyond the dichotomous achievement goal framework, two studies with N = 204 high school athletes and N = 147 university student are presented investigating how two facets of perfectionism-striving for perfection and <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to imperfection [Stoeber, J., Otto, K., Pescheck, E., Becker, C., & Stoll, O. (2007). Perfectionism and competitive anxiety in athletes: Differentiating striving for perfection and <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to imperfection. Personality and Individual Differences, 42, 959 - 969. ]-relate to athletes' achievement goals. Design: Study 1 employed a cross-sectional correlational design, Study 2 a longitudinal correlational design. Results: Following the trichotomous achievement goal framework, Study 1 found striving for perfection to be positively related to mastery and performance-approach goals, whereas <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to imperfection were positively related to performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals and inversely to mastery goals. Following the 2 x 2 framework, Study 2 found striving for perfection to be positively related to mastery-approach and performance-approach goals whereas <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to imperfection were positively related to mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance avoidance goals. Moreover, <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to imperfection predicted residual increases in mastery avoidance goals over 3 months. Conclusions: It is concluded that striving for perfection in athletes is associated with an adaptive pattern of achievement goals whereas <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> to imperfection are associated with a maladaptive pattern. Thus, striving for perfection in sport may be adaptive in athletes who do not experience strong <b>negative</b> <b>reactions</b> when performance is less than perfect. ...|$|R

5|$|During the {{pre-production}} {{stages of}} Entre a Mi Mundo, Selena and Pérez {{had fallen in}} love—despite their fellow band members warning them about Abraham. Selena and Pérez decided to date discretely to avoid a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from Abraham. After finding out about their relationship, Abraham fired Pérez from the group just weeks before the album was due to be released, and threatened to disband the group if Selena went after Pérez. Selena and Pérez decided to elope in Corpus Christi, Texas on April 2, 1992; a move that Selena chose believing that her father would have never approved of them. In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement spread on local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, more than just a military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena.

5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage.

Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread <b>negative</b> <b>reaction,</b> including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E

The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Mantis, which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis. The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island which opened in 2014.|$|E
5|$|A third {{entry in}} the Deus Ex series was stated to be in {{development}} at Eidos Montréal in May 2007 by Eidos France director Patrick Melchior during an interview on MusiquePlus. At the time, Eidos did {{not comment on the}} story. Eidos Montréal project manager Stéphane D'Astous confirmed the game's existence in November, stating that concept approval had only just been granted. An initial teaser trailer was released on November 26, 2007. The game's official title, first details, and original release window were announced at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. It was published worldwide by Square Enix. While originally scheduled for 2010, the game was shifted to beyond April the following year so the team could further polish the gameplay. It was released for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). The gameplay was identical across all platforms barring control schemes. Originally Eidos had intended to make the PC retail version of the game region locked. The reason behind this was due to DVD limitations which meant the languages on the game had to be split. However, due to <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> from the public, this lock was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|A trial, {{in which}} the rebellious actors sued the {{management}} at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and {{they were to be}} granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a <b>negative</b> <b>reaction</b> by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.|$|E
