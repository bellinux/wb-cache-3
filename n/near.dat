5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed <b>near</b> Diego Garcia on April3 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar <b>near</b> Diego Suarez. It weakened {{upon entering the}} Mozambique channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing <b>near</b> Mayotte, the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking Madagascar again <b>near</b> Majunga.

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Etau began {{turning to}} the north-northeast due to the approaching trough, passing <b>near</b> Amami Ōshima. By that time, the typhoon had become large, with gale force winds extending 870km (540mi) in diameter. Increasing wind shear and cooler air caused Etau to weaken. The typhoon still maintained 10minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) when it made landfall <b>near</b> Muroto on the Japanese island of Shikoku, shortly before 1300UTC on August8. Continuing northeastward, the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm as it passed <b>near</b> Awaji Island, before making landfall on Honshu <b>near</b> Nishinomiya at 2100UTC on August8. While accelerating to the northeast, Etau lost tropical characteristics over land. After briefly reaching open waters to the northeast of Honshu, the storm made its final landfall <b>near</b> Erimo, Hokkaido at 1630UTC on August9, shortly before becoming extratropical. This was based on analysis from the JMA, whereas the JTWC assessed the storm remaining offshore Hokkaido. The remnants of Etau entered the Sea of Okhotsk and persisted for several more days, dissipating on August12 {{to the west of}} the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E
