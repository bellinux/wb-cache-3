5|$|In ice hockey, a {{combination}} of a player's goals and assists are collectively called points. Penalty minutes are the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> assigned to a player for infractions assessed during the season. Plus-minus is a statistic that tracks when a player was on the ice while goals were scored, both for and against their team, though some in game situations will not effect the statistic. Below is a listing of all player statistics for the Blue Jackets during the season.|$|E
5|$|Temporary {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} radiation sources {{for a set}} duration (usually a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|If, {{during their}} {{turn on the}} {{campaign}} map, the player should engage one of their armies in combat with another faction's army, or if their troops should be engaged by another faction during the AI's turn, the player then has the option of fighting a real-time battle or siege. In this gameplay mode, the player directs the troops they had brought {{with them on the}} campaign map to the engagement, ordering them to manoeuvre and attack the enemy's troops on a three-dimensional battlefield. Troops can either be killed outright on the battlefield or made to rout and flee the field if their morale falls below a certain threshold. Reviewers have noted of Rome: Total War that, during a battle, troop numbers do not outweigh all other considerations; other factors such as individual unit types' strengths and soldiers' morale and fatigue at the point of fighting are also taken into account. A battle is won when one side kills or routs the entire enemy army; a siege may be won by the attacking side through either dispatching the opposing forces or gaining control of the besieged city's central plaza for a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes,</b> and by the defending side either by killing the attackers or by destroying their siege equipment before they have managed to breach the city's defences.|$|E

25|$|A Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) {{is often}} {{performed}} {{during the entire}} day after polysomnography while the electrodes and other equipment are still in place. The patient is given nap opportunities every second hour; the test measures the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> it takes {{from the start of}} a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep. It is a measure of daytime sleepiness; it also shows whether REM sleep is achieved in a short nap, a typical indication of narcolepsy.|$|E

It is a very difficult potion to make as the ingredients have to be added in a very specific order, the mixture has to be stirred exactly the right number of times and the heat of the flames on which it is simmering has to be lowered to exactly the right level for the right <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> before the final ingredient is added.

25|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{multiplayer}} can be customised, {{such as the}} weapons, the number of points needed to win, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> {{until the end of}} the game, as well as the music that plays along with the level. There is also a variety of different characters the player can choose to play as, each with their own individual statistics. Some characters are from the Story mode, while there are other more humorous ones such as a dinosaur and an Elvis impersonator. Up to ten computer-controlled bots can be used. Their appearance, difficulty, and team can be customised. The bots can do some acrobatic moves that the player cannot do such as rolls and somersaults.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks. He also {{saw one of the}} accused (Avinash Treebhoowoon) on two occasions within a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> the day his wife died. McAreavey said that he had gone back to the hotel room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room to eat with their cups of tea. He found her unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and laid her on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Subway uses {{a system}} known as Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) for {{dispatching}} and train routing on the A Division (the IRT Flushing Line, and the trains {{used on the}} , do not have ATS for two reasons: they are isolated from the main-line A Division, and they were already planned to get communications-based train control (CBTC) before the ATS on the A Division, or ATS-A, project had started). ATS allows dispatchers in the Operations Control Center (OCC) to see where trains are in real time, and whether each individual train is running early or late. Dispatchers can hold trains for connections, re-route trains, or short-turn trains to provide better service when a disruption causes delays. ATS is used to facilitate the installation of train arrival displays, which count down the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> until a train arrives, on the A Division and on the BMT Canarsie Line. ATS was first proposed for the BMT Canarsie Line and the A Division in 1992, after a 1991 derailment killed five people on a 4 train that derailed near the 14th Street – Union Square station. CBTC for the Canarsie Line was proposed two years later.|$|E

40|$|The Miller {{spreading}} {{procedure was}} applied to mouse metaphase spreads of methotrexate-resistant 3 T 3 cells that contain large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>minute</b> chromosomes and dihydrofolate reductase genes. There is substantial variation in both size and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> in individual cells, the smallest of which (estimated as 5 × 103 kilobase pairs) would be undetected by standard light microscopic analyses. Minute chromosomes are composed of nucleosomal chromatin, which is organized into typical higher order fibers that are folded to form rosette-like structures characteristic of normal chromosome organization. There {{is no evidence that}} the DNA in minutes is linear. Minutes exist singly and in pairs, and members of a pair are connected by higher order chromatin fibers, suggesting that they are topologically interlocked. They are often closely apposed to chromosomal telomeres or arms, a configuration that may be involved in their distribution at mitosis. In addition to typical minutes, which do not possess kinetochores, a small marker chromosome possessing all of the features of a centromere region is present in parental and resistant cells. An unusual feature of this cell line is the retention <b>of</b> resistance, <b>minute</b> chromosomes, and amplified dihydrofolate reductase genes; most methotrexate-resistant mouse cell lines with minute chromosomes lose these properties when grown in the absence of methotrexate...|$|R

500|$|With McCrimmon as team captain, the Wheat Kings again {{reached the}} league {{championship}} in 1978–79. He scored 28 points in 22 games to help Brandon win the President's Cup. The team {{advanced to the}} 1979 Memorial Cup tournament where it reached the final against the Ontario Hockey League champion Peterborough Petes. McCrimmon routinely played a high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> each game; his teammates marvelled at his stamina. In the Memorial Cup final, he played virtually every minute of the contest. [...] His total ice time was 60 minutes, 38 seconds, and he was off the ice only to serve a two-minute penalty. [...] Peterborough won the game, 2–1 in overtime, after McCrimmon lost the puck on a play he thought was icing was not called. [...] Peterborough's Terry Bovair stole the puck from him and scored the championship winning goal. Despite the loss, McCrimmon was named a tournament all-star on defence.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} voted 29–17 {{in favor}} of electing Hoar as temporary chairman of the convention. At midnight, the committee was adjourned, and the members agreed to continue the meeting the following morning. News of Cameron's behavior had spread throughout town overnight. His hardliner strategy had failed, and Conkling and other Grant managers sought to control the situation before it became any worse. The next morning, Conkling asked his trusted colleague, Chester A. Arthur, to solve the problem. Arthur assessed the situation and drew up a compromise. He met Chandler {{and the rest of}} the anti-Grant cabal at the entrance of the committee's suite. Arthur acknowledged that the Grant men had rejected Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman the day before, but said that the Grant men might perhaps reconsider. He proposed that the delegates decide on the unit rule in a free vote, and in return, Don Cameron would be restored as the chairman of the national committee. After discussing for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes,</b> the two men came to an agreement. Arthur was confident that since Chandler, the leader of Blaine's campaign, had accepted the deal, then [...] "it would be agreed by the Grant men." [...] Chandler then discussed the compromise deal with the thirty anti-Grant committee members, and also James Garfield, who had previously expressed his opposition to the unit rule. 23 out of 30 anti-Grant men agreed to the terms, and Garfield commented that the proposition [...] "must be accepted" [...] in [...] "spirit of reconciliation." ...|$|E

60|$|Some of {{the finest}} streaks of colour in the stony layers, {{alternating}} with the obsidian, can be distinctly seen {{to be due to}} an incipient crystallisation of the constituent minerals. The extent to which the minerals have crystallised can, also, be distinctly seen to be connected with the greater or less size, and with the <b>number,</b> <b>of</b> the <b>minute,</b> flattened, crenulated air-cavities or fissures. Numerous facts, {{as in the case of}} geodes, and of cavities in silicified wood, in primary rocks, and in veins, show that crystallisation is much favoured by space. Hence, I conclude, that, if in a mass of cooling volcanic rock, any cause produced in parallel planes a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>minute</b> fissures or zones of less tension (which from the pent-up vapours would often be expanded into crenulated air-cavities), the crystallisation of the constituent parts, and probably the formation of concretions, would be superinduced or much favoured in such planes; and thus, a laminated structure of the kind we are here considering would be generated.|$|R
