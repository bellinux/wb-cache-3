5|$|Late in the {{dry season}} (around April) of each year, females {{give birth to a}} single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains {{attached}} to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic <b>nipples.</b>|$|E
5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of <b>nipples.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mammary glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the <b>nipples</b> seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly.|$|E
25|$|Very rarely, <b>nipple</b> {{pain can}} be caused by {{vasospasm}} of the <b>nipple.</b> In essence, blood does not flow properly to the <b>nipple</b> which causes the <b>nipple</b> to blanch. This {{can be caused}} by trauma to the <b>nipple</b> through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the <b>nipple.</b> The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the <b>nipple</b> is blanched. The <b>nipple</b> can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to the <b>nipple.</b>|$|R
40|$|BackgroundNipple {{reconstruction}} following breast mound reconstruction is {{the final}} step in breast reconstruction. Although <b>nipple</b> reconstruction is a simple surgery, the psychological aspects of <b>nipple</b> reconstruction {{are thought to be}} important. <b>Nipple</b> projection is a key factor in determining patient satisfaction with the surgery. In the present study, the Hammond flap technique was introduced for <b>nipple</b> reconstruction. MethodsTwenty-six patients who had undergone breast reconstruction from February 2008 to March 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients were evaluated based on preoperative photos, and their <b>nipple</b> diameters and heights were measured. Postoperative evaluation was conducted 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following <b>nipple</b> reconstruction. A questionnaire on patient satisfaction with the <b>nipple</b> reconstruction was administered 12 months after <b>nipple</b> reconstruction. Moreover, the same plastic surgeon scored <b>nipple</b> projection and overall cosmetic result of the new <b>nipple.</b> ResultsThe mean projection was 4. 4 mm (range, 3 - 6 mm), and it well matched the contralateral <b>nipple.</b> Twelve months following <b>nipple</b> reconstruction, the mean reduction rate in the <b>nipple</b> projection was 43. 6 %. Patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the <b>nipple</b> projection and the overall cosmetic result in 80. 7 % cases. ConclusionsIn the present study, compared with other techniques, the use of the Hammond flap technique in <b>nipple</b> reconstruction showed competitive results with regard to <b>nipple</b> projection and patient satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|Carly and Kate {{travel to}} the beach, where Kate has a run-in with Amber, and the two women inform her that Mark has been {{cheating}} on all of them. All three women then decide to take revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with an estrogen to swell his <b>nipples,</b> has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo; Carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea; Amber has an ugly fake three-way sexual partner against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and Too Hot to Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too Hot to Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too Hot to Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her <b>nipples,</b> appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|Paul Wasansky, who in 1570 was {{executed}} in Ivančice, in present-day Czech Republic, {{on account of}} 124 confessed murders (he was a roaming highwayman), underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure: First, his limbs were cut off and his <b>nipples</b> were ripped off with glowing pincers. He was then flayed, afterwards impaled and finally roasted alive. The pamphlet, which purports to give Wasansky's verbatim confession, does not record how Wasansky was apprehended, nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>nipple</b> shield is a nipple-shaped sheath worn {{over the}} areola and <b>nipple</b> during breastfeeding. Modern <b>nipple</b> shields {{are made of}} soft, thin, {{flexible}} silicone and have holes {{at the end of}} the <b>nipple</b> section to allow the breast milk to pass through. Older <b>nipple</b> shields were made of latex and harder, thicker plastics, and often caused more problems than they solved. A 17th-century <b>nipple</b> shield held in Shakespeare's birthplace is made of pewter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nipple</b> {{confusion}} is {{the tendency of}} an infant to unsuccessfully adapt between nursing at the breast {{and then with a}} <b>nipple</b> on a bottle. The same confusion can happen when the baby is put back onto the breast. <b>Nipple</b> confusion can turn into <b>nipple</b> refusal in which the baby refuses both the <b>nipple</b> of the bottle and breastfeeding.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} localized topical drug delivery to the breast via mammary papilla (<b>nipple).</b> 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and estradiol (EST) were used as model hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds respectively. Porcine and human <b>nipple</b> were used for in-vitro penetration studies. The removal of keratin plug enhanced the drug transport through the <b>nipple.</b> The drug penetration was significantly higher through the <b>nipple</b> compared to breast skin. The drug’s lipophilicity had a significant influence on drug penetration through <b>nipple.</b> The ducts in the <b>nipple</b> served as a major transport pathway to the underlying breast tissue. Results showed that porcine <b>nipple</b> could be a potential model for human <b>nipple.</b> The topical application of 5 -FU on the rat <b>nipple</b> resulted in high drug concentration in the breast and minimal drug levels in plasma and other organs. Overall, {{the findings from this}} study demonstrate the feasibility of localized drug delivery to the breast through <b>nipple...</b>|$|R
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and <b>nipples.</b> Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E
5|$|Aguilera {{announced}} via Twitter on September 12, 2012 {{that the}} album would be titled Lotus. The album artwork {{was shot by}} fashion photographer Enrique Badulescu. Aguilera unveiled the cover on October 5, where she is shown nude with her long, blonde hair covering her <b>nipples,</b> while her vulva is shaded by a white light; she extends her arms emerging from a lotus flower. It received a generally positive response from critics; Tiffany Lee from Yahoo! Music complimented Aguilera's figure, while Sam Lansky from Idolator drew comparisons to the cover of her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002). Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of <b>nipples.</b> Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>nipple</b> shield is a {{piece of}} body jewelry worn on the <b>nipple,</b> {{partially}} or fully covering the areola. The shield encircles the <b>nipple,</b> and can be stuck on by various means, including suction, friction and the action of glue, but is most often held in place by a <b>nipple</b> piercing. Usually, the primary intent of the <b>nipple</b> shield is to lift, highlight, and ornament the <b>nipple,</b> as well as the whole breast, much as other pieces of jewelry do for other parts of the body.|$|R
50|$|A {{less common}} design {{has a few}} names {{including}} 'button head', 'threepenny bit', 'flat' and 'tat head'. These are a larger <b>nipple</b> head with a flat sealing surface which overhangs {{the body of the}} <b>nipple</b> allowing the grease gun end to be hooked onto the <b>nipple</b> with a sliding action which wipes the <b>nipple</b> surface as it's attached. The grease gun hose is usually at a sharp angle (e.g. 70-90°) to the axis of the <b>nipple</b> but can be approached from any azimuthal angle. It is not possible for grease pressure to force this type of connector away from the <b>nipple.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Beatles {{hosted the}} orchestral session as a 1960s-style happening, with guests {{including}} Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Donovan, Pattie Boyd, Michael Nesmith, {{and members of}} the psychedelic design collective The Fool. Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on <b>nipples.</b> Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.|$|E
5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires parental consent for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing parental consent requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and <b>nipples,</b> on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require parental consent to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho has imposed a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their <b>nipples</b> through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal <b>nipples</b> is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two <b>nipples,</b> but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta), {{also known as}} the {{laughing}} hyena, is a species of hyena, currently classed as the sole member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years {{until the end of the}} Late Pleistocene. The spotted hyena is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer <b>nipples</b> and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.|$|E
5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four <b>nipples.</b> At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his <b>nipples.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{examination}} of nonhuman primate (NHP) lateralized behaviors may {{provide insight into}} the evolution of hemispheric specialization. This study examined <b>nipple</b> preference in 64 infant macaques in order to consider the ontogeny of lateralized behavior. We used a focal animal sampling method to record <b>nipple</b> contact during 15, 30 -min observation sessions collected across each infant’s first year of life. Using a lateralized behavior index (LBI) we calculated individual and population preferences (LBI (RL) /(Rþ L); ‘‘R’’mean right <b>nipple</b> contact, ‘‘L’’mean left <b>nipple</b> contact). Strength of preference was calculated as the absolute value of this score. Infants exhibited no population preference for a particular <b>nipple,</b> but showed a significant strength of preference that developed after 48 hr. Interestingly, successive siblings preferred the <b>nipple</b> not used by the previous infant. These findings suggest that <b>nipple</b> preference is guided by external stimuli, and that <b>nipple</b> preference during infancy may not be a behavioral representation of hemispheric specialization. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Background: Infants of {{breastfeeding}} {{mothers with}} persistent <b>nipple</b> pain {{have been shown}} to apply stronger vacuums to the breast and transfer less milk during one monitored feed. This may be associated with differences in the movement of the tongue. The aim was to analyse the intra-oral <b>nipple</b> shape and movement of the tongue of infants of mothers with and without <b>nipple</b> pain. Methods: Breastfeeding infants of mothers with or without <b>nipple</b> pain were monitored using ultrasound and intra-oral vacuum during one breastfeed. From cine clips of the ultrasound scans measurements were made of the depth of the intra-oral space between the hard-soft palate junction (HSPJ) and the mid-tongue; the distance of the tip of the <b>nipple</b> to the HSPJ; and <b>nipple</b> diameters from the tip to the base. Results: During nutritive sucking, tongue movements of infants of mothers with <b>nipple</b> pain resulted in a smaller intra-oral space (p = 0. 040) and restricted <b>nipple</b> expansion compared to controls (p < 0. 012). Stronger baseline and peak vacuums compared to controls were confirmed (p = 0. 002). Conclusion: In these mothers, <b>nipple</b> pain was associated with restricted infant tongue movement. Ultrasound may complement measurement of intra-oral vacuum in monitoring treatment strategies in breastfeeding women experiencing <b>nipple</b> pain...|$|R
