25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little bit of a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{fragrance}} {{is described}} by Steal Their Style as a [...] "feminine and flowery fragrance". Along with Glow by JLo, the perfume achieved success in the fragrance market {{and became one of}} America's highest-selling bottles. Collectively with Glow by JLo, it brought in over $USD300 million within a year, making Lopez the nineteenth richest person under forty, according to business magazine Forbes. The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot / No matter where I go, I know where I came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her old self from South Bronx." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{dispute between}} Geldof and Hutchence family members over Tiger continued. Geldof legally adopted Tiger, against {{the wishes of}} Patricia and Tina, who {{disagreed}} with Geldof changing her surname to Hutchence-Geldof. In July 2009, Patricia protested that Geldof had prevented access to her granddaughter for three years, [...] "It's totally cruel and unnecessary. I've lost my husband and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> granddaughter who doesn't even know her beloved Grandpa Ross [...] has died. We have been completely cut {{out of her life}} by Bob Geldof." [...] Patricia requested a visit with Tiger from Geldof for what would have been Hutchence's 50th birthday (22 January 2010) and indicated that she accepted her son's death as being a suicide. Patricia died on 21 September 2010; Tiger was not in attendance at her grandmother's funeral due to Geldof's fear of the attention that would be generated. Her uncle Rhett indicated that Geldof had sent condolences, that he had spoken to Tiger and agreed it was advisable to keep the 14-year-old out of the media.|$|E

2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well will take you to the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea {{it would}} be nice to stay in the country. S'posin' you an' me go right off an' get a job on some farm. That would settle Skip in great shape, an' we'd <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mighty good time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If Lady Ruth {{desires to}} see me," [...] Wingrave remarked slowly, [...] "I shall {{be here at}} nine o'clock this evening. Tomorrow my {{movements}} are uncertain.

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{unbounded}} {{confidence in}} this man's common honesty.

6000|$|... "What! are you drawing {{it all out}} again?" [...] {{he asked}} in surprise. Then I {{realized}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written fifty-six instead of six. I was too far gone to reason <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> feeling {{that it was impossible}} to explain the thing. All the clerks had stopped writing to look at me.|$|R

60|$|At King's Cross, {{they took}} him away from me. Still, I hardly cried.
