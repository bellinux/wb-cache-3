5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E

5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the winds}} {{often have a}} {{destructive}} nature, they have some benefits as well. They cause cold water to rise from below the surface layer of the ocean, bringing with it many <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> ultimately benefit local fisheries. As the winds blow over the ocean, sea surface temperatures drop about 4°C (7°F), indicating the upwelling. Chlorophyll concentrations in the surface water go from negligible, {{in the absence of}} winds, to very active at more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter {{in the presence of the}} winds.|$|E
25|$|Frequently alcoholics have {{disrupted}} social {{links in}} their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic gastritis, and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system and reduces absorption of <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E

25|$|If {{the rate}} of {{absorption}} (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate {{at the edges of}} a metabolic model. This ensures that <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method of making sure that the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.|$|E
25|$|The primary endosymbionts {{are thought}} to help the host either by {{providing}} <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of Buchnera is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of Wigglesworthia, it is presumed, is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from the blood that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists {{play a major role}} in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulatory}} mechanism in the United States, a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), prescribes {{the maximum amount}} of a pollutant (including <b>nutrients)</b> <b>that</b> a body of water can receive while still meeting U.S. Clean Water Act water quality standards. Specifically, Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires each state to generate a TMDL report for each body of water impaired by pollutants. TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals. EPA has described TMDLs as establishing a pollutant budget then allocating portions of the overall budget to the pollutant's sources. For many coastal water bodies, the main pollutant issue is excess nutrients, also termed nutrient over-enrichment.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is a {{component}} of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element <b>nutrient</b> <b>that</b> functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|R
25|$|Organisms, and {{all other}} {{metabolic}} systems, require some input of nutrients. Typically the rate of uptake of nutrients is dictated by their availability (a <b>nutrient</b> <b>that</b> is not present cannot be absorbed), their concentration and diffusion constants (higher concentrations of quickly-diffusing metabolites are absorbed more quickly) and the method of absorption (such as active transport or facilitated diffusion versus simple diffusion).|$|R

25|$|Reef-building or hermatypic corals {{live only in}} the {{photic zone}} (above 50m), the depth to which {{sufficient}} sunlight penetrates the water, allowing photosynthesis to occur. Coral polyps do not photosynthesize, but have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae of the genus Symbiodinium, {{commonly referred to as}} zooxanthellae. These organisms live within the tissues of polyps and provide organic <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> nourish the polyp. Because of this relationship, coral reefs grow much faster in clear water, which admits more sunlight. Without their symbionts, coral growth would be too slow to form significant reef structures. Corals get up to 90% of their nutrients from their symbionts.|$|E
25|$|Either by hand or in a rice polisher, {{white rice}} may be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called {{polished}} rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), parboiled, or processed into flour. White rice {{may also be}} enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.|$|E
25|$|To design optimal {{growth media}} {{with respect to}} {{enhanced}} growth rates or useful by-product secretion, {{it is possible to}} use a method known as Phenotypic Phase Plane analysis. PhPP involves applying FBA repeatedly on the model while co-varying the nutrient uptake constraints and observing the value of the objective function (or by-product fluxes). PhPP makes it possible to find the optimal combination of <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> favor a particular phenotype or a mode of metabolism resulting in higher growth rates or secretion of industrially useful by-products. The predicted growth rates of bacteria in varying media have been shown to correlate well with experimental results. as well as to define precise minimal media for the culture of Salmonella typhimurium.|$|E

25|$|The San Francisco Estuary has a {{numerous}} {{sources of}} <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used}} for primary production, derived largely from waste water treatment facilities, agricultural and urban drainage, and the ocean. In spite of this, the estuary is unique in that it tends to have a relatively depressed rate of primary production. This is probably due to two factors: large inputs of nitrogen in the form of ammonium, which suppresses nitrate uptake by phytoplankton, which prefer the metabolically cheaper NH4+, and high turbidity, which limits light required for photosynthesis to the top few centimeters of the water column. This turbidity is a legacy of hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada in the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{the wheat}} {{industry}} began to adopt voluntary widespread enrichment (fortification) of wheat flour with vitamins, folic acid, and iron, {{the outcome of}} a recommendation by the National Nutrition Conference for Defense, charged with investigating the causes of poor health among many World War II recruits. By 1942, some 75 percent of breads in the United States were fortified. Mandatory fortification requirements went into effect in 1943, following the publication of the first U.S. government recommended dietary allowances. The removal of naturally occurring <b>nutrients</b> <b>that</b> occurs in grain processing led to a number of diseases caused by nutritional deficiency, including beriberi, pellagra, neural tube defect, and iron deficiency anemia. Enrichment helped eradicate or reduce the frequency of these conditions in the United States.|$|E
