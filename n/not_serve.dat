This information is replicated as {{and when the}} two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> as patterns for protein sequences.|$|E

Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E

The northern portion of NY268 followed the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek.|$|E
5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909.

Between {{the two world wars}} he was a staunch advocate of mechanization {{at a time when the}} idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do <b>not</b> <b>serve</b> to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.|$|E
