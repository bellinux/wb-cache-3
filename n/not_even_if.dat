5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E

500|$|When {{dealing with}} the {{dialogue}} in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters {{as if they were}} actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: [...] "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them." [...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E

2500|$|After relabeling, {{the former}} just looks like ω itself, i.e. 3 + ω = ω, {{while the latter}} does not: [...] is not equal to ω since [...] has a largest element (namely, 2') and ω does <b>not</b> (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> ω and [...] are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this {{addition}} is not commutative. In fact it is quite rare for α+β to be equal to β+α: this happens {{if and only if}} α=γm, β=γn for some ordinal γ and natural numbers m and n. From this it follows that [...] "α commutes with β" [...] is an equivalence relation on the set of nonzero ordinals, and all the equivalence classes are countably infinite.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gadamer, in {{contrast}} to the [...] "wealth of meaning" [...] that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant [...] "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of [...] "moral feeling" [...] that had been worked out in English philosophy". The moral imperative [...] "cannot be based on feeling, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility". For Kant, the sensus communis only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge. Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from [...] "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it [...] "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".|$|E
2500|$|Dennett's reply {{from natural}} selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, {{a human being}} is born {{that does not have}} Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] but {{nevertheless}} acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a [...] "zombie" [...] in thought experiments in the philosophy of mind). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually [...] "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.|$|E

Even if this notion were ever to gain complete acceptance by the scientific world, Jewish thought, unlike the reasoning of the high priest of that notion, would nonetheless never summon us to revere a still extant representative of this primal form as the supposed ancestor of us all. Rather, Judaism in that case would call upon its adherents to give even greater reverence than ever before to the one, sole God Who, in His boundless creative wisdom and eternal omnipotence, needed to bring into existence no more than one single, amorphous nucleus and one single law of [...] "adaptation and heredity" [...] in order to bring forth, from what seemed chaos but was in fact a very definite order, the infinite variety of species we know today, each with its unique characteristics that sets it apart from all other creatures.

2500|$|Wolverine {{appears in}} [...] voiced by Steven Blum. He ambushes Spider-Man at Hell's Kitchen {{and ask him}} {{questions}} to determine if Spider-Man is a symbiote or <b>not.</b> (<b>Even</b> <b>if</b> the player gives wrong answers, likely due to not reading the comics, the fight continues.) He helps Spidey evacuate a church; however, before he can board, Wolverine is attacked by two burly Symbiotes, which dog pile him to the ground. As a result, Wolverine turns into a monstrous symbiote version of himself; he attacks Spidey, even using the Symbiote pods to gain armor. If the player chooses the Red Suit Path, Wolverine uses his claws to gut himself, effectively removing the symbiote. (Ironically, Wolverine had originally suggested doing this to Spider-Man if the symbiote managed {{to gain control of}} him.) If the player chooses the Black Suit Path, Spider-Man will absorb Wolverine's symbiote and then rip him in half with Wolverine swearing to kill him. In both Black Suit endings, Black Widow enlists a symbiote-controlled Wolverine (who is in full control of his symbiote) to bring her Spider-Man dead or alive. The Symbiote-Wolverine prefers the dead option. Wolverine is an assist character who will slash at any opponents in all versions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of tradecraft, covert and clandestine are not synonymous. As noted in the {{definition}} (which {{has been used by}} NATO since World War II) in a covert operation the identity of the sponsor is concealed, but in a clandestine operation, the operation itself is concealed. At least insofar as someone or something that is known to exist by at least two individuals can be [...] "concealed". Put differently, clandestine means [...] "hidden", and covert means [...] "deniable". The adversary is aware that a covert activity is happening, but theoretically and hypothetically does not know who is doing it and certainly not the sponsorship. Separating action from [...] "sponsorship" [...] is a technicality hopefully (for the [...] "sponsor") providing sufficient distance from the action so that the sponsor can claim ignorance in the event the [...] "covert" [...] plot is discovered. Clandestine activities, however, if successful, are completely unknown to the adversary, and their function, such as espionage, would be neutralized if there was any awareness of the activity. Such [...] "neutralization" [...] of the intended goal, actions or results does not grant the sponsor deniability of responsibility, blame and guilt and is not a legal, ethical or moral defense if negative consequences have resulted from the operation. Espionage is espionage {{regardless of whether or not}} the intelligence and information provided to the sponsor – friend or foe – is of benefit or use or <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> the information was intentionally misleading, fake or inaccurate the crime is in passing it to a foreign government.|$|E
