There is no {{specific}} requirement of feed intake for each livestock because their feed continuously varies based on the animals’ age, sex, breed, environment, etc. However basic nutrient requirement of a livestock’s feed must consist of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Dairy cattle need more energy in their feed than other type of cattle. Studies have shown that energy supplied by feed is provided by various carbohydrate sources include non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) such as fermentable feeds or <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber</b> (NDF) such as forage. Feeds with high NDF is good for rumen health, however provides less energy and vice versa. Fats are added in the livestock feed to increase energy concentration, especially when the NFC content is already too high since excessive NFC lessens the NDF fraction, affecting the rumen digestion. In ruminants, most proteins consumed are breakdown by microorganisms and the microorganism later get digested by the small intestine. The [...] suggested that the crude protein required in livestock feed should be less than 7%. Lactating ruminant especially dairy cattle require highest amount of protein, especially for milk synthesis. Minerals including calcium, phosphorus and selenium are required by livestock for maintaining growth, reproduction and bone health.|$|E

The utilization of such methods is complementary to other quality assurance methods and demonstrates a complex aspect of food quality. In this study, biocrystallization was used as a method for distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced pasteurized milk, demonstrating how the differences in the dairy cow feeding regime can affect milk properties. The biocrystallization was performed by means of copper (II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl 2 * 2 H 2 O). The biocrystallization patterns obtained from the conventional and organic milk samples were readily distinguished. A significant indication of differences was the emergence of degradation features in the biocrystallization patterns. While degradation features do not appear in organic milk, conventional milk showed clear indications of degradation, although the compound analysis of the two milks indicated no differences. From the morphological perspective, the biocrystallization patterns of organic milk have fared better according to all criteria. The results of the fatty acid analysis in milk from conventional and certified organic farms showed a greater content of beneficial fatty acids in organic milk: oleic (P< 0. 05), linoleic and linolenic (P< 0. 01). The analysis of animal feed indicated a higher content of cellulose, i. e. acid <b>detergent</b> <b>fibers</b> (ADF), and a lower content of <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fibers</b> (NDF) in the organic animal feed.

The diets had the same amount of nitrogen (150. 4 g crude protein/kg DM), containing 325. 6 g of concentrated feed/kg DM. There was no effect on the serum concentration of transaminase and the animals showed no clinical symptoms of intoxication by ricin. The intake of DM, crude protein (CP) and non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) reduced from 0. 67 replacement of SBM by CMT. The intake of <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fibers</b> corrected for ash and protein (NDFap) increased from 0. 33 replacement of SBM with CMT.

Approach: In this study with beef cattle, concentrates without or with curcumin and low or&# 13; high level of leucaena leaves were fed to assess the possible interactive effects. Apparent&# 13; macronutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance were measured. Results: When the ration was&# 13; curcumin free, an increase in the intake of leucaena leaf meal raised the group mean of apparent&# 13; digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude fat, <b>neutral</b> and acid <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber,</b> but the opposite&# 13; effect was seen for the curcumin-containing rations.

Glucose uptake was varied from 12. 43 to 98. 22 % and those for PIM-Y from 14. 36 to 98. 57 % and the increase was dependent on both glucose and sample concentrations. This founding fractionation procedure suggested that these purified insoluble fibers could be incorporate as low calorie bulk ingredients in high fiber foods production to reduce calorie level and help to control blood glucose levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and digestibility of leaves, stems and panicles of Amaranthusdubius Mart. ex Thell. were evaluated. We collected the samples in Merecure, estado Miranda, Venezuela, in two collecting seasons (rainy and dry). We determined the proximate composition, dietetic fiber, acid detergent fiber, <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber,</b> lignin and digestibility {{of the organic}} matter and of the <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber.</b> We observed the interaction among these factors {{in most of these}} analyses, except for the crude fiber and <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber.</b> The highest content of protein (270. 90 g. kg- 1), ashes (211. 70 g. kg) and the highest digestibility of the organic matter (910. 80 g. kg- 1 - 1) and of the <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber</b> (770. 50 g. kg) were found in leaves during the rainy season. Protein concentration was lowerin the stems during the dry season (60. 80 g. kg- 1), and the lowest ether extract content (3. 60 g. kg) and lower digestibility of the organic matter (469. 90 g. kg- 1 - 1) were found in the stems during the rainy season. The panicle presented the highest ether extract (22. 40 g. kg- 1) and lignin (190. 90 g. kg) contents. The organ of the plant and the collecting season both affect the proximate composition and fiber content of A. dubius. Because of its high nutritional value and digestibility, it has potential as a food and feed supplement...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of new feeds in ruminant nutrition is essential to maximize performance and to minimize production costs; however, this is only possible after knowing the feeding behavior of the animals and nutrient availability. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the ingestive behavior and in vivo digestibility of goats fed increasing levels (0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 7 %) of copra extracted from green coconuts. Twenty male goats of undefined breed were allocated in a completely randomized design. The addition of increasing levels of coconut copra had a quadratic effect on dry matter intake and daily rumination time. An increasing linear effect was observed for rumination time of dry matter and <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber.</b> There was no effect (P> 0. 05) on the apparent digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber,</b> acid detergent fiber, or non-fibrous carbohydrates. The digestible non-fibrous carbohydrate intake or apparent digestibility of hemicellulose and total digestible nutrients was also not affected. A quadratic effect of increasing inclusion levels of copra was observed for apparent ether extract digestibility, while the increasing inclusion of copra had a decreasing linear effect (P< 0. 05) on digestible <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber</b> intake, apparent crude protein digestibility, digestible crude protein intake, and digestible ether extract intake. The best inclusion level of coconut copra for goat feeding is 3. 15 % of the total diet to increase dry matter intake and apparent ether extract digestibility without affecting the apparent digestibility of <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber,</b> but reducing crude protein digestibility...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} thesis includes articles and publications dedicated {{to the topic of}} the digestive tract, the issue of measuring the digestibility of horse nutriens, characteristics and nutritional values of the yellow oat (Avena sativa), black oat (Avena strigosa) and hay. The practical part is devoted to comparing the nutritional values and digestibility of yellow and black oats in the ration using yellow or black with oat hay The experiment was conducted on six horses borrowed from the Academic riding club in Prague - Suchdol in February 2016. The preparatory period was 5 days, and sampling of faeces took place fifth morning after the morning feeding. Three pairs were created out of the six horses. The first pair formed gelding breed, Czech warmblood, who were housed in the inner box stable. The second pair formed a Haflinger gelding breed housed in an outdoor box. The third pair formed a Hucul gelding breed and welsh cob, housed in an outdoor box. One of the horses from an experimental pair was fed oat hulls and other horse was fed black varieties oats Raven. Rations was the same for both of the horses and both experimental animals also received the same amount of roughage.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{sugar cane bagasse}} from cachaça production, subjected to hay-making and ensiling. The experiment was conduced at Universidade Federal de Lavras, MG, using the completely random delineation (CRD), with seven treatment and three repetitions. The treatments were constituted of in natura sugar cane bagasse (INB), manually hayed and baled sugar cane bagasse, mechanically hayed and baled, manually baled INB and mechanically baled INB, whole ensiled INB and chopped ensiled INB. Bromatological composition, tampon capacity (TC), pH values and total sugar rate of the INB were evaluated. For the ensilage, there were used cistern silos and for the baling, manual and mechanical balers. The bagasse was baled in natura, or after reaching 89 % rate of DM, according to the treatments. The evaluated characteristics were dry matter rate (DM), crude protein (CP), <b>fiber</b> in <b>neutral</b> <b>detergent</b> (FND), <b>fiber</b> in acid <b>detergent</b> (FAD). The results went through variance analyses and the averages were compared by the Scott - Knott test (P< 0. 05). The INB presented rates of 51. 70 % of DM; 2 % of CP; 79. 43 % of FND; 48. 78 % of FAD and 16. 4 % of total sugar in the MS. The sugar cane bagasse presented low TC and the silage presented satisfactory pH for good conservation. The dehydration followed by the manual baling provided {{a decrease in the}} cell wall components, revealing itself as the best bagasse conservation method...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} supplements on the productive performance and economical parameters of beef steers on pastures during the dry season. Twenty-four castrated steers with average age and weight of eighteen months and 269 kg, respectively, were evaluated in the following treatments: pasture without minerals (P); pasture and mineral salt (PMS) and pasture and mineral salt plus urea (PMSU). The chemical composition showed low contents of crude protein and high values of <b>neutral</b> and acid <b>detergent</b> <b>fiber</b> for forages sampled {{in the form of}} complete collection compared with the grazing simulation technique. The supplementation with mineral salt plus urea led to a higher average daily gain (p < 0. 05) than the animals on pasture without mineral. However, when the average daily gain was expressed per metabolic weight, the supplementation with mineral salt plus urea was superior (p < 0. 05). The supplementation of animals on pasture proved economically profitable, and the use of mineral salt with urea in the dry season enables a better performance at viable costs...|$|R
