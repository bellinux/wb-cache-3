40|$|This paper derives optimal weights for current-account and <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators</b> for {{adjusting}} {{the exchange rate}} (a "crawling peg"). Keven (1975) showed that use of a current account indicator alone would not stabi 1 iereserves, while a <b>reserve</b> <b>indicator</b> results in unstable fluctuations in the exchange rate. This paper begins by analyzing {{the problem in the}} frame work of Phillips (1954), in which the current account indicator is "proportional" and the <b>reserve</b> <b>indicator</b> is "integral. " We then analyze the problem in a deterministic optimal control framework, and finally as a problem in stochastic control. In all cases the optimal combination is a weighted average, which we call the Keven-Phillips formula. With a fairly low variance of the current account, its weight falls in the range 0. 47 - 0. 65. Rising variance reduces its weight in the optimal formula. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to identify whether the recent foreign reserve accumulation in Asian economies {{has been too}} extraordinary to recover the moderate level of reserves which depleted {{at the time of}} the currency crisis in 1997 - 1998. First of all, the level of reserves numerated by various economic fundamentals such as broad money, imports and short-term external debt in Asian economies was examined in order to judge whether the level was high enough to weather speculative pressures at the onset of the crisis in 1997. The analysis is based on a Brownian motion model with an absorbing barrier. Although most Asian economies appeared to have larger <b>reserves</b> (<b>reserve</b> <b>indicators)</b> than the estimated threshold {{at the time of the}} crisis of 1997, reserves in terms of short-term external debt were apparently not sufficient to avoid speculative attacks. Then, based on the estimated threshold of <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators,</b> the likelihood of a 25 % devaluation within three months ahead is calculated. Probabilities of currency devaluation vary from time to time, among countries, and among <b>reserve</b> <b>indicators.</b> The devaluation likelihood was modest in the mid 1990 s, but then it showed a big jump in 1997 in Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, and Philippines. foreign reserves, accumulation, Asia, threshold, currency crisis...|$|R
