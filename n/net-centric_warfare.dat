The refer-ence model prescribes four sets of fundamental functionality: user/entity interaction ser-vices; intelligent assistance capabilities; net-centric services (encompassing communities of interest (COI) services, core enterprise services (discovery, mediation, collaboration, etc.), and environment control services); and resource provisioning services. The role and critical importance of the set of services that are to provide intelligent assistance to users of the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to its envisaged Net-centric Information Envi-ronment (NCIE), {{has yet to be}} fully delineated.

40|$|We {{have argued}} that the success of <b>Net-Centric</b> Operations and <b>Warfare</b> (NCOW) depends upon the ability of net-centric {{environment}} (NCE) users—both human and automated—to readily discover useful information and Web-based services. Effective discovery requires, in turn, effective meta-data “tagging. ” It was argued that no single, overarching classification scheme is adequate to provide the semantic support required for the successful deployment of such core enterprise services as discovery, collaboration, mediation, and storage. What was needed was a way to support multiple taxonomies with automatic taxonomy evolution using machine learning and intelligent agent technology. In this paper we analyze the underlying reasons for this claim and show that what is really needed is a way to allow multiple ontologies (along with their taxonomic correlates) with cross-domain (i. e., inter-ontology) resolution (translation) to coexist in a netcentric environment. After surveying some apparent theoretical limits to ontology commensurability, we describe a conceptual framework that is sufficient to enable information and Web-services interoperability for command and control NCE. We compare this framework to current semantic web approaches to show what our framework contributes...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Department of Defense and, subsequently, the U. S. Navy have embraced {{a strategy of}} exerting influence through information dominance versus amassing a large presence. This philosophy, called <b>Net-centric</b> <b>Warfare,</b> uses sensor and network technology to leverage naval platforms towards realizing effects previously achievable only by a larger force. In adapting this strategy, the U. S. Navy has realized many benefits, but has also increased its reliance on the technologies implementing <b>Net-centric</b> <b>Warfare.</b> One such technology is the U. S. Navy's future Military SATCOM terminal, the Navy Multiband Terminal, which will provide critical off-ship bandwidth required for these leveraging effects. The Navy plans to sustain the NMT system using the same methods as previous systems. When considering Operational Availability, these legacy methods do not adequately address attributes affecting system performance, creating a risk the NMT system will not perform as needed to successfully execute <b>Net-centric</b> <b>Warfare.</b> This risk can be managed by transitioning away from traditional methods to those utilizing online collaborative technologies.

However, the inherent nature of NCW systems is often quite complex and dynamic, which leads to impaired situation awareness (SA) and heightened levels of mental workload for the human operator. The following study investigated the moderating effects of automated audio-visual alerts on user SA and perceived workload while using a <b>net-centric</b> <b>warfare</b> system. Twenty-six participants observed battlefield scenarios on a simulation of the common NCW system, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB 2), and were required to pay attention and remember critical events (e. g., the appearance of an enemy unit). The system was presented with or without an automated alerting aid that provided combined auditory and visual alerts when certain critical events occurred (i. e., System to Help Implement and Empower Leader Decisions; SHIELD). Results revealed that contrary to current assumptions the use of an automated alerting aid did not impact user SA; however, perceived workload was significantly lower with the addition of the alerting aid. This work demonstrates that the automated alerts used in this NCW experiment do not affect SA (either positively or negatively) and decreased perceived workload...|$|E

40|$|<b>Net-centric</b> <b>warfare</b> {{is about}} {{employing}} information age concepts to increase combat power in war and mission effectiveness in {{operations other than war}} [1]. By linking sensor networks, {{command and control}} networks, and shooter networks, warfighters can achieve efficiencies in the full spectrum of operations by sharing information in a common operating environment. Unity of effort across organizational, national, technical and spatial boundaries is necessary. Warfighters have a duty to share information with others, and in the tactical environment it is not always obvious who needs the information and exactly how that information will be used. In some respects, sharing information is a leap of faith that the recipient will treat the information properly, not abusing the implied trust. This article introduces aspects of the tactical environment and some of the complexities of sharing information in a tactical network, describes the security challenges and suggests a high-level security architecture that applies adequate measures without compromising the information sharing needs of the warfighter. Secure solutions to these types of complex net-centric problems are Cross-Domain Information Sharing in a Tactical Environment <b>Net-centric</b> <b>warfare</b> in the full spectrum of operations mandates information sharing among non-traditional partners across security domains. This information sharing requires the exploitation of complex technologies and generates significant security challenges. Traditional information assurance solutions to support cross-domain information sharing have focused heavily on preventive measures, restricting information flow and reducing the risk of information compromise. This constraint on information flow directly opposes the duty of the warfighter to share information. A holistic solution involving robust software components, auditing, and permission management will reduce the risks of unauthorized information exposure to adequate levels without imposing severe information flow constraints. made achievable with the increased assurance that can be placed on well-developed and tested software...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The rapid flow of {{information}} through a command-and-control organization strengthens the agility of the command and increases {{the efficiency of the}} organization. Therefore, a metric is proposed for the speed of useful information as it flows in an organization, enterprise or command structure. Information is assumed to be useful if a member of the organization considers it to have the potential to reduce uncertainty, and thus become an important contribution to a decision process. Information velocity depends on information flow and time, which is sometimes described as “getting the right information to the right person at the right time. ” Efficient information flow is the goal of <b>net-centric</b> <b>warfare</b> and is needed for making faster, better decisions.

Enabled by high-speed electronics and advances in wavefront control, we develop an architecture that provides free-space coherent optical links with information capacity, security, network robustness and power management performance that exceed the current state-of-the-art, including commercially deployed systems, R&D test-beds, and alternative theoretical architectures proposed. The deleterious effects of the turbulent atmosphere are mitigated with several diversity transmitters and receivers. We allow the phase and the amplitude of each transmitter to be controlled independently and assume, through coherent detection, that the phase and amplitude of the received wave is measured. Thus we can optimally allocate transmit power into the diffraction modes with the smallest propagation losses to increase channel capacity and mitigate turbulence-induced outages. Additionally, spatial mode modulation and rejection provides robust communication in the presence of denial of service via interference by adversaries with a priori knowledge of the system architecture. Some possible implementations of this system are described. New results, including asymptotic singular value distribution, expected bit error rate, interference performance, and performance in the presence of inhomogeneous turbulence, are given. Finally, performance of this system is compared with the performance of optical diversity systems without wavefront control and optical systems without diversity, both current state-of-the-art systems.

Research indicates that rechargeable batteries {{will continue to be}} the AUV power source of choice for at least the near future. Thus, a need exists in both military and commercial markets for a universal, industry-standard underwater AUV recharge system. A novel solution using a linear coaxial wound transformer (LCWT) inductive coupling mounted on the AUV and a vertical docking cable is investigated. The docking cable may be deployed from either a fixed docking station or a mobile "tanker AUV". A numerical simulation of the simplified system hydrodynamics was created in MATLAB and used to evaluate the mechanical feasibility of the proposed system. The simulation tool calculated cable tension and AUV oscillation subsequent to the docking interaction. A prototype LCWT coupling was built and tested in saltwater to evaluate the power transfer efficiency of the system. The testing indicated that the surrounding medium has little effect on system performance.

40|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world is again {{experiencing}} a major shift in the geopolitical landscape. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of theCold War have profoundly changed the nation’s security environment. However, as theSeptember 11 th attacks demonstrated, new deadly challenges have emerged from terrorist networks and rogue states. Although none of these threats equal the destructivecapabilities of the Soviet Union, their determination to obtain, and the greater likelihood that they will use, weapons of mass destruction, creates a more complex and dangerous security environment.

As a result, DoD is struggling to meet these competingrequirements and reconcile the spending between traditional and new programs. Therefore, creating a more efficient acquisition system is a top priority. High-qualityresearch in the area of acquisitions is necessary to catalyze positive and lasting changes to improve performance, reduce acquisition cycle times, and reduce the costs of DoD acquisitions, even as the Department confronts rapidly changing external and internalenvironments. This report highlights some the forces that are acting to change theenvironment including: budget constraints, a changing threat environment, technological innovations, force transformation, human capital management, a shrinking industrialbase, and ethics; and then develops a strategy for acquisition research.

40|$|The {{utility of}} present Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) {{is limited by}} their {{on-board}} energy storage capability. Research indicates that rechargeable batteries {{will continue to be}} the AUV power source of choice for at least the near future. Thus, a need exists in both military and commercial markets for a universal, industry-standard underwater AUV recharge system. A novel solution using a linear coaxial wound transformer (LCWT) inductive coupling mounted on the AUV and a vertical docking cable is investigated. The docking cable may be deployed from either a fixed docking station or a mobile "tanker AUV". A numerical simulation of the simplified system hydrodynamics was created in MATLAB and used to evaluate the mechanical feasibility of the proposed system. The simulation tool calculated cable tension and AUV oscillation subsequent to the docking interaction. A prototype LCWT coupling was built and tested in saltwater to evaluate the power transfer efficiency of the system. The testing indicated that the surrounding medium has little effect on system performance. (cont.) Finally, an economic analysis was conducted to determine the impact of the proposed system on the present military and commercial AUV markets. The recharge system creates substantial cost-savings, mainly by reducing support ship requirements. An effective AUV recharge system will be an important element of the Navy's <b>net-centric</b> <b>warfare</b> concept, as well as a valuable tool for commercial marine industries. by Lynn Andrew Gish.
