5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} green pigeon was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon.</b> He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} or Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata) is {{a species of}} pigeon which is most likely extinct. It was first {{mentioned}} and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though {{the idea that it}} was related to the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E

5|$|Recent extractions of DNA {{from the}} dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, {{as well as}} 37 species of doves, has found where in Columbidae the raphines should be placed. Surprisingly, raphines are not the most {{primitive}} columbid, instead they are grouped with the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> as their closest relative, with other closely related birds being the crowned pigeons and tooth-billed pigeon. A third raphine, Raphus solitarius, is now {{considered to be an}} ibis in the genus Threskiornis.|$|E
5|$|The family Columbidae {{previously}} {{also contained}} the family Raphidae, {{consisting of the}} extinct Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo. These species are in all likelihood part of the Indo-Australian radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above, with the fruit doves and pigeons (including the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon).</b> Therefore, they are here included as a subfamily Raphinae, pending better material evidence of their exact relationships.|$|E
5|$|The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> and the Kanaka pigeon (which {{does not appear to}} have had diminished flight abilities) suggests dispersal through island hopping and an origin for the spotted green pigeon in Oceania or southeast Asia. The fact that the closest relatives of Caloenas were the extinct subfamily Raphinae (first demonstrated in a 2002 study), which consists of the dodo from Mauritius and the Rodrigues solitaire from Rodrigues, indicates that the spotted green pigeon could also have originated somewhere in the Indian Ocean. In any case, it seems most likely that the bird inhabited an island location, like its relatives. That the Caloenas pigeons were grouped in a clade at the base of the lineage leading to Raphinae indicates that the ancestors of the flightless dodo and Rodrigues solitaire were able to fly, and reached the Mascarene Islands by island hopping from south Asia.|$|E

5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{was shown to}} be closest to the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon.</b> The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon. The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E

50|$|Birds {{are also}} plentiful, despite the {{presence}} of cats. Possibly the pigs and maybe the cats have extirpated certain ground birds, as indicated by the paucity of Gallicolumba doves and rails. The majestic Sanford's sea-eagle is plentiful, and among rarer birds, the beach thick-knee, crested cuckoo-dove and Kolombangara monarch are found. <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeons</b> and island imperial-pigeons use Tetepare as a foraging ground, crossing over from their roosts in neighboring mangrove swamps in huge numbers. The only known endemic taxon on Tetepare is the plentiful Tetepare white-eye (Zosterops tetiparius tetiparius), a subspecies of the dark-eyed white-eye.|$|R
50|$|The green {{imperial}} pigeon is a large, plump pigeon, 45 cm in length. Its back, {{wings and}} tail are metallic green. The head and underparts are white, apart from maroon undertail coverts. Sexes are similar. The bird's call is deep and resonant, {{and is often}} the first indication {{of the presence of}} this treetop species. The <b>Nicobar</b> imperial <b>pigeon</b> (Ducula nicobarica) is sometimes still considered conspecific.|$|R
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon.</b> This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E

500|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} was scientifically named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, based on Latham's description. The {{original}} binomial name Columba maculata means [...] "spotted pigeon" [...] in Latin. Latham himself accepted this name, {{and used it}} in his 1790 work Index ornithologicus. Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies' specimen, this can therefore be considered the holotype specimen of the species. Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species; James Francis Stephens suggested that it belonged in the fruit pigeon genus Ptilinopus in 1826, and Johann Georg Wagler instead suggested {{that it was a}} juvenile <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Caloenas nicobarica) in 1827. Tommaso Salvadori listed the bird in an appendix about [...] "doubtful species of pigeons, which have not yet been identified" [...] in 1893. In 1898, Henry Ogg Forbes supported the validity of the species, after examining <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon</b> specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development. He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> Caloenas. In 1901, Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert agreed that the pigeon belonged to Caloenas, but suggested that it was probably an [...] "abnormity", though more than one specimen had been recorded.|$|E
500|$|Most {{literature}} {{addressing the}} spotted green pigeon simply repeated Latham's descriptions, adding little new information, until Gibbs published {{a more detailed}} description in 2001, followed by the museum curator Hein van Grouw in 2014. The surviving specimen measures [...] in length, though study specimens are often stretched or compressed during taxidermy, and may therefore not reflect {{the length of a}} living bird. The weight has not been recorded. The spotted green pigeon appears to have been smaller and slenderer than the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> which reaches , and the Kanaka pigeon appears to have been 25% larger than the latter. At [...] in length, the tail is longer than that of the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> but the head is smaller in relation. The bill is , and the tarsus measures [...] Though the wings of the specimen appear to be short and rounded, and have been described as being [...] long, vanGrouw discovered that the five outer primary feathers have been pulled out of each wing, and suggested that the wings would therefore had been about [...] longer in life, around [...] in total. This is in accordance with Latham's 1823 illustration, which shows a bird with longer wings.|$|E

500|$|The {{surviving}} specimen is [...] long, and {{has very}} dark, brownish plumage {{with a green}} gloss. The neck feathers are elongated, {{and most of the}} feathers on the upperparts and wings have a yellowish spot on their tips. It has a black bill with a yellow tip, {{and the end of the}} tail has a pale band. It has relatively short legs and long wings. It has been suggested it had a knob on its bill, but there is no evidence for this. Unlike the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> which is mainly terrestrial, the physical features of the spotted green pigeon suggest it was mainly arboreal, and fed on fruits. It may have been native to an island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean, and it has been suggested that a bird referred to in 1928 as titi by Tahitian islanders was this bird. The spotted green pigeon may have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area, and may have disappeared due to over-hunting and predation by introduced animals.|$|E
500|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} was only {{sporadically}} {{mentioned in the}} literature throughout the 20th century; little new information was published, and the bird remained an enigma. In 2001, Errol Fuller suggested that the bird had been historically overlooked because Rothschild (an avid collector of rare birds) dismissed it as an aberration, perhaps {{because he did not}} own the surviving specimen himself. Fuller considered it a valid, extinct species, and also coined an alternative common name for the bird: the Liverpool pigeon. On the basis of Fuller's endorsement, BirdLife International listed the spotted green pigeon as [...] "Extinct" [...] on the IUCN Red List in 2008; it was previously [...] "Not Recognized". In 2001, the ornithologist David Gibbs stated that the spotted green pigeon was only superficially similar to the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and possibly distinct enough to warrant its own genus (related to Ptilinopus, Ducula, or Gymnophaps). He also hypothesised that the bird might have inhabited a Pacific island, based on stories told by Tahitian islanders in 1928 about a green and white speckled bird called titi. The palaeontologist David Steadman disputed the latter claim in a book review, noting that titi is an onomatopoeic word (resembling the sound of the bird) used especially for shearwaters (members of Procellariidae) in east Polynesia. The ornithologists Julian P. Hume and Michael Walters, writing in 2012, agreed with Gibbs that the bird warranted generic status.|$|E
2500|$|From 1963 to 1977, he made eight {{trips to}} the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, {{accompanied}} by various people on different trips—colleagues from BNHS, researchers, assistants from the Zoological Survey of India, his son Akbar, etc. The aim of the expeditions to the archipelago of around 225 islands was to gather specimens of unknown subspecies, or of subspecies that were till then taxonomically documented as merely [...] "Andamans" [...] or [...] "Nicobars" [...] or [...] "Andamans and Nicobars". Several specimens were obtained during these trips and added to the collection of BNHS: The Otus alius (Nicobar scops owl), the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> the Narcondam hornbill, other birds, fruit bats, flying foxes, frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, etc. His observations {{were published in the}} Journal of the BNHS, which brought to light the nature of fauna in the islands.|$|E
60|$|After {{ten days}} at Langundi, finding it {{impossible}} to get the bird I was particularly in search of (the <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> or a new species allied to it), and finding no new birds, and very few insects, I left early {{on the morning of}} April 1st, and in the evening entered a river on the main island of Batchian (Langundi, like Kasserota, being on a distinct island), where some Malays and Galela men have a small village, and have made extensive rice-fields and plantain grounds. Here we found a good house near the river bank, where the water was fresh and clear, and the owner, a respectable Batchian Malay, offered me sleeping room {{and the use of the}} verandah if I liked to stay. Seeing forest all round within a short distance, I accepted his offer, and the next morning before breakfast walked out to explore, and on the skirts of the forest captured a few interesting insects.|$|E
60|$|On {{the last}} day of my stay here, one of my hunters succeeded in finding and {{shooting}} the beautiful <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> of which I had been so long in search. None of the residents had ever seen it, which shows that it is rare and slay. My specimen was a female in beautiful condition, and the glassy coppery and green of its plumage, the snow-white tail and beautiful pendent feathers of the neck, were greatly admired. I subsequently obtained a specimen in New Guinea; and once saw it in the Kaióa islands. It is found also in some small islands near Macassar, in others near Borneo; and in the Nicobar islands, whence it receives its name. It is a ground feeder, only going upon trees to roost, and is a very heavy fleshy bird. This may account far the fact of its being found chiefly on very small islands, while in the western half of the Archipelago, it seems entirely absent from the larger ones. Being a ground feeder it is subject to the attacks of carnivorous quadrupeds, which are not found in the very small islands. Its wide distribution over the whole length of the Archipelago; from extreme west to east, is however very extraordinary, since, {{with the exception of a}} few of the birds of prey, not a single land bird has so wide a range. Ground-feeding birds are generally deficient in power of extended flight, and this species is so bulky and heavy that it appears at first sight quite unable to fly a mile. A closer examination shows, however, that its wings are remarkably large, perhaps in proportion to its size larger than those of any other pigeon, and its pectoral muscles are immense. A fact communicated to me by the son of my friend Mr. Duivenboden of Ternate, would show that, in accordance with these peculiarities of structure, it possesses the power of flying long distances. Mr. D. established an oil factory on a small coral island, a hundred miles north of New Guinea, with no intervening land. After the island had been settled a year, and traversed in every direction, his son paid it a visit; and just as the schooner was coming to an anchor, a bird was seen flying from seaward which fell into the water exhausted before it could reach the shore. A boat was sent to pick it up, and it was found to be a <b>Nicobar</b> <b>pigeon,</b> which must have come from New Guinea, and flown a hundred miles, since no such bird previously inhabited the island.|$|E
