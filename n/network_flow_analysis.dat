40|$|The flow {{capacity}} of a transportation network can be reduced significantly if its constituent bridges are damaged by natural or man-made hazards. For rapid risk-informed decision making on hazard mitigation and response, it is therefore essential to have a capability to predict the post-hazard {{flow capacity}} of the network efficiently and accurately. However, this is a challenging task due to the uncertainty in hazards and structural damage, and the complex nature of the <b>network</b> <b>flow</b> <b>analysis.</b> Moreover, the bridge structures may experience significant deterioration over their life cycle, which requires time-varying network reliability analysis. This paper proposes a new non-sampling-based approach to estimate the time-varying post-hazard flow {{capacity of a}} bridge transportation network considering structural deterioration of bridges. The proposed approach evaluates the probabilities of structural damage scenarios efficiently using the matrix-based system reliability method and rapidly computes the corresponding flow capacities using a maximum flow capacity analysis algorithm. The matrix-based framework facilitates the integration of these results to obtain the probabilistic distributions and statistical moments of the network flow capacity. It also enables computing various measures useful for risk-informed decision making, such as the conditional {{mean and standard deviation}} of flow capacity given observed structural damage, and component importance measures. In the proposed approach, probability calculation and <b>network</b> <b>flow</b> <b>analysis</b> are performed separately, which renders time-varying post-hazard flow capacity analysis efficient. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example based on the Sioux Falls network under multiple bridge-deterioration scenarios simulating the progress of deterioration. close 111...|$|E
