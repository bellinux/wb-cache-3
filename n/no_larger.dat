5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} to walk on either two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> structures.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, Sheffield Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and Sheffield developed into a small town, <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> than Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s the crucible steel process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E

In the beginning the only large source for uranium ore was the silver mines in Joachimsthal, Austria-Hungary (now Jáchymov, Czech Republic). The uranium ore was only a by-product of the mining activities.|$|R

5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, and there is <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique (positive) common divisor of a and b that is divisible by any other common divisor c.|$|E
5|$|The genus Amphidromus {{is unusual}} in that it {{includes}} species that have dextral shell-coiling and species that have sinistral shell-coiling. In addition, some species within this genus are particularly notable because their populations simultaneously include individuals with left-handed and right-handed shell-coiling. This is an extremely rare phenomenon, and very interesting to biologists. Studies focused on the soft anatomy of Amphidromus are scattered and fragmentary. Information on the internal anatomy is known only from a few species, and <b>no</b> <b>larger,</b> comparative morphological study has ever been carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsidiarity}} principle resolves some {{of these}} issues. The term originates from social thought within the Catholic Church and states that <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> organ shall resolve an issue that can be resolved at a more local level. It {{can be compared to}} federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the subsidiarity principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy.|$|E

She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He breaks down the door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, the National Liberation Front's Military Region 2 {{ordered the}} Viet Cong 261st Battalion and the 514th Battalion, the home {{battalion}} of Dinh Tuong Province, {{to destroy the}} strategic hamlets in their region {{and at the same}} time to attack South Vietnamese sweeping operations. Between 28–30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a Viet Cong radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that the Viet Cong were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed the Viet Cong had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that the Viet Cong unit was <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E
5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E

5|$|Natives of {{the region}} {{encountered}} foreigners at several times and places during the 18thand 19thcenturies. European and American vessels explored the coastal area around {{the mouth of the}} river in the late 18thcentury, trading with local natives. The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic. Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793. From 1805 to 1807, the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers, and encountered numerous small settlements of natives. Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors. They also noted brass teakettles, a British musket, and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes. From the earliest contact with westerners, the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal, but instead congregated in social units <b>no</b> <b>larger</b> than a village, and more often at a family level; these units would shift with the season as people moved about, following the salmon catch up and down the river's tributaries.|$|E
