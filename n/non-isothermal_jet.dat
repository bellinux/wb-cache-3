Therefore, {{it is very important to}} reveal the characteristics of the secondary airflow equipment with nozzle's jet. In this paper, the characteristics of secondary airflow equipment and its air jet were researched through experiment. The experiment results on secondary airflow equipment performance showed that air volume, air static pressure, power and sound pressure level of the equipment would increase along with the increase of rotation speed under the same air nozzle diameters. And the results on air jet track illustrated that when the horizontal distance increased, the axis velocity of secondary airflow decreased both in isothermal jet and <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jet</b> conditions. Through this experiment, the characteristic parameters of the secondary airflow equipment were provided for actual construction design...|$|E
40|$|Title of vol. 1 : Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), {{building}} related {{diseases and}} human responseA simple physical model is employed {{to investigate the}} coupled evaporation and movement of droplets expelled during respiratory activities, which is essential for studying the transmission route of some respiratory infectious diseases. The exhaled air is treated as a steady <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jet</b> horizontally issuing into stagnant surrounding and then the droplet is simulated to evaporate and move in this jet. Numerical calculations have been performed for physiological saline droplet, which focus {{on the study of}} droplet lifetime and how the droplet size changes, as well as how far the droplet moves. The results indicated that the droplet size predominately decides its evaporation and movement after being expelled. The sizes of the largest droplets that could totally evaporate before falling 2 meters were derived, as well as the maximum horizontal distances that droplets could reach during different respiratory activities. The effect of relative humidity on the dispersal of droplets in air was discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{infectious}} diseases {{are believed to be}} transmitted between people via large droplets and by airborne routes. An understanding of evaporation and dispersion of droplets and droplet nuclei is not only significant for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases but also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. How far droplets can move is related to how far droplet-borne diseases can transmit. A simple physical model is developed and used here to investigate the evaporation and movement of droplets expelled during respiratory activities; in particular, the well-known Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets is revisited considering the effect of relative humidity, air speed, and respiratory jets. Our simple model considers the movement of exhaled air, as well as the evaporation and movement of a single droplet. Exhaled air is treated as a steady-state non-isothermal (warm) jet horizontally issuing into stagnant surrounding air. A droplet is assumed to evaporate and move in this <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jet.</b> Calculations are performed for both pure water droplets and droplets of sodium chloride (physiological saline) solution (0. 9 % w/v). We calculate the droplet lifetimes and how droplet size changes, as well as how far the droplets travel in different relative humidities. Our results indicate that a droplet's size predominately dictates its evaporation and movement after being expelled. The sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are determined under different conditions. The maximum horizontal distances that droplets can reach during different respiratory activities are also obtained. Our study is useful for developing effective prevention measures for controlling infectious diseases in hospitals and in the community at large. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Visualization and {{measuring}} methods using a fog can be effectively {{applied to the}} research of ventilation and warm air heating. These methods allow visualization of airflow boundaries, and from that airflow shapes, ventilation efficiency, etc. can be deduced. In the course of research of air jet from ventilation outlets, {{it is possible to}} use visual recordings to evaluate mainly the length of the marginal zone and the expansion angle in the main zone, which in turn determines the outlet constant for example. Analysis of <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jets</b> easily enables evaluation of jet axis position, while dynamic visual recordings permit the qualitative evaluation of jet stability, jet direction, etc. This paper outlines various examples of visual recordings whose results can be extrapolated towards further quantitative analysis of flows in ventilated and heated spaces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThermal {{effects on}} the sound {{generation}} by vortex pairing are investigated in axisymmetric subsonic jets. Direct numerical simu- lation of compressible Navier-Stokes equations is performed for an accurate description of near-field flow dynamics and far-field sound. As the core temperature increasing, the positions of vortex roll-up and pairing move upstream, and the noise intensity is enhanced. In addition, sound predicted by Lilley-Goldstein acoustic analogy {{is consistent with the}} result of simulation in all cases. A further analysis of sound sources of the Lilley-Goldstein equation shows that the thermodynamic component has remarkable influence in <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jets,</b> especially in the cold one. Moreover, sound generation in the isothermal jet is specifically studied by a simple nonlinear interaction model based on instability waves which are obtained by solving linear parabolized stability equa- tions. The major radiation pattern given by the model is found to be in good agreement with the directly computed data, suggesting the great importance of nonlinear interaction in subsonic jet noise...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the fluid mechanics of a ventilation system formed by a momentum source and buoyancy sources. We investigate {{the interaction between}} plumes and a <b>non-isothermal</b> air <b>jet</b> for separate sources of buoyancy produced by the plume and {{the momentum of the}} air jet. The mathematical model represents the situation in which a plume rises from two heat sources causing buoyancy. The model is used to discuss the interactions involved. The effects of parameters such as the power of the source and the air-flow volume used in the mathematical-physical model are also discussed. An expression is deduced for the trajectory of the <b>non-isothermal</b> air <b>jet</b> penetrated by plumes. Experiments were also carried out to illustrate the effect on the flow of the air jet and to validate the theoretical work. The results show that the buoyancy source’s efforts to baffle the descent of the cold air have even been effective in reversing the direction of the trajectory. However, increasing the distance between the plumes can reduce the effect of the plumes on the jet curve. And it is apparent that when the velocity of the air supply increases, the interference caused by the plumes can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} conceptions and methods for visual {{representation}} of research numerical {{results in the}} problems of fluid mechanics and gas. The three-dimensional nature of unsteady flow being simulated creates significant difficulties for the visual representation of results. It complicates control and understanding of numerical data, and exchange and processing of obtained information about the flow field. Approaches to vortical flows visualization with the usage of gradients of primary and secondary scalar and vector fields are discussed. An overview of visualization techniques for vortical flows using different definitions of the vortex and its identification criteria is given. Visualization examples for some solutions of gas dynamics problems related to calculations of jets and cavity flows are presented. Ideas of the vortical structure of the free <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jet</b> {{and the formation of}} coherent vortex structures in the mixing layer are developed. Analysis of formation patterns for spatial flows inside large-scale vortical structures within the enclosed space of the cubic lid-driven cavity is performed. The singular points of the vortex flow in a cubic lid-driven cavity are found {{based on the results of}} numerical simulation; their type and location are identified depending on the Reynolds number. Calculations are performed with fine meshes and modern approaches to the simulation of vortical flows (direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation). Paradigm of graphical programming and COVISE virtual environment are used for the visual representation of computational results. Application that implements the visualization of the problem is represented as a network which links are modules and each of them is designed to solve a case-specific problem. Interaction between modules is carried out by the input and output ports (data receipt and data transfer) giving the possibility to use various input and output devices...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the Direct Numerical Simulation of non-isothermal turbulent flows laden with solid {{particles in the}} dilute regime. The focus is set on the accurate prediction of heat transfer between phases and of particles dispersion. The dispersed phase is described by an Eulerian approach : the Mesoscopic Eulerian Formalism [41, 123], recently extended to non-isothermal flows [78]. The main objective of this work is to assess the ability of this formalism to accurately account for both dynamic and thermal inertia of particles in turbulent sheared flows. The CFD code used in this work is AVBP. The numerical simulation of dilute sprays with an Eulerian approach calls for specific modelling and raises additional numerical issues. First, the numerical methods implemented in AVBP for two-phase flows [69, 103, 109] were tested and revisited. The objective was to propose an accurate and robust numerical strategy that withstands the steep gradients of particle volume fraction due to preferential concentration [132] with a limited numerical diffusion. These numerical strategies have been tested {{on a series of}} test cases of increasing complexity and relevant diagnostics were proposed. In particular, the two-dimensional vortex laden with solid particles was suggested as a simple configuration to illustrate the effect of particle inertia on their concentration profile and to test numerical strategies. An analytical solution was also derived in the limit of small inertia. Moreover, dissipations due to numerics and to physical effects were explicitly extracted and quantified. Eventually, the numerical strategy coupling the highorder centered scheme TTGC with a stabilization technique –the so called artificial viscosity– proved to be the most accurate and robust alternative in AVBP if an adequate set-up is used (i. e. sensors). Then, the issue of the accurate prediction of particle dispersion in configurations with a mean shear was adressed. One of the RUM model (denoted AXISY-C), proposed by Masi [78] and implemented by Sierra [120], was successfully validated in a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jet</b> laden with solid particles. Contrary to the former RUM models [63, 103], the main statistics of the dispersed phase were recovered at both the center and the edges of the jet. Finally, the impact of the thermal inertia of particles on their temperature statistics has been investigated. The results showed a strong dependency of these statistics to thermal inertia, pinpointing the necessity of the numerical approaches to account for this phenomenon. Therefore, the extension of the MEF to non isothermal conditions, i. e. the RUM heat fluxes, has been implemented in AVBP. The impact of the RUM HF terms on the temperature statistics was evaluated in both configurations of 2 D and 3 D jets. Eulerian solutions were compared with Lagrangian reference computations carried out by B. Leveugle at CORIA and by E. Masi at IMFT for the 2 D and 3 D jets, respectively. Results showed a strong positive impact of the RUM HF on the fluctuations of mesoscopic temperature, {{and to a lesser extent}} on the mean mesoscopic temperature depending of the configuration. Neglecting the RUM HF leads to erroneous results whereas the Lagrangian statistics are recovered when they are accounted for...|$|E
40|$|To {{satisfy the}} optimal {{environment}} in agricultural buildings, much effort {{is made to}} control ventilation rate and indoor temperature. However, distribution of fresh air is equally important for animal performance and welfare. So far, no sensor is available to measure and to control airflow pattern continuously in a ventilated building. Therefore, an airflow pattern sensor was developed to measure the trajectory of a <b>non-isothermal</b> air <b>jet</b> in a building with a single or multiple air inlet(s). The experimental conditions covered the whole year characteristics {{to come up with}} a general conclusion in an experimental room of 8 m x 4 in x 4 m. The principle of the airflow pattern sensor is to predict the trajectory of a <b>non-isothermal</b> air <b>jet</b> from the temperature distribution measured near to the air inlet. As seen from data analysis, a prediction of the airflow pattern in terms of drop distance was possible with an error of 0. 87 in in the range from 2. 40 to 7. 15 in using eight temperature sensors on an arc around the inlet opening in combination with inlet and outlet temperatures of the room. The sensor was found to be useful for on-line control of the airflow pattern. (c) 2004 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a numerical method {{developed by the}} author and its applications for computing the generated sound by an unsteady flow field and its propagation. The full equations of motion for compressible and unsteady flows describe both flow field and sound generation and propagation. It is assumed that the flow variables can be decomposed into semi-compressible / incompressible components and inviscid, irrotational acoustic components. The present method is based on Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to compute the turbulent flow and an approach based on an inhomogeneous wave equation to compute the radiated acoustic field. In this way one can avoid the necessity for a very large computational effort associated with direct simulation of the near- and specially far- field sound generated by a turbulent flow. The governing equations are written {{in the form of}} a non-homogeneous wave equation for the acoustic fluctuation with acoustic sources on the right-hand side. The thesis includes the details of the coupling between the flow solver and the acoustic one, as well as the results for test cases employed to validate the numerical algorithm and the implemented boundary conditions. The method has been successfully applied to compute the near- and far- acoustic fields generated by various unsteady flows such as a round hot turbulent jet ejected from a pipe close to a solid boundary, coaxial turbulent <b>non-isothermal</b> <b>jets</b> (separate exhaust system), or the flow around a wind-turbine...|$|R
40|$|A circular, free, turbulent, {{incompressible}} and <b>non-isothermal</b> air <b>jet</b> is simulated {{by using}} a LES approach. The simulation is validated by comparing with experimental and numerical data taken from the literature the axial distributions of mean centreline axial velocity and temperature as well as radial profiles of mean velocity, mean temperature and of direct second order moments of velocity components. Subsequently, the jet behaviour related to its vortical structures is studied. In the first 5 - 6 D downstream from the orifice, the presence of vortex rings affects the velocity and temperature fields. The spatiotemporal visualisation of the traces that vortex rings design on two parallel lines to the jet axis, permits to graphically compute their convection velocity, frequency of emergence, size and axial progression before breaking-up. These results are also supported by the spectral analysis carried out on a Boolean function (a spatiotemporal indicator {{of the presence of}} a vortex) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop an {{experimentally}} validated computational model for the lower plenum of High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGR), three separate Large Eddy Simulation (LES) studies are conducted. First, detailed study is made of LES for an isothermal turbulent jet, which is compared to well-accepted experimental data. Inconsistencies in the literature surrounding the Reynolds number dependence for the turbulent statistics are comprehensively addressed. Second, a non-isothermal LES study of flow over a cylinder is conducted, and includes comparison between experimental data and LES for different subcritical Reynolds numbers. The final study is that of LES for a <b>non-isothermal</b> round <b>jet,</b> where {{the effect of a}} precursor simulation is found to play a vital role for capturing the underlying physics within the turbulent Navier Stokes and energy equations. Good agreement is obtained between our LES predictions and experimental measurements in both near-field and far-field data.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of <b>non-isothermal</b> swirling <b>jets</b> undergoing vortex breakdown, {{with an emphasis on}} helical coherent structures. It is proposed that the dominant helical coherent structure can be suppressed by heating the recirculation bubble. This proposition is assessed with Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the breakdown region of isothermal and heated swirling jets. The coherent kinetic energy of the dominant helical structure was derived from PIV snapshots via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. For one set of experimental parameters, mild heating is found to increase the energy content of the dominant helical mode. Strong heating leads to a reduction by 30 % of the coherent structures energy. For a second set of experimental parameters, no alteration of the dominant coherent structure is detectable. Local linear stability analysis of the time-averaged velocity fields shows that the key difference between the two configurations is the density ratio at the respective wavemaker location. A density ratio of approximately 0. 8 is found to correlate to a suppression of the global mode in the experiments. A parametric study with model density and velocity profiles indicates the most important parameters that govern the local absolute growth rate: The density ratio and the relative position of the density profiles and the inner shear layer...|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{temperature}} fluctuations of <b>non-isothermal</b> turbulent <b>jets</b> are encountered in many engineering applications including liquid metal cooled fast reactors (LMFR), {{and can cause}} thermal stresses on solid boundaries. An accurate prediction of the {{temperature fluctuations}} is important to assess potential thermal fatigue damage to components, and traditionally this {{has been done by}} RANS turbulence modelling calculations with limited success. In this study, a large eddy simulation (LES) technique was applied to predict the temperature fluctuations of thermal striping observed in a triple jet. The triple jet model was used as a mock-up of the outlet of fuel subassemblies in a nuclear fast reactor. The results show that LES predicted the highly oscillatory nature of unsteady thermal mixing of the triple jet. The LES results were in good agreement with the available experimental data in terms of mean, RMS, skewness and kurtosis. The large amplitude of the temperature fluctuations associated with the thermal striping was captured correctly, demonstrating that LES can be used to analyse unsteady characteristics of thermal striping. Instantaneous and time mean thermal fields were further analysed to assess the capability and accuracy of LES in the thermal striping study. The Spalart–Allmaras and realisable k − ε turbulence models were also considered along with LES. It is found that these turbulence models produced a very small amplitude of fluctuations, and failed to predict the correct magnitude of unsteady thermal fluctuations, highlighting the limitations of the RANS approach in unsteady heat transfer simulations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn dilute {{two-phase}} flows, accurate {{prediction of}} {{the temperature of}} the dis- persed phase can be of paramount importance. Indeed, processes such as evaporation or chemical reactions are strongly non-linear functions of heat transfer between the carrier and dispersed phases. This study is devoted to the validation of an Eulerian description of the dispersed phase -the Meso- scopic Eulerian Formalism (MEF) - in the case of non-isothermal flows. Di- rect numerical simulations using the MEF are compared to a reference La- grangian simulation for a two-dimensional <b>non-isothermal</b> turbulent <b>jet</b> laden with solid particles. The objectives of this paper are (1) to study the influ- ence of the thermal inertia of particles on their temperature distribution and (2) conduct an a posteriori validation of the MEF, which was recently ex- tended to non-isothermal flows. The focus is on the influence of additional terms in the MEF governing equations, namely heat fluxes arising from the Random Uncorrelated Motion (RUM). Results show that mean and rms of particle temperature are strongly dependent of the thermal Stokes number. The mean temperature is satisfactorily predicted by the MEF, comparing to the Lagrangian reference. Under the conditions of the present study, the RUM heat fluxes have a marginal influence on the mean particle tempera- ture. However, a significant impact was observed on the magnitude of particle temperature fluctuations. Neglecting the RUM heat fluxes leads to erroneous results while the Lagrangian statistics are recovered when it is accounted for in the regimes of low to moderate thermal Stokes number...|$|R
40|$|The viscous linear {{stability}} of parallel gaseous jets with piecewise constant base profiles is {{considered in the}} limit of low Mach numbers. Our results generalise those of Drazin [P. G. Drazin, Discontinuous velocity profiles for the Orr–Sommerfeld equation J. Fluid Mech. 10 (1961) 571 – 583], by contemplating the possibility of arbitrary jumps in density and transport properties between two uniform streams separated by a vortex sheet. The eigenfunctions, obtained analytically in the regions of uniform flow, are matched through an appropriate set of jump conditions at the discontinuity of the basic flow, which are derived by repeated integration of the linearised conservation equations in their primitive variable form. The development leads to an algebraic dispersion relation of ample validity that explicitly accounts for the parametric dependence of the stability properties on the jet-to-ambient density ratio, the Reynolds number, the Prandtl number, and the exponent of the presumed power-law dependence of viscosity and thermal conductivity on temperature. The dispersion relation is validated through comparisons with stability calculations performed with continuous profiles and is applied, in particular, to study the effects of molecular transport on the spatiotemporal {{stability of}} parallel <b>non-isothermal</b> gaseous <b>jets</b> with very thin shear layers. The eigenvalue computations performed by using the vortex-sheet model are shown to be several orders of magnitude faster than those associated with continuous profiles with thin shear layers.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulation {{is used to}} study turbulent plane wall-jets. The investigation is aimed at studying dynamics, mixing and reactions in wall bounded flows. The produced mixing statistics {{can be used to}} evaluate and develop models for mixing and combustion. An aim has also been to develop a simulation method that can be extended to simulate realistic combustion including significant heat release. The numerical code used in the simulations employs a high order compact finite difference scheme for spatial integration, and a low-storage Runge-Kutta method for the temporal integration. In the simulations the inlet based Reynolds and Mach numbers of the wall-jet are Re = 2000 and M= 0. 5 respectively, and above the jet a constant coflow of 10 % of the inlet jet velocity is applied. The development of an isothermal wall-jet including passive scalar mixing is studied and the characteristics of the wall-jet are compared to observations of other canonical shear flows. In the near-wall region the jet resembles a zero pressure gradient boundary layer, while in the outer layer it resembles a plane jet. The scalar fluxes in the streamwise and wall-normal direction are of comparable magnitude. In order to study effects of density differences, two non-isothermal wall-jets are simulated and compared to the isothermal jet results. In the <b>non-isothermal</b> cases the <b>jet</b> is either warm and propagating in a cold surrounding or vice versa. The turbulence structures and the range of scales are affected by the density variation. The warm jet contains the largest range of scales and the cold the smallest. The differences {{can be explained by the}} varying friction Reynolds number. Conventional wall scaling fails due to the varying density. An improved collapse in the inner layer can be achieved by applying a semi-local scaling. The turbulent Schmidt and Prandtl number vary significantly only in the near-wall layer and in a small region below the jet center. A wall-jet including a single reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer is also simulated. The reactants are injected separately at the inlet and the reaction time scale is of the same order as the convection time scale and independent of the temperature. The reaction occurs in thin reaction zones convoluted by high intensity velocity fluctuations. QC 2010062...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{fluctuations}} {{are known}} {{to occur in the}} mixing region of non-isothermal flows, and can cause undesired thermal stresses. One relevant application where this is a major concern is the very high temperature gas reactor (VHTR), a next generation nuclear reactor, which uses helium as the primary coolant. In the lower plenum of the VHTR, coolant enters from multiple channels at different temperatures and mixes together before being routed to a gas turbine or hydrogen production facility. Incomplete mixing of the coolant can be the root of thermal stresses both within the lower plenum as well as downstream components (e. g., gas turbine blades). For acceptable predictions of this phenomenon, fundamentally based experiments along with properly verified and validated models are needed. The objectives of this study are to gain insight into the thermal loading conditions expected in the VHTR lower plenum and provide valuable experimental validation data for current and future modeling efforts. To this end, an experimental study is conducted for three <b>non-isothermal</b> parallel round <b>jets</b> whose axis to axis separation distance is 1. 41 jet diameters. A central cold jet is surrounded on either side by an adjacent hot jet in a planar configuration with air as the working fluid. All of the jets are turbulent with a jet Reynolds number between 5. 5 × 103 and 1. 8 × 104, and the mixing is quantified via temperature measurements on a flat polycarbonate plate mounted parallel to the axial direction of the jets. The full field temperatures of the plate surface are captured via infrared thermography. Two different plate to jet spacings are considered: 0. 5 and 1. 0 jet diameters. Other variables include the cold to hot jet velocity ratio, set at three levels of 0. 50, 1. 00, and 1. 51, and the temperature difference between the cold and hot jets, set at two different values of 33. 3 ˚C and 44. 4 ˚C. Horizontal line traces of the plate surface temperature are analyzed in the range of 2 - 20 jet diameters downstream. The line traces suggest that with decreasing velocity ratios, the induced turbulence provided by higher jet velocities promotes mixing further upstream. Results also suggest the most severe temperature gradients on the plate surface occur in the area that is characteristic of the convective mixing region (8 to 16 jet diameters downstream). Observations of the maximum surface temperature on the plate describe the influence of the plate to jet spacings in the entrance region (2 to 8 jet diameters downstream) in that with increased spacing, the maximum temperatures are closer to the axial center of the cold jet. Past the entrance region and with increasing values of jet velocity ratio, the maximum temperature location spreads much more rapidly. The thermal mixing initiated further upstream by increasing values of jet velocity ratios and the rapid spreading of maximum plate surface temperatures for decreasing jet velocity ratios are both notable concerns in the analysis of reactor coolant channel outlet conditions and their thermal hydraulic interactions with solid boundaries. This research represents preliminary predictions of the thermal loading in the VHTR lower plenum and provides validation data for fundamental and applied thermal mixing simulations...|$|R
