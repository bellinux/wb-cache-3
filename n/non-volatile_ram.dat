Backscatter at acoustic frequencies above 20 kHz is useful for profiling those quantities, which, when tracked over long periods of time, can provide a valuable contribution to understanding and monitoring the state of marine ecosystems. The Water Column Profiler^TM is a self-contained echosounder, designed for long-term, autonomous operation. The instrument can be used in either downward-looking mode, from a moored surface buoy, or in upward-looking mode from a submerged mooring. The instrument has selectable parameters for pulse length and sampling interval. The data are recorded in digital form, and averaging in both time and range is available. On-board storage of up to 64 Mbytes of <b>non-volatile</b> Flash <b>RAM</b> allows operation for periods up to 6 months in length for 150 m water depth sampled at 1 m intervals every minute.

40|$|Modern {{computer}} systems feature memory hierarchies which typically include DRAM {{as the main}} memory and HDD as the secondary storage. DRAM and HDD have been extensively used {{for the past several}} decades because of their high performance and low cost per bit at their level of hierarchy. Unfortunately, DRAM is facing serious scaling and power consumption problems, while HDD has suffered from stagnant performance improvement and poor energy efficiency. After all, computer system architects have an implicit consensus that there is no hope to improve future system’s performance and power consumption unless something fundamentally changes. To address the looming problems with DRAM and HDD, emerging <b>Non-Volatile</b> <b>RAMs</b> (NVRAMs) such as Phase Change Memory (PCM) or Spin-Transfer-Toque Magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) have been actively explored as new media of future memory hierarchy. However, since these NVRAMs have quite different characteristics from DRAM and HDD, integrating NVRAMs into conventional memory hierarchy requires significant architectural re-considerations and changes, imposing additional and complicated design trade-offs on the memory hierarchy design. This work assumes a future system in which both main memory and secondary storage include NVRAMs and are placed on the same memory bus. In this system organization, this dissertation work has addressed a problem facing the efficient exploitation of NVRAMs and DRAM integrated into a future platform’s memory hierarchy. Especially, this dissertation has investigated the system performance and lifetime improvement endowed by a novel system architecture called Memorage which co-manages all available physical NVRAM resources for main memory and storage at a system-level. Also, the work has studied the impact of a model-guided, hardware-driven page swap in a hybrid main memory on the application performance. Together, the two ideas enable a future system to ameliorate high system performance degradation under heavy memory pressure and to avoid an inefficient use of DRAM capacity due to injudicious page swap decisions. In summary, this research has not only demonstrated how emerging NVRAMs can be effectively employed and integrated in order to enhance the performance and endurance of a future system, but also helped system architects understand important design trade-offs for emerging NVRAMs based memory and storage systems...|$|R

50|$|Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) {{is a form}} of {{computer}} data storage. A random-access device allows stored data to be accessed directly in any random order. In contrast, other data storage media such as hard disks, CDs, DVDs and magnetic tape, as well as early primary memory types such as drum memory, read and write data only in a predetermined order, consecutively, because of mechanical design limitations. Therefore, the time to access a given data location varies significantly depending on its physical location.Today, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuits. Strictly speaking, modern types of DRAM are not random access, as data is read in bursts, although the name DRAM / RAM has stuck. However, many types of SRAM, ROM, OTP, and NOR flash are still random access even in a strict sense. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as DRAM memory modules), where its stored information is lost if the power is removed. Many other types of <b>non-volatile</b> memory are <b>RAM</b> as well, including most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called NOR-Flash. The first RAM modules to come into the market were created in 1951 and were sold until the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|R

40|$|We present FlashStore, a high {{throughput}} persistent key-value store, {{that uses}} flash memory as a <b>non-volatile</b> cache between <b>RAM</b> and hard disk. FlashStore {{is designed to}} store the working set of key-value pairs on flash and use one flash read per key lookup. As the working set changes over time, space is made for the current working set by destag-ing recently unused key-value pairs to hard disk and recy-cling pages in the flash store. FlashStore organizes key-value pairs in a log-structure on flash to exploit faster sequential write performance. It uses an in-memory hash table to index them, with hash collisions resolved by a variant of cuckoo hashing. The in-memory hash table stores compact key sig-natures instead of full keys so as to strike tradeoffs between RAM usage and false flash read operations. FlashStore {{can be used as}} a high throughput persistent key-value storage layer for a broad range of server class ap-plications. We compare FlashStore with BerkeleyDB, an embedded key-value store application, running on hard disk and flash separately, so as to bring out the performance gain of FlashStore in not only using flash as a cache above hard disk but also in its use of flash aware algorithms. We use real-world data traces from two data center applica-tions, namely, Xbox LIVE Primetime online multi-player game and inline storage deduplication, to drive and evalu-ate the design of FlashStore on traditional and low power server platforms. FlashStore outperforms BerkeleyDB by up to 60 x on throughput (ops/sec), up to 50 x on energy efficiency (ops/Joule), and up to 85 x on cost efficiency (ops/sec/dollar) on the evaluated datasets. 1...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{resistance}} switching effect has drawn attention withinthe scientific {{community as a}} potential candidate for <b>non-volatile</b> random accessmemories (<b>RAM)</b> and crossbar logic concepts. The resistance switching memorycells are based on (at least) two well-defined non-volatile resistance states, e. g.,high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS), that define two (ormore) logic memory states, e. g., 1 or 0. Often these cells have a simple capacitorstructure and are therefore easy to fabricate. However, the market launch ofRRAMs is hindered by several serious obstacles. For example, the underlyingmicroscopical physical and chemical switching mechanism of RRAM devicesis still under debate although various models have been proposed to explainthe observed phenomena. By missing a deep understanding of the resistiveswitching eect on an atomistic scale, a reliable fabrication of predictable andwell performing Gbit memory seems to be questionable. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} develop and physically understand the nickel oxide(NiO) based resistive switching non-volatile memory devices. Although theunderlying microscopical switching mechanism is still under debate, the macroscopicswitching mechanism of this material system is often described by thecreation and rupture of well-conducting nickel flaments embedded within aninsulating NiO matrix, the so called fuse-antifuse mechanism. The resistiveswitching characteristics, essentials for future non-volatile memories, such aslow voltage and current operation with high resistance ratio between HRS andLRS, fast switching speed, high retention and endurance are presented. Additionally, the emphasis is layed on the understanding of the so called formingprocess. It describes the first resistance transition of the resistive switchingdevice in which the proposed nickel flament is formed. Therefore, it is the keyprocess for understanding the resistive switching phenomena. The statistical distributionof the observed forming process is studied under accelerated constantvoltage stress conditions and at varying temperatures within the framework ofthe Weibull statistics. To understand the physical and chemical nature of the flamentary structure,the inuence of different ambient atmospheres and temperatures on the formingprocess is analyzed electrically as well as chemically by XPS analysis. Combiningthese results with the results of the potentiostatic breakdown studies, a modelfor the forming process in Pt/NiO/Pt non-volatile resistive switching memorydevices is proposed...|$|R
