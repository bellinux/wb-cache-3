5|$|Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Leatherface. He regarded Leatherface as being mentally retarded and having <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke. John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits.|$|E
5|$|Caudy <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> {{write in}} English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred {{on his property}} south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E

25|$|Pavarotti {{began the}} serious study {{of music in}} 1954 {{at the age of}} 19 with Arrigo Pola, a {{respected}} teacher and professional tenor in Modena who offered to teach him without remuneration.

25|$|As his {{eyesight}} deteriorated, Borges relied increasingly on his mother's help. When he was {{not able}} to read and write anymore (he <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read Braille), his mother, to whom he had always been close, became his personal secretary. When Perón returned from exile and was re-elected president in 1973, Borges immediately resigned as director of the National Library.|$|E

25|$|Berlioz {{was not a}} child prodigy, {{unlike some}} other famous composers of the time; he began {{studying}} music at age 12, writing small compositions and arrangements. As {{a result of his}} father's discouragement, he <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> play the piano, a peculiarity he later described as both beneficial and detrimental. He became proficient at guitar, flageolet and flute. He learned harmony from textbooks alone—he was not formally trained. The majority of his early compositions were romances and chamber pieces.|$|E
25|$|Morricone {{never left}} Rome to compose his music and <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak English. But {{given that the}} {{composer}} has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, {{and then as a}} composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|Though she <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read notes, {{she had a}} great natural {{talent and}} could quickly learn her part in a song simply by having heard it once. Her voice was {{described}} {{as that of a}} nightingale, and when Jeanette Wässelius, successor of Caroline Halle-Müller, retired in 1820, Henriette replaced her as Sweden's first prima donna, in competition with Elisabeth Frösslind and Anna Sofia Sevelin. Her salary reflected her position. She was paid 1.600; as comparison, the male actor with the highest salary was paid 1.800, and the lowest salary for an actress was 200.|$|E

25|$|Many {{photographs}} and films {{from the early}} years show the life around Johnny Stark's villa in Roquefort-la-Bédoule (south of France). The villa, also named La Bédoule, allowed everyone to escape from Paris and relax. The home supported Johnny's telephone addiction with 28 telephones, with each car also having a phone. Mathieu lived here with her aunt Irène, and brothers and sisters would often visit. The pool {{was designed to be}} shallow all around, and deep in the center, as Mireille has a fear of drowning, and <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> swim. The property was sold after Johnny's divorce.|$|E
25|$|She <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read or write, {{and only}} learned to sign {{when she was}} already an adult. Her family were {{in dire need of}} money, so she started to sing {{regularly}} as a professional in the Taberna de Ceferino, in Seville, and then spent a period in Madrid and Bilbao. In this town, she was not allowed to sing in public owing to her young age, so she sat as model for painter Ignacio Zuloaga. Back in Andalusia, she took part in the performances of several cafés cantante in Jerez, Seville, Málaga and other towns. In 1910 she made her first recordings, and in 1920 the Teatro Romea was paying her the highest fee it had ever paid to an artist. After that, she started a long series of tours in all Spain.|$|E
25|$|Greenland {{was always}} colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion {{of the soil}} was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland {{settlements}} may not have recognized {{until it was too}} late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation. A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food. But they <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.|$|E

25|$|From {{that time}} she was an indefatigable reader, troubling her parents only by her devotion to books {{rather than to the}} play natural to her age. Her father had a {{considerable}} library, the contents of every book in which she made her own, always preferring history, — before she had finished her 10th year being acquainted with Hume, Gibbon, Alison, and kindred writers. At this point, she was sent away to school. Her father and mother, seeing the intellect for which they were responsible, took all possible pains with her education, and fortunately her physical strength was sufficient to carry her through an uninterrupted course in different academies and a series of lessons with masters at home. She cared more for languages and natural sciences, in which she was very proficient, than for most other studies, and took no especial pleasure in mathematics. Booth's superior education was not given her at school, where she learned less than she did by herself, for she showed very young that disdain of obstacles and that taste for literature which were two strong points in her character. She was only a tiny child when she taught herself French. A stray French primer fell into her hands, and she became interested in spelling out the French words and comparing them with the English ones, and continued to study in this way. Later she acquired German in the same manner, and being self-taught, and not hearing either language, she <b>never</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak them, but made herself so proficient in them in after years that she could translate almost any book from either German or French at sight, reading them aloud in English.|$|E

After returning from the convent, she was educated at home in housekeeping, sewing and crafts. In 1806 Cadron took First Communion.|$|E
