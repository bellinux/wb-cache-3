40|$|Children are an {{important}} market segment and so marketers frame and direct ad messages to them to seek a favourable response. Advertisements are particularly targeted at children as they have consider-able influence over family food purchases. Parents are concerned about extensive exposure of children to ads (foods particularly) which affect consumption behaviour of their children. The {{nature and extent of}} mediation that parents undertake to protect their children against <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> is seen to be influenced by their attitude towards advertising. As mothers are seen to be the primary car-egivers to children, the article explores the attitude of mothers towards advertising on TV in general, children advertising and food advertising directed at children in India. The findings of the present article highlight that Indian mothers hold negative attitude towards advertising in general, for ads directed at children and also for food ads on TV. They strongly voice that promotions are directed at children in an unethical manner. Attitude of mothers towards advertising in general and towards food advertising is found to be different for younger versus older children...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to disentangle the effect on meat product consumption <b>of</b> generic <b>advertising</b> from that <b>of</b> nonadvertising-related food health information. Using quarterly data from 1976 to 2000, a linearized Almost Ideal Demand System was estimated for beef, pork, poultry, and fish. Simulation results indicate that the increased food health concerns for fat and cholesterol have resulted in a 6 % reduction in the consumption of beef per capita per quarter since 1987, and an 18 % increase in the poultry consumption. The results also indicate that there is a significant <b>negative</b> spill-over <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> beef <b>advertising</b> on pork consumption and vice versa. However, a positive spill-over <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> pork <b>advertising</b> on poultry consumption is also identified. [Econlit citations: D 120, Q 110, Q 130 ]. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Earlier (mostly experimental) {{studies have}} shown that the use of spokes {{characters}} might help to promote healthy food amongst children (De Droog, Valkenburg, and Buijzen, 2011; Lapierre, Vaala, and Linebarger, 2011; Smits and Vandebosch, 2012). However, it might be too far fetched to conclude that in real-life situations, this marketing strategy will indeed be effective in making children eat fruits and vegetables, since parents could resist to buy commercially marketed heatlhy foods (Morley, Chapman, Mehta, King, Swinburn & Wakefield, 2008). In this paper we investigate the attitude of parents towards the use of a celebrity spokes character for the promotion of a unhealthy product (i. e. a biscuit) versus a healthy product (i. e. a kiwi). We also explore how these attitudes towards endorsed foods are predicted by their general advertising attitude (Metha, 2000), their opinions regarding the <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> food <b>advertising</b> on children’s eating habits and nagging behaviour (Preston, 2005; Chan and McNeal, 2003; Yu, 2012; Marshall, O’Donohoe), as well as their opinions regarding the specific nagging effects induced by celebrity endorsers and the perceived liking of the (unhealthy or unhealthy) celebrity endorsed product by their child (compared to a similar unendorsed product). Control variables are: the sex, age and education level of the parents. Data were gathered amongst a purposive sample of parents of (at least one) child between 2 - 6 years old, who were contacted via 4 pre-schools and 5 kinder gartens in Belgium (as to reach a diverse population). A total of 616 printed versions of the standardised questionnaire were distributed via these institutions. 292 of them (response rate = 47, 4 %) were returned to the researcher. The standardized questionnaire was filled out by one of the parents (in 87 % of cases the mother). The results show that parents often have a negative attitude towards advertising in general, think advertising promotes unhealthy food habits amongst children, and makes them request (endorsed) products from their parents. However, when confronted with concrete examples of endorsed foods, most parents do not consider the use of the celebrity gnome on the packaging as problematic, not for the kiwi, neither for the biscuit. Those who are most skeptical, hold more negative general conceptions about advertising. The perceived preference of the child for the endorsed product also plays a role : parents who think their child would like the endorsed fruit more than a comparable (not endorsed) fruit, are less skeptical towards the use of an endorser, while for the biscuit the opposite is true. The results show that most parents do not object the use of a (specific) celebrity spokes character, for the promotion of (specific) food products (despite their overall negative attitudes towards food marketing aimed at children). Future research might further investigate these seemingly contradictory results. Policy makers, health organizations and food companies that want to further stimulate the fruit (and vegetable) consumption amongst young children may thus be successful amongst kids ànd their parents. They could also try to convince the (reluctant) minority of parents, by surpassing their criticism against “commercialization” and demonstrating that this promotion technique might actually have a positive influence on their children’s eating habits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Adolescence is {{the period}} of {{important}} changes of the individual’s emotional, cognitive and social development. These changes occur in a specific social and cultural environment, <b>of</b> which <b>advertising</b> is part. Because young people are the target group of many products and commercials, it is worth highlighting the social role <b>of</b> <b>advertising.</b> Usually it is identified with negative consequences (like unhealthy habits).

40|$|Children are {{important}} targets of advertising campaigns from companies. However, {{children have been}} found to be particularly vulnerable to <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising,</b> and protecting children from these effects is an important task of consumer policy. Two important aspects have to be considered in this task. First, advertising affects judgments and behaviour not only during ad exposure, but also in delayed consumption and purchase contexts. Second, advertising thrives largely at an implicit level – during ad exposure as well as in consumption decisions. The current article introduces a dual-step (ad exposure vs. purchase/consumption) and dual-process (implicit vs. explicit) model of advertising effects on children. The model is based on a review of implicit advertising effects and implicit mechanisms of self-control. It implies that consumer policies intending to prevent undesired advertising effects should support interventions with the goal of strengthening advertising and purchasing literacy and, in addition, implicit self-control mechanisms in children. As self-control in consumption decisions is largely relevant for, and learned during, shopping and consumption, such interventions should focus on educating parents or other primary caregivers, because they are the most likely persons to accompany children in such situations and have a great influence on children’s implicit learning...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective: The {{question}} {{addressed in}} this review is whether aggregate alcohol advertising increases alcohol consumption among college students. Both the level of alcohol-related problems on college campuses and the level <b>of</b> alcohol <b>advertising</b> are high. Some researchers {{have concluded that the}} cultural myths and symbols used in alcohol advertisements have powerful meanings for college students and affect intentions to drink. There is, however, very little empirical evidence that alcohol advertising has any effect on actual alcohol con-sumption. Method: The methods used in this review include a theoreti-cal framework for evaluating the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising.</b> This theory suggests that the marginal <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> diminishes at high lev-els <b>of</b> <b>advertising.</b> Many prior empirical studies measured the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> at high levels <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> and found no effect.
