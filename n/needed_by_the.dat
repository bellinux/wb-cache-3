The second condition represents an anti-dependency, when the second segment produces a variable <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first segment. The third and final condition represents an output dependency: when two segments write to the same location, the result comes from the logically last executed segment.|$|E

5|$|After {{debarking}} her passengers at San Juan on 1 May, {{the ship}} took on supplies <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> American ground forces in Santo Domingo: gasoline, oil, and ammunition. She docked in Santo Domingo on 2 May and exchanged her cargo for 450 more evacuees {{to be taken}} to San Juan. In all, Yancey carried almost a quarter of those fleeing the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk soon thereafter, and resumed her role of training and cruising off the eastern seaboard and into the Caribbean basin. On 1 January 1969, Yancey was redesignated as LKA-93.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport coal to Givors, from where it could be taken to other towns on the river Rhone. On the return trip, boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E
5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side of Manhattan, there were a myriad of Hudson River ferries at one point, with boat routes running from New Jersey to twenty {{passenger}} docks in Manhattan. However, the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, and George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey, as well as the growth of car ownership in the United States, meant that these ferries were no longer <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mid-20th century. As a result, in 1967, the last cross-Hudson ferry (between Hoboken and Battery Park City) ceased operations.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{resigned}} as sheriff in 1875 {{and was soon}} elected as a delegate to the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention. One of three members appointed to wait upon convention president-elect E.B.

He sat on many other committees, including Revenue and Taxation, the Select Committee on Frontier Affairs, the Select Committee on Education, and the Standing Committee on the Legislative Department. Of the 68 days of the convention, Ross attended 63, voted 343 times, and missed or abstained from voting only 66 times.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{industry}} {{came out}} of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British bombers, tanks and warships. Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by 2inches.|$|E

5|$|The UN has six {{principal}} organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions {{for peace}} and security); the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the UN Trusteeship Council (inactive since 1994). UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by Portuguese António Guterres since 2017. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies {{to participate in the}} UN's work.|$|E

5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.|$|E
5|$|Vesicles {{sent off}} by the ER {{containing}} proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport {{to other parts of}} the cell. Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus. The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> plant structure.|$|E
5|$|When South Kasai seceded, {{government}} {{troops from the}} Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC) were already fighting Katangese troops in the Kasai region. South Kasai held important railway junctions <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Congolese army for its campaign in Katanga, and therefore soon became an important objective. South Kasai also had important mineral wealth which the central government was anxious {{to return to the}} Congo. The central government also misunderstood the South Kasaian position, believing that, like Katanga, the region had declared full independence from the Congo and rejected Congolese sovereignty.|$|E

50|$|The {{industrial}} revolution {{brought about the}} most dramatic change as textiles came to be manufactured on a broad scale.

Another is owned by a charter member of The American Game Collectors Association.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a difficult situation. The types of tractors <b>needed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military were {{very different from what}} farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery tractors were brought back from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.|$|E
