The work involved experimental evaluation of a breadboard sensor yielding results which would permit design of a prototype sensor for a specific application. The laboratory work included evaluation of the <b>noise</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> angle of the sensor, demonstration of a technique for producing an acquisition signal, constraints on the useful field-of-view, and a qualitative evaluation of the effects of stray light. In addition, the potential of the silicon avalanche-type photodiode for this application was investigated. No benefit in noise figure was found, but the easily adjustable gain of the avalanche device was useful. The use of mechanical tuning of the modulating element to reduce voltage requirements was also explored. The predicted performance of EODS in both photomultiplier and solid state detector configurations was compared to an existing state-of-the-art star tracker...|$|E
40|$|CLASSICAL photosensors principally {{consist of}} a zero or reverse biased {{photodiode}} connected to an amplifying transistor as shown in fig. 1. Impinging photons generate electron-hole pairs in the photodiode which are separated due to the electric field in the space charge region of the pn +-junction. The associated charge transport results in a signal dependent photocurrent iph = △q/△t. The transistor either serves as a signal amplifier for the voltage caused by the collected charge on the capacitance at its gate, or it {{is used as a}} sense amplifier for a regulation feedback which produces a constant photodiode voltage and transports the collected charge to a separate conversion node. High resolution and high dynamic range requirements at the typical low light intensities in optical spectrometry demand large photosensitive areas because high levels of signal charge have to be reached in order to avoid shot noise limitations. Large photodiodes imply large junction capacitances yielding a large CD in the equivalent circuit fig. 1. System performance is then limited by the thermal noise of the transistor, whose <b>noise</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> voltage vn causes a noise equivalent charge qneq at the conversion node...|$|E

Dye-filled planar afferent axons had mean distal axonal diameters of 1. 6 - 4. 9 microns, highly branched arbors, and contacted 11 - 24 hair cells. Dye-filled isthmus afferent axons had mean distal axonal diameters of 1. 8 - 7. 9 microns, with either small or large field arbors contacting 4 - 9 or 25 - 31 hair cells. The estimated mean number of contacts per innervated hair cell was 2. 2 for planar and 1. 3 for isthmus afferent neurons. Data on evoked afferent responses were available only for isthmus units that were observed to respond to our microrotational stimuli. Of 21 such afferent neurons, eight were successfully dye-filled. Within this sample, high-gain units had large field arbors and lower-gain units had small field arbors.

40|$|International audienceThe {{photopic}} motion sensitivity {{function of}} the energy-based motion system is band-pass peaking around 8 Hz. Using an external noise paradigm to factorize the sensitivity into <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> and calculation efficiency, {{the present study investigated}} if the variation in photopic motion sensitivity as a {{function of the}} temporal frequency is due to a variation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> (e. g., early temporal filtering) or calculation efficiency (ability to select and integrate motion). For various temporal frequencies, contrast thresholds for a direction discrimination task were measured in presence and absence of noise. Up to 15 Hz, the sensitivity variation was mainly due to a variation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> and little variation in calculation efficiency was observed. The sensitivity fall-off at very high temporal frequencies (from 15 to 30 Hz) was due to a combination of a drop of calculation efficiency and a rise of <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> <b>noise.</b> A control experiment in which an artificial temporal integration was applied to the stimulus showed that an early temporal filter (generally assumed to affect <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> <b>noise,</b> not calculation efficiency) could impair both the calculation efficiency and <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> at very high temporal frequencies. We conclude that at the photopic luminance intensity tested, the variation of motion sensitivity {{as a function of the}} temporal frequency was mainly due to early temporal filtering, not to the ability to select and integrate motion. More specifically, we conclude that photopic motion sensitivity at high temporal frequencies is limited by internal noise occurring after the transduction process (i. e., neural noise), not by quantal noise resulting from the probabilistic absorption of photons by the photoreceptors as previously suggested...|$|R
