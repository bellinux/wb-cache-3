5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed <b>no</b> <b>anomalies</b> of internal organs.|$|E

Clear references are made to the exact time the bomb detonated ("It's eight fifteen, and that's the time that it's always been"), and questions are asked as to whether the action was necessary. The song also references a supposed radio message in which the crew detail <b>no</b> <b>anomalies</b> as a result of nuclear detonation ("We got your message on the radio - conditions normal and you're coming home"); the American government denied any rumours of radiation sickness associated with the dropping of the bombs.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{quantization}} of a tensionless closed string in light-cone gauge. It {{is known that}} by using a Hamiltonian BRST scheme a tensionless string has <b>no</b> Lorentz <b>anomaly</b> in any space-time dimensions and <b>no</b> <b>anomaly</b> for the space-time conformal symmetry in two dimensions. In this paper, we show that a 3 d tensionless closed string in light-cone gauge also has <b>no</b> <b>anomaly</b> of space-time conformal symmetry.

50|$|If n is even, {{then one}} may rewrite the n Majorana fermions as n/2 Dirac fermions. These have parity {{invariant}} mass terms, and so Pauli-Villars {{may be used}} to regulate the divergences and <b>no</b> parity <b>anomaly</b> arises. Therefore for even n there is <b>no</b> <b>anomaly.</b> Moreover, as the contribution of 2n Majorana fermions to the partition function is the square of the contribution of n fermions, the square of the contribution to the anomaly of n fermions must be equal to one. Therefore the anomalous phase may only be equal to a square root of one, in other words, plus or minus one. If it is equal to one, then there is <b>no</b> <b>anomaly.</b> Therefore the question is, when is there an ambiguity in the partition function of a factor of -1.|$|R

6000|$|One further {{verification}} may {{be drawn}} from facts which are obstacles to the converse hypothesis. These objects and powers, celestial and terrestrial, which force themselves most on men's attention, have some of them several proper names, identified with those of different individuals, born at different places, and having different sets of adventures. Thus we have the sun variously known as Apollo, Endymion, Helios, Tithonos, etc.--personages having irreconcilable genealogies. Such anomalies Prof. Max Müller apparently ascribes to the untrustworthiness of traditions, which are [...] "careless about contradictions, or ready to solve them sometimes by the most atrocious expedients." [...] (Chips, vol. ii., p. 84.) But if {{the evolution of the}} myth has been that above indicated, there exists <b>no</b> <b>anomalies</b> to be got rid of: these diverse genealogies become parts of the evidence. For we have abundant proof that the same objects furnish metaphorical names of men in different tribes. There are Duck tribes in Australia, in South America, in North America. The eagle is still a totem among the North Americans, as Mr. McLennan shows reason to conclude that it was among the Egyptians, among the Jews, and among the Romans. Obviously, for reasons already assigned, it naturally happened {{in the early stages of}} the ancient races, that complimentary comparisons of their heroes to the Sun were frequently made. What resulted? The Sun having furnished names for sundry chiefs and early founders of tribes, and local traditions having severally identified them with the Sun, these tribes, when they grew, spread, conquered, or came otherwise into partial union, originated a combined mythology, which necessarily contained conflicting stories about the Sun-god, as about its other leading personages. If the North-American tribes, among several of which there are traditions of a Sun-god, had developed a combined civilization, there would similarly have arisen among them a mythology which ascribed to the Sun several different proper names and genealogies.|$|E

The 411 rocket {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a RD-180 powered first stage with a single AJ-60A solid fuel booster, and a Centaur upper stage. OSIRIS-REx separated from the launch vehicle 55 minutes after ignition, with a speed of 5.4 km/s mph.

5000|$|A book, Goodnight Malaysian 370, was {{published}} in August 2014 by New Zealanders Geoff Taylor and Ewan Wilson; the authors blamed a deliberate act of the pilot for the aircraft's disappearance, but admitted {{they were not able}} to [...] "provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory" [...] nor any motive. Ewan Wilson had previously dismissed the fire emergency theory as unlikely. New Zealand aviation expert Peter Clark stated that to take over the aircraft took [...] "immense knowledge" [...] and that even the co-pilot would not have been sufficiently skilled to disable the communications system and reprogramme a seven-hour flight off-course. However, Clark admitted the theory would be difficult to prove even if the data recorders were found, because the voice recorders would likely have been overwritten; and because, if the pilot was in control of the aircraft, then instrument data would report <b>no</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Shah's family vehemently denied the possibility of pilot suicide.|$|E
50|$|Initial Failure AnalysisExamination of {{the module}} shown in Figure 1 in the Failure Analysis Laboratory found no {{external}} {{evidence of the}} failure. Coordinate axes of the device were chosen as shown in Figure 1. Radiography {{was performed on the}} module in three orthogonal views: side, end, and top-down; as shown in Figure 2. For purposes of this paper the top-down x-ray view shows the x-y plane of the module. The side view shows the x-z plane, and the end view shows the y-z plane. <b>No</b> <b>anomalies</b> were noted in the radiographic images. Excellent alignment of components on the mini-boards permitted an uncluttered top-down view of the mini-circuit boards. The internal construction of the module was seen to consist of eight, stacked mini-boards, each with a single microcircuit and capacitor. The mini-boards connected with the external module pins using the gold-plated exterior of the package. External inspection showed that laser-cut trenches created an external circuit on the device, which is used to enable, read, or write to any of the eight EEPROM devices in the encapsulated vertical stack. Regarding nomenclature, the laser-trenched gold panels on the exterior walls of the package were labeled with the pin numbers. The eight miniboards were labeled TSOP01 through TSOP08, beginning {{at the bottom of the}} package near the device pins.|$|E
