5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding {{a transparent}} ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms.

3000|$|... {{then the}} {{reflectance}} curves of these selected pixels {{would be used}} in the <b>next</b> <b>stages</b> (instead of their CRs), because the main hypothesis of the CDAF (i.e., the minerals may present as continuous in small regions) is fulfilled.

50|$|Rudi Altig won {{the first}} stage with a small advantae. In the <b>next</b> <b>stages,</b> no big time {{differences}} were made, so Altig was able to defend his lead until the mountains.|$|R
5|$|In July, {{four months}} after leaving England, Simpson rode his first race as a professional, the Tour de l'Ouest in west France. He won the fourth stage and took the overall race leader's jersey. He won the next stage's {{individual}} time trial, increasing his lead. On the <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> he lost the lead with a punctured tyre, finishing the race in fourteenth place overall.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the <b>next</b> <b>stage,</b> although {{he would no longer}} be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's first match {{outside the}} league in the 1924–25 season came in the Lancashire Senior Cup.

Nelson progressed to the <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> of the cup with a comprehensive 4–0 win and were handed another home tie in the second round, against First Division side Blackburn Rovers. A 2–1 win for the away team ended Nelson's participation in the cup for the season.|$|E

50|$|The first {{detector}} of Viola & Jones had 38 stages, with 1 {{feature in}} the first stage, then 10, 25, 25, 50 in the <b>next</b> five <b>stages,</b> {{for a total of}} 6000 features. The first stages remove unwanted rectangles rapidly to avoid paying the computational costs of the <b>next</b> <b>stages,</b> so that computational time is spent analyzing deeply the part of the image that have a high probability of containing the object.|$|R
5|$|Simpson's {{first major}} {{event of the}} 1961 season was the Paris–Nice stage race in March. In stage three he helped his team win the team time trial and took the general {{classification}} lead by three seconds; however, he lost it in the <b>next</b> <b>stage.</b> In {{the final stages of}} the race Simpson's attacks were thwarted, and he finished fifth overall.|$|E
5|$|The Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal {{proteins}} in turn regulate the transcription of gap genes such as giant, knirps, Krüppel, and tailless in a striped pattern, creating {{the first level}} of structures that will become segments. The proteins from these in turn control the pair-rule genes, which in the <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> set up 7 bands across the embryo's long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as engrailed split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a long {{primarily}} flat stage that was won by Dario Beni. He lost the lead after the <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> to the eventual winner Luigi Ganna, who in turn lost it to Carlo Galetti after the mountainous third stage. Ganna regained the lead after the fourth stage and successfully defended {{it all the way}} to the finish in Milan, winning three stages en route. Atala won the team classification.|$|E
5000|$|Stage 2 is [...] "Image Maintenance". This {{involves}} the intentional sustaining or maintaining of imagery, without which a mental image {{is subject to}} rapid decay, and does not remain for sufficient duration to proceed to the <b>next</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R

5|$|The first 1 MWp {{solar park}} {{was built by}} Arco Solar at Lugo near Hesperia, California {{at the end of}} 1982, {{followed}} in 1984 by a 5.2 MWp installation in Carrizo Plain. Both have since been decommissioned, though Carrizo Plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed or planned. The <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> followed the 2004 revisions to the feed-in tariffs in Germany when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player {{controls}} Q*bert, who starts each game {{at the top of}} a pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the <b>next</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> of Bath Deep Lock is {{numbered}} 8/9 as two locks {{were combined}} when the canal was restored in 1976.

50|$|Adam Durnin was {{appointed}} as Theatre Manager, taking the Albany's development through its <b>next</b> <b>stages.</b> By October 2016, {{a team of}} 8 full and part-time staff, supported by 4 apprentices, had taken responsibility for the day to day management of the theatre - but still supported by volunteers.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the club}} could not retain the title the {{following}} year, Shearer again ended the (now 38-game) season as Premier League top scorer, with 31goals in 35games, as Blackburn finished {{seventh in the}} league. The previous season's first-place finish also saw the club enter the Champions League. Shearer's only goal in six full Champions League games was a penalty in a 4–1 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final fixture and Blackburn finished third in their group, failing to progress to the <b>next</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, thanks to a superior goal difference, {{they went into the}} game as underdogs due to a number of their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or suspension, and because they had lost to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw they needed to go to the <b>next</b> <b>stage</b> of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically <b>next</b> <b>stage.</b> It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
30|$|Parallel or column FFT {{processor}} maps {{the signal}} flow graph {{or a single}} stage of the signal flow graph, isomorphically, into a hardware structure.

50|$|The 1993 Tour {{started in}} the same way as the 1992 Tour: Indurain won, with Alex Zülle in second place. The <b>next</b> <b>stages</b> were flat, and all {{finished}} in mass sprints.
