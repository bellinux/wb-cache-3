During {{spring training}}, he strained the common flexor tendon in his throwing arm. He underwent Tommy John surgery in April, and missed the 2015 season. After completing a rehabilitation assignment, the Phillies optioned Hollands to Lehigh Valley on June 2, 2016. He was released on May 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Tallon scored only six in Australia's 236 {{and then took}} 0/10 in Scotland's second innings and did not take a catch in the innings victory. In the second match in Aberdeen, Tallon kept wicket, conceding 26 byes and <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> {{dismissal}} {{and he was not}} required to bat. When the match became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position in Scotland's second innings, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match. Tallon took 2/15 as Australia finished the tour with another innings win.|$|E

25|$|An {{analysis}} of 2010 school data by The Guardian found that state faith schools were <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> {{fair share of}} the poorest pupils in their local areas, as indicated by free school meal claims. Not only was this so at an overall national level, but also in the postcode areas nearby the schools. This suggested selection by religion was leading to selection of children from more well-off families.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Government was criticised by the media, {{human rights}} lawyers {{and human rights}} activists for doing too little, too late and for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> {{stronger}} stance against the death penalty.

25|$|The fourth Test in Melbourne saw Bennett {{make his}} Test debut over the Christmas holiday period.

25|$|According to Rothbard, {{government}} support for failed enterprises and keeping wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression. Hayek, unlike Rothbard, believed since the 1970s, {{along with the}} monetarists, that the Federal Reserve further contributed {{to the problems of}} the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression. However, in 1932 and 1934 Hayek had criticised the FED and the Bank of England for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> more contractionary stance.|$|E

Nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing. As the precursor for NAD and NADP, niacin is also involved in DNA repair.|$|E
25|$|A poor batsman, Carr {{never made}} a half-century, and {{in his later years}} his batting {{declined}} even further. In his last significant season (1913) he scored only 95 runs in 17 innings. In 1914 he played only one match, in late July against Surrey, bowling 28 overs but <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket. The start of World War I a few weeks later brought an end to his cricketing career. Carr {{died at the age of}} 78 in Salcombe Hill near Sidmouth in Devon.|$|E

He largely withdrew from Catholic observances, even in death denying last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as counter-weight to repressive Papal policies. He put his primary support behind conciliarists, irenicists, and humanists. When the papacy instigated the Counter-Reformation, using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought {{were the most}} neutral in the debate, <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> side or trying to effect restraint, thus leading to political chaos and threatening to provoke civil war.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationism is {{most famous}} for an {{opposition}} {{to the theory of}} evolution, but believers also are on record opposing many measurements, facts, and principles in the fields of physics and chemistry, dating methods including radiometric dating, geology, astronomy, cosmology, and paleontology. Young Earth creationists do not accept any explanation for natural phenomena which deviates from the veracity of a plain reading of the Bible, whether it be the origins of biological diversity, the origins of life, or the origins of the universe itself. This has led some young Earth creationists to criticize other creationist proposals such as intelligent design, for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> strong stand on the age of the Earth, special creation, or even the identity of the designer.|$|E

25|$|The {{unstable}} {{situation in}} Haiti, where elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide had been ousted from office {{by the military}} in September 1991, presented another regional problem. The United States pressured the military government to restore Aristide. In July 1993, the Haitian military regime agreed to reinstate Aristide by October 30, 1993, but then refused to step down. In October, in an effort Clinton approved even though Aspin opposed it, the United States sent the USS Harlan County carrying 200 troops to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Met by a hostile mob of armed Haitians, the ship turned away without attempting to undertake its mission, which the Pentagon described {{as an effort to}} professionalize the Haitian military and undertake civil assistance projects. Some observers attacked Aspin for <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> harder stand in the administration against an action he opposed and then aborting the effort in the face of local opposition.|$|E
25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the first draw is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not taken in the first draw, is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of not taking the red ball in n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius’ model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|E
25|$|Waugh {{was seeking}} to force {{his way into the}} Australian team {{at the start of the}} 1988–89 season. He started poorly, with a duck and 18 against Queensland and <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket. In the next match he made a duck and {{appeared}} to be in control in the second innings when he was run out for 46. He then faced the touring West Indies, Waugh was dismissed for nine in the first innings. In the second innings, Waugh bounced back to score an unbeaten 103 from 163 balls against the undisputed world champions, earning praise from their captain Viv Richards. In the following match against Tasmania, Waugh was immediately out for a duck attempting a cut shot, but made 100 not out in the second innings. He then scored 69 and 39 against Western Australia. Waugh was overlooked for Test selection, but was selected in the ODI squad for the start of the triangular tournament against the West Indies and Pakistan. It was to be the first time that twins played international cricket for Australia.|$|E
50|$|President John F. Kennedy {{was asked}} by many to address {{the public about the}} state of the economy, but he {{ultimately}} decided not to do so. Kennedy’s advisors pushed for all sorts of remedies, from reducing the margin requirement to announcing a tax cut of $5-$10 billion to holding a “fireside chat” and discussing the health of the economy. Six weeks after deciding on <b>not</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> action, however, Kennedy reduced the margin requirement and decided on a tax cut, hoping to incentivize large, self-financing companies.|$|R
