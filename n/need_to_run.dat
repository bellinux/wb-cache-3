5|$|Curse of Enchantia {{was officially}} {{revealed}} under this title at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in April 1992. The game was originally {{planned to be}} released in September 1992, but got delayed two months to November 1992. It was the first adventure game by Core Design as well {{as one of the first}} CD-ROM adventure games. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC CD-ROM drives in 1993. It was also re-released on CD as part of Encore Multipack, together with Heimdall and Thunderhawk. The game's original release was accompanied by a promotional campaign with valuable prizes (computers and money) in some magazines such as France's Joystick. Owners of computers with newer PC operating systems <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> it using DOSBox.|$|E

It is the replacement for Win386 in Windows 3.x, and the file vmm32.vxd is a compressed archive containing most of the core VxD, including VMM.vxd itself and ifsmgr.vxd (which facilitates file system access without the need to call the real mode file system code of the DOS kernel).|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{authorities}} {{assert that}} they cannot simply trust the United States or Europe to provide Iran with nuclear energy fuel, {{and point to}} {{a long series of}} agreements, contracts and treaty obligations which were not fulfilled. Developing nations say {{they do not want to}} give up their rights to uranium enrichment and do not trust the United States or other nuclear countries to be consistent suppliers of the nuclear material they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> their power plants.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol fuels, {{including}} butanol and ethanol, are partially oxidized {{and therefore}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> at richer mixtures than gasoline. Standard gasoline engines in cars can adjust the air-fuel ratio to accommodate {{variations in the}} fuel, but only within certain limits depending on model. If the limit is exceeded by running the engine on pure ethanol or a gasoline blend with {{a high percentage of}} ethanol, the engine will run lean, something which can critically damage components. Compared to ethanol, butanol can be mixed in higher ratios with gasoline for use in existing cars without the need for retrofit as the air-fuel ratio and energy content are closer to that of gasoline.|$|E

25|$|Public {{systems or}} those {{crossing}} administrative domains (including different {{departments in the}} same organization) often result in the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> on heterogeneous systems, using different operating systems and hardware architectures. With many languages, there is a trade-off between investment in software development {{and the number of}} platforms that can be supported (and thus the size of the resulting network). Cross-platform languages can reduce the need to make this tradeoff, though potentially at the expense of high performance on any given node (due to run-time interpretation or lack of optimization for the particular platform). There are diverse scientific and commercial projects to harness a particularly associated grid or for the purpose of setting up new grids. BOINC is a common one for various academic projects seeking public volunteers; more are listed {{at the end of the}} article.|$|E
25|$|The wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) {{hypothesis}} {{was prompted by}} observation of young chukar chicks, and proposes that wings developed their aerodynamic functions {{as a result of}} the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators. This makes it a specialized type of cursorial ("from the ground up") theory. Note that in this scenario birds need downforce to give their feet increased grip. But early birds, including Archaeopteryx, lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce WAIR depends on is generated by upstrokes, it seems that early birds were incapable of WAIR. Because WAIR is a behavioural trait without osteological specializations, the phylogenetic placement of the flight stroke before the divergence of Neornithes makes it impossible to determine if WAIR is ancestral to the avian flight stroke or derived from it.|$|E
25|$|There are two centres in a rugby team, inside centre (number 12) {{and outside}} centre (number 13). The inside centre usually stands {{close to the}} fly-half or at first {{receiver}} {{on the other side}} of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres' main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to side step and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.|$|E

[...] Huntsman aggressively touted himself as a fiscal conservative, pledging considerable business and personal tax cuts as well as a foreign policy moderate, calling for a decrease in defense spending and withdrawal from Afghanistan, while increasing pressure on Iran and support for Israel.|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2014, Solis {{formally}} {{announced the}} start of her campaign for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat, with the election to be held on June 3. [...] By this time she had raised over $600,000 for her effort and was considered the favorite to win the contest. [...] News of the federal investigation {{had little effect on}} her campaign. [...] Solis won the seat on June 4, 2014, garnering 70percent of the vote against two other opponents.

500|$|While {{modeling}} in Italy, Larter met fellow {{model and}} aspiring actress Amy Smart {{and the two}} [...] "became instant friends", according to Larter. A modelling job later took her to Los Angeles, while there, she decided to take acting classes with Smart. The two then moved into an apartment together. In November 1996, Larter portrayed fictional model Allegra Coleman in an Esquire magazine hoax. When speaking about the cover and her subsequent fame, Larter said, [...] "When the door opens for you in Hollywood, you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> with it. You know?"

500|$|Classical Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; rather, their mothers would have taught them {{the skills they}} would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a household. [...] They married young, often to much older men. [...] When they married, Athenian women had two main roles: to bear children, and to run the household. [...] The ideal Athenian woman did not go out in public or interact with men she was not related to, though this ideology of seclusion would only have been practical in wealthy families. [...] In most households, women were needed to carry out tasks such as going to the market and drawing water, which required taking time outside the house where interactions with men were possible.|$|E
500|$|Though Microsoft used {{forms of}} viral {{marketing}} for promotion (including the alternate reality game or ARG), {{the main focus}} of the company's efforts was traditional media outlets. [...] Because there already was interest in the title among the gaming community, Microsoft did not feel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a social media campaign, instead banking on the gaming community to spread the word itself. The focus on traditional media would help expand the fan base beyond established gamers and convince the public that the game was a cultural milestone. To build public interest, Microsoft made public statements that Halo 3 would surpass media sales records, including the July 2007 record of $166 million set by the launch of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
500|$|Ice later {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing. Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation. Rather than being dissuaded, their fear encouraged Robinson who agreed to work with Ice. In an interview, Robinson stated [...] "It's the most punk-rock thing you could do." [...] Despite not being happy with his old image, Winkle stated that {{he never had a}} problem with his older music. Ice decided against changing his stage name to something else, as he felt no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.|$|E

500|$|VR {{announced}} its 2 billion Finnish Mark Pendolino order on 7 February 1992, {{consisting of two}} firm orders and twenty-three options. ABB's X 2000 was considered {{in addition to the}} Italian train; the latter was chosen due to its lower price (70 million FIM per unit) and because it was already running. Only these two tilting trains were considered due to the twisting nature Finland's railway network. Thanks to its tilting mechanism, the Pendolino [...] unlike such other European high-speed trains like the TGV, Thalys, and AVE [...] does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> on specialised high-speed lines, which was important to VR; instead, it runs on existing lines, and was expected to surpass the speed attained by traditional trains by 35%. This has both beneficial and negative consequences. The trains cannot run at as high a speed as, for example, the TGV, due to the lines. However, the Pendolino can also run alongside normal non-tilting trains, allowing for greater use of the railway. Building trains that could ensure passenger comfort at high speed on these routes by tilting through the curves was seen as a much cheaper solution than reconstructing the railway network itself due to Finland's low population and long distances. The train was originally called the Sm200, but in May 1995 it was officially named Sm3 according to VR's nomenclature for multiple units.|$|E
