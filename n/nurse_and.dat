40|$|Abstract The {{relation}} between <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine has been undergoing {{a number of}} changes in recent years. Optimization of synergy and competences between healthcare professions {{is one of the}} priorities of the healthcare system development. This research addresses the issue whether <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medical professions are partner professions in healthcare of clients. The objective of the thesis was to ascertain whether <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medical professions can be declared as partner professions in healthcare. This objective was fulfilled through a quantitative research using the method of a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire contained 17 questions for doctors and 18 questions for nurses. The respondents of this questionnaire survey were 132 <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> 97 doctors. The data were processed by means of descriptive statistics using charts. It follows from the data analysis that <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine cannot be regarded as partner professions yet. According to <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> doctors, the partner {{relation between}} these two professions is of crucial importance for client care. Higher education <b>and</b> professionalism of <b>nurses</b> contributes to improvement of mutual relations. The research has revealed {{that it is necessary to}} continue addressing this issue. Within the research we explored several areas that, as we believe, are closely connected with this issue, and we based the research on its theoretical part. This thesis is beneficial by exploring the opinions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> doctors on the relations between <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine, and by ascertaining their opinions on the effect of the partnership between these two professions on quality improvement of client care. We also investigated whether <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> doctors believe that higher education <b>and</b> professionalism of <b>nurses</b> contributed to improvement of the relation between <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine. It is apparent from the research that <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> doctors realize that partnership between <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine is of fundamental significance for care of clients. If they endeavour to trust each other, communicate effectively and show mutual respect, <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine will become partner professions. The research may initiate drawing attention to problems in relations between <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medicine, and may provide guidance to finding the solution. It may also stimulate nurses, doctors, students of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> medical branches, and managements of healthcare facilities to think about the issue...|$|R

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT Title: The {{perceptions}} of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants on care-related prevention concerning people with dementia: a mixed methods approach. Background: Because {{of the growing}} number of people with dementia, care-related prevention activities done by <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants will become increasingly important to prevent complications and maintain an acceptable quality of life. Currently it’s unknown what the {{perceptions of}} <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention in dementia care are. Aim: To gain insight into the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants towards care-related prevention so care-related prevention for people with dementia can be further improved in the future. Research question: How do <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants working in home care, residential or nursing homes perceive care-related prevention concerning people with dementia? Method: A mixed methods approach with survey research and individual semi-structured interviews. First, secondary analyses were done on existing survey data collected in 2011 on a sample of 206 <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants. Second, in March-May 2014 12 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to embellish the quantitative results. Results: From this study three concepts related to the perceptions of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> CNAs towards care-related prevention activities emerged: attitude, knowledge and skills <b>and</b> the future. <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants think care-related prevention is a task of their profession. They experience insufficient knowledge and skills and they like to devote more time to care-related prevention in the future. Conclusion: <b>Nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants perceive care-related prevention to be part of their profession. They however express the need for more education on care-related prevention, preferably in a classroom setting. In the future, <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants like to devote more time to care-related prevention and e-health can support this. Recommendations: Additional training of <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> certified <b>nursing</b> assistants focused on their different needs and use of e-health...|$|R
