40|$|O fibroma nasofaríngeo juvenil é um dos tumores mais raramente encontrados e sua propagação para o {{interior}} do crânio é excepcional. A etiopatogenia desta afecção é discutida, não sendo considerada por muitos autores uma verdadeira neoplasia benigna, mas sim uma hiperplasia reativa do tecido colágeno causada por estímulo genético ou hormonal. Relatamos um caso de fibroma nasofaríngeo juvenil em adolescente masculino de 15 anos de idade, o qual se propagava para as fossas cranianas anterior e média. O doente não apresentava sinais clínicos ou laboratoriais de hiperestrogenismo. Foi operado em dois tempos, sendo feita inicialmente exérese da porção intracraniana do tumor mediante craniotomia frontotemporal e, uma semana depois, o restante foi retirado por via transmaxilar. Um ano após o tratamento cirúrgico o paciente foi re-examinado, não havendo sinais clínicos ou radiológicos de recidiva do processo. The juvenile <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>fibroma</b> {{is one of}} {{the less}} frequently found tumors and its propagation towards the skull cavity is very rare. The etiopathogeny of this process is controversial. Many authors do not consider it a true beningn neoplasm, but a reactive hyperplasia of the collagen tissue caused by a genetical or hormonal stimulus. A case of juvenile <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>fibroma</b> in a 15 -year-old male is reported. The tumor extended to the anterior and middle fossae. The patient failed to show any clinical or laboratory sign of hyperestrogenism. The operation was performed in two stages: firstly the removal of the intracranial portion of the growth was performed through a fronto-temporal craniotomy; one week later, the remaining was excised through a trasmaxillar approach. One year after the surgical treatment the patient was re-evaluated and no clinical or radiological signs of the tumor recurrence were evidenced...|$|E
40|$|THE commonest nasopharyngeal tumours {{occurring}} {{in children and}} young adults are the <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>fibroma,</b> the lymphosarcoma and the anaplastic carcinoma or " lympho-epithelioma ". The nasopharygeal fibromas usually run a benign clinical course, they form bulky tumours and give rise to postnasal obstruction and epistaxis. The lymphosarcomas are rapidly growing bulky malignant tumours which give rise to post-nasal obstruction and pressure symptoms; however, epistaxis is uncommon; although extremely radiosensitive the prognosis of nasopharyngeal lymphosarcomas is very poor, metastasis to cervical lymph nodes and lungs occurring early. The anaplastic carcinomas or " lympho-epitheliomas " are characterised by a tendency to spread early to adjacent lymph nodes whilst the primary is still obscure. Like the lymphosarcomas although they are extremely radiosensitive their prognosis is very poor, metastasis occurring to the vertebral column and liver. It is proposed in this paper to describe the clinical and histological features of 7 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma {{occurring in}} {{children and young adults}}. Two of the cases are of particular interest occurring in siblings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background While IMRT {{is widely}} used in {{treating}} complex oncological cases in adults, it is not commonly used in pediatric radiation oncology {{for a variety of}} reasons. This report evaluates our 9 year experience using stereotactic-guided, inverse planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in children and adolescents {{in the context of the}} current literature. Methods Between 1999 and 2008 thirty-one children and adolescents with a mean age of 14. 2 years (1. 5 - 20. 5) were treated with IMRT in our department. This heterogeneous group of patients consisted of 20 different tumor entities, with Ewing's sarcoma being the largest (5 patients), followed by juvenile <b>nasopharyngeal</b> <b>fibroma,</b> esthesioneuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (3 patients each). In addition a review of the available literature reporting on technology, quality, toxicity, outcome and concerns of IMRT was performed. Results With IMRT individualized dose distributions and excellent sparing of organs at risk were obtained in the most challenging cases. This was achieved at the cost of an increased volume of normal tissue receiving low radiation doses. Local control was achieved in 21 patients. 5 patients died due to progressive distant metastases. No severe acute or chronic toxicity was observed. Conclusion IMRT in the treatment of children and adolescents is feasible and was applied safely within the last 9 years at our institution. Several reports in literature show the excellent possibilities of IMRT in selective sparing of organs at risk and achieving local control. In selected cases the quality of IMRT plans increases the therapeutic ratio and outweighs the risk of potentially increased rates of secondary malignancies by the augmented low dose exposure. </p...|$|E
