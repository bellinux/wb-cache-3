Speaking to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets in November 1917, he declared that [...] "the state is an institution built up for the sake of exercising violence. Previously, this violence was exercised by a handful of moneybags over the entire people; <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>want...</b> to organise violence {{in the interests of the}} people." [...] He strongly opposed suggestions to abolish capital punishment. Fearing anti-Bolshevik forces would overthrow his administration, in December 1917 Lenin ordered the establishment of the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.|$|E
