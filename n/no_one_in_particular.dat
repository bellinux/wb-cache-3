2500|$|In January 2007, {{during the}} first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was {{revealed}} in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of Time in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated to <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> [...] "His wife sent him...She works at the CIA." [...] Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court [...] "I didn't want to give [...] immunity. I did so reluctantly." [...] Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court [...] "I'm not sure we're getting the full story here." [...] According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, [...] "Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will say before agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [...] he never got one from Fleischer." ...|$|E

30|$|No methods {{produced}} {{death rates}} of zero in this study, {{but it is}} worth noting that the Rate Ratio Scaling method is susceptible to producing them. When there are <b>no</b> deaths <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>particular</b> period-cohort <b>in</b> a region in the base period the rate ratio will be zero, and the resulting projected death rate will therefore also be zero. The theoretical underlying death rate is unlikely to be zero. Regions with smaller populations, with small numbers of deaths, will be at greater risk of this occurring. The Broad Age Rate Ratio Scaling is much less prone to this issue due to the use of broad age group rate ratios which are less likely to be zero. Similarly, the smoothing of rate ratios in the TOPALS method makes the possibility of a zero death rate less likely.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} the public's general health depends on the {{accessibility}} and quality of our public assets, the way that people live, work, learn, grow struggle, and play together (Judy Kurland, 2000). Ecological theory suggests that by evaluating and altering these conditions, {{it is possible to}} influence health behavior and, thus, the health outcomes of populations and their constituent individuals. Various aspects of one’s community can either encourage or discourage public health. Accessibility and availability of products, physical characteristics and structures, inaccessible or poorly resourced health services, neighborhood socioeconomics, deteriorated neighborhoods, and the media are all examples of factors that can influence <b>one’s</b> health. <b>In</b> this study the health of the city of Flint was researched by examining the features and characteristics of zip code areas using a variety of data sources and methodologies, including secondary health and census data, neighborhood drive-thrus and photographs, documenting grocery stores prices, and through mapping neighborhood resources and health data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Because of the varied nature of the data collected, different data analyses techniques were used. A focused comparison of 5 health issues in two zip codes showed that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> variable <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> stood out as a major correlate of the health differences between the two zip codes.

Mr. Fergusson says, somewhat doubtfully, that he perceives a [...] "kind of beauty" [...] in a ship: I say, without any manner of doubt, that a ship is one of the loveliest things man ever made, and one of the noblest; nor do I know any lines, out of divine work, so lovely as those of the head of a ship, or even as the sweep of the timbers of a small boat, not a race boat, a mere floating chisel, but a broad, strong, sea boat, able to breast a wave and break it: and yet, with all this beauty, ships cannot be made subjects of sculpture. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> pauses <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> delight beneath the pediments of the Admiralty; nor does scenery of shipping ever become prominent in bas-relief without destroying it: witness the base of the Nelson pillar. It may be, and must be sometimes, introduced in severe subordination to the figure subject, but just enough to indicate the scene; sketched in the lightest lines on the background; never with any attempt at realisation, never with any equality to the force of the figures, unless the whole purpose of the subject be picturesque.

40|$|Now, 10 {{years after}} the first plans, we analyse in this paper what has {{happened}} with Underground Logistic Systems (ULS). The major question in this paper is: Which barriers and enablers led to the failure of ULS and what ULS spin-offs can be found nowadays? Several factors can be classified as barriers or enablers. The main conclusions that can be drawn are that the opportunities for try-out were too limited; political support could have been gained on higher levels; the costs were too high, the catchment area was too limited; ULS in itself is a very promising system, but there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> clear goal. <b>In</b> <b>particular,</b> the lack of a thorough and positive business model in combination with a lack of sufficient freight volumes almost immediately guaranteed the failure of the initiative. The spin-offs seem to have taken place in different directions: ranging from rather soft impacts (e. g. scientific knowledge) to more hard developments (adopting and developing transport and tunnelling technologies), and, although difficult to quantify, they are of great value.

40|$|We {{present a}} dual {{optimization}} concept of predicting optimal sequences {{as well as}} optimal folds of off-lattice protein models {{in the context of}} multi-scale modeling. We validate the utility of the recently introduced hidden-force Monte Carlo optimization algorithm by finding significantly lower energy folds for minimalist and detailed protein models than previously reported. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the lowest energy fold amongst all sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture. <b>In</b> <b>particular,</b> for protein models with a binary sequence, we show that the sequence-optimized folds form more compact cores than the lowest energy folds of the historically fixed, Fibonacci-series sequences of chain lengths of 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. We then extend our search algorithm to use UNRES, one of the leading united-residue protein force fields. Our combined fold and sequence optimization on three test proteins reveal an inherent bias in UNRES favoring alpha helical structures even when secondary structure prediction clearly suggests only beta sheets besides random coil, and virtually <b>no</b> helices. <b>One</b> test <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain, demonstrates that by permutations of its sequence UNRES re-folds this structure into a perfect alpha helix but, in fact, the helix is just an artefact of the force field, the structure quickly unfolds in all-atom state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulation.

40|$|Josef Haslinger’s story "Fiona und Ferdinand" (2006) {{revolves}} around a disclosed secret in its narrator’s childhood hometown, which implicates two (deceased) village elders in a decades-old {{rape and murder}} mystery long blamed on two anonymous “Russian soldiers. ” The discovery of two partial skeletons locked in a bedroom trunk awakens the narrator’s memory: years before as a child, he unearthed the same skeletons after first spying a finger bone buried in a stream. The identification of the bones is central in determining the perpetrators of the rape/murder, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> [...] and <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> the narrator’s mother [...] seems interested in hearing {{the testimony of the}} crime’s lone eyewitness, now an aged woman. Instead, the revelation evokes a collective effort to willfully impede any investigation into the truth, presumably as a means to maintain the town’s dual pretenses of order and respectability.  "Fiona und Ferdinand" emphasizes Haslinger’s preoccupation with the Austrian failure to confront its own past, specifically via families as fundamental units of transmission and memory. In this analysis of the text, I explore Haslinger’s treatment of space, time, and memory in several ways. First, I examine how his notion of “officially sanctioned memory” intersects with a landscape that contains past and present alike. Second, I discuss how bodies, either the violated female body or the rotted skeletons Fiona and Ferdinand, are emblems that raise discussions of space, gender, and memory. Last, I consider collective memory and how it enables processes of forgetting. The reluctance to “dig up the past” is thematized in "Fiona und Ferdinand" using devices common throughout Haslinger’s oeuvre, and this paper will analyze the story through the lens of Haslinger-as-archaeologist, exploring how families, and the memories they possess, are both the key to truth and the foil to its revelation.   </div...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} we examine games, and games hardware, {{that can be}} classed as ‘Vaporware’. More specifically software that was never written, or hardware that was never built, and consequently <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever played. <b>In</b> <b>particular</b> we are considering such vaporware as examples of ‘Design Fiction’ as they once represented speculative visions of the future based on emerging technology. Vaporware is a term generally used to describe products that are announced {{to the general public}} but are never actually manufactured. Whereas design fiction is a term used to describe plausible ‘diegetic prototypes’ that are built, or suggested, to create an opportunity for discourse about possible technological futures. Whilst it could be argued vaporware games are simply failed products that were justifiably scrapped before joining the long lists of come-to-nothing games and consoles, by reviewing examples we offer an alternative view that they can serve as objects of discourse for exposing the potential futures of video games and thus could be considered in terms of design fiction. To add further weight to the argument that games can be useful as design fictions we then consider “Game of Drones”, an example of a design fiction that pivots around a game element, to illustrate how the deliberate use of design fiction can stimulate discourse around game futures (in this case the growing promotion of ‘gamified’ services as means of engaging users). Whilst the notion of designing games that will never be built may seem paradoxical in relation to the Games industry’s predominantly commercial aims, we believe that the deliberate adoption of design fiction as a practice within game design would facilitate the emergence of meaningful discussions around future gaming without the frustrations induced by vaporware...|$|R

S. responds to the challenges posed by globalization in a piecemeal manner, its trade laws vacillating between the pull of nationalism and internationalism. The Article proposes an alternative that balances the current global reality with the nationalist call for a return to the local. To the extent that a 2 ̆ 2 national 2 ̆ 2 market can still be accurately identified, its identification does not come from the traditional conceptions of a national corporation or a national product, but from the <b>one</b> factor <b>in</b> the production process that is still territorial rather than globally oriented: the national workforce.

Despite calls from nationalists to fortify national boundaries to protect domestic products and industry, products that are globally sourced are in fact the products of <b>no</b> <b>one</b> country <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> Country-of-origin designations thus merely perpetuate this chimera of nationality in a world of internationality.
