500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained in this video are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> you see every day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E
500|$|The board {{found that}} Oppenheimer's {{association}} with Chevalier [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that our security system permits {{on the part}} of one who customarily has access to information of the highest classification", and concluded that [...] "Oppenheimer's continuing conduct reflects a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system," [...] that he was susceptible [...] "to influence which could have serious implications for the security interests of the country," [...] that his attitude toward the H-bomb program raised doubt about whether his future participation [...] "would be consistent with the best interests of security," [...] and that Oppenheimer had been [...] "less than candid in several instances" [...] in his testimony. The majority therefore did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Dark Fantasy", is {{introduced}} with a narrative by Nicki Minaj, attempting an English accent, {{that serves as}} a retelling of writer Roald Dahl's poetic rework of [...] "Cinderella". It introduces My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy themes of decadence and hedonism, with West musing how [...] "the plan was to drink until the pain was over / But what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?". His lyrics on the track contain various musical and popular culture references, including those to the song [...] "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)", the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car, rapper Nas, fashion designer Phoebe Philo, short story [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the song [...] "Sex on Fire", singer Leona Lewis, and television character Steve Urkel. [...] "All of the Lights" [...] incorporates drum 'n' bass breaks and brass fanfare. West's lyrics contain a reference to the death of Michael Jackson in the opening lines and present a narrative of a character who abuses his lover, does prison time, scuffles with her new boyfriend, and subsequently mourns his absence from his child's life. For the song, West enlisted 11 guest vocalists, including Alicia Keys, John Legend, Elton John, Tony Williams, Elly Jackson, and Rihanna, who sings the song's hook. In an interview for MTV, Jackson said of the song's vocal layering, [...] "He got me to layer up all these vocals with other people, and he just basically wanted to use his favorite vocalists {{from around the world to}} create this really unique vocal texture on his record, but it's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> where you can pick it out".|$|E

But it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change America needs. It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change America wants.

2500|$|Hill's first {{completed}} screenplay, a Western called Lloyd Williams and His Brother, was optioned by Joe Wizan. It {{was never}} made but the script was admired at Warner Bros who asked Hill to pitch some projects. He {{came up with}} a detective story, Hickey & Boggs and the studio agreed to finance a draft. [...] "Detective films were very old hat, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> a young screenwriter was going to pitch," [...] recalls Hill. [...] "I think they were intrigued, maybe fresh air could be blown into a venerable genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1959 {{contract}} renewal {{also contained}} a clause that illustrates Diệm's increasing sensitivity to criticism: it stated that MSUG staffers' personal records and notes {{would not be}} used [...] "against the security or the interests of Vietnam". This stipulation ran contrary {{to the notion of}} academic freedom, and some professors chose to ignore it. For example, Robert Scigliano, an MSU political scientist who served as assistant project chief during 1957–1959, wrote an article in 1960 concerning the political parties of South Vietnam that called attention to Diệm's suppression of the opposition. Diệm was sufficiently irked by the article that he saw fit to mention it to MSU President Hannah when the latter visited Vietnam in early 1961, saying it [...] "was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> he liked to see MSU personnel writing".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} {{remember}} that little speech. It's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> one {{is pleased with}} afterwards; but, in the circumstances, it was, perhaps, excusable," [...] he said.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, madame, {{you are too}} good,' said Genevieve, weeping; and kindly {{holding the}} {{trembling}} hand, Albinia finished the letter, herself. 'Silly boy!

60|$|With those words, {{she walks}} out into Duke Street, Saint James's. Mr Twemlow {{returning}} to his sofa, lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster, with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with {{the pleasures of the}} table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, let me {{carry them}} for you!" [...] she entreated, {{and after a}} tender {{struggle}} she succeed in enslaving herself to them, and went away wearing them through the heel-bands like manacles on her wrist. She was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> girl to offer such pretty devotions, and Mrs. March was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> woman to suffer them; but they played the comedy through, and let March go off for his last hill-climb with the promise to meet him in the Stadt Park {{when he came to}} the Kurhaus for his last mineral bath.|$|R
60|$|Prescott felt amused. Jernyngham and his {{daughter}} were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> people <b>the</b> somewhat primitive prairie ranchers would welcome; their request for accommodation {{was more likely to}} cause astonishment and alarm.|$|R
60|$|It cost Thirlwell {{an effort}} to hide his surprise; indeed, he {{wondered}} with some embarrassment whether he had succeeded, for this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> girl he had expected to meet.|$|R
60|$|It proved sufficient. The singer let {{the captive}} foot go and turned away; {{and when the}} {{conductor}} left, peace had settled down upon the clattering car. The little incident had, however, an unpleasant effect on Alison, for this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> to which she had been accustomed. It was {{a moment or two}} before she turned to her companion.|$|E

This, however, is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that's likely to lead to his advancement." [...] He lay quiet for a moment or two; and then went on: [...] "I'm {{grateful}} to you. Had you much trouble in persuading Bland to let you have the letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The poor Truant {{was silent}} for an instant, and then he said: [...] "That is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> I am good at, but I expect {{some of the other}} fellows could tell you easily enough. Our windows must be all in a row, and you can climb up and ask some of them; and if any one tells you, will you get us all out?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, {{commentator}} Pat Buchanan {{mounted a}} campaign for the Republican nomination for President against incumbent George H. W. Bush in 1992. He received a prime-time speech-slot at the 1992 Republican National Convention, to give his speech on the culture war. He argued: [...] "There is a religious war {{going on in our}} country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself." [...] In addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed public morality as a defining issue:The agenda Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change America wants. It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change America needs. And it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} it is true. It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{weakness}} I have seen in him. He is weak and vain, but I should have said that he was true." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It isn't decent. I {{say that}} with all due {{deference}} to Lady Chiltern's better judgment. It's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that men do. I care less about it than most men, but even I object to such a proposition when it is made so openly. No doubt I am old." [...] This assertion Mr. Maule made in a weak, quavering voice, which showed that had his intention been that way turned in his youth, he might probably have earned his bread on the stage.|$|E
60|$|Jim did {{not like}} her working as she {{had worked for the}} last week or two, and if he had stopped they might have begun an argument. He would have gained nothing by this, for Carrie was obstinate and he {{admitted}} that he was now and then impatient. Carrie was plucky and they needed help, but cooking for the hired men was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> she ought to do. Then he had been disturbed in the night by a rattle of stones, and now saw he must grapple with a difficulty that was worse than he had thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll have to explain, because I don't {{know what}} to do. Lansing gave me a tip to buy some shares, and when some friends said I'd got a good thing, I went to him again. I must say he was pretty guarded, but I got a hint and acted on it, {{with the result that}} I have dropped a good deal of money. This," [...] he added deprecatingly, [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> I should talk to you about, but I was told that Lansing couldn't receive any callers, and you'll see why you should know." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him rather curiously, and, George thought, with some cause, for {{he was a little}} {{astonished}} at his outbreak. This was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> language that was most natural to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sadie's a {{very good}} sort," [...] Charnock resumed. [...] "She knows what we are, and doesn't expect too much; <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> girl to make ridiculous demands. In fact, Sadie can make allowances." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Wild Honey" [...] was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{song that}} drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. enjoyed. Despite being a playful side to U2 people rarely get to see, Mullen said, [...] "it wasn't {{one of my}} favourites." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it seemed}} at the moment, both to Blake and to myself. The music was manifestly <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that Mrs. Hartley could conceive. It was {{absolutely}} not commonplace. It was elliptical, touched with technical subtlety, although simple in appearance. At last a complete phrase was written out and partly harmonized. This, 'E. A.' said, {{was the beginning}} of a little piece that he had intended to call 'Unghere' or 'Hungarie.' Nothing in all my long experience with psychics ever moved me like the first phrase of that sweet, sad melody. It seemed like the touch of identification I had been seeking." ...|$|E
60|$|Dick {{looked as}} though he liked {{the idea of having a}} venture in the 'Old Stick-in-the-Mud.' Caldigate, without {{actually}} disbelieving all that had been said to him, did not relish the proposal. It was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> which they had intended. After they had learned their trade as miners it might be very well for them to have shares in some established concern;--but in that case he would wish to be one of the managers himself, and not to trust everything to any Crinkett, however honest. That suggestion of travelling about and amusing themselves, did not commend itself to him. New South Wales might, he thought, be a good country for work, but did not seem to offer much amusement beyond sheer idleness, and brandy-and-water.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} and thought; though on the surface the matter was clear--he had been cleverly outwitted by {{somebody}} who had exchanged the case while he got his meal. This, as he reflected, was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> for which a constable got promoted; {{but there were other}} points that required attention. The substitution had not been effected by anybody connected with the Queen's; it was, he suspected, the work of some of the frequenters of the Sachem; and he and his superiors had to contend with a well-organized gang. News of what had happened in the bluff had obviously been transmitted to the settlement while he had rested at Lansing's homestead. He had, however, made a long journey, and as he would have to ride on and report the matter to his sergeant in the morning, he went to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your uncle," [...] said Miss Port. [...] "He told me at our house. Of course, he didn't go into no particulars, {{but that}} isn't to be expected, he's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{man to do}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless {{you can get}} steam on her in {{the next}} few hours she'll be {{breaking}} up by morning. The reefs to lee <b>of</b> us are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ones I'd like to put a steamer ashore on, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all, madam," [...] was the {{somewhat}} depressed admission. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} something must have happened to him. He was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> gentleman to go away like this and leave no word behind him." ...|$|R
