5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States from England in August 1941 to {{find out}} why Briggs and his {{committee}} were apparently ignoring the MAUD Report. Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the urgency. In these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E

50|$|The Citizen Cup was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} 1995 regatta. Beginning with the 2000 America's Cup the defending yacht club <b>has</b> opted <b>not</b> {{to hold a}} defense selection regatta - America's Cup winners New Zealand and Switzerland <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to field multiple teams, while the United States chose to stand with 2010 Cup champion BMW Team Oracle for the 2013 competition.|$|R
50|$|West Marin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning weekly, the Point Reyes Light, has {{struggled}} financially for decades. Four years ago, David Mitchell sold the Light to Robert Plotkin; since that time, <b>the</b> newspaper <b>has</b> continued {{to struggle with}} limited resources and reduced staffing. <b>The</b> Light <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to provide <b>the</b> depth of community coverage that its editor desires and our community deserves.|$|R
5|$|Paradigm {{announced}} at E3 1997 {{that they were}} producing a Nintendo 64 sequel to Pilotwings 64. However, even though Nintendo expressed interest in Paradigm's early presentations, the game was cancelled because Nintendo did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to aid in its development at that time. There were rumors of a sequel on the Nintendo GameCube and later the Wii, development courtesy of Factor 5, but no game was ever shown. After their briefing time at E3 2010, Nintendo announced a sequel titled Pilotwings Resort for the Nintendo 3DS, which was released as a launch title for the handheld console.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartheid}} government greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people. However, it did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to effectively enforce censorship of written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it. Less {{than one hundred}} pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s. Thus music and performance {{played an important role}} in propagating subversive messages.|$|E
5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
30|$|Another {{major item}} for future {{research}} needs to address the trend towards outsourcing in the transportation sector. This trend {{means that there is}} a strong demand for better integration of transport management information. Often, the actual transport provider is a small company <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> and technical means to link into forwarder’s IT systems. The position of a shipment may therefore not be known on the legs of the trip that are outsourced.|$|R
50|$|Still {{more schools}} are {{actively}} pursuing a need-blind and / or full-need admissions policy but <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to fully implement it.|$|R
30|$|Barriers to {{implementing}} PROMs include clinicians {{believing they}} do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity {{to use them}} [14, 15], clinicians perceiving their practice is being judged on changes in PROMs scores [16], organisations <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to utilise PROMs, such as no administrative support [17] and organisations not incorporating PROMs into existing workflows [18]. There are also factors which facilitate implementation. Examples include choosing PROMs that clinicians feel are relevant to their patients [19], clinicians receiving feedback on their patients’ scores [20] and organisations providing sufficient training and support to staff on using PROMs [21].|$|R
5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be {{crucial for the}} success of Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used to}} replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began.|$|E
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it {{was again}} Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the {{critical}} role. Chetwode believed that the EEF did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert {{and would have to}} capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade– the last of history's great cavalry charges– to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.|$|E
50|$|In 1889 George Gillmore, {{formerly}} {{an electrician}} for the GPO's Manx telegraph operations, {{was granted a}} licence by the Postmaster General to operate the Isle of Man's first telephone service. Based in an exchange in Athol Street, early customers of Gilbert's telephone service included the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company and the Isle of Man Railway. <b>Not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to fund expansion or a link to England, Gillmore sold his licence to the National Telephone Company and stayed on as their manager on the island.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the American market, the J platform did not continue into <b>the</b> 1990s. <b>Not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to develop a mid-size car on their own, Isuzu forged a short-lived alliance with Subaru. This provided for Isuzu to supply Subaru with Isuzu Bighorns (rebadged as the Subaru Bighorn), while Isuzu rebadged Subaru's mid-size Legacy sedan as the Isuzu Aska, beginning in June 1990. Both rebadged models were sold only in the Japanese market. There was also a Subaru Leone Van version briefly available, badged as the Isuzu Geminett II.|$|R
50|$|The club {{is located}} in Athens, but it does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{financial}} <b>resources</b> {{to compete in the}} same manner as the big Athenian clubs like Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, and AEK Athens.|$|R
25|$|Gorbachev {{initiated}} {{a policy of}} glasnost (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for perestroika (economic restructuring). The Soviet Union was struggling economically after the long war in Afghanistan and did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to control Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The United States Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are {{responsible}} for prosecuting criminals who engage in credit card fraud in the United States. However, they do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to pursue all criminals, and in general they only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed in}} international waters, so the Egyptian government {{had the right}} to initiate its own search and rescue and investigation. Because the government did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to salvage the aircraft, the Egyptian government requested that the United States lead the investigation. The Egyptian government signed a letter formally ceding responsibility of investigating the accident to the United States.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} in October 2016 that 4.1.2 had been distributed with a known security hole (CVE-2016-1513) {{for nearly a}} year as <b>the</b> project <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> development <b>resources</b> to fix it.|$|R
50|$|When {{the tests}} became a formal part of nationally {{recognised}} assessment schemes, uniform national standards became necessary, and as NFYFC did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> necessary <b>resources</b> it gave up {{control of the}} scheme.|$|R
50|$|A P2P network {{generally}} {{consists of}} a large number of nodes each connected not to all other nodes, but a small subset of the nodes. If a node wants to find a <b>resource</b> on <b>the</b> network, which may be on a node it does not know about, it could simply broadcast its search query to its immediate neighbours. If <b>the</b> neighbours do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource,</b> it then asks its neighbours to forward the query to their neighbours in turn. This is repeated until <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> is found or all <b>the</b> nodes <b>have</b> been contacted, or perhaps a network-imposed hop limit is reached.|$|R
25|$|At {{the outset}} of World War II, there was {{controversy}} over whether Australia should concentrate on forming an expeditionary force for overseas service to fight Germany in Europe or a home defence force to fight Japan. Prime Minister Robert Menzies decided to do both, although {{the experience of the}} Great War indicated that Australia did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to do either.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a {{military}} base was begun in early 2011 at a three hectare site. The base {{is one of three}} being built to work against drug trafficking and other crimes along the Querétaro/San Luis Potosí border. This base is part of the 17th Military Zone to patrol the Querétaro-San Luis Potosí border. The military is there to countering drug trafficking in the area as the region does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> for local police forces.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans {{returned}} in 1476, this time assisted by their allies from Crimea, the Tartars and their newly conquered Vassal of Wallachia. Stephen {{knew that he}} did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to defend his people and evacuated them to the mountains. After a failed attack on the Ottoman vanguard Stephen seemed {{on the brink of}} defeat when King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary offered assistance. The Ottomans withdrew when the Hungarians began moving in and fighting did not resume until 1484.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{formally}} educated, experienced {{workers and}} entrepreneurs also opens reservations up to exploitation from outside firms looking {{to capitalize on}} <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> of reservation land. Although this land is often incredibly isolated geographically and absent of natural resources or productive potential, some areas do hold potential for development. Such development, though, requires a substantial amount be invested at the onset to build necessary infrastructure. Tribes are at a disadvantage, <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> or specialists needed. As such, they contract development out to firms off the reservation, who keep a {{great majority of the}} profits.|$|R
50|$|However, {{at the end}} of the 1980s, the Ministry of Defence did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{financial}} <b>resources</b> {{necessary for}} large-scale purchases of the VAZ-2122. As a result, it was never put into mass production.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the provincial}} {{governor}} had absolute power {{to intervene in}} civitas affairs, in practice civitates were largely autonomous, {{in part because the}} governor operated with a minimal bureaucracy and simply did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> for detailed micro-management of the civitates. Provided that the civitates collected and delivered their assessed annual tributum (poll and land taxes) and carried out required services such as maintaining trunk Roman roads that crossed their territory, they were largely left to run their own affairs by the central provincial administration.|$|E
25|$|FitzRoy quickly {{realized}} that he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> {{to bring about a}} quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy's Governorship, which they presented to the House of Commons in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by George Grey, then Governor of South Australia. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied.|$|E
25|$|As {{the boycott}} was relaxed (or rather, not as stringently enforced) {{starting}} in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many companies which previously {{stayed out of the}} Israeli market had entered it, e.g. McDonald's and Nestlé. In 1985, the ban was lifted on Ford, which had been in place since the company had opened an assembly plant in Israel, and Colgate-Palmolive, although five other companies were added to the blacklist. Toyota began selling cars in Israel in 1991, although it claimed that it had never complied with the boycott, arguing that it did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to sell cars in the country.|$|E

50|$|A rental {{relocation}} {{is normally}} required because the customer or end user {{of the equipment}} wants to move the rented item from one construction job site to another, or simply reposition on the existing site (particularly {{in the case of}} construction trailers, portable storage etc.). The key to why a relocation is necessary is that <b>the</b> customer does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> or equipment available to move the asset. For example trailers generally require on site services to be moved such as plumbing and electricity, they may require cranes to move them or load them onto trucks for moving.|$|R
50|$|Japan did <b>not</b> yet <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> {{to acquire}} battleships and so planned {{to employ the}} Jeune École {{doctrine}} which favoured small, fast warships, especially cruisers and torpedo boats, with guns powerful enough to destroy larger craft.|$|R
