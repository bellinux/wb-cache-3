40|$|Bioinformatics can be {{considered}} as a new field of study and it promises a vast exploration area (Carzaniga., Rosenblum., Wolf., 2001). In order to expedite the maturity in this area, a proper and supportive portal where all researchers could gather and cooperate in conducting their research need to be established. One of the features in a portal that can assist Bioinformatics researchers in performing their work is the ability of the portal to <b>notify.</b> <b>Notification</b> system is a combination of software and hardware to provide a method of distributing message(s) to a set of recipients. The notification messages could assist the recipients in many ways, from time saving and cost saving till life saving. Notification system can be developed with numerous functions depending on the needs and o ne of the most beneficial functions in research area is notification on the next most relevant knowledge to be read. This type of notification could lessen the researchers’ time in finding the correct thus enhancing their research efficiency. Another type of notification that could assist researchers is the events reminder. Busy and hectic researchers could forget their pack schedule and put total focus on their research while the reminder prompts them when it is time through Windows’ pop up, email and SMS as the means of delivering the messages. Whilst the knowledge management system (KMS) provides a sturdy basic for the Bioinformatics portal as a whole, the agent technology support the operation of the notification system. Agent technology offers great capabilities in ensuring the recipients is notified accordingly through its autonomous, learning and cooperative characteristics. The objective of this project is to build a notification system for Bioinformatics community of practice (CoP). Researchers in this community could utilize this system to make their research process more efficient. </span...|$|E

40|$|New {{strategies}} to support partner notification (PN) {{are critical for}} STD control and require detailed understanding of how specific individual and partnership characteristics guide notification decisions. From 2011 to 2012, 397 MSM and TW recently diagnosed with HIV, syphilis, or another STD completed a survey on anticipated notification of recent sexual partners and associated factors. Qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} a subset of participants to provide further depth to quantitative findings. Prevalence ratios and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to analyze participant- and partner-level factors associated with anticipated PN. Among all partners reported, 52. 5 % were described as "Very Likely" or "Somewhat Likely" to be <b>notified.</b> Anticipated <b>notification</b> was more likely for main partners than casual (adjusted Prevalence Ratio [aPR], 95 % CI: 0. 63, 0. 54 - 0. 75) or commercial (aPR, 95 % CI: 0. 44, 0. 31 - 0. 62) partners. Other factors associated with likely notification included perception of the partner as an STD source (aPR, 95 % CI: 1. 27, 1. 10 - 1. 48) and anticipated future sexual contact with the partner (aPR, 95 % CI: 1. 30, 1. 11 - 1. 52). An HIV diagnosis was associated with a lower likelihood of notification than non-HIV STDs (aPR: 0. 68, 0. 55 - 0. 86). Qualitative discussion of the barriers and incentives to PN reflected a similar differentiation of anticipated notification according to partnership type and type of HIV/STD diagnosis. Detailed attention to how partnership characteristics guide notification outcomes is essential to the development of new PN strategies. By accurately and thoroughly assessing the diversity of partnership interactions among individuals with HIV/STD, new notification techniques can be tailored to partner-specific circumstances...|$|R
40|$|In Afghanistan, {{improving}} TB case detection remains challenging. In 2014, {{only half}} of the estimated incident TB cases were <b>notified,</b> and <b>notifications</b> have decreased since peaking in 2007. Active case finding has been increasingly considered to improve TB case notifications. While access to health services has improved in Afghanistan, it remains poor and many people seeking health services won't receive proper care. From October 2011 through December 2012 we conducted three separate case finding strategies in six provinces of Afghanistan and measured impact on TB case notification. Systematically screening cough among attendees at 47 health facilities, active household contact investigation of smear-positive index TB patients, and active screening at 15 camps for internally displaced people were conducted. We collected both intervention yield and official quarterly notification data. Additional TB notifications were calculated by comparing numbers of cases notified during the intervention with those notified before the intervention, then adjusting for secular trends in notification. We screened 2, 022, 127 people for TB symptoms during the intervention, tested 59, 838 with smear microscopy and detected 5, 046 people with smear-positive TB. Most cases (81. 7 %, 4, 125) were identified in health facilities while nearly 20 % were found through active case finding. A 56 % increase in smear-positive TB notifications was observed between the baseline and intervention periods among the 47 health facilities, where cases detected by all three strategies were notified. While most people with TB are likely to be identified through health facility screening, {{there are many people who}} remain without a proper diagnosis if outreach is not attempted. This is especially true in places like Afghanistan where access to general services is poor. Targeted active case finding can improve the number of people who are detected and treated for TB and can push towards the targets of the Stop TB Global Plan and End TB Strategy...|$|R

40|$|Background: In August 2011, the German Protection against Infection Act was amended, mandating the {{reporting}} of healthcare associated infection (HAI) outbreak notifications by all healthcare workers in Germany via local public health authorities and federal states to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Objective: To describe the reported HAI-outbreaks and the surveillance system’s structure and capabilities. Methods: Information on each outbreak was collected using standard paper forms and <b>notified</b> to RKI. <b>Notifications</b> were screened daily and regularly analysed. Results: Between November 2011 and November 2012, 1, 326 paper forms notified 578 HAI-outbreaks, between 7 and 116 outbreaks per month. The main causative agent was norovirus (n = 414 / 578; 72 %). Among the 108 outbreaks caused by bacteria, the most frequent pathogens were Clostridium difficile (25 %) Klebsiella spp. (19 %) and Staphylococcus spp. (19 %). Multidrug-resistant bacteria were responsible for 54 / 108 (50 %) bacterial outbreaks. Hospitals were affected most frequently (485 / 578; 84 %). Hospital outbreaks due to bacteria were mostly reported from intensive care units (ICUs) (45 %), followed by internal medicine wards (16 %).

40|$|AbstractEpisodes {{of adult}} {{bacterial}} meningitis (ABM) at a Danish hospital in 1991 – 2000 were identified from the databases of the Department of Clinical Microbiology, and compared {{with data from}} the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish National Notification System. Reduced penicillin susceptibility occurred in 21 (23 %) of 92 cases of known aetiology, compared to an estimated 6 %in nationally notified cases (p < 0. 001). Ceftriaxone plus penicillin as empirical treatment was appropriate in 97 % of ABM cases in the study population, and in 99. 6 % of nationally <b>notified</b> cases. The <b>notification</b> rate was 75 % for penicillin-susceptible episodes, and 24 % for penicillin-non-susceptible episodes (p < 0. 001). Cases involving staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were under-reported. Among 51 ABM cases with no identified risk factors, nine of 11 cases with penicillin-non-susceptible bacteria were community-acquired. Severe sequelae correlated independently with age, penicillin non-susceptibility, mechanical ventilation and non-transferral to a tertiary hospital (p < 0. 05; logistic regression). Other factors that correlated with severe sequelae by univariate analysis only were inappropriate clinical handling, abnormal consciousness, convulsions and nosocomial infection. Overall, the data indicated that neither age alone, community-acquired infection nor absence of identified risk factors can predict susceptibility to penicillin accurately. Recommendations for empirical antibiotic treatment for ABM should not be based exclusively on clinical notification systems with possible unbalanced under-reporting...|$|R

METHODS Exploratory study, considering cases of classical dengue and severe dengue with laboratory confirmation of the infection in the city of Rio de Janeiro during the years 2011 / 2012. The georeferencing technique was applied for the cases <b>notified</b> in the <b>Notification</b> Increase Information System in the period of 2011 and 2012. For this process, the fields “street” and “number” were used. The ArcGis 10 program’s Geocoding tool’s automatic process was performed. The spatial analysis was done through the kernel density estimator. RESULTS Kernel density pointed out hotspots for classic dengue that did not coincide geographically with severe dengue and were in or near favelas. The kernel ratio did not show a notable change in the spatial distribution pattern observed in the kernel density analysis. The georeferencing process showed a loss of 41 % of classic dengue registries and 17 % of severe dengue registries due to the address in the Notification Increase Information System form. CONCLUSIONS The hotspots near the favelas suggest that the social vulnerability of these localities can be an influencing factor for the occurrence of this aggravation since there is a deficiency of the supply and access to essential goods and services for the population.

40|$|Time {{needed to}} report {{surveillance}} data {{within the public}} health service delays public health actions. The amendment to the infection protection act (IfSG) from 29 March 2013 requires local and state public health agencies to report surveillance data within one working day instead of one week. We analysed factors associated with reporting time and evaluated the IfSG amendment. Local reporting time is the time between date of notification and date of export to the state public health agency and state reporting time is time between date of arrival at the state public health agency and the date of export. We selected cases reported between 28 March 2012 and 28 March 2014. We calculated the median local and state reporting time, stratified by potentially influential factors, computed a negative binominal regression model and assessed quality and workload parameters. Before the IfSG amendment the median local reporting time was 4 days and 1 day afterwards. The state reporting time was 0 days before and after. Influential factors are the individual local public health agency, the <b>notified</b> disease, the <b>notification</b> software and the day of the week. Data quality and workload parameters did not change. The IfSG amendment has decreased local reporting time, no relevant loss of data quality or identifiable workload-increase could be detected.

40|$|Introduction: Violence {{against the}} elderly {{person can be}} any act, single or repetitive, or omission, that causes harm or {{discomfort}} and reduces {{the quality of life}} of the elderly. Objective: To identify the demographic characteristics of elderly victims of violence, <b>notified</b> by the <b>Notification</b> of Injury Information System (SINAN) in the municipality of Porto Nacional - TO in the year 2014, to characterize the most reported forms of violence, the place of occurrence, the means of aggression and the relationship with the victim. Method: This is an epidemiological, descriptive and exploratory study with a quantitative approach. The survey was conducted through reports issued by SINAN in Porto Nacional. The study population consisted of 130 reports of violence. Data collection took place in April. The data were released with the help of Excel tables and analyzed through BioEstat 5. 0. Result: It was possible to identify that the majority of the elderly were males, with a mean age of 78. 3 years, of brown color, who had schooling, married/stable union, retired and had no physical or mental disabilities. In relation to the type of violence suffered by the elderly, physical violence had more notifications. The place of occurrence was in the elderly’s own houses and the relation between aggressor and victim was unknown. Conclusion: The results found in this study evidenced the importance of notifying all the cases and it is suggested a protocol of attendance to people in situation of violence for all the professionals that compose the networks of care, among these, primary care, hospitals, social action department and public prosecutor's office, which could facilitate the identification of signs of violence...|$|R

METHODS This is a program evaluation research, with ecological design, which uses three non-hierarchical groups of the municipalities of the State of São Paulo according to their performance in relation to operational indicators. We have selected 195 municipalities with at least five new cases of tuberculosis <b>notified</b> in the <b>Notification</b> System of the State of São Paulo and with 20, 000 inhabitants or more in 2010. The multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify the association between the groups of different performances, the epidemiological and demographic characteristics, and the characteristics of the health systems of the municipalities. RESULTS The group with the worst performance showed the highest rates of abandonment (average [avg] = 10. 4, standard deviation [sd] = 9. 4) and the lowest rates of supervision of Directly Observed Treatment (avg = 6. 1, sd = 12. 9), and it was associated with low incidence of tuberculosis, high tuberculosis and HIV, small population, high coverage of the Family Health Strategy/Program of Community Health Agents, and being located on the countryside. The group with the best performance presented the highest cure rate (avg = 83. 7, sd = 10. 5) and the highest rate of cases in Directly Observed Treatment (avg = 83. 0, sd = 12. 7); the group of regular performance showed regular results for outcome (avg cure = 79. 8, sd = 13. 2; abandonment avg = 9. 5, sd = 8. 3) and supervision of the Directly Observed Treatment (avg = 42. 8, sd = 18. 8).
