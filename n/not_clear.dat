5|$|George E. Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875. The {{cause of}} death was a liver abscess, {{although}} whether it was amoebic or bacterial is <b>not</b> <b>clear.</b> He was initially interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk. His remains were disinterred on October 23 and he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia on October 24, 1875. More than 40,000 people lined the funeral route while another 5,000 marched in the funeral procession. A memorial to Pickett was erected over his grave site and dedicated on October 5, 1888. The memorial was not, however, placed directly above Pickett's burial site, and the exact location of his remains is <b>not</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

Therefore, this small increase in the probability of <b>not</b> <b>clearing</b> a fault is acceptable, as it offers a significant reduction in the likelihood of inappropriate protection action from exacerbating stressed conditions and driving the system closer to a blackout [22].|$|R

The only shells retained were the OF-530, O-530, G-530/G-530Sh, and possibly chemical shells. The Soviet Army also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, but it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> whether that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> what {{portion of}} the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses {{to decide whether the}} dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E
