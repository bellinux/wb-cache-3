But an Opposition that day after day exposes the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Prime Minister to a rain of questions and cross-questions, the only object of which, or an important object of which, is to promote a feeling of insecurity, involving demands for <b>new</b> <b>expenditure</b> of an almost indefinite character, those who, like the right hon.

(M123) When {{the time}} came {{for him to take}} stock of his own performances, Mr. Lowe, who was apt to be cleverer than he was wise, made a speech at Sheffield, in September 1873, that almost recalls the self-laudation of Cicero over the immortal glories of his consulate. He disclaimed any share of the admirable genius for finance that had been seen in Pitt, Peel, or Gladstone, but he had read in the Latin grammar that economy was a great revenue, and he thought that he could at least {{discharge}} the humble task of hindering extravagance. “The first thing I did as chancellor of the exchequer,” he said, “was to issue an order that no <b>new</b> <b>expenditure</b> whatever would be allowed without my opinion first being taken upon it.... In an evil hour for my own peace and quietness I took upon myself—I believe it was never taken upon himself by any chancellor of the exchequer before—the duty of protecting the revenue, instead of leaving it to be done by an inferior official.” After reciting his figures, he wound up with a resounding pæan: “So far as I am aware, up to the present time there is no one who can challenge comparison with what has been done during these years. Sir R. Peel and Mr. Gladstone routed out protection in your trade, a measure that conferred immortal honour on them, but so far as relieving you from taxation is concerned, I believe you would seek in vain in British history for anything like what has been done during these last four years.” This strange vein {{was more than a little}} distasteful to the prime minister, as a letter to Lord Granville upon it shows (Sept. 9, 1873):— ...|$|E

5000|$|Unlike some price indices (like the CPI), the GDP {{deflator}} is {{not based}} on a fixed basket of goods and services. The basket is allowed to change with people's consumption and investment patterns. [...] Specifically, for the GDP deflator, the [...] "basket" [...] in each year is the set of all goods that were produced domestically, weighted by the market value of the total consumption of each good. Therefore, <b>new</b> <b>expenditure</b> patterns are allowed to show up in the deflator as people respond to changing prices. The theory behind this approach is that the GDP deflator reflects up to date expenditure patterns. For instance, if the price of chicken increases relative to the price of beef, it is claimed that people will likely spend more money on beef as a substitute for chicken.|$|E
50|$|There is a Council (dating from 1874), {{which oversees}} {{academic}} matters. All {{decisions of the}} Council require {{the approval of the}} Board, but if the decision in question does not require a <b>new</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the approval is normally formal, without debate. The Council had a significant number of elected representatives from the start, and was also larger than the Board, which at that time, continued to consist of the Provost and seven Senior Fellows only. The Council is the formal body which makes academic staff appointments, always, in practice on the recommendation of appointments panels, but which have themselves been appointed by the Council. An illustration {{of the relationship between the}} Board and the Council, is where a decision is made to create a new professorial chair. As this involves paying a salary, the initial decision to create the chair is made by the Council, but the decision to make provision for the salary is made by the Board, consequently the Board might over rule, or defer a Council decision on grounds of cost.|$|E

Results from the regular WIFO business survey suggest that improved sales prospects will induce companies to carry out new investment projects.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} compare Ireland's G D P per capita to other {{countries}} in the early twentieth century, a <b>new</b> <b>expenditure</b> based estimate for 1907 is presented in this article. Since it broadly adopts Feinstein's method for estimating U K G D P, it is more compatible with the U K figures than previous estimates and therefore provides a better benchmark for comparison with other countries. In general expenditure based G D P estimates tend to come out higher than income or output based estimates. I f the latter methods are adopted for Ireland and compared to Feinstein's figures for the U K, this will tend to understate Ir i sh performance. This paper attempts to reconcile this problem by adopting a more compatible methodology; it concludes that Ireland's economic performance was better than earlier estimates suggest...|$|E

40|$|Economists {{generally}} {{believe that}} countercyclical fiscal policies have stabilizing effects that work through automatic stabilizers and discretionary actions. Analyses underlying this conventional wisdom focus on intratemporal margins: how employment and personal income respond {{in the short}} run to changes in government expenditures and taxes. But in economic downturns, countercyclical policies increase government indebtedness, raising future debt service obligations. These <b>new</b> <b>expenditure</b> commitments must be financed by some mix of higher taxes, lower spending, or higher money growth in the future. Expectations of how future policies will adjust change current savings rates and the efficacy of countercyclical policies. It is thus possible for responses to expected future policies to exacerbate and prolong recessions. This paper highlights these expectations effects. Connecting the theory to U. S. data we find: (1) through this expectations channel, countercyclical policies may create a business cycle when there would be no cycle in the absence of countercyclical policies; (2) nontrivial fractions of variation in investment and velocity can be explained by variation in macro policies alone [...] -without any nonpolicy sources of fluctuation; and (3) persistence in key macro variables can arise solely from expectations of policy. ...|$|E

40|$|Major {{competitors}} {{of commercial}} banks frequently refinance consumer loans before maturity. They may do so either {{to maintain an}} ongoing credit relationship with a customer or to alleviate payment problems for customers experiencing credit difficulties. From a legal standpoint, creditors who engage in refinancings often are subject to laws regulating calculations of interest rebates on prepaid obligations. In addition, occasionally, as in Maine, refinanced balances nay be subject to different finance rate ceilings, etc., depending {{on the length of}} time unpaid balances are left outstanding. However, practically nothing is known {{about the extent to which}} commercial banks engage in consumer loan refinancings and whether, in fact, they need be much concerned about such laws. Little is known, also, about the types of loans banks are most likely to refinance and of their motives for doing so (to maintain bank-customer relationships or to reduce customer payment difficulties). This paper analyzes data on over 30, 000 consumer loans made from 1965 - 71 in five regions of the country by banks that participated in a Federal Reserve survey of bank consumer lending practices. By analyzing the frequency with which consumer loans were paid off by refinancing and the reasons for the refinancing it provides several useful insights into bank behavior. In particular, this analysis suggests that banks refinance only a small and declining portion of their total consumer loans. They do not appear to use refinancings as a way to maintain ongoing customer relation ships; however, they refinance loans more frequently to allow customers to make <b>new</b> <b>expenditures</b> than to meet payment problems. Nonetheless, refinancings to meet payment difficulties rose consistently during the 1969 - 70 recession. Data computed in this study suggests that riskier types of loans were not more likely to be refinanced than better quality types of loans however, individual bad loans were more likely to be refinanced than individual good loans. Finally, over time, possibly because of the growth of revolving credit, loans were les-s likely to be refinanced to allow bank customers to make <b>new</b> <b>expenditures.</b> I...|$|R
