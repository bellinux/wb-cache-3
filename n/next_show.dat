5|$|Abbott asked Donen {{to appear}} in the chorus of his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He quickly became the show's {{assistant}} stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's <b>next</b> <b>show</b> Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers {{could not find a}} clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the <b>next</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} <b>next</b> <b>show,</b> against the advice of his staff.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} of Mine All Mine, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce the revival of Doctor Who, which completed his decade-long quest to return the series to the airwaves. At the time, he was developing two scripts: the first, a cinematic adaptation of the Charles Ingram-Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? scandal, was cancelled after he accepted the Doctor Who job; and the second, a dramatisation {{of the life of}} the Venetian adventurer and lover Giacomo Casanova, was his <b>next</b> <b>show</b> with Red Productions.|$|E
5|$|To help {{design the}} next major show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} from the National Circus School {{who had been working}} in Belgium. When he joined the troupe in 1985, he brought with him his experience in commedia dell'arte techniques, which he imparted to the performers. Although his experience would be limited in the <b>next</b> <b>show</b> due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct every show up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E
50|$|Later, a {{fight between}} the Flag-Smasher and Araña was described. The second Flag-Smasher struck Araña with his mace, but Spider-Man later {{defeated}} him. He was <b>next</b> <b>shown</b> being described as the new Flag-Smasher.|$|R

5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the <b>next</b> <b>show,</b> and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers did {{not appear}} for JAPW again until late 2005, again in a tables, ladders, and chairs match for the tag team title, this time against the teams of Teddy Hart and Homicide, the Backseat Boyz, and The S.A.T.. The match, which took place at JAPW's 8th Year Anniversary Show, was won Hart and Homicide. At the <b>next</b> <b>show,</b> Fall Out, the S.A.T. {{defeated}} them and thus became number one contenders to the tag team championship. More recent JAPW appearances came in early 2006, losing along with the Outcast Killers to the S.A.T. once again at Wild Card II in a tag team title match, and then at Brotherly Love to the team of Sabu and Sonjay Dutt, a match they also lost. In October 2008, the Briscoes competed at JAPW's 11th Anniversary Show against LAX (Homicide and Hernandez). During a brawl outside the ring, Mark suffered a large gash {{on the side of}} his head.|$|E
5|$|They {{dropped the}} tag team {{title to the}} CM Punk and Colt Cabana at ROH's Chicago-area debut, ROH Reborn: Stage Two, working in ROH {{for the first time}} as outward heels. At the <b>next</b> <b>show,</b> Round Robin Challenge III, the title {{switched}} three times among the teams in the round robin challenge, the Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana), the Briscoe Brothers, and the Prophecy team of Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. The Briscoes defeated Maff and Whitmer in the fourth match of the night to win the title for a second time, and then lost it back to Punk and Cabana in the main event. The Brothers both participated in ROH's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament, with Mark going over Alex Shelley in his qualifier and Jay falling to Homicide. Mark did not, however, win the elimination final. After losing a two out of three falls tag team title match to Punk and Cabana at Death Before Dishonor II Part 1, ending that feud, they lost in separate singles matches to members of The Rottweilers the next night. Between that and their victory in tag team action at Testing the Limit, it is likely that a feud was planned between the Briscoes and the Rottweilers.|$|E
6000|$|... 16. How little method {{there is}} in our present {{formation}} of them, I am myself more and more surprised as I consider. A child is shown a rose, and told that he is to call every flower like that, 'Rosaceous';[52] he is <b>next</b> {186} <b>shown</b> a lily, and told that he is to call every flower like that, 'Liliaceous';--so far well; but he is <b>next</b> <b>shown</b> a daisy, and {{is not at all}} allowed to call every flower like that, 'Daisaceous,' but he must call it, like the fifth order of architecture, 'Composite'; and being <b>next</b> <b>shown</b> a pink, he is not allowed to call other pinks 'Pinkaceous,' but 'Nut-leafed'; and being <b>next</b> <b>shown</b> a pease-blossom, he is not allowed to call other pease-blossoms 'Peasaceous,' but, in a brilliant burst of botanical imagination, he is incited to call it by two names instead of one, 'Butterfly-aceous' from its flower, and 'Pod-aceous' from its seed;--the inconsistency of the terms thus enforced upon him being perfected in their inaccuracy, for a daisy is not one whit more composite than Queen of the meadow, or Jura Jacinth;[53] and 'legumen' is not Latin for a pod, but 'siliqua,'--so that no good scholar could remember Virgil's 'siliqua quassante legumen,' without overthrowing all his Pisan nomenclature.|$|R

The game was <b>next</b> <b>shown</b> at the Tokyo Game Show in September. A near complete build was sent to gaming websites in January 2005, when it was revealed the branching system had been removed and the game now followed a linear level-by-level progression system.|$|R

He collapsed and died of heart failure two weeks afterwards, on the morning of 19 April 1992, aged 75.

In 1927, her family suffered misfortune. Their house and furnishings were lost to settle a financial legal judgment after a neighborhood boy was accidentally shot and paralyzed by someone target shooting in their yard under the supervision of Ball's grandfather.
