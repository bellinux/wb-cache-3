25|$|Four-stroke radials have an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> per row, {{so that a}} {{consistent}} every-other-piston firing order can be maintained, providing smooth operation. For example, on a five-cylinder engine the firing order is 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 and back to cylinder 1. Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression. The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire, making the motion more uniform. If an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> were used, an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible. The prototype radial Zoche aero-diesels (below) have an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> either four or eight; {{but this is not}} problematic, because they are two-stroke engines, with twice the number of power strokes as a four-stroke engine.|$|E

40|$|We prove three {{fundamental}} properties <b>of</b> counting holomorphic <b>cylinders</b> in log Calabi-Yau surfaces: positivity, integrality and the gluing formula. Positivity and integrality {{assert that}} the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> defined via virtual techniques, are in fact nonnegative integers. The gluing formula roughly says that cylinders can be glued together to form longer <b>cylinders,</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> longer <b>cylinders</b> equals the product <b>of</b> the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> shorter <b>cylinders.</b> Our approach uses Berkovich geometry, tropical geometry, deformation theory and the ideas in the proof of associativity relations of Gromov-Witten invariants by Maxim Kontsevich. These three properties provide an evidence for a conjectural relation between counting cylinders and the broken lines of Gross-Hacking-Keel. Comment: Improved presentatio...|$|R

25|$|The AMA Competition Committee {{recognised}} {{the need}} for more variation of racing motorcycle and changed the rules from 1970, by standardizing a full 750cc displacement for all engines regardless of valve location or <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> enabling Triumph and BSA to field their 750cc triples instead of the 500cc Triumph Daytona twins.|$|E
25|$|The {{number eight}} {{refers to the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> of Spyker's Ferrari engine – the same {{rationale}} as used with road-going Spykers.

5000|$|In a radial engine, {{cylinders}} {{are arranged}} radially in a circle. Simple radials use one row (i.e. one circle) <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Larger radials use two rows, or even four. Most radials are air-cooled with separate cylinders {{and so there}} are no banks as such. Most radials also have odd <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> in each row and stagger these between successive rows, for better cooling.|$|R
25|$|The {{radial engine}} {{normally}} uses fewer cam lobes than other types. As with most four-strokes, the crankshaft takes two revolutions {{to complete the}} four strokes of each piston (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust). The camshaft ring is geared to spin slower and {{in the opposite direction}} to the crankshaft. The cam lobes are placed in two rows for the intake and exhaust. For the example, four cam lobes serve all five cylinders, whereas 10 would be required for a typical inline engine with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> and valves.|$|E
25|$|The Nordberg Manufacturing Company of the United States {{developed}} {{and produced a}} series of large two-stroke radial diesel engines from the late 1940s for electrical production, primarily at aluminium smelters and for pumping water. They differed from most radials in that they had an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> in a single bank (or row) and an unusual double master connecting rod. Variants were built that could be run on either diesel oil or gasoline or mixtures of both. A number of powerhouse installations utilising large numbers of these engines {{were made in the}} U.S.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} no {{medium-sized}} sedan bearing the Citroen name since the 1930s.

The GS was an exceptionally aerodynamic, modern and spacious medium-sized sedan with a compact air-cooled four-cylinder boxer motor driving the front wheels. Apart from the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> that description fits pretty well with the car the Panhard 24 would have become had Panhard been permitted to build the range into a more direct replacement for the Panhard PL 17.|$|E

50|$|The terms {{supersport}} and superbike {{are sometimes}} applied indiscriminately to all high-performance motorcycles. Categorization by engine displacement alone is a crude measure, particularly when comparing engines with different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> like inline or V fours with parallel and V twins, {{not to mention}} the greater power for a given displacement of two-stroke engines over four strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Volkswagen Group went on {{to produce}} a W16 engine {{prototype}} which produced [...] for the Bentley Hunaudières concept car. A quad-turbocharged version of this engine went into production in 2005 powering the [...] Bugatti Veyron EB16.4. The major advantage of these engines is packaging; they contain high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> but are relatively compact in their external dimensions.|$|R
25|$|The usual {{configurations}} {{used for}} increased primary gas supply are manifolded or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple side mounted cylinders, or rebreathers. Bailout and decompression gas may {{be included in}} these arrangements, or carried separately as side-mounted stage and decompression cylinders. Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and {{where they will be}} used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the maximum operating depth and if applicable, minimum operating depth.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{capacity}} of older HDDs is calculated {{as the product}} of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of zones of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder-head-sector (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter. When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, , has between one and four platters.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the {{increasing}} engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both rev and air-intake limiters to avoid the costs of re-engineering their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but {{early in the season}} it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded last year, with the V10 engines.|$|E
50|$|A V16 {{engine is}} {{perfectly}} balanced {{regardless of the}} V angle without requiring contra-rotating balancing shafts which are necessary to balance engines with odd <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> in-line or those equipped with counterweighted crankshafts like the 90° V8. In addition V angles of 45° and 135° give an impulse every 45°, so are optimal solutions, for even-firing and non-split bearing crankshaft journals.|$|R
5000|$|With an old BIOS limit <b>of</b> 1024 <b>cylinders</b> and the ATA {{limit of}} 16 heads the {{combined}} effect was 1024&times;16&times;63=1032192 sectors, i.e., a 504 MiB limit for sector size 512. BIOS translation schemes known as ECHS and revised ECHS mitigated this limitation by using 128 or 240 instead of 16 heads, simultaneously reducing the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> and sectors {{to fit into}} [...] (ECHS limit: 4032 MiB) or [...] (revised ECHS limit: 7560 MiB) for the given total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sectors on a disk.|$|R

25|$|MotoGP-class {{motorcycles}} are {{not restricted}} to any specific engine configuration. However, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; {{the weight of the}} extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series use this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in 1941 and {{continuing}} through 1999, Oldsmobile used a two digit model designation.

2500|$|Starting {{with the}} 140 series in 1966, Volvo used a tri-digit system for their cars. The first number was the series, the second number the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{and the third}} number the number of doors; so a 164 was a 1-series with a six-cylinder engine and four doors.
