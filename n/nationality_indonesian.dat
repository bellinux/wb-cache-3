40|$|Since the {{established}} literature is mostly political, economic, and social histories of modern Indonesia, my thesis will establish motivations behind {{the context of}} the discrimination of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia with particular attention on how it affects the perception of ethnic Chinese Indonesian’s nationality. Most of the times in {{the established}} literature, the history, motivations, and consequences behind the discrimination of the ethnic Chinese are briefly summarized or put in as an afterthought. Most of the present day established literature is focused on how the now-allowed Chinese imports are starting to influence Indonesian culture and how post-Suharto regimes have taken steps to at least tolerate the ethnic Chinese population. Since Indonesia is such a new nation, it is important to establish why a key player in its initial start up economy was targeted for racism for so long. My thesis will use the thread of Dutch colonialism and the impact of Western ideologies of democracy and nationalism to explain the reasons behind ethnic Chinese discrimination in Indonesia. Thus, my thesis question will ask what are the reasons behind the discrimination of the ethnic Chinese and how it affected perception of ethnic Chinese <b>Indonesian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Furthermore, my thesis question will address all the sub-questions that come ! 4 with it such as do the roots stem from Dutch colonization or does it go back further than that? How can the ethnic Chinese be discriminated against socially when most of them are in the upper economic strata of the country? Do the native Indonesians consider the ethnic Chinese Indonesian to be proper citizens of Indonesia? Do the ethnic Chinese consider themselves as citizens of Indonesia or China? And how did different ruling regimes affect the perceptions of Chinese <b>Indonesian</b> <b>nationality...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The use of Budi Utomo to {{mark the}} {{inception}} of modern nationalism in Indonesia is not without controversy. Although many scholars agree that Budi Utomo was likely the first modern indigenous political organization, others question its value as an index of <b>Indonesian</b> <b>nationality.</b> For example, in his novels, Pramoedya Ananta Toer pointed to the exclusively aristocratic and male composition of Budi Utomo. Ariel Heryanto questions the nationalism of Budi Utomo, given that its existence was permitted by the Dutch regime: [...] "Because of Utomo's remarkably conservative character, the Dutch colonial administration tolerated it." [...] Heryanto points to a [...] "more populist and egalitarian" [...] Muslim association (Sarekat Dagang Islamiyah), born a few years prior, as a more genuinely nationalist organization: one which was banned by the Dutch. In enshrining Budi Utomo as the first nationalist organization, the current government reiterates the colonial version of history.|$|R

One {{of them is}} the national disintegration that threaten the existence of Pancasila, UUD 1945 and The Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI) agreed by {{a large part of the}} nation. National disintegration problems actually come from groups of Muslim themselves. The behavior of Muslims cannot be separated from the influence of fatwa, the direction of the scholars, teachers, and clerics who become their role model. And the scholars, teachers, and clerics cannot be separated from the influence of what they read. Among their reading materials is in the form of Qur 2 ̆ 7 an interpretation. Among the books of interpretation which has considerable influence is an-Nur interpretation by Hasbi ash-Shiddieqy, al-Azhar interpretation by Hamka and al-Mishbāh by Quraish Shihab which of course in those third interpretations contains political verses of interpretation. Khalifah verses which are closely related to political issues are chosen as the material in the study of this article. There are nine verses containing the word of khalifah, two verses in the singular (Khalifah) and seven verses in the plural (khulafā 2 ̆ 7 / khalāif).

40|$|This study {{critically}} and reflexively {{explores the}} professional learning of five English language teacher educators (of <b>Indonesian</b> <b>nationality)</b> in an <b>Indonesian</b> context. The {{main focus of}} this qualitative study is an investigation into how the five teacher educators from a single private university in Indonesia understand their professional work and lives in dialogic (Bakhtin, 1981) relationship with various national policy documents and with international ELT professionalism discourses. I explore how the Indonesian teacher educators experience and understand their work and professionalism {{in the area of}} English Language Teaching (ELT), their commitment to their profession and the various factors that mediate these experiences and understandings. In this exploration, there is a particular focus on the nature of language, identity and culture in intercultural teacher education settings. I use a narrative-based inquiry framework (cf. Cole & Knowles, 2000; Doecke & Parr, 2009; Riessman, 2002) to generate critical accounts of these teacher educators describing, reflecting upon and conceptualizing their teacher ‘professionalism’ within the context of Indonesian society and culture. The data is drawn from extended narrative interviews with individual teacher educators, and the interview responses were approached as narrative accounts (Mishler, 1986). In processing the teacher educators’ narratives, I firstly constructed short biographies of their professional learning experiences. Subsequently, I analysed the different commonalities and the particularities of the teacher educators’ experiences, teaching beliefs, professional identities, the issues with which they were grappling {{in the course of their}} professional learning, and the place of imagination in the work of ELT teacher educators in Indonesia. Since I myself have also worked as a teacher educator in Indonesia, I was able to build in an additional critical perspective by interweaving reflexive autobiographical observations vis-a-vis certain experiences and issues emerging from the study of the teacher educators. The study overall demonstrates the complex, nuanced and dynamic nature of professional learning and intercultural identity construction, involving multiple, sometimes competing discourses of professionalism in ELT. The teacher educators’ professional learning narratives provide an insight into their “struggle for voice” (Britzman, 2003) in their immediate teaching and learning context as well as internationally. I show how it is through this struggle that the teacher educators encounter and engage with these discourses and continuously negotiate their understandings of their professional work and lives. From the teacher educators’ critical discussion on ELT paradigms and practices in Indonesia, this study also emphasises the importance of revisiting, re-evaluating, and reimagining the teaching paradigm of ELT in Indonesia in engaging with today’s globalized world. I call for pedagogical and curriculum reform in ELT that takes into account Indonesian learners’ linguistic and cultural identity and that will enable them to use English as a language that mediates their identity work as national, international and intercultural selves...|$|R

A report in 2016 stated that a Cambodian maid detained in one of Malaysian immigration centre saw three women of Cambodian and Vietnamese nationalities die there after been severely tortured, with other <b>nationalities</b> like Thai, <b>Indonesian</b> and Laotian prisoners badly tortured as well. Previously in 2012, one Cambodian maid died after been starved to death by her employer. Since 2011, Cambodia has banned its domestic workers from travelling to Malaysia. The issues led to protest and criticism from various human rights groups in Cambodia who demanded the Cambodian government stop sending domestic workers until Malaysia adhered strictly to human rights, although many Cambodians continued to explore job opportunities, mainly as domestic workers, in the hope of earning more money than they could at their home country. Following negotiation between the two countries government, Cambodia lifted the ban for its workers to going to Malaysia, with Malaysia also legalising any Cambodians maid working illegally in the country.

5000|$|During {{the era of}} the VOC, the Moluccans {{were not}} only forced to trade with the VOC only, but also to focus solely on the {{production}} of cloves. After the downfall of the VOC and the collapse of the trade in cloves, they were fully dependent on the colonial structure and found occupation in the colonial army. The Ambonese were regarded as fierce fighters, reliable soldiers and absolutely loyal to the Dutch Crown. It was precisely this reputation that made them unpopular with other <b>Indonesian</b> <b>nationalities.</b> The Malay nickname for them was Belanda Hitam, which translates to [...] "Black Dutch" [...] in English. All of this put them in a difficult position during both the Japanese occupation and the Indonesian national revolution. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, most of the Moluccan soldiers were only briefly interned as prisoners of war (POWs). Initially, the Japanese occupation force decided to release them from military duty and send them home. However, the Japanese quickly discovered their miscalculation when the Moluccans became among the most active in the resistance movement against them. Throughout the occupied Dutch East Indies, Moluccan soldiers created underground resistance cells aiding the Allied forces. Some of these cells were active in gathering intelligence; other sleeper cells hid weapons in strategic locations waiting to take up arms during an Allied invasion. The Japanese secret police (Kempeitai) responded by torturing and beheading any suspect, which usually did not deter the Moluccans. After the capitulation of the Imperial Japanese Army to the Allied forces, the Moluccan soldiers acted equally defiantly towards the Indonesian revolutionaries trying to fill the power vacuum left by the Japanese. Smaller scale conflicts in the Bersiap period between regrouped Moluccan fighting units and Permuda groups usually left the well-trained Moluccan fighters victorious. In their efforts to subdue the counter revolutionary RMS movement on Ambon, the newly established Tentara Nasional Indonesia (Republican Indonesian army, TNI) encountered the military prowess of the Moluccan special troops. The heavy fighting triggered them to create their own special troops. At that time the Moluccan special troops' only contemporaries were the Gurkha units of the British Indian Army.|$|R
