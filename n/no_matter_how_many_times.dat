5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; {{it is one of the}} axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

The song's narrator longs {{for a woman}} that views him as [...] "just a friend/That's all I've ever been/For you don't know me." [...] Allmusic editor Bill Janovitz writes of the song's affecting narrative, stating [...] "The genius, the pathos, and the soul that is Charles oozes into this recording [...] <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> one hears the song, it still induces chills down the spine after the narrator blows any chance {{he might have had}} and is left alone at the end." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{became a}} single, reviews {{for the song}} itself were mixed.

[...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added {{that it is a}} [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely to hear all year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E

[...] Putting a coin in – that is, giving the machine a coin input – shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. [...] In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs {{does not change the}} state.

2500|$|Kennedy {{claimed that}} in 1946, he {{provided}} information – including secret codewords and details of Klan rituals – to {{the writers of}} the Superman radio program, intending to strip away the Klan's mystique. There {{was a series of}} 16 episodes in which Superman took on the Klan. He claimed that the trivialization of the Klan's rituals and codewords likely had a negative impact on Klan recruiting and membership, leading Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt to dub Kennedy [...] "the greatest single contributor to the weakening of the Ku Klux Klan" [...] in their 2005 book Freakonomics. However, in 2006, Dubner and Levitt cast doubt on the statements of Kennedy, stating [...] "the story of Stetson Kennedy was one long series of anecdotes -- which, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> they were cited over the decades, were nearly all generated by the same self-interested source".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{admits that}} there is a {{distinct}} challenge for them, coming out of their past bands (Eraserheads and The Teeth). The challenge is particularly pronounced on frontman, Ely Buendia, since older fans tend to compare him and his new band with the huge popularity of The Eraserheads before. In an interview by Y. Losorata he says, [...] "I just want my fans and hopefully, my fans to be, to appreciate my music. I’m lucky to still have my career in music as a job and as part of Pupil wala akong (I don't have) delusions to become as big as my previous band was." [...] In fact, the band itself describes their music as actually [...] "one foot in the past, one foot in the present and both eyes dead set at the future." [...] According to Buendia, it's not being there but getting there that's exciting for him, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> he tries to get there. He later added in a different interview, [...] "Let’s just say that the Eraserheads is about escaping reality and Pupil is about accepting reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following on {{from the}} {{implementation}} of the London congestion charge in February 2003, City of Edinburgh Council announced plans to introduce a road tolls scheme to be put in place on main routes into the city. [...] A postal referendum of Edinburgh residents was held between 7–21 February 2005, with 74.4% of those voting no, announced on 22 February 2005. The system would have operated in a broadly similar fashion to the one in London, with two cordons - an inner cordon and an outer cordon operating from Monday to Friday. A flat charge of £2 would have applied to vehicles entering the city boundary - by passing the outer cordon, or those entering the city centre by passing the inner cordon. This charge would have applied <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> a vehicle crossed both cordons. Cameras with automatic number plate recognition technology would have been placed at the entry to both cordons, which would record the registration numbers of vehicles passing them. At the end of each day numbers would have been recorded against received payments. Paying would have been done electronically via the internet, text message or at specialised payment terminals in shops, where daily, weekly, monthly and yearly passes would have been available.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{weeks after}} WrestleMania, during a tag team match with Ken Shamrock against Mark Henry and Rocky Maivia (later known as The Rock), Hart turned on Shamrock, [...] "snapping" [...] his ankle and [...] "biting his ear" [...] in the process. After {{the attack on}} Shamrock, Hart became the co-leader, with The Rock, of the Nation of Domination, {{claiming}} that [...] "Enough is enough and it's time for a change". The Nation's first big feud after Hart joined was against DX. It was during this feud that D-Generation X parodied the Nation of Domination. The imitation was complete with an actor dressing up as Hart and uttering the phrase [...] "I am not a [...] "; this {{was in response to}} Shawn Michaels referring to Owen as a nugget of feces in a toilet bowl that, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> Michaels flushed, he was unable to get rid of. [...] "Nugget" [...] became a derisive term that followed Hart {{for the rest of his}} career. Hart's participation in the DX feud was sidetracked when Shamrock returned from injuries dead set on getting revenge on Hart. The two split a pair of specialty matches on pay-per-view, but nothing was ever conclusively settled between them.|$|E
2500|$|Blanc was {{a regular}} on the NBC Red Network show The Jack Benny Program in various roles, {{including}} voicing Benny's Maxwell automobile (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny's pet polar bear Carmichael, the tormented department store clerk, and the train announcer. The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile's sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc's most memorable characters from Benny's radio (and later TV) programs was [...] "Sy, the Little Mexican", who spoke one word at a time. The famous [...] "Sí ... Sy ... Sue ... sew" [...] routine was so effective that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> it was performed, the laughter was always there, thanks to the comedic timing of Blanc and Benny. Blanc continued {{to work with him}} on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny's 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s. They last appeared together on a Johnny Carson Tonight Show in January 1974. A few months later, Blanc spoke highly of Benny on a Tom Snyder Tomorrow show special aired the night of the comedian's death.|$|E
