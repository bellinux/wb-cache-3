The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the predictive value of the diameter of fetal NT in the detection of chromosomopathy. The investigation included 317 pregnant women with monofetal pregnancies, gestational age 11 - 14 weeks. The control group consisted of pregnant women in whom, after amniocentesis, a regular result of fetal karyotype was obtained. The limits of physiological and pathological findings of the NT value were not determined; instead, we used the diameters of NT that were obtained in pregnant women with pathological score of amniocentesis as potentially pathological values. Mean value of NT in the control group was 1. 92 ± 0. 39 mm, and in the group with pathological findings of fetal karyotype it was 2. 49 ± 0. 37 mm, which is a statistically significant difference (p 0. 05). The probability that a patient with negative NT findings be healthy is 0. 97. NT sensitivity as a marker for chromosomopathy was 0. 97. The rate of false positive findings was 0. 027. Specificity of NT as a marker for chromosomopathy was 0. 97. The probability that a patient with positive findings <b>NT</b> <b>really</b> be ill was 0. 66. Valid findings of NT can be considered safe ultrasonographic markers in the assessment of absence of chromosomopathy. Pathological finding, given the low positive predictive value of NT, must be amended by other prenatal tests before a pregnant woman is advised on prenatal invasive diagnostics...|$|E
5000|$|As the log {{approaches}} {{its maximum}} size, it can either overwrite old events or stop logging new events. This makes it susceptible to attacks {{in which an}} intruder can flood the log by generating {{a large number of}} new events. A partial defense against this is to increase the maximum log size so that a greater number of events will be required to flood the log. It is possible to set the log to not overwrite old events, but as Chris Benton notes, [...] "the only problem is that <b>NT</b> has a <b>really</b> bad habit of crashing when its logs become full".|$|R
