40|$|BOG (Boil off Gas) {{compressor}} {{deals with}} the gas evaporated from the LNG storage tank. Its working temperature is lower than - 120 â„ƒ. There {{are two types of}} starting process for BOG compressor: Direct Starting and <b>No-load</b> <b>Starting.</b> During the starting process, the temperature on cylinder will change rapidly and result in additional thermal stress to some parts on the cylinder, especially to the bolted joints on the cylinder head. In this paper, transient Finite Element thermal analysis is proposed on the cylinder with some improvement of the boundary condition settings, such as the consideration of the ice increase on the cylinder wall. Then, the theoretical and transient FE analysis are proposed subject to the bolted joints of the cylinder head in two starting process. Result shows that the maximum temperature difference on the cylinder is 81. 5 â„ƒ during direct starting; while it could decrease to 60. 9 â„ƒin <b>No-Load</b> <b>Starting.</b> Along the bolted joints in the cylinder head, the maximum temperature difference will be up to 52 â„ƒ in direct starting and 45 â„ƒ in <b>No-Load</b> <b>Starting.</b> The preload increases rapidly over 60 % and its mean tensile stress on the bolt is near to the yield strength. Besides, the preload are distributed unevenly during the starting process. The maximum uneven rate is 20 % in Direct Starting and 15 % in <b>No-Load</b> <b>Starting.</b> It shows that <b>No-Load</b> <b>Starting</b> could offer a more stable starting process. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis, a preload adjustment method is proposed to ensure the safety and validity of bolted joints on BOG compressor...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} there is studied the dynamic regime {{behaviour}} of a reluctance synchronous motor fitted {{out with a}} starting cage. There are analyzed two concrete situations: cage made of aluminium and cage made of copper. There are presented the mathematical model of the motor, the simulation program and the simulations carried out for the two situations. For the case of cage made of aluminium there have been performed experimental tests for direct-on-line <b>no-load</b> <b>starting,</b> tests that confirm the simulations carried out. The paper ends with conclusions regarding {{the influence of the}} cage material upon the time- dependent variation of the main electrical and mechanical quantities of the motor...|$|E
