40|$|International audienceIn complex {{industrial}} plants, {{there are}} usually many sensors and the modeling of plants leads to lots of mathematical relations. Before using classical tools for fault detection, the first problem to solve is: what sensors and mathematical relations should be selected {{for the design of}} a detection test such as a state observer or a parity space based detection algorithms. This paper presents a general method for finding all the possible testable subsystems i. e. sets of relations, than can lead to detection tests, taking into account actuator and sensor locations. This method, which is based on a structural analysis, provides the constraints that have to be used for the design of each detection test and manages situations where constraints contain <b>non</b> <b>deductible</b> variables. Thanks to these results, it becomes possible to select the most interesting testable subsystems regarding detectability and diagnosability criteria...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of deductibility of local taxes on communities' {{budgetary}} decisions. Our focus is on how changes in the tax price of local spending induced by deductibility affect the mix between deductible and nondeductible revenue sources, and on expenditures. The econometric analysis {{is based on a}} rich data set that tracks the fiscal behavior of 172 local governments from 1978 to 1980. We find that the elasticity of <b>deductible</b> <b>taxes</b> with respect to the tax price is in the range - 1. 2 to - 1. 6; the tax price has no statistically significant effect on the use of nondeductible revenue sources; and the elasticity of local expenditures with respect to the tax price is about - 1. 8. Hence, if deductibility were eliminated, we would expect to see a substantial decline in local government spending. ...|$|R
