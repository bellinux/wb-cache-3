The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving <b>nobody</b> <b>to</b> throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus there was <b>nobody</b> <b>to</b> stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E

5|$|In Roman {{constitutional}} law, the assemblies are {{a sovereign}} authority, {{with the power}} to enact or reject any law, confer any magistracies, and make any decision. In fact, with a single law, they held the authority to override the norms and precedents of the Republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged. There are two necessary components to any assembly: (1) the convening magistrate and (2) the citizens in the assembly itself. Assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them, they heard the speakers put forth by the presiding officer. And after such discussion, the presiding officer could call for a direct up or down vote. Without a magistrate, there would be <b>nobody</b> <b>to</b> legally call upon the assembly; and without the citizens, there is naught but a magistrate.|$|E

The album was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews, with Allmusic summarising the album as [...] "The Twilight Sad transform everything that came before into some of their most compelling music.

25|$|A {{purpose trust}} in English {{law is a}} trust created for the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts because they have no legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore <b>nobody</b> <b>to</b> enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts. If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being for a purpose, it involves beneficiaries in some respect. Purpose trusts can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the rule against perpetuities and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{acquiring}} the Auburn property, Tubman {{went back to}} Maryland and returned with her [...] "niece," [...] an eight-year-old light-skinned black girl named Margaret. The circumstances of this expedition remain clouded in mystery. There is great confusion about the identity of Margaret's parents, although Tubman indicated they were free blacks. The girl had left behind a twin brother and a loving home in Maryland. Years later, Margaret's daughter Alice called Tubman's actions selfish, saying, [...] "she had taken the child from a sheltered good home {{to a place where}} there was <b>nobody</b> <b>to</b> care for her." [...] Indeed, Alice described it as a [...] "kidnapping".|$|E

We had practised emergency stops and it worked". The manner of any potential restart was modified to allow the race re-commence as soon as practicable.

It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired.

500|$|Several major {{hospitals}} and teaching centres {{were established in}} Britain during the 18th century, but with only a very few corpses legally available for dissection, these institutions suffered from severe shortages. [...] Some local authorities had already attempted to alleviate the problem, with limited success; in 1694, Edinburgh allowed anatomists to dissect corpses [...] "found dead in the streets, and the bodies of such as die violent deaths... who shall have <b>nobody</b> <b>to</b> own them". [...] Suicide victims were given over, as were infants who had died while being born and also the unclaimed bodies of abandoned children. [...] But {{even though they were}} supported by the common law, anatomists occasionally found it difficult to collect what was granted to them. Fuelled by resentment of how readily the death penalty was used, and imbued with superstitious beliefs, crowds sometimes sought to keep the bodies of executed felons away from the authorities. [...] Riots at execution sites were commonplace; worried about possible disorder, in 1749 the Sheriff of London ignored the surgeons and gave the dead to their relatives.|$|E

On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand mufti, stated: [...] "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This {{is not one of}} them." [...] Khalid Latif, an imam who serves as a chaplain {{and the director of the}} Islamic Center of New York University, argued that the sea burial was respectful.|$|E
