5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Vmax is {{only one}} of several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat, also called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.|$|E
5|$|Stirred {{into action}} by the 1930 Ohio penitentiary fire, which {{resulted}} in 300 deaths when guards refused to let inmates out of their cells, Hollywood produced movies which depicted the harsh conditions in prisons at the time. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. The picture features future genre staples such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, an escape, and the codes of prison life. Never box office hits, prison pictures failed to attract the female audiences they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> financial success. The chain gang films were produced in a similar response to the callous inhumanity of the chain gang system which was prevalent among states in the southern US. The 1932 film I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal movie of the genre, and {{was based on the}} autobiography of Robert E. Burns who was himself a fugitive {{at the time of the}} picture's release.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{offensive}} plans {{specified that}} the three units would make a series of coordinated, but separate, attacks on the American perimeter. The Iwasa Unit would begin the offensive by advancing southeast and capturing Hill 700 on 8March. It would then rest for two days before advancing against the Piva airfields. The Muda Unit was to launch its attack on 10March by advancing west and capturing Hills 260 and 309. On 12March it and a battalion from the Iwasa Unit would capture Hill 608. The Magata Unit would begin its attack on 11March and move south through low-lying terrain to assault the 129thInfantry Regiment. After defeating this unit, the Magata Unit would join the Iwasa Unit's advance on the airfields. Once these airfields were secured, the three units would advance to Cape Torokina, and capture it by 17March. Due to their inadequate supply of rations, the Japanese <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a rapid victory.|$|E

5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E

5|$|Then, as they {{approached}} their target, the MiG-21 pilots would make a supersonic diving pass against trailing or isolated flights, so they could position themselves for a missile kill. The action of 23 August demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Air Force had successfully executed their new procedure, which was helped by more skilful ground controllers who directed the MiG fighter towards their targets. Indeed, the new procedure gave North Vietnamese MiG pilots the ingredient they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a kill over their U.S. opponents; between August 1967 and February 1968, the North Vietnamese Air Force achieved a kill ratio of 1.1:1 against the USAF, {{with the loss of}} 20 aircraft for 22 victories. In the same period of time, Operation Rolling Thunder had cost the United States approximately $900million ($5,640million at 2010 prices) with the loss of more than 700 aircraft. The bombing campaign continued until 31 October 1968, when it was abandoned by the U.S. Government.|$|E
