The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues 3s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided {{to develop a new}} setting and <b>new</b> <b>story</b> for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a <b>new</b> <b>story,</b> {{with a new}} setting and new characters.

The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half an hour {{in the lives of the}} characters.|$|E
5|$|Kenshin's {{character}} was well-received by fans, with his holding {{the top spot}} in all reader popularity polls for the series. Critics of the series praised his strong personality and backstory which most critics found appealing. However, though some complained about his development during the OVA series; while {{his role in the}} prequel OVAs were praised, his role in the ones that created a <b>new</b> <b>story</b> arc resulted in criticism by various critics including Watsuki himself. Satoh's acting in the live-action film received positive comments due to how he fits the character as well as his fight choreography. A variety of collectibles based on Kenshin have been created, including figurines, key chains, plushies, and replicas of his sakabatō sword.|$|E

5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring {{him to continue}} writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a <b>new</b> <b>story</b> for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, {{was inspired by a}} friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well enough and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring it closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics was vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and <b>new</b> <b>story</b> details including an entire subplot cut from the original game.|$|E
5|$|You Only Live Twice is a 1967 British spy {{film and}} the fifth in the James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The film's screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, and loosely based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name. It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely <b>new</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one <b>new</b> <b>story</b> every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a <b>new</b> <b>story</b> and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience as a designer was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the <b>new</b> <b>story.</b> Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{he took up}} a {{position}} with , Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted Le Soir to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the Le Soir team on 15 October, Hergé {{was involved in the}} creation of a children's supplement, Soir-Jeunesse, aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched The Adventures of Tintin with a <b>new</b> <b>story,</b> The Crab with the Golden Claws, in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the Adventures. This story, like the subsequent Adventures of Tintin published in Le Soir, would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining firmly neutral. Hergé also included new Quick & Flupke gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.|$|E
5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial deception was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover deception for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF deception planners were worried about the impact of a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a <b>new</b> <b>story</b> would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E
