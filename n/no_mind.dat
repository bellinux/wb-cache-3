5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying <b>no</b> <b>mind</b> to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Flow studied by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has been {{compared}} to Buddhist meditative states such as samadhi and mindfulness. Ronald Siegel describes flow as “mindfulness while accomplishing something.” Nobo Komagata and Sachiko Komagata, however, are critical of characterizing the notion of “flow” as a special case of mindfulness, noting that the connection is more complicated. Zen Buddhism has a concept called Mushin (無心, <b>no</b> <b>mind)</b> which is also similar to flow.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Taylor's {{performance}} as Maggie was praised by critics. She {{was named the}} 13th greatest guest spot {{in the history of}} the show by IGN. Taylor also appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars. Todd Everett at Variety called the last scene in the episode, where Maggie speaks her first word, [...] "quite a heart-melter". He added that [...] "it is probably no surprise that the casting of Elizabeth Taylor as the voice for baby Maggie Simpson's first word was a publicity stunt [...] <b>No</b> <b>mind,</b> the episode in question delivered well-rounded view of series' multiple attractions." [...] Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked her {{performance as}} the best guest appearance in the show's history.

500|$|In his {{influential}} book From Caligari to Hitler, Kracauer argues the Dr. Caligari {{character is}} symptomatic of a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, which he calls the German [...] "collective soul". Kracauer argues Dr. Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of Adolf Hitler and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the mentality that allowed the Nazi Party to rise. He calls Dr. Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's [...] "manipulation of the soul". Kracauer described the film {{as an example of}} Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority, and reflects a [...] "general retreat" [...] into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany. Cesare symbolizes those who have <b>no</b> <b>mind</b> of their own and must follow the paths of others; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which [...] "self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder". Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority [...] "just because it has not made a preachy statement against it", and said the connection between Dr. Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part.|$|E

On October 19 2014, the track list of Reclassified was released, which also included [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] as 9th track. On 23 October 2014, the track was available for streaming. A day later, the track was made available as an instant digital download track upon pre-ordering Reclassified via iTunes Stores. [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was written by Iggy Azalea, The Invisible Men, Jon Mills, Darryl Reid and Jon Turner. It was produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade. Lasting for a duration of 3:20 (three minutes and twenty seconds), [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] is built on [...] "club-ready" [...] electro handclap-based beats and heavy synthesisers. Lyrically, Azalea talks about her success and goes after her [...] "haters" [...] on the song. At one point, she raps: [...] "Haters gon' hate while critics critique, I pay them <b>no</b> <b>mind</b> whenever they speak / what they make a year I make in a week, I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat!" [...] On the hook, she raps: [...] "Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy SZN / Until l get what I want, I ain't leaving… Simmer down bitch / It's Iggy SZN." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{delusion}} can {{be defined}} as [...] "a false, unshakeable idea or belief which is out of keeping with the patient's educational, cultural and social background ... held with extraordinary conviction and subjective certainty", and is a core feature of psychotic disorders. The patient's delusions may be described as persecutory or paranoid delusions, delusions of reference, grandiose delusions, [...] erotomanic delusions, delusional jealousy or delusional misidentification. Delusions may be described as mood- (the delusional content in keeping with the mood), typical of manic or depressive psychoses, or mood-incongruent (delusional content not in keeping with the mood) which are more typical of schizophrenia. Delusions of control, or passivity experiences (in which the individual has the experience of the mind or body being under the influence or control of some kind of external force or agency), are typical of schizophrenia. Examples of this include experiences of thought withdrawal, thought insertion, thought broadcasting, and somatic passivity. [...] Schneiderian first rank symptoms are a set of delusions and hallucinations which have been said to be highly suggestive of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Delusions of guilt, delusions of poverty, and nihilistic delusions (belief that one has <b>no</b> <b>mind</b> or is already dead) are typical of depressive psychoses.|$|E

It overflew known North Vietnamese antiaircraft positions without drawing fire. The copter halved its height when it came out over level land.

Bahá'u'lláh stated that the soul not only {{continues}} to live after the physical death of the human body, but is, in fact, immortal. Heaven can be seen partly as the soul's state of nearness to God; and hell as a state of remoteness from God. Each state follows as a natural consequence of individual efforts, or the lack thereof, to develop spiritually. Bahá'u'lláh taught that individuals have no existence prior to their life here on earth and the soul's evolution is always towards God and away from the material world.|$|E

Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it <b>no</b> <b>mind</b> 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them.
