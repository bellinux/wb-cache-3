5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it <b>never</b> <b>took</b> {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E

5|$|Antestor (then called Crush Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and was not yet musically {{considered}} black metal.

5|$|Let {{go by the}} Cubs {{after the}} 1912 season, Chance signed with the Yankees, serving as a player–manager for two seasons. He joined the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League as a player–manager, {{returning}} to MLB in 1923 as manager of the Red Sox.

5|$|The {{diminutive}} Hassett was {{an elegant}} middle-order batsman, {{known for his}} wide range of strokes, timing, quick footwork and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes {{found it hard to}} discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and <b>never</b> <b>took</b> more than two in a single innings. He <b>never</b> <b>took</b> a wicket at Test level and bowled less than 19 overs.|$|E
5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou <b>never</b> <b>took</b> place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E

5|$|Willis {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut against the West Indies at Headingley, during the 1973 Prudential Trophy. He <b>never</b> <b>took</b> a five-wicket haul in ODIs; his career-best figures for an innings were 4 wickets for 11 runs against Canada during the 1979 Cricket World Cup, a match England won by 8 wickets at Old Trafford. , Willis is thirty-fourth overall among all-time {{combined}} five-wicket haul takers.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, Duke of York, now {{second in}} line to the throne, evidently became close to May during their shared period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a {{suitable}} candidate to marry a future king.

George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his father, <b>never</b> <b>took</b> a mistress.|$|E

5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this <b>never</b> <b>took</b> place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{performances}} in South Africa, Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007. He played in all 12 matches, seven against Australia and five against Pakistan. Pathan scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02, averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics. It was a steady performance; Pathan <b>never</b> <b>took</b> more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan.|$|E

They then defeated Mexico 2–0, with Banks again rarely troubled throughout. A 2–0 win over France then took England through the group stage without Banks conceding a goal.|$|E
