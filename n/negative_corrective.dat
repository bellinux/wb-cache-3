2500|$|Control action - The {{mathematical}} model and practical loop above both use a [...] "direct" [...] control action {{for all the}} terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply <b>negative</b> <b>corrective</b> action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% control output - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail safe mode, {{in the case of}} loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} 243 {{employees}} {{of two different}} hospitality organizations compared the effects of managers’ giving feedback with no comments at all (favorable or unfavorable). The study found that feedback, formally known as contingent reinforcement, improves performance even when that feedback involves <b>negative</b> or <b>corrective</b> comments. Echoing previous studies, this research found {{a positive relationship between}} contingent rewards and workers’ effectiveness and satisfaction. Moreover, contingent punishment also had a small positive relationship with effectiveness and satisfaction. Going beyond previous work, however, this study found that managers’ omission of any commentary on good performance has a direct, albeit moderate, negative relationship with workers’ effectiveness and a small, direct negative relationship on satisfaction. These findings point {{in the direction of the}} long-established psychological theory of operant conditioning, which suggests that a behavior that is totally ignored will eventually be extinguished. In this case, the behavior that will be lost is good service...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{negative}} input for 13 categories of grammatical error were assessed in {{a longitudinal study}} of naturalistic adult–child discourse. Two-hour samples of conversational interaction were obtained at two points in time, separated by a lag of 12 weeks, for 12 children (mean age 2; 0 at the start). The data were interpreted within the framework offered by Saxton’s (1997, 2000) contrast theory of <b>negative</b> input. <b>Corrective</b> input was associated with subsequent improvements in the grammaticality of child speech for three of the target structures. No effects were found for two forms of positive input: non-contingent models, where the adult produces target structures in non-error-contingent contexts; and contingent models, where grammatical forms follow grammatical child usages. The findings {{lend support to the}} view that, in some cases at least, the structure of adult–child discourse yields information on the bounds of grammaticality for the language-learning child.

40|$|Persistent neural {{activity}} {{in the absence of}} a stimulus has been identified as a neural correlate of working memory, but how such activity is maintained by neocortical circuits remains unknown. Here we show that the inhibitory and excitatory microcircuitry of neocortical memory-storing regions is sufficient to implement a corrective feedback mechanism that enables persistent activity to be maintained stably for prolonged durations. When recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs to memory neurons are balanced in strength, but offset in time, drifts in activity trigger a corrective signal that counteracts memory decay. Circuits containing this mechanism temporally integrate their inputs, generate the irregular neural firing observed during persistent activity, and are robust against common perturbations that severely disrupt previous models of short-term memory storage. This work reveals a mechanism for the accumulation and storage of memories in neocortical circuits based upon principles of <b>corrective</b> <b>negative</b> feedback widely used in engineering applications. Working memory on a time scale of seconds is used to hold information in mind during cognitive tasks such as reasoning, learning, and comprehension 1. Over forty years ago 2,...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{outcomes}} of a three year workshop series with senior leadership and management development managers {{from a range of}} public and private sector organisations. The aim of this enquiry was to explore the interface between performance management and leadership development systems {{and the extent to which}} they can complement one another to offer a coherent progression and performance framework. A number of competing and inter-related dynamics were uncovered that influence the extent to which performance management systems facilitate appropriate and desirable forms of behaviour in organisations and the extent to which these are supported and reinforced through leadership development. The most significant of these influences was seen to be one of identity and the impact that these systems can have on a sense of shared ‘social identity’ and purpose. By way of conclusion we argue that the narrative function of corporate leadership systems in expressing ‘who we are’ and ‘what we value’ is equally, if not more, important in determining their impact (positive or <b>negative)</b> than their <b>corrective</b> or developmental capacity per se...|$|R
40|$|Subjects of {{the study}} werefive {{elementary}} string class students who performed consis-tently with incorrect left-hand positions. Three teaching procedures were used {{in an attempt to}} modify the incorrect hand positions: <b>corrective</b> (<b>negative)</b> verbalfeedback and physical prompts in a schedule of twice per minute for two minute training ses-sions, positive feedback on the same schedule, and increasing the training session from two to ten minutes and the praise schedule from two to four times per minute. Data were collected for two minutes during each training session in all conditions and, to assess generalization effects, during a later period of class each day when the left-hand position was not taught. Results indicated improvement for some subjects during the first and second interventions, although the improvements were not substantial nor enduring. The third intervention resulted in greater response improvement for all subjects and more generalization. Although students varied in response to different teaching styles, praise was always as effective as corrective feedback in changing the left-hand position and more durable in its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{failure modes}} {{characterization}} and early detection {{is a key}} issue in complex assets. This {{is due to the}} <b>negative</b> impact of <b>corrective</b> operations and the conservative strategies usually put in practice, focused on preventive maintenance. In this paper anomaly detection issue is addressed in new monitoring sensor data by characterizing and modeling operational behaviors. The learning framework is performed {{on the basis of a}} machine learning approach that combines constrained K-means clustering for outlier detection and fuzzy modeling of distances to normality. A final score is also calculated over time, considering the membership degree to resulting fuzzy sets and a local outlier factor. Proposed solution is deployed in a CBM+ platform for online monitoring of the assets. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real operational faults in an auxiliary marine diesel engine. Experimental results show a fully comprehensive yet accurate prognostics approach, improving detection capabilities and knowledge management. The performance achieved is quite high (precision, sensitivity and specificity above 93 % and ?= 0. 93 ?= 0. 93), even more so given that a very small percentage of real faults are present in data...|$|R
40|$|Rationale : Endovascular {{implantation}} {{may lead}} to mechanical injury {{of the vessel}} walls, their inflammation and subsequent formation of a thrombus in the stented portion of the vessel, as well as to endothelial growth and restenosis. Intimal injury changes {{the potential of the}} damaged area from negative to positive. Aim : To demonstrate the efficacy of <b>corrective</b> <b>negative</b> charge on the stent surface after its endovascular implantation in the reduction of the risk of vessel thrombosis and restenosis. Materials and methods : With a terminal element technique we created a model for distribution of electrostatic potentials in a healthy and in a partially injured vessel, as well as in a vessel with a negatively charged electret stent. Trials of experimental and serial stents in animals were performed with stent placement into the pig neck arteries with subsequent (at day 21) histological examination of the areas of stent placement.  Morphological abnormalities and vessel wall reactions after endovascular carotid stent implantation, such as clot formation and endothelial reaction were assessed. Results : Negatively charged electret cover of the stent produces corrective electrostatic field to prevent thrombus formation and vascular intima reaction with subsequent restenosis. The use of the stent with negatively charged electret cover ensures a significant reduction of the risk for positive potential inside the injured vessel, thereby dramatically reducing the risk of vessel thrombosis and restenosis. After placement of stents with negatively charged electret cover to animals, there was very mild proliferation of endothelial cells of the vessel wall neointima, compared to that after placement of the reference stents; no thrombus formation was observed. If the reference uncovered stents were placed, there was a dramatic narrowing of the arterial lumen due to proliferation of endothelial neointimal cells, as well as full thrombotic closure of the vessel. Conclusion : The suggested technology allows for improvement of endovascular stent placement, for reduction of the risk of thrombosis and restenosis after endovascular interventions aimed at revascularization of arterial stenosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Across many domains, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) {{are used}} to {{facilitate}} practice, providing a customized learning environment and personal tutoring experience for students to learn {{at their own pace}} through effective student modeling and feedback. Most current ITSs are built around cognitive learning theories including Ohlsson's theory on learning from performance errors and Anderson's ACT theories of skill acquisition which focus primarily on providing <b>negative</b> feedback or <b>corrective</b> feedback, facilitating learning by correcting errors. Research into the behavior and methods used by expert tutors suggest that experienced tutors use positive feedback quite extensively and successfully. This research investigates positive feedback; learning by capturing and responding to correct behavior, supported by cognitive learning theories. The research aim is to develop and implement a systematic approach to delivering positive feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, in particular SQL-Tutor, a constraint-based tutor which instructs users in the design of Structured Query Language (SQL) database queries. An evaluation study was conducted at the University of Canterbury involving a control group of students who used the original version of SQL-Tutor giving only negative feedback and an experimental group using the modified version of SQL-Tutor where both negative and positive feedback were given. Results of the study show that students learn quite similarly from one system to another, however those in the experimental group take significantly less time to solve the same number of problems, in fewer attempts compared to those in the control group. Students in the experimental group also learn approximately the same number of concepts as students in the control but in much less time. This indicates that positive feedback results in increased amount of learning over a shorter period of time and improves the effectiveness of learning in ITSs...|$|R
40|$|Both {{in second}} and foreign {{language}} (L 2) teaching environments and in digital games, feedback is considered indispensable {{as well as}} a powerful device to support learning. However, the state of affairs in the fields of second language acquisition and educational psychology shows that the effects of <b>corrective</b> (<b>negative)</b> feedback (CF) are not univocal, and suggests that the effectiveness of CF in digital game-based language learning is likely to depend on the following factors: the type of CF (explicit or implicit), how learning is measured (as the development of explicit or implicit L 2 knowledge), and individual differences related to learners receptivity to CF, namely perceived usefulness of CF and intrinsic motivation. The current PhD project investigates the complex interplay between these factors both from a theoretical point of view and empirically, and in a highly interdisciplinary way, combining insights from the literatures of second language acquisition, computer-assisted language learning (CALL; by itself a highly interdisciplinary undertaking), educational psychology and technology, motivational psychology, and game studies. Subsequent to the general introduction (chapter 1) and the theoretical study (chapter 2), this dissertation presents the results of four empirical studies with prototypes of digital game-based experiences engineered for the instruction and practice of English as a L 2. These were evaluated mainly in the context of secondary education. The first empirical study (chapter 3) explores the role of individual differences vis-à-vis CF types in a 3 D immersive game designed for the instruction of English pragmatics. It shows that learners (N= 83) found explicit CF more useful than more implicit CF, and that the perceived usefulness of explicit CF correlated positively with parameters of motivation. The second empirical study (chapter 4) investigates learners (N= 36) use of explicit metalinguistic CF in a written interactive murder mystery, and cannot present any evidence that perceived usefulness predicted CF use; there was a strong positive association, however, between CF use and prior metalinguistic knowledge. The third and fourth empirical studies focus on the effectiveness of grammar practice with CF in mini-games. The third study (chapter 5) found that vivid CF, adapted to the fantasy of the game concept, affected learners (N= 32) intrinsic motivation positively, which was related to their willingness to practise more. The fourth empirical chapter (chapter 6) reports on the effects of grammar practice on L 2 learning in a two-month study, comprising one month of practice. The results indicate that intensive practice supported by mini-games and CF helped learners (N= 125; control group N= 61) to develop L 2 grammar knowledge that was useful for their performance on various transfer tasks (both near and far transfer). Moreover, the effects of explicit metalinguistic CF were, by and large, stronger than the effects of CF which did not include any metalinguisticexplanation; this finding did not apply to learners performance on a complex spoken language task. The final chapter of this dissertation (chapter 7) discusses the main findings, and presents directions for future research. The results of this project bode well for the design of powerful technology-mediated language learning spaces which seek to engage learners by drawing on their gaming experience or interest, and which are aimed at supporting learners in mastering the conventions of formal language use. status: publishe...|$|R
