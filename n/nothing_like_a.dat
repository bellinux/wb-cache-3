Comparing Canada to the U.S., he said that unlike the U.S., Canada has a progressive income tax system that favors the vulnerable, and the government has regulated and supervised its financial institutions.|$|E

500|$|A made-for-television film, {{directed}} by Richard Pearce, was produced and televised in 2001, starring Glenn Close as Nellie, Harry Connick, Jr. as Cable and Rade Sherbedgia as Emile. This version changed {{the order of}} the musical's songs (the film opens with [...] "There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dame") and omits [...] "Happy Talk". [...] "My Girl Back Home" [...] was filmed but not included in the broadcast due to time constraints; it was restored for the DVD, issued in 2001. [...] The last half-hour of the film features scenes of war, including shots of segregated troops. Lovensheimer states that the film returned to the Michener original in one particular: [...] "Harry Connick Jr.'s Joe Cable is a fascinating combination of sensitive leading man and believable Leatherneck".|$|E

500|$|Additional {{elements}} of South Pacific had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. [...] One introduces {{the character of}} Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to Allied forces by radio. [...] Michener based the spy, dubbed [...] "the Remittance Man", on Captain Martin Clemens, a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war. [...] The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and {{the efforts of the}} Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song [...] "There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dame". Several of the stories involve the Seabee, Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the restless}} American Seabees, led by crafty Luther Billis, lament {{the absence of}} {{available}} women– Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed [...] "Bloody Mary", a sassy middle-aged Tonkinese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter {{as she tries to}} sell them her wares ("Bloody Mary"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i – which is off-limits to all but officers – supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship ("There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dame").|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production enjoyed immense {{critical and}} box-office success, became the second-longest running Broadway musical {{to that point}} (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier Oklahoma! (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind. [...] The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950. [...] Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including [...] "Bali Ha'i", [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair", [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dame", [...] "Happy Talk", [...] "Younger Than Springtime", and [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy", have become popular standards.|$|E

500|$|A bid of £1m {{offered by}} Damien Hirst {{for the entire}} {{collection}} had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying [...] "You can see he {{knew very little about}} anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> kingfisher" [...] He also showed appreciation for the displays: [...] "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket." [...] About the auction, Hirst said, [...] "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|South Pacific {{was made}} into a film of the same name in 1958, and it topped the box office that year. Joshua Logan {{directed}} the film, which starred Rossano Brazzi, Mitzi Gaynor, John Kerr, Ray Walston and Juanita Hall; all of their singing voices except Gaynor's and Walston's were dubbed. Thurl Ravenscroft, later television's Tony the Tiger, sang the basso profundo notes in [...] "There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dame". The film opened with Cable's flight to the island in a PBY, followed by the Seabees' beach scene, and added Billis' rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese. [...] The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound. It was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65mm Todd-AO cinematography by Leon Shamroy was also nominated. The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing. The film includes the song [...] "My Girl Back Home", sung by Cable, which was cut from the stage musical. [...] The movie was the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. of the 1950s; its UK revenues were the highest ever, a record it kept until Goldfinger in 1963. Although reviewers have criticized the film– Time magazine stated that it was [...] "almost impossible to make a bad movie out of it– but the moviemakers appear to have tried"– it has added success on television, videotape and DVD to its box office laurels.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began at}} Broadway's Belasco Theatre on February 2, 1949. [...] There was no formal chorus; {{each of the}} nurses and Seabees was given a name, and, {{in the case of}} the men, $50 to equip {{themselves}} with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. [...] Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. [...] Of the mood backstage, [...] "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." [...] He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in Allegro), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. [...] He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during [...] "There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. [...] This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.|$|E

However, Dreyfus argued that philosophy, especially 20th-century philosophy, had discovered serious problems with this information processing viewpoint.

A hitherto unheard-of uncle needs help in his restaurant, so the whole family ups sticks. Including Teresa - who'd always fought for independence from her family? Rosa, who presumably owned the house she'd transformed into something resembling an Imperial Palace, is suddenly prepared to leg it with a couple of suitcases? There was plenty that didn't ring true. But few viewers minded. There was, if anything, more sympathy for the programme-makers, trying valiantly to dispose of this singularly unpopular family while retaining an element of drama." ...|$|E
