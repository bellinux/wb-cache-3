5|$|Bristol awards a {{range of}} {{academic}} degrees spanning bachelor's and master's degrees as well as junior doctorates and higher doctorates. The postnominals awarded are the degree abbreviations used commonly among British universities. The university {{is part of the}} Engineering Doctorate scheme, and awards the Eng. D. in systems engineering, engineering management, aerospace engineering and <b>non-destructive</b> evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{was tested}} in the Instituto de Física of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City using a 3 megaelectronvolt pelletron {{particle}} accelerator. Testing methods applied to the codex included ultraviolet imaging, infrared reflectography, optical microscopy, particle-induced X-ray emission and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The specific aim of this <b>non-destructive</b> testing was to compare the materials used in the codex with those used in other pre-Columbian codices.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} iridium-192 {{is one of}} the {{two most}} important sources of energy for use in industrial γ-radiography for <b>non-destructive</b> testing of metals. Additionally, 192Ir is used as a source of gamma radiation for the treatment of cancer using brachytherapy, a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Specific treatments include high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, bilary duct brachytherapy, and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy.|$|E
5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is <b>non-destructive,</b> and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a <b>non-destructive</b> tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{is poorly}} preserved; the {{surviving}} page fragments display {{a number of}} figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico city and is not on public display. The physics institute of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México subjected the codex to <b>non-destructive</b> testing {{in an effort to}} determine its authenticity. The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced wear and tear, are suspect. The researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.|$|E
5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of <b>non-destructive</b> techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-cost}} net shape forging for demanding applications that {{are subject to}} {{a high degree of}} scrutiny, i.e. <b>non-destructive</b> testing by way of a dye-penetrant inspection technique, it is crucial that basic forging process disciplines be implemented. If the basic disciplines are not met, subsequent material removal operations will likely be necessary to remove material defects found at <b>non-destructive</b> testing inspection. Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} {{difference between}} tableau with unification {{and the other}} two calculi is that the latter two calculi only modify a tableau by adding new nodes to it, while the former one allows substitutions to modify the existing part of the tableau. More generally, tableau calculi are classed as destructive or <b>non-destructive</b> depending on whether they only add new nodes to tableau or not. Tableau with unification is therefore destructive, while propositional tableau and tableau without unification are <b>non-destructive.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>non-destructive</b> {{inspection}} {{process for}} the module was developed. As a result, Boeing issued Alert Service Bulletin 747-27A2397. The bulletin, dated July 24, 2003, recommended that Boeing 747 operators conduct ultrasonic inspections of pertinent high-time lower and upper rudder power control modules.|$|E
25|$|Atomic mirrors are devices which reflect matter waves. Usually, atomic mirrors work at grazing incidence. Such mirrors can be {{used for}} atomic {{interferometry}} and atomic holography. It has been proposed that they {{can be used}} for <b>non-destructive</b> imaging systems with nanometer resolution.|$|E
25|$|Gingivitis is a <b>non-destructive</b> {{disease that}} occurs around the teeth. The {{most common form}} of gingivitis, and the {{most common form of}} {{periodontal}} disease overall, is in response to bacterial biofilms (also called plaque) that is attached to tooth surfaces, termed plaque-induced gingivitis.|$|E
25|$|Feathers {{are also}} {{valuable}} in aiding {{the identification of}} species in forensic studies, particularly in bird strikes to aircraft. The ratios of hydrogen isotopes in feathers help in determining the geographic origins of birds. Feathers may also be useful in the <b>non-destructive</b> sampling of pollutants.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a gemologist, the most important of differential properties are those that foster <b>non-destructive</b> testing; most of these are visual in nature. <b>Non-destructive</b> testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E
25|$|A Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM) is {{a device}} which uses focused sound to investigate, measure, or image an object. It is {{commonly}} used in failure analysis and <b>non-destructive</b> evaluation. The first scanning acoustic microscope was co-invented in 1974 by C. F. Lemons and R. A. Quate at the Microwave Laboratory of Stanford University.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{the life}} {{sciences}} is used generally as a <b>non-destructive</b> way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules {{by means of the}} fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or autofluorescence).|$|E
25|$|Recreational vehicle use also bears monitoring, as {{all-terrain}} vehicles (ATV's) and larger vehicles can damage streambeds and tear up fragile vegetation. Public vehicles are prohibited {{south and west}} of the existing trail system and from the river bottom and badlands areas, and from the ecological reserve altogether, except for management purposes and fire protection, or education and <b>non-destructive</b> research.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} basis of the flirt pole is {{engaging}} the dog's prey drive, these exercises do not necessarily increase the drive. In fact, many trainers like to use the flirt pole to give dogs an opportunity to express prey drive in a <b>non-destructive</b> way, and use the flirt pole {{as a part of the}} training and socialization.|$|E
25|$|Polarisation in T-cell help {{is useful}} in {{influencing}} allergic responses and autoimmune diseases. In autoimmune diseases, {{the goal is to}} shift the self-destructive TH1 response (with its associated cytotoxic T cell activity) to a <b>non-destructive</b> TH2 response. This has been successfully applied in predisease priming for the desired type of response in preclinical models and is somewhat successful in shifting the response for an established disease.|$|E
25|$|Both helper and {{cytotoxic}} T-cells {{can control}} viral infections by secreting interferons. Cytotoxic T cells usually kill virally infected cells. However, {{they can also}} be stimulated to secrete antiviral cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, which do not kill the cell, but limit viral infection by down-regulating the expression of viral components. DNA vaccinations can be used to curb viral infections by <b>non-destructive</b> IFN-mediated control. This was demonstrated for hepatitis B. IFN-γ is critically important in controlling malaria infections and is a consideration for anti-malarial DNA vaccines.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to the often environmentally damaging methods of trawling and dredging, scientists aboard Chapman pioneered the use of fixed video cameras deployed on sensitive reef habitats to collect information on the kinds and abundance of reef fishes in a <b>non-destructive</b> manner, a novel approach in fishery data collection. Employing this technique off the Atlantic coast of Florida, Chapman conducted baseline studies of coral reefs that led to the establishment of the Experimental Oculina Research Reserve, one of the first such reserves of its kind.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{a primary}} X-ray beam to excite {{fluorescent}} radiation from the sample was first proposed by Glocker and Schreiber in 1928. Today, the method {{is used as a}} <b>non-destructive</b> analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is beryllium (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, {{it is often difficult to}} quantify elements lighter than sodium (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.|$|E
25|$|These fakes are {{detected}} by gemologists using {{a number of}} tests, relying primarily on <b>non-destructive,</b> close examination of surface structure under magnification; a featureless, pale blue background peppered by flecks or spots of whitish material is the typical surface appearance of natural turquoise, while manufactured imitations will appear radically different in both colour (usually a uniform dark blue) and texture (usually granular or sugary). Glass and plastic will have a much greater translucency, with bubbles or flow lines often visible just below the surface. Staining between grain boundaries may be visible in dyed imitations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{aspects of}} bird biology are {{difficult}} to study in the field. These include the study of behavioural and physiological changes that require a long duration {{of access to the}} bird. <b>Non-destructive</b> samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory. For instance, the variation in the ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes it possible to roughly establish the origins of migrant birds using mass spectrometric analysis of feather samples. These techniques can be used in combination with other techniques such as ringing.|$|E
25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, <b>non-destructive</b> testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{was heavy}} in Santa Cruz County and less {{so to the}} south in Monterey County, but effects {{extended}} well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland. No surface faulting occurred, though {{a large number of}} other ground failures and landslides were present, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a <b>non-destructive</b> tsunami was also observed.|$|E
25|$|Survey {{work has}} many {{benefits}} if performed as a preliminary exercise to, {{or even in}} place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, {{because it does not}} require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ sampling methods.) As with other forms of <b>non-destructive</b> archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It {{is the only way to}} gather some forms of information, such as settlement patterns and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into maps, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.|$|E
25|$|The Generic Graphics Library (GEGL) {{was first}} {{introduced}} as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release, GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit-depth color operations; because of this less information is lost when performing color operations. When GEGL is fully integrated, GIMP will have a higher color bit depth and better <b>non-destructive</b> work-flow. Current distribution versions of GIMP only support 8-bit of color, which is much less than what e.g. digital cameras produce (12-bit or more). Full support for high bit depth is included with actual Gimp 2.9 Development version. For accelerations OpenCL is available for some operations.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be {{possible}} to create functional 3D maps of the brain activity, using advanced neuroimaging technology, such as functional MRI (fMRI, for mapping change in blood flow), magnetoencephalography (MEG, for mapping of electrical currents), or combinations of multiple methods, to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and <b>non-destructive</b> methods. Today, fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, as the methods complement each other. Even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan, important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies.|$|E
25|$|CFB Trenton is {{also home}} to lodger units {{independent}} from 8 Wing including Aerospace and Telecommunications Engineering Support Squadron (ATESS) and The Canadian Forces Aerospace Warfare Centre (CFAWC). ATESS provides specialized engineering, training, and production/manufacturing in aerospace and telecommunications.

CFAWC is the centre of excellence for air power development, including Concept Development and Experimentation (CD) and lessons learned. In addition, CFAWC develops and maintains the Air Force air power knowledge repository and coordinates efforts to provide advanced synthetic environment and modelling and simulation services to assist CD, requirements definition, operational test and evaluation (OT) and mission rehearsal. The CFAWC is commanded by an RCAF Colonel.|$|E
25|$|The annual campouts were {{increasingly}} {{being seen as}} opportunities for bird-watching, photography and <b>non-destructive</b> studies. During the 1933 campout near Moree, New South Wales, extensive egg-collecting by the oologists present aroused much criticism from other members; the egg-collectors were later formally censured. This growing split between members' attitudes to bird-study {{came to a head}} at the 1935 campout at Marlo, eastern Victoria, when a museum ornithologist, George Mack, provocatively shot a scarlet robin at its nest, which had been under observation by the party. This caused outrage among many members and was followed by a decision of the RAOU Council to appoint a committee to reconsider the question of collecting. The result was a policy that collecting of specimens, except under government permit, was not acceptable, and that no collecting should take place at campouts anyway.|$|E
25|$|Black {{light is}} used {{extensively}} in <b>non-destructive</b> testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing optical brightener residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill. Black light puppetry is also performed in a black light theater.|$|E
