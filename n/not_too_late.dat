While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond that it is <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him {{to use it as}} his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E

25|$|The return leg {{match at}} the Sree Kanteerava Stadium started with Bengaluru FC needing a 1–0 victory to {{guarantee}} {{a place in the}} semi finals. It was however, the visitors Aizawl who drew first blood from a Joel Sunday goal in the 26th minute. Bengaluru FC however were <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to strike back. In the 28th minute, C.K. Vineeth found himself {{at the end of a}} Keegan Pereira pass and the Keralite did not make any mistake in finding the back of the net. In the 38th minute however, the agony for the hosts mounted as Joel Sunday scored a scorcher of a goal to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead with 2 away goals, 1 more than Bengaluru FC. After the restart, post the lemon break, the fate of the match was sealed by the Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana as he scored from a direct free-kick to give the visitors an almost unassailable 3–1 lead (5–2 on aggregate). Bengaluru FC pressed hard in the final half hour and did manage to pull one back through a penalty goal from Indian striker Sunil Chettri.

25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to redeem himself so he will not end up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

Since Dante's Ulisse has already undertaken this voyage and recounts it in the Inferno, Ulysses' entire monologue can be envisioned as his recollection while situated in Hell.|$|E

He was considered for the award of a knighthood three times from 1967, but the honour was twice blocked by British officials. [...] In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, intervened to secure a knighthood (KBE) for Wodehouse, which was announced in January 1975, in the same New Year Honours list in which Charlie Chaplin became Sir Charles.

Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) convinces him that it is <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to pursue his dreams and sings [...] "Piano Man" [...] with him.

Chris and Peter admit they don't hate each other and vow to spend more time together. As they are doing this, they see Brian and Stewie running away from the chaotic Miley who is smashing vehicles, shops and houses. The monkey confronts her, and {{attempts}} to talk her out of her rampage (as well as her career), but Miley ends up kidnapping him and takes him {{to the top of a}} nearby skyscraper. Fortunately, Peter is able to recruit his neighbor, Quagmire, to shoot her down in a biplane, and a battle with Miley starts escalating. The monkey falls out of her hands and he grips onto a narrow ledge with one hand. Miley's skin, hair and clothes peel off, revealing her android skeleton and she tries to kill Peter and Quagmire with a rock, but fails. Eventually, she is pummelled off the top. Afterwards, the monkey falls off the ledge but is saved by Peter just before he hits the road far below. Stewie and Brian then see the broken Miley, where Stewie says Brian can now have sex with her, but Miley blows up seconds later. Stewie apologizes to Brian for missing his chance for sexual intercourse with Miley but then her dismembered arm falls back out of the sky in front of them and Brian wags his tails in excitement and tells Stewie that it's <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to have sex with her, anticipating what's to happen with him next with her hand.
