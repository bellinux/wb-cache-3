He built about 44 instruments in the territory of former East Prussia, Poland and Lithuania. Although many of his organs were destroyed during the Second World War, {{there are still some}} partially preserved organs in Poland, and one remarkably well preserved organ in Vilnius (Lithuania). This document provides the available biographical information about Casparini and his family, in particular his grandfather Eugenio (1623 - 1706), the builder of the renowned Sonnenorgel in Görlitz, and his father Adam Orazio (1675 - 1745). The biographical section also deals with Casparini 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with his teacher Heinrich Gottfried Trost (ca. 1681 - 1759) and his pupil Christoph Heinrich Obuch (1713 - 1787). There is also a list of Casparini 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organs</b> and discussion of the major influences they betray.

40|$|In October of 1987, Canadian doctors artificially {{sustained}} {{the life of}} an anencephalic infant so that her organs could be transplanted into another child, touching off a fiery debate. At the request of her parents, doctors connected Baby Gabrielle, who was born missing most of her brain, to a respirator before flying her to Loma Linda, California, where her heart was transplanted into the world 2 ̆ 7 s youngest recipient of a heart transplant. While Baby Gabrielle 2 ̆ 7 s parents insisted that their daughter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organs</b> be used in this manner and were presumably happy with the resulting transplant, one of Baby Gabrielle 2 ̆ 7 s doctors expressed qualms about his role in the saga. Almost immediately, a firestorm of debate ignited as parents of unborn children with anencephaly began offering their children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organs</b> for use in similar procedures. Critics quickly began warning of slippery slopes and difficult moral questions. This continuing debate calls into question the medical propriety and the usefulness of current medical definitions of death. It also implicates even more fundamental issues, questioning what is required for a life to be considered fully human and also {{the nature and extent of}} respect, both legal and medical, warranted by such a life. This Article attempts to demonstrate that organ donation from anencephalic infants can be both beneficial and morally justifiable. Section I discusses the biological and physical manifestations of anencephaly. Section II introduces the current need for infant organs for transplantation, the possibility that anencephalic organs could address some of that demand, and the basic ethical positions both for and against the allowance of anencephalic organ transplantation. Section III discusses the dead donor rule, the legal obstacle which currently makes anencephalic organ donation legally problematic. Section IV discusses possible legal approaches to permitting organ transplants from anencephalic donors: the abandonment of the dead donor rule would cause too many undesirable consequences; the classification of anencephalic infants as non-persons offends society 2 ̆ 7 s general ethical norms and creates slippery slope problems that are in the realm of possibility; however, the classification of anencephalic infants as persons born into a state of death permits anencephalic organ donation without denying anencephalic infants personhood status and opening Pandora 2 ̆ 7 s box. Section V lays out legal safeguards necessary to prevent the abuse of an anencephalic organ donation scheme in the event that mankind perfects its ability to intentionally create anencephalic human organ donors. Section VI addresses potential class-related social concerns posed by anencephalic organ donation while arguing that a facially-just transplant policy should not be tainted by independent social problems, such as lack of medical care for the poor.

It is redescribed from Siganus nebulosus, Moreton Bay, and S. doliatus, Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia, with emphasis on the presence of Juel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organ,</b> a uterine seminal receptacle and the blind sac associated with the genital atrium. It differs from its congeners in the trajectory of the pars prostatica which recurves dorsally to the sinus-sac. Oligolecithoides Shen, 1982 is synonymised with Hysterolecithoides and O. trilobatus Shen, 1982 is synomised with H. epinepheli Yamaguti, 1934. Machidatrema Leon-Regagnon, 1998 is diagnosed, and found to be close to Hysterolecithoides, but differs in the lack of a blind-sac projecting from the dorsal genital atrium, by its tandem testes, the coiling of the uterus between the testes and the ovary, and the ventral excretory pore. M. leonae n. sp. is described from Siganus fuscescens, S. lineatus, S. doliatus, S. corallinus, S. vulpinus and Scarus globiceps at Heron Island, Queensland. It differs from its closest congener, M. akeh, in the muscular and tegumental flap over the genital pore and details of the terminal genitalia. M. chilostoma (Machida, 1980) and M. kyphosi (Yamaguti, 1970) are redescribed from Kyphosus vaigiensis from Heron Island. Neotheletrum Gibson & Bray, 1979 is diagnosed: it differs from Hysterolecithoides in its confluent excretory arms, blind seminal receptacle (no Juel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organ)</b> and uniformly tripartite vitellarium. A cladistic analysis suggests that M. chilostoma and M. kyphosi are not best accommodated in Machidatrema, that Machidatrema (sensu stricto) is monophyletic and that Hysterolecithoides is paraphyletic.

To illuminate the genesis of this unusual reproductive system, we isolated from the cane toad (Bufo marinus) the orthologues of several known vertebrate sex-determining genes, determined their primary structure, and studied their expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization of tissue sections.

Different asymmetric curves with their medians distant from zero were given by the maximum H wave unaccompanied by the M wave (H max.) and the H wave compounded by some M wave amplitude.
