The Finance Act 1920 introduced a 'Duty on licences for <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> vehicles' {{which was to be}} hypothecated and paid into a newly established Road Fund. Excise duties specifically for <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> vehicles were first imposed in 1921, along with the requirement to display a vehicle licence (tax disc) on the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> omnibus {{appeared}} {{on the streets of}} London on 22 April 1833.

50|$|Wright Brothers Day (December 17) is a United States {{national}} observation. It is codified in the US Code, and commemorates {{the first}} successful flights in a heavier than air, <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> airplane, that were made by Orville and Wilbur Wright on December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. On September 24, 1959 U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared December 17 to be Wright Brothers Day.|$|R
50|$|Another {{landmark}} {{application of}} scientific ideas to practical uses was the innovation {{of the brothers}} Wilbur and Orville Wright. In the 1890s they became fascinated with accounts of German glider experiments and began their own investigation into the principles of flight. Combining scientific knowledge and mechanical skills, the Wright brothers built and flew several gliders. Then, on December 17, 1903, they successfully flew the first heavier-than-air, <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> airplane.|$|R

In 1933 this figure was set at £15,000. The Road Traffic Act, 1961 (which is currently in force) repealed the 1933 act but replaced these sections with functionally identical sections.|$|R

During this vehicle's construction in 1832, a negligent engineer died of fright when a boiler component tore, expelling high-pressure steam in his direction. Neither he nor anyone else present was physically injured in any way, and the machinery itself suffered no significant damage.|$|R

In his book Drive On! L. J. K. Setright suggests that the magazine was set up by Henry Sturmey as an organ of propaganda for Harry J. Lawson, founder of the Daimler Company and a journalist on the magazine in its early days. Henry Sturmey stood down as editor of The Autocar magazine and left the company in 1901.|$|R

About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used.
