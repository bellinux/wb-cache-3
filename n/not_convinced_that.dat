5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the album would sell well, because {{the project was}} {{a radical departure from}} his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
5|$|On the song's {{very first}} demo, {{it started with}} a 12-string riff, just like the {{breakdown}} section {{in the middle of the}} song, but they replaced it with a chunky 6-string intro on the second demo. The song was recorded three to four times, in different ways, with both Adams and Vallance still <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> it was finished.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge would cost about $6.16 million, while keeping it would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> it would be sufficient.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Frederick, {{the heir to}} the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused {{constitutional}} chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since the heir apparent, George III, was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council of others, and that George would become the heir when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> a council was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong to}} prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E
50|$|Harris {{taught him}} as much as he could, but did <b>not</b> <b>convince</b> Smith <b>that</b> there was much more to boxing than {{battering}} your opponent into submission.|$|R

5|$|The {{submarine}} {{pens and}} other Atlantic Wall fortifications {{had been built}} in 1940 and 1941, when the Germans had air superiority and could deter Allied air attacks. By 1942 this advantage had been lost to the United States Army Air Forces, which had begun deploying to England in May 1942, and a greatly expanded Royal Air Force. The German Army preferred an alternative approach which would use trailer-style mobile launch platforms called Meillerwagen accompanied by testing and fuelling equipment mounted on railway cars or trucks. Although this configuration was far less efficient and would have a much lower rate of fire, it would have the great advantage of presenting a much smaller target for the Allied air forces. The Army was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> fixed bunkers could resist repeated air attacks and was particularly concerned about {{the vulnerability of the}} launch sites' road and rail links, which were essential for resupplying them with missiles and fuel.|$|E
5|$|Cotton was the South's primary export and {{the basis}} of its economy, and the system of {{production}} the South used was dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to European nations, but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The Union blockade of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade would cut off the supply of cotton to Britain and other European nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the South's military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the Confederacy had the strength to become independent. In the end, not a single foreign nation recognized the Confederate States of America.|$|E

25|$|Clavain and Felka {{learn of}} this history during {{communication}} with the Inhibitors in Galiana's head. Clavain, however, is <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the Inhibitors are right about the coming catastrophe and believes that their degrading performance may give humanity a chance for survival that other species have not had. As such, he rejects the Inhibitor requests to stand down.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scientists}} were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> this species belonged to either Yandusaurus or Agilisaurus, and in 2005, {{it was once}} again reassigned, this time to its own newly created genus. It {{is now known as}} Hexinlusaurus multidens (Barrett et al. 2005). Several studies agree that this species is slightly more derived than Agilisaurus (Norman et al. 2004; Barrett et al. 2005; Butler 2005). Both Yandusaurus and Hexinlusaurus were also found in the Dashanpu Quarry.|$|E
25|$|Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University {{thinks that}} {{leaflets}} {{that can only}} contain a relatively short text are unlikely to convince their readers and as such are ineffective in comparison to, for instance, radio programs. Professor Lee Jung-hoon from Yonsei University is <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> an organization such as North Korean People's Liberation Front is able to truly destabilize the North Korean regime, whatever methods they used, {{as they would have}} challenges trying to infiltrate North Korean society and posing {{as an alternative to the}} regime.|$|E

25|$|Beazley {{resigned}} the Labor leadership {{after the}} election and was succeeded by Simon Crean. But by 2003 Crean had failed to make any headway against Howard and Labor MPs began to fear that Howard would easily win the election due in 2004. Crean's opponents persuaded Beazley to attempt {{a return to the}} leadership by challenging Crean. The Labor Caucus (parliamentary Labor Party) re-elected Crean in June 2003, <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Beazley offered a better alternative. Some Beazley supporters, most notably Stephen Conroy, continued to plot against Crean, and Beazley refused to rule out a further challenge.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} received varied response. A {{survey conducted}} by The Sunday Times found {{that a majority of}} the citizens were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> frozen pork was as delectable as fresh pork, and opined that the difference in price was negligible. A small percentage of those interviewed were indifferent. According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about seventy percent of the pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork at the time of the campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a failed project, with virtually nobody calling it. On the other hand, foreign pork merchants from countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States were very supportive of the campaign as it would help boost their pork sales.|$|E
25|$|During the Seven Years' War, the French {{drew up a}} plan {{to invade}} the British Isles and met with Charles Stuart to discuss the {{possibility}} of his landing in either Ireland or Scotland to raise a rebellion. Charles refused, saying he would only cross the channel if it was to lead a rebellion in England. The French were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Charles could deliver on his promises of raising large support in Britain, and cut {{him out of the}} plan. Nonetheless, they hoped that Jacobites would support their forces once they landed. The planned invasion was eventually abandoned following British victory at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759 which dramatically weakened the French navy.|$|E

50|$|In {{the last}} years of his life, Wallscourt joined the Irish Confederation, but, while he {{supported}} the French revolutionaries of 1848, he could <b>not</b> be <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> armed revolution was a practical proposition in the famine-stricken Ireland of that time.|$|R

25|$|The {{new product}} {{continued}} to be sold and retained the name Coca-Cola (until 1992, when it was renamed Coke II), so the old product was renamed Coca-Cola Classic (also called Coke Classic, later just Coke), and {{for a short period}} it was referred to by the public as Old Coke. Many who tasted the reintroduced formula were <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the first batches really were the same formula that had supposedly been retired that spring. This was true for some regions because Coca-Cola Classic differed from the original formula in that all bottlers who hadn't already done so were using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar to sweeten the drink.|$|E
25|$|Price's army joined Van Dorn's on September 28. Van Dorn, as {{the senior}} officer, took {{command of the}} {{combined}} force. Grant became certain that Corinth was their next target. The Confederates hoped to seize Corinth from an unexpected direction, isolating Rosecrans from reinforcements, and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. Grant sent word to Rosecrans {{to be prepared for}} an attack, but despite the warning, Rosecrans was <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> Corinth was necessarily the target of Van Dorn's advance. He believed that the Confederate commander would not be foolhardy enough to attack the fortified town and might well instead choose to strike the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and maneuver the Federals out of their position.|$|E
25|$|His {{political}} opponent Roy Jenkins {{later wrote}} that Macleod seemed to prefer to focus his attacks on more moderate Labour figures who might dispute {{the ownership of}} the centre ground with him. He wrote that Macleod had “some quality of self-destructiveness in him”. He wrote {{that there was a}} “calculated coldness” about his partisan attacks. Jenkins wrote that Macleod had “a darting crossword-puzzle mind fortified by a phenomenal memory” adding that “I am <b>not</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> he was a particularly nice man, but he had insight and insolence”. Jenkins likens him to Benjamin Disraeli or to George Canning, who by attracting the admiration of a clique of younger men left a legend out of all proportion to their actual achievements.|$|E

60|$|Nasmyth, {{being a man}} {{of simple}} and, for the most part, {{wholesome}} ideas, was in a quandary. His feelings were generous, but he shrank from putting them into words.
