5|$|The two {{restaurant}} owners {{meet with}} Derrick, {{who does not}} react politely to them. However, they decide <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in Derrick. The husband/father has an awakening about Amira as well and forgives her, turning in Nasir to the police for an expired visa. At Parker’s party, Mac (Tina Majorino) reconnects with Max (Adam Rose), and Veronica shows mild jealousy when Piz shows her his new fling. Logan gets Parker a romantic cake. In order to escape from an awkward suitor whom Logan introduces her to, Veronica asks Piz {{to pretend to be}} her boyfriend. Afterwards, Wallace informs her that Piz does have a crush on her.

Piz retreats to the elevator, but Veronica appears and kisses him back. The elevator opens, revealing Logan.|$|E
5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Eve assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T. C., Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two Russells in the final episode.|$|E

5|$|In November 2007, Vincent runs a {{blood test}} on himself after {{experiencing}} {{what appears to be}} symptoms of morning sickness and discovers he is pregnant. Eve inspects Vincent (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. Vincent torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive and pregnant with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent with the birth of his son on the Russells' kitchen table after Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian.

Vincent is last seen being arrested by Chief of Police Sam Bennett. Since T. C. Russell, Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two members of the Russell family to appear in the series finale.|$|E

25|$|On 26 August, Aung San Suu Kyi, who {{had watched}} the demonstrations from her mother's bedside, entered the {{political}} arena by addressing {{half a million people}} at Shwedagon Pagoda. It was at this point that she became a symbol for the struggle in Burma, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} Western world. Kyi, as the daughter of Aung San, who led the independence movement, appeared ready to lead the movement for democracy. Kyi urged the crowd <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> on the army but find peace through non-violent means. At this point in time for many in Burma, the uprising was seen as similar to that of the People Power Revolution in the Philippines in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Lewis chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{professional}} {{after the}} Olympics, and instead fought {{four more years}} as an amateur, hoping for {{a second chance to}} win a gold medal. At the World Championships, he lost in the preliminary round to Petar Stoymenov of Bulgaria. Later that year, Lewis won gold at the Commonwealth Games. After winning several more amateur titles in the following years, he traveled to Seoul, South Korea, for the 1988 Summer Olympics and achieved his goal. In the gold medal final, Lewis defeated future world heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe via second-round referee stopped contest (RSC). Lewis would go on to become the first super-heavyweight gold medallist to become world heavyweight champion as a professional. In the Games' closing ceremony, Lewis was Canada's flag bearer. Lewis finished his amateur career with a record of 75 wins (58 by knockout) and 7 losses.|$|E
25|$|While honing {{his forces}} at Macha, Belgrano ordered several {{reconnaissance}} missions on the enemy. He chose {{one of his}} best officers, Lieutenant La Madrid, to collect intelligence about the royalist headquarters at Yocalla. La Madrid departed the republican camp with four Dragoons and a native guide. After an icy-cold night, which ended in a heavy snowfall, the small detachment was just 400 metres away from the enemy stronghold. Not only their recce mission went unnoticed, but they also surprised a royalist patrol marching on the snow and took five prisoners. Only a troop of local natives, loyal to Pezuela, harassed La Madrid's group during their retreat along the defile of Tinguipaya, and informed Castro about his path through the mountains. When the captives were presented to Belgrano, he recognized two of them - a corporal and a soldier - as members of the royalist army defeated in Salta. These men had sworn <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their arms on the republicans again. To make an example, Belgrano had them executed by a shooting squad. Their bodies were later beheaded, and their heads, along with a reinforcement of eight Dragoons, were sent to La Madrid, still close to the enemy.|$|E
500|$|Along their {{march through}} {{the forests of}} the frontier, Washington was joined by more men at Winchester. [...] At this point he learned from Captain Trent of the French advance.

[...] He warns her that the training has reached a critical point, where the dog might be cured or go insane. [...] He believes that curing the dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this, {{though there is no}} indication in the story that this is any kind of national problem.

[...] The next day, Brown, escorted by U.S. Marine Corps military police, {{was turned over to}} the custody of Japanese police at the Naha detention center. [...] When asked why they had waited ten days after the formal charges to indict Brown, Japanese Deputy Chief Prosecutor Junichi Okumura stated that they wanted to give Brown a chance to apologize (called jidan in Japanese) to the victim. [...] Since that apparently did not occur and V. N. still expressed a desire to press charges, the Japanese authorities went ahead with the indictment.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{to honor the}} Kaiju and mecha genres while {{creating}} an original stand-alone film, something [...] "conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything". The director {{made a point of}} starting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. He cautioned his designers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to films like Gamera, Godzilla, or The War of the Gargantuas for inspiration, stating: [...] "I didn't want to be postmodern, or referential, or just belong to a genre. I really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. I tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur." [...] Rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as The Colossus and George Bellows's boxing paintings. The film's designers include Wayne Barlowe, Oscar Chichoni, monster sculptors David Meng and Simon Lee, and [...] and The Hobbit designer Francisco Ruiz Velasco. Del Toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled At the Mountains of Madness adaptation may have been used in Pacific Rim.|$|E
