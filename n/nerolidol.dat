The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of P. gaudichaudianum essential oil and <b>nerolidol</b> using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model study. Treatment of the XV 185 - 14 c and N 123 strains with essential oil and <b>nerolidol</b> led to cytotoxicity but did not induce mutagenicity. Our results revealed an important role of base excision repair (BER) as the ntg 1, ntg 2, apn 1 and apn 2 mutants showed pronounced sensitivity to essential oil and <b>nerolidol.</b> In the absence of superoxide dismutase (in sod 1 Δ mutant strain) sensitivity to the essential oil and <b>nerolidol</b> increased indicating that this oil and <b>nerolidol</b> are generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS production was confirmed by DCF-DA probing assay in Sod-deficient strains.

The analysis of the chemical composition of the essential oil from B. dracunculifolia by GC showed that this was composed mainly of mono- and sesquiterpenes and the majority compound was <b>nerolidol.</b> Therefore, antiulcerogenic activity of <b>nerolidol</b> (50, 250 and 500 mg/kg) was investigated using ethanol-, indomethacin- and stress-induced ulcer models in rat. In the stress-induced ulcer model, a significant reduction of the ULI in animals treated with <b>nerolidol</b> (50, 250 and 500 mg/kg) and cimetidine (100 mg/kg) was observed, compared to the control group (p < 0. 05).

This investigation aimed to study the effect of terpene concentration on the transdermal absorption of diclofenac sodium from ethanol:glycerin:phosphate buffer solution (60 : 10 : 30). Therefore, enhancing effects of various terpenes (menthone, limonenoxide, carvone, <b>nerolidol</b> and farnsol) with different concentrations (0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2. 5 %, v/v) on the permeation of diclofenac sodium were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells fitted with rat skin.

Whereas the terpenoid profile of cultivated strawberry species is dominated by the monoterpene linalool and the sesquiterpene <b>nerolidol,</b> fruit of wild strawberry species emit mainly olefinic monoterpenes and myrtenyl acetate, which are not found in the cultivated species.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the spin-labeled 5 -doxyl stearic acid revealed remarkable fluidity increases in the plasma membrane of terpene-treated Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. For an antiproliferative activity assay using 5 × 10 (6) parasites/mL, the sesquiterpene <b>nerolidol</b> and the monoterpenes (+) -limonene, α-terpineol and 1, 8 -cineole inhibited {{the growth of the}} parasites with IC 50 values of 0. 008, 0. 549, 0. 678 and 4. 697 mM, respectively. The IC 50 values of these terpenes increased as the parasite concentration used in the cytotoxicity assay increased, and this behavior was examined using a theoretical treatment of the experimental data. Cytotoxicity tests with the same parasite concentration as in the EPR experiments revealed a correlation between the IC 50 values of the terpenes and the concentrations at which they altered the membrane fluidity. In addition, the terpenes induced small amounts of cell lysis (4 - 9 %) at their respective IC 50 values. For assays with high cell concentrations (2 × 10 (9) parasites/mL), the incorporation of terpene into the cell membrane was very fast, and the IC 50 values observed for 24 h and 5 min-incubation periods were not significantly different.

40|$|The {{screening}} of several Chinese medicinal plants for insecticidal principles showed that essential oil of Rhododendron anthopogonoides flowering aerial parts possessed significant toxicity against maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais. A total of 37 components {{were identified in}} the essential oil and the main constituents of the essential oil were 4 -phenyl- 2 -butanone (27. 22 %), <b>nerolidol</b> (8. 08 %), 1, 4 -cineole (7. 85 %), caryophyllene (7. 63 %) and γ-elemene (6. 10 %), followed by α-farnesene (4. 40 %) and spathulenol (4. 19 %). Repeated bioactivity-directed chromatographic separation on silica gel columns led us to isolate three compounds, namely 4 -phenyl- 2 -butanone, 1, 4 -cineole, and <b>nerolidol.</b> 4 -Phenyl- 2 -butanone shows pronounced contact toxicity against S. zeamais (LD 50 = 6. 98 mg/adult) and was more toxic than either 1, 4 -cineole or <b>nerolidol</b> (LD 50 = 50. 86 mg/adult and 29. 30 mg/adult, respectively) against the maize weevils, while the crude essential oil had a LD 50 value of 11. 67 mg/adult. 4 -Phenyl- 2 -butanone and 1, 4 -cineole also possessed strong fumigant toxicity against the adults of S. zeamais (LC 50 = 3. 80 mg/L and 21. 43 mg/L) while the crude essential oil had a LC 50 value of 9. 66 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} profiles of flavour-related genes and aroma quality of fruit headspace were investigated {{in the four}} strawberry genotypes “Regina delle Valli” (Fragaria vesca), “Profumata di Tortona” (F. moschata), “Onda” and VR 177 selection (F. x ananassa). Real-time RT-PCR {{analysis was used to}} identify <b>Nerolidol</b> Synthases (FaNES 1 and FaNES 2) and Monoterpene Synthase (FvPINS) genes in F. x ananassa and F. vesca, respectively. In F. x ananassa genotypes the terpenoid profile was characterized by <b>nerolidol,</b> whereas wild species produced mainly monoterpenes. The flavour biogenesis in ripening fruit was largely determined by the expression of a strawberry alcohol acyltransferase (SAAT) gene, especially in “Profumata di Tortona” and “Regina delle Valli”. The fruit solid-phase microextraction (SPME) headspace was analyzed using the Gaschromatography-Olfactometry (GC-O), that allows the chromatographic separation of volatiles together with their olfactometric evaluation. The aroma quality differed among the genotypes: “Regina delle Valli” had a peculiar profile characterized by high concentrations of limonene, linalool and mesifurane that resulted in “spiced”, “citrus, floral” and “sweet, baked” descriptors; the character impact compound in “Profumata di Tortona” was ethyl butanoate, responsible for “sweet” and “fruity, strawberry” descriptors, which, however, was developed in lower amount if compared to the F. x ananassa genotypes.

40|$|Abstract: In a {{previous}} paper we described {{the isolation of}}four <b>nerolidol</b> glycosides 1 - 4 from Etiobotrya japonica collected in China. Here we report the isolation of seven glycosides 5 - 11, five of which (57, 10, and 11) are new natural products, from E. japonica collected in Southern Italy. Compounds 5 - 7 are sesquiterpene glycosides characterized by <b>nerolidol</b> (5) or isohumbeniol (6 and 7) as aglycones and by branched oligosaccharidic chains made up of one β-D-glucopyranosyl and three a-L-rhamnopyranosyl units which link trans-femloyl ester moieties in compounds 5 and 7. Analysis of the oligosaccharide structures was achieved by 2 D spectral analysis including 1 H- 1 H correlated spectroscopy (COSY), 1 H- 13 C direct chemical shift correlations (HETCOR), and 2 D-Homonuclear Hanmann-Hahn spectroscopy (HOHAHA). Compounds 8 - 11 were characterized as ionone-derived glycosides by chemical and spectral methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Head lice {{infestation}} is {{an emerging}} social prob-lem in undeveloped and developed countries. Because of louse resistance increasing, several long-used insecticidal compounds {{have lost their}} efficacy, and alternatives, such as essential oils, have been proposed to treat this parasitic infestation. The present study investigated the efficacy of two natural substances: tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil and <b>nerolidol</b> (3, 7, 11 -trimethyl- 1, 6, 10 -dodecatrien- 3 -ol) against lice and its eggs. Products were used alone and in combination (ratio 1 : 1 and 1 : 2) from 8 % dilution. The in vitro effect of natural substances at different concentrations were evaluated against 69 head lice (adults and nymphs) and 187 louse eggs collected from school children in Chieti– Pescara (Central Italy) over a 6 -month period. The lice mortality was evaluated for 24 h by a stereo light micro-scope. The ovicidal activity was monitored by microscopic inspections for 15 days. Tea tree oil was more effective than <b>nerolidol</b> against head lice with 100 % mortality at 30 min and 1 % concentration. On the contrary, <b>nerolidol</b> expressed a more pronounced ovicidal activity inducing the failure of 50 % of the eggs to hatch at 1 % concentration after 4 days; the same effect was achieved by using a twice concentration of tea tree oil. The association of the two substances both in ratios 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 combined efficaciously their insecticidal and ovicidal effect; in particular, the ratio 1 : 2 (tea tree oil 0. 5 % plus <b>nerolidol</b> 1 %) acted producing both the death of all head lice at 30 min and the abortive effect of louse eggs after 5 days. These results offer new potential application of natural compounds and display a promising scenario {{in the treatment of}} pediculosis resistant cases. The development of novel pediculicides containing essential oils could be, in fact, an important tool to control the parasitic infestation...|$|E

Differences in the expression level of genes coding of strawberry alcohol acyltransferase (SAAT), F. x ananassa <b>nerolidol</b> synthase 1 (FaNESl) and F vesca monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases (FvPINS and PINS 1, respectively) were detected among these genotypes. In fruits of F. x ananassa the terpenoid profile was dominated by <b>nerolidol,</b> whereas wild spe–cies produced mainly monoterpenes.
