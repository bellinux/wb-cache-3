40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted gear drives, the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the gear}} drives can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur gear drives with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the gear drive can be achieved by changing the <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> coefficient and finally the optimum value of <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> coefficient are suggested for the given spur gear drive that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an on-line method for detecting damaged {{teeth in the}} bandsaw using acoustic emission (AE) signal energy. The method {{is based on an}} analysis of differences in AE energies generated by <b>normal</b> and damaged <b>teeth</b> during sawing. Because of the difference in the amount of sawing, the AE energy was low for sawing by the damaged tooth and high for sawing by the <b>normal</b> <b>tooth</b> immediately after the damaged tooth. The ratio of AE energy for two successive <b>teeth</b> — a <b>normal</b> <b>tooth</b> immediately following a damaged tooth — was much greater than 1, whereas the ratio of AE energy for two successive <b>normal</b> <b>teeth</b> was close to 1. The results demonstrate that the technique using the AE energy ratio for two successive teeth is effective for on-line detection of damaged bandsaw teeth.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} trans-dental photo-curing {{on the degree of}} conversion (DC) of a resin composite irradiated by a light curing unit operating in different curing modes. Methods: A curing lamp having six different curing modes was used for indirect photo-activation of a Nanocomposite through different <b>thicknesses</b> of <b>tooth</b> tissues. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine DC. Three main experimental groups were formed in accordance with the 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 1. 3 mm, <b>tooth</b> <b>thicknesses</b> which were further subdivided into six minor groups formed according to irradiation modes. Control groups employed direct irradiation. Results: For each of the six light curing modes, the average DC decreased with increase in intervening <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness.</b> Among the groups, 0. 5 mm had the highest DC mean values, 21. 5 mm group had the lowest mean values (P< 0. 05). The composite resin showed lower DC mean values when irradiated indirectly compared to control direct curing (P< 0. 05). DC mean values for turbo and high light modes were statistically significantly higher compared to Normal, Soft Start, Pulse and Pulse Soft light modes. Conclusions: A Nano-composite resin cured through different <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> has lower DC compared to direct curing. DC decreases with increasing intervening <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness.</b> DC mean values for turbo and high light modes were statistically higher compared to normal, soft start, pulse and pulse soft light modes...|$|R

40|$|Examining three {{bleaching}} systems, this in vivo {{clinical trial}} evaluated {{the relationship among}} tooth sensitivity, light activation, and agent concentration, and it correlated dental sensitivity with <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness.</b> Materials and Methods: Eighty-seven volunteer patients were included. Inclusion criteria were the presence of anterior teeth without restorations {{as well as the}} absence of a previous bleaching experience and absence of non-carious cervical lesions or dental pain. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding, a maximum of TF 3 hypoplasia, tetracycline-fluorosis stains, malpositioned teeth, orthodontic treatment, periodontal disease, and/or analgesic/anti-inflammatory intake. Patients were randomly assigned to three bleaching groups: Group A (n= 25) was treated with 15 % H 2 O 2 and nitrogenous-titanium-dioxide and was light activated (Lase Peroxide Lite, DMC, SaoCarlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil); Group B (n= 27) was treated with 35 % H 2 O 2 and was light activated (Lase Peroxide Sensy, DMC); and Group C (n= 35) was treated with 35 % H 2 O 2 (White Gold Office, Dentsply, 38 West Clark Ave., Milford, USA) without light activation. Tooth sensitivity (TS) was self-reported by the patients using the visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline (TSO), immediately after treatment (TSI), and at seven days after treatment (TS 7). In 46 patients, <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> was determined by computed tomography. TSO, TSI, and TS 7 were compared between the A and B groups to determine the effect of concentration and between the B and C groups to determine the effect of light using analysis of covariance. The correlation between <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> and TSI was determined by Spearman Rho test (SPSS 15). Results: Eighty-seven patients were evaluated at baseline, and 61 were evaluated at seven days. Separated by groups, tooth sensitivity, expressed as VAS value at the time points TS 0, TS 1, and TS 7, respectively, were as follows: Group A: 13. 76 +/- 13. 53, 24. 40 +/- 25. 24, and 5. 94 +/- 5. 5; Group B: 15. 07 +/- 18. 14, 42. 4 +/- 31. 78, and 8. 68 +/- 17. 99; and Group C: 10. 80 +/- 14. 83, 31. 51 +/- 29. 34, and 7. 24 +/- 9. 2. Group A showed significantly lower tooth sensitivity than group B at TSI (p= 0. 032). No differences were observed in the tooth sensitivities between groups B and C. No correlation was encountered between <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> and <b>tooth</b> sensitivity immediately after treatment (Rho=- 0. 088,p= 0. 563). The median <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> was 2. 78 +/- 0. 21 mm. Conclusions: Increases in the concentration of bleaching agents directly affect tooth sensitivity, and LED/laser activation and <b>tooth</b> <b>thickness</b> are not correlated with tooth sensitivity after dental bleaching...|$|R

This is because it negatively affects the dimensional stability and accuracy of the involute profile, {{as well as the}} concentricity, roundness, tooth spacing uniformity, and size of the gear.

Group 2 - comprising of Class-II direct composite resin restored teeth and Group 3 - comprising Class-II ceramic inlay restored teeth. Cavities were prepared with occlusal width of 1 / 3 intercuspal distance and 2 mm deep pulpally. Group 2 teeth were restored with hybrid composite resin (Z 350 3 M ESPE, USA) and group 3 teeth were restored with Vitadur Alpha alumina (Ivoclare Vivadent, Liechtenstein, Europe). Ceramic inlay was bonded with adhesive cement (rely X resin cement of 3 MESPE, USA). The specimens were subjected to a compressive load until they fractured. Data were analyzed statistically by unpaired Student′s t test. Results: The fracture resistant strength, expressed as kilonewton (KN), was group 1 - 1. 51 KN, group 2 - 1. 25 KN, and group 3 - 1. 58 KN.
