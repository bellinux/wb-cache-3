However, in May 2011, Averno was booked in a Lucha de Apuesta, where he lost his mask and was forced to reveal his true identity.

5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. It {{is a matter}} of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly reminded us that we must cultivate our garden.

5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs. They could only be convened by magistrates, and citizens only voted on matters proposed by the presiding magistrate. Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce voter intimidation, and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved {{by a majority of}} the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It {{was not until the}} time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspension}} {{order of}} Nagpal was challenged in the Allahabad High Court on 30 July 2013 through a Public interest litigation (PIL). The petition was filed by social activist Nutan Thakur at the Lucknow bench of the court. It also requested {{the court to}} direct the central government to ask the state governments to prevent harassment of those officers who have ordered action against illegal construction of religious places, and illegal mining. On 1 August, {{the court ruled that}} the suspension is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> a PIL, and the officer should directly approach the court. It however praised her work in preventing illegal sand mining and ordered both the central and the state government to report how they are tackling illegal mining and what security is being provided to the officers engaged in stopping it.|$|E

25|$|In John Paul II's teaching, {{homosexual}} intercourse {{is regarded}} as an utilization of another's body, not a mutual self-giving in familial love, physically expressed by the masculine and feminine bodies; and such intercourse is also performed by a choice of the will, unlike homosexual orientation, which he acknowledged is usually <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> free choice.|$|E
25|$|Art is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> taste, but {{involves}} the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving {{a work of}} art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.|$|E
25|$|The {{court ruled}} that even in cases of adultery, sadomasochistic {{behaviour}} was generally <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public interest but {{that there could be}} a public interest if the behaviour involved the mocking of Jews or the Holocaust. Mosley was awarded damages of £60,000 (approx. $92,000) from the case and the {{court ruled that}} there was no evidence of a Nazi element to the sex act.|$|E

25|$|The {{significance}} of Bai Bureh's {{war against the}} British is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> whether he won or lost the war but {{that a man who}} had none of what could be called formal military training was able to show that for a significant number of months he was able to take on the British who were very proud of their great military successes across the globe. The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied {{in the same way that}} one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E
25|$|Antheus Ortiz Chávez, {{better known}} under the ring name Hijo de Pirata Morgan (born February 28, 1992 in Mexico City, Mexico) is a Mexican luchador, or {{professional}} wrestler currently {{working for the}} Mexican professional wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) portraying a tecnico ("Good guy") wrestling character. Hijo de Pirata Morgan's real name was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public record until March 16, 2013 where he lost his wrestling mask and had to reveal his real name.

He is legitimately the son of professional wrestler Pedro Ortiz Villanueva, better known as Pirata Morgan, and not a storyline family relationship as it sometimes the case in Lucha Libre.|$|E

Their birth names are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public record as they are both enmascarados, or masked wrestlers, and in lucha libre the identities of masked wrestlers are kept secret unless unmasked.|$|E
