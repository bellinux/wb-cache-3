40|$|This thesis' {{topic is}} The United States' {{influence}} on Northern Ireland conflict resolution. The Norther Ireland conflict {{has its roots}} in the 17 th century, when protestants from Scotland and England started to come to the Ulster region. Religion differences between the inhabitants, most of the original population were Catholics, led over the centuries to the division of two ethnics on the Ulster territory - protestant and catholic. After the partition of the island in 1921 the southern part declared independence, however the <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> <b>territory</b> remained a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The conflict between ethnics sharpened itself, because most of the Catholics wanted to united the island under Irish rule (the republicans), while protestants wanted to remained in the union with the Great Britain (the unionists and the loyalists). At the end of the 1960 's the conflict turned itself into a violent one and the attacks and killing continued for the next thirty years during the period called "the Troubles. " The conflict was settled by the end of the 1990 's with a contribution of the governments of the Republic of Ireland, the Great Britain and the US.

5000|$|Research by Paul Compton of Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) {{fed into}} a secret 1984 {{briefing}} paper {{prepared by the}} <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> Office for then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, which examined various repartition schemes, the most extensive transferring to the Republic half of <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland's</b> <b>territory</b> and one-third of its population, with West Belfast a [...] "walled ghetto" [...] enclave. The plans were quickly dismissed as impractical and politically unworkable. Later in 1984, then-Taoisaeach Garret FitzGerald spoke against repartition as reinforcing partition.|$|R

2500|$|As amended, Article 3, Section 1 {{expresses the}} [...] "firm will" [...] of the Irish nation {{to create a}} united Irish people, though not, explicitly, a united country. It stresses, however, that a united Ireland should respect the {{distinct}} cultural identity of Unionists and that it should only come about with the separate [...] "democratically expressed" [...] consent of the peoples of both parts of the island. This provision was intended to diminish the concerns of Unionists, that their rights would be ignored in a united Ireland, should that happen. Under the Good Friday Agreement the people of <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland's</b> [...] "democratically expressed" [...] consent must be secured in a referendum. Interestingly for a provision that speaks of the [...] "Irish Nation"'s desire for unity, it adds an additional legal requirement for a referendum to be held not only in <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> {{but also in the}} Republic of Ireland before a united Ireland could be brought about. This has the effect of creating an extra hurdle to Irish acceptance of a cession of <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland's</b> <b>territory</b> from the UK which would not apply to a cession of any other territory.|$|R
50|$|There was a UK {{regional}} network {{for the rest}} of the PSA's building and estates management work.

The main function of the DWOs was to carry out maintenance and small building projects. The DWOs were mostly situated in urban centres where there were a number of government buildings to maintain, or on military installations.|$|R

The Republic of Ireland left the Commonwealth of Nations organisation. The remaining six {{counties of}} the island of <b>Ireland</b> constituted the <b>territory</b> of <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland.</b> In 1927, the realm, consisting of combined <b>territories</b> of <b>Northern</b> <b>Ireland</b> and Great Britain, was renamed the [...] "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
