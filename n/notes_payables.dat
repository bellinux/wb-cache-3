50|$|There are {{associations}} between managerial entrenchment and capital structure decisions which mostly result {{on the fact}} that CEO's are reluctant to debt when funding an investment. The capital structure is the way that the company chooses to fund its own operations and growth. Debt {{comes in the form of}} bond issues or long-term <b>notes</b> <b>payable,</b> while equity is classified as common stock, preferred stock or retained earnings.|$|R
5000|$|Current {{ratio is}} {{generally}} {{used to estimate}} company's liquidity by [...] "deriving the proportion of current assets available to cover current liabilities". The main idea behind this concept is to decide whether current assets which also include {{cash and cash equivalents}} are available pay off its short term liabilities (taxes, <b>notes</b> <b>payable</b> and etc.)The higher current ratio is, the better is for the organisation.|$|R
50|$|One {{response}} from Congress was the Act of July 17, 1861, which allowed for $250,000,000 to be borrowed on the credit of the United States. Of this sum, up to $50,000,000 was authorized as non-interest bearing Treasury <b>Notes,</b> <b>payable</b> upon demand, in denominations less than fifty dollars and {{not less than}} ten dollars. These were called Demand Notes to distinguish them from the interest-bearing Treasury Notes in existence at the time.|$|R
5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the <b>notes</b> <b>payable</b> issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|R
50|$|On 26 April 1884, Gordon issued £2,500 in <b>notes,</b> <b>payable</b> {{six months}} from issue. By the end of July, {{estimates}} between £26,000 and £50,000 had been issued. Neither representative nor fiat money, Gordon’s notes were more promissory in nature, and were personally guaranteed, {{with the backing of}} the Egyptian government. Accepted by both merchants and soldiers, the notes initially provided economic relief and trade stimulus, but had begun to depreciate by July.|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>note</b> <b>payable</b> is {{commonly}} used in accounting (as distinguished from accounts payable) or commonly as just a [...] "note", it is internationally defined by the Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes, but regional variations exist. A banknote is frequently {{referred to as a}} promissory note, as it is made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. Mortgage notes are another prominent example.|$|R
50|$|A {{promissory}} note, {{sometimes referred}} to as a <b>note</b> <b>payable,</b> is a legal instrument (more particularly, a financial instrument and a debt instrument), in which one party (the maker or issuer) promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of money to the other (the payee), either at a fixed or determinable future time or on demand of the payee, under specific terms. If the promissory note is unconditional and readily saleable, it is called a negotiable instrument.|$|R

5000|$|A {{promissory}} note, {{referred to}} as a <b>note</b> <b>payable</b> in accounting, or commonly as just a [...] "note", is a contract where one party (the maker or issuer) makes an unconditional promise in writing to pay a sum of money to the other (the payee), either at a fixed or determinable future time or on demand of the payee, under specific terms. They differ from IOUs in that they contain a specific promise to pay, rather than simply acknowledging that a debt exists.|$|R
50|$|Solvency, {{in finance}} or business, {{is the degree}} to which the current assets of an {{individual}} or entity exceed the current liabilities of that individual or entity. Solvency can also be described as the ability of a corporation to meet its long-term fixed expenses and to accomplish long-term expansion and growth. This is best measured using the net liquid balance (NLB) formula. In this formula solvency is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments, then subtracting <b>notes</b> <b>payable.</b>|$|R

50|$|A swap {{agreement}} {{in which one}} party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In partial return reverse swaps, the underlying asset, {{referred to as the}} reference asset, is usually a stock or portfolio of stocks. The reference asset is sold to the buyer, with half (or some other percentage) of the return owned by the party receiving the agreed rate of payment, which is usually {{in the form of a}} <b>note</b> <b>payable.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In what {{appeared}} incidental at the time, the charter included {{the right to}} bank unless this was specifically prohibited; in years to come, {{there was to be}} some uncertainty as to how definitive these rights were. [...] McCulloch and Tod were keen from the outset to provide banking services to their trading partners: “they had set their minds on having, `like banks`, promissory notes to pay to agents, weavers, manufacturers and other customers"; these were duly issued in 1747. However, [...] "three years later the Company issued true bank <b>notes,</b> <b>payable</b> on demand, and non-interest bearing." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{return to}} specie payments, however, at the {{earliest}} period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations {{in the value of}} currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States <b>notes</b> <b>payable</b> in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained.|$|R
2500|$|Now, then, {{let it be}} {{considered}} what has actually {{been done in the}} provision of a National currency. In July and August, 1861, and February, 1862, the issue of sixty millions of dollars in United States <b>notes,</b> <b>payable</b> on demand, was authorized. They were made receivable in payments, but were not declared a legal tender until March, 1862, when the amount in circulation had been greatly reduced by receipt and cancellation. In 1862 and 1863 the issue of four hundred and fifty millions in United States <b>notes,</b> <b>payable</b> not on demand, but, in effect, at the convenience of the government, was authorized, subject to certain restrictions as to fifty millions. These notes were made receivable for the bonds of the National loans, for all debts due to or from the United States, except duties on imports and interest on the public debt, and were also declared a legal tender. In March, 1863, the issue of notes for parts of a dollar was authorized to an amount not exceeding fifty millions of dollars. These notes were not declared a legal tender, but were [...] made redeemable under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. In February, 1863, the issue of three hundred millions of dollars in notes of the National banking associations was authorized. These notes were made receivable to the same extent as United States notes, and provision was made to secure their redemption, but they were not made a legal tender.|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} {{determinants}} of capital structure {{in the absence of}} tax incentives. I find that debt use is positively related to asset tangibility, growth, and size, and negatively related to age, liquidity, and profitability. Tax-exempt sector-specific findings indicate that debt is also positively related to the efficacy of state laws against the misuse of assets and to the percentage of decision makers that are paid and negatively related to decision-maker compensation and to charitable contributions. Religious organizations most commonly borrow from internal sources, those in education use tax-exempt bonds, while human services organizations use mortgages and <b>notes</b> <b>payable.</b> Copyright (c) 2010, The Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|If a {{promissory}} <b>note</b> <b>payable</b> to {{a solvent}} commercial bank made by one not a customer were discounted for the maker by the bank and the price though due were not demanded by the maker, the financial and legal consequences would be those of a demand loan by maker to bank. If bullion, coins, bank notes, or deposit currency were sold by one not a customer to a bank and the price not demanded when due, the consequences would be those of a demand loan. Similarly, if the discounted note matured but were permitted by the bank to run, the 6 ank would be making a demand loan to the solvent maker...|$|R
5000|$|The law {{allowed for}} the notes to be hand-signed by F.E. Spinner (Treasurer), and L.E. Chittenden (Register of the Treasury). This proved unfeasible, however, and Congress also {{authorized}} the notes to be signed by procurators. Seventy women were hired at an annual salary of $1,200 to sign the notes. A distinction of [...] "for the" [...] was written after a signature to indicate that it was being used in place of treasury officials. Apparently, some skilled women could even imitate the signature of F.E. Spinner. In late August [...] "for the" [...] was added to printing plates to simplify the hand-signing operation. The American Bank Note Company stopped printing <b>notes</b> <b>payable</b> at St. Louis and Cincinnati several days after revising printing plates with [...] "for the".|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} be eligible, a small {{business}} must be established, have financial statements to demonstrate it was profitable {{in one of the}} past two years, and be able to project sufficient cash flow to meet current and future loan payments over a two-year period from loan approval.

Examples of qualifying loans may include business credit card obligations, capital leases, <b>notes</b> <b>payable</b> to vendors or suppliers, Development Company Loan Program (504) first lien loans, other loans to small businesses made without an SBA guaranty, and loans made by or with an SBA guaranty on or after Feb. 17, 2009.

5000|$|During 1861, {{the first}} year of the American Civil War, the {{expenses}} incurred by the Union Government much exceeded its limited revenues from taxation, and borrowing was the main vehicle for financing the war. The Act of July 17, 1861 authorized United States Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to raise money via the issuance of $50,000,000 in Treasury <b>Notes</b> <b>payable</b> on demand. [...] These Demand Notes were paid to creditors directly and used to meet the payroll of soldiers in the field. While issued within the legal framework of Treasury Note Debt, the Demand Notes were intended to circulate as currency and were of the same size as banknotes and closely resembled them in appearance. [...] During December 1861, economic conditions deteriorated and a suspension of specie payment caused the government to cease redeeming the Demand Notes as coins.|$|R
50|$|Corporations may rely on {{borrowed}} funds (debt capital or credit) {{as sources}} of investment to sustain ongoing business operations or to fund future growth. Debt comes in several forms, such as through bank loans, <b>notes</b> <b>payable,</b> or bonds issued to the public. Bonds require the corporations to make regular interest payments (interest expenses) on the borrowed capital until the debt reaches its maturity date, therein the firm must pay back the obligation in full. Debt payments can also {{be made in the}} form of sinking fund provisions, whereby the corporation pays annual installments of the borrowed debt above regular interest charges. Corporations that issue callable bonds are entitled to pay back the obligation in full whenever the company feels it is in their best interest to pay off the debt payments. If interest expenses cannot be made by the corporation through cash payments, the firm may also use collateral assets as a form of repaying their debt obligations (or through the process of liquidation).|$|R
5000|$|These {{practices}} {{created a}} new kind of [...] "money" [...] that was actually debt, that is, goldsmiths' debt rather than silver or gold coin, a commodity that had been regulated and controlled by the monarchy. This development required the acceptance in trade of the goldsmiths' promissory <b>notes,</b> <b>payable</b> on demand. Acceptance in turn required a general belief that coin would be available; and a fractional reserve normally served this purpose. Acceptance also required that the holders of debt be able legally to enforce an unconditional right to payment; it required that the notes (as well as drafts) be negotiable instruments. The concept of negotiability had emerged in fits and starts in European money markets, but it was well developed by the 17th century. Nevertheless, an act of Parliament was required in the early 18th century (1704) to overrule court decisions holding that the gold smiths notes, despite the [...] "customs of merchants", were not negotiable.|$|R

5000|$|Until 1910 banks could issue {{private bank}} notes, except in Queensland which issued {{treasury}} notes (1866-1869) and banknotes (1893-1910) which were legal tender in Queensland. Private bank notes were not legal tender {{except for a}} brief period in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue or other provisions {{for the protection of the}} public. Queensland treasury notes were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Australian Notes Act 1910 prohibited the circulation of state notes as money and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 imposed a tax of 10% per annum on 'all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth ... and not redeemed'. These Acts put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 expressly prohibits persons from issuing bills or <b>notes</b> <b>payable</b> to bearer on demand and intended for circulation. In 1910, the Australian pound was issued and was the legal tender in Australia.|$|R
