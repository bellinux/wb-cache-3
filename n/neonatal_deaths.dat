5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and <b>neonatal</b> <b>deaths</b> per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> <b>death</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} elements of nursing and midwifery practice and health professionals supporting parents following such a loss often develop their skills in bereavement care through experience and modelling from experienced peers. For student nurses and midwives who have limited exposure to <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> during their clinical experiences, developing the skills to support bereaved parents is a priority during their undergraduate education. Clinical simulations can aid student learning in this complex area of clinical practice and assist them to engage effectively in support for bereaved parents. This paper reports on a qualitative study where the use of neonatal resuscitation simulation is used to prepare a group of undergraduate (double degree) nurse midwives to support bereaved parents surrounding <b>neonatal</b> <b>death.</b> The findings indicate that this simulation can assist students to develop and reflect upon their bereavement support skills in the context of unexpected <b>neonatal</b> <b>death.</b> They also point to the need for equipping students with self care strategies to manage their personal responses to the highly emotive context of <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> and supporting the bereaved mother.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the preterm birth rate, neonatal body weight and causes of total early <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> at Siriraj Hospital for 7 -year period (2002 - 2008). Materials and Methods: The medical records of preterm birth and neonatal body weight at Siriraj Hospital during 2002 - 2008 were collected and analyzed. Results: During 7 -year period, 2002 - 2008, the total birth rate was decreased steadily from 2002 - 2006, but was increased suddenly in 2007 then decreased slightly in 2008. The rate of preterm birth was increased steadily from 2004 to 2008 (9. 44 %- 12. 98 %). The rate of threatened preterm labor was constantly between 1. 20 - 1. 78 %. Among preterm birth, {{low birth weight}} infant was mostly found except in the year 2003. Early <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> was mostly caused from fetal abnormality while sepsis and chromosome abnormality were the lowest causes of fetal <b>death.</b> Trend of <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> from prematurity had continuously decline and no early <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> in year 2008. Conclusion: Regarding to 7 -year review, the preterm birth rate was consistent during 7 years while premature baby was almost survived.

500|$|Women's {{reproductive}} {{and sexual}} health {{has a distinct}} difference compared to men's health. Even in developed countries pregnancy and childbirth are associated with substantial risks to women with maternal mortality accounting {{for more than a}} quarter of a million deaths per year, with large gaps between the developing and developed countries. Comorbidity from other non reproductive disease such as cardiovascular disease [...] contribute to both the mortality and morbidity of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Sexually transmitted infections [...] have serious consequences for women and infants, with mother-to-child transmission leading to outcomes such as stillbirths and <b>neonatal</b> <b>deaths,</b> and pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility. In addition infertility from many other causes, birth control, unplanned pregnancy, unconsensual sexual activity and the struggle for access to abortion create other burdens for women.|$|E
2500|$|Neonatal tetanus {{is a form}} of {{generalized}} tetanus {{that occurs}} in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated. [...] If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire passive immunity and are thus protected. [...] It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument. [...] As of 1998 neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all <b>neonatal</b> <b>deaths.</b> In 2010 the worldwide death toll was 58,000 newborns. [...] As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013 the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries. [...] Neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries.|$|E

2500|$|Landfill {{sites have}} been shown to have adverse effects on fetal development. [...] Extensive {{research}} has been shown that landfills have several negative effects on babies born to mothers living near landfill sites: low birth weight, birth defects, spontaneous abortion, and fetal and infant mortality. [...] Studies done around the Love Canal site near Niagara Falls and the Lipari Landfill in New Jersey have shown a higher proportion of low birth babies than communities farther away from landfills. [...] A study done in California showed a positive correlation between time and quantity of dumping and low birth weights and <b>neonatal</b> <b>deaths.</b> [...] A study in the United Kingdom showed a correspondence between pregnant women living near landfill sites and an increased risk of congenital disorders, such as neural tube defects, hypospadias, epispadia, and abdominal wall defects, such as gastroschisis and exomphalos. [...] A study conducted on a Welsh community also showed an increase incidence of gastroschisis. [...] Another study was done on twenty-one European hazardous waste sites and showed that those living within three kilometers had an increased risk of giving birth to infants with birth defects and that as distance from the land increased, the risk decreased. [...] These birth defects included neural tube defects, malformations of the cardiac septa, anomalies of arteries and veins, and chromosomal anomalies. Looking at communities that live near landfill sites brings up environmental justice. [...] A vast majority of sites are located near poor, mostly black, communities. [...] For example, between the early 1920s and 1978, about 25% of Houston’s population was black. [...] However, over 80% of landfills and incinerators during this time were located in these black communities.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} possible {{differences in}} emotional impact on parents following either a deliberate intrauterine <b>death</b> or a <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> in extremely preterm growth retarded infants. DESIGN: Retrospectively matched study by audiotaped semi-structured interview, 3 - 9 {{years after the}} perinatal loss. RESULTS: Nineteen couples (ten in the intrauterine death group and nine in the <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> group) consented to participate. More than 50 % of the intrauterine death group couples could not share or discuss their emotions. Most partners in this group did not feel {{the loss of their}} own child. Discongruent grieving between partners was more pronounced in the intrauterine death group and could be identified as a risk factor for prolonged and abnormal grief reactions. Four couples (three in the intrauterine death group and one in the <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> group) developed long-term emotional disturbance and psychosocial problems. Long-term follow-up in both groups was failing remarkably. CONCLUSION: Assimilating a non-intervention policy followed by fetal death requires different skills and is more complicated than grief support around an early <b>neonatal</b> <b>death.</b> Follow-up is essential to identify the couple 'at risk' and to mobilize extra suppor...|$|R
40|$|Although {{numerous}} studies have found higher rates of abortion and still births following consanguinity (familial marriages), {{the question of whether}} consanguinity significantly increases the risk of <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> has inadequately been addressed. This study aims to evaluate familial marriage effects on <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> in rural areas in Iran. In this nested case-control study, 6900 newbornswho were born in rural areas of Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad Province (South-West of Iran) were followed till the end of neonatal period, and <b>neonatal</b> <b>death</b> was the outcome of interest. Subsequently 97 cases and 97 controls were selected in study cohort by using risk set sampling model. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were estimated by usinga conditional logistic regression model. In the final model, prematurity (OR = 5. 57), low birthweight (LBW) (OR = 7. 68), consanguinity (first cousins) (OR = 5. 23), C-section (OR = 7. 27), birth rank more than 3 (OR = 6. 95) and birthsinterval less than 24 months (OR = 4. 65) showed significant statistical association with neonatal mortality (p < 0. 05).
