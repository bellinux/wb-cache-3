25|$|A {{study from}} 2013 {{provided}} brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and {{presented it to}} 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.|$|E
2500|$|Many genetic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions and Druze, Palestinians, Bedouin, Lebanese and other Levantines cluster near one another genetically. Many studies have found that Jews and Palestinians are closer to each other than the Palestinians or European Jews are to non-Jewish Europeans or Africans. They also found substantial genetic overlap between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. A small but statistically significant difference was found in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities, However, a highly distinct cluster was found in Palestinian haplotypes. 32% of the 143 Arab Y-chromosomes studied belonged to this [...] "I Arab clade", which contained only one non-Arab chromosome, that of a Sephardic Jew. This could possibly be attributed to the geographical isolation of the Jews or to the immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium. The Druze people, a [...] "genetic sanctuary" [...] for the diversity of the Near East in antiquity, have been found in genetic studies to be the closest to Jews of the populations in the Levant. Lebanese also cluster closely with Jewish ethnic groups, closer than Syrians and Palestinians, according to a 2010 study by Behar et al. The single archeogenetic study of the southern Levant (Salamon et al., 2010) explored mtDNA haplogroups of Chalcolithic period from a cave in the Judean Desert.|$|E

Nebel proposed that [...] "part, or perhaps the majority" [...] of Muslim Palestinians descend from [...] "local inhabitants, mainly Christians and Jews, who had converted after the Islamic conquest in the seventh century AD". In a genetic study of Y-chromosomal STRs in two populations from Israel and the Palestinian Authority Area: Christian and Muslim Palestinians showed genetic differences. The majority of Palestinian Christians (31.82%) were a subclade of E1b1b, followed by G2a (11.36%), and J1 (9.09%). The majority of Palestinian Muslims were haplogroup J1 (37.82%) followed by E1b1b (19.33%), and T (5.88%). The study sample consisted of 44 Palestinian Christians and 119 Palestinian Muslims.|$|E

50|$|Manipulating single {{cells is}} {{important}} to many biological studies, such as in controlling the cellular microenvironment and isolating specific cells of interest. Acoustic tweezers has been demonstrated to manipulate each individual cell with micrometer-level resolution. Cells generally have a diameter of 10-20 μm. To meet the resolution requirements of manipulating single cells, short-wavelength acoustic waves should be employed. In this case, surface acoustic wave (SAW) is a more favored option than bulk acoustic wave (BAW) as it allows using shorter-wavelength acoustic waves (normally less than 200 μm). Ding et al. reported a surface standing acoustic wave (SSAW) microdevice that is able to manipulate single cells with prescribed paths. Fig.18 shows that the movement traces of single cells can be controlled to form the letter sequences PNAS and PSU, respectively. The working principle of the device lies in the controlled movement of pressure nodes in a SSAW field. Ding et al. employed chirped interdigital transducers (IDTs) {{that are able to}} generate SSAWs with adjustable positions of pressure nodes. By simply changing the input frequency, the position of pressure nodes can be changed. Ding et al. also showed that not only micrometer-sized cells, but also the millimeter-sized microorganism C. elegan can be manipulated with the same manner. In this manner, it can be programmed to move single cells along any desired paths. It should be noted that Ding et al. also examined cell metabolism and proliferation after the acoustic treatment. <b>No</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> comparing to the control group, indicating the non-invasive nature of acoustic base manipulation. In addition to using chirped IDTs, phase shift based single particle/cell manipulation has also been reported.|$|E
