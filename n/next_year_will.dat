Producer Jimmy Jam stated, [...] "This record now, even though {{it may not be the}} best of times in her personal life, she feels that the future is bright... She's excited about music and about life in general. She's excited about what the <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> hold for her, and that's the tone she's set for herself and [...]" [...] Jam added, [...] "In the history of Janet, the records that are the happy records, that make people smile, have always traditionally been the more successful records.. going back as far to songs like 'When I Think of You' to 'Doesn't Really Matter.' This continues that tradition, with kind of a nod to the dance music of the '80s." [...] Virgin Records' president Roy Cooper stated, [...] "The new album is very bright, it's very upbeat and dynamic. She wanted to make an album that was rhythmically strong as well as melodically strong. She also wanted as explosive and strong a start as possible, and this certainly qualifies."

60|$|And {{what is true}} of the {{taxation}} of manufactured articles as {{a foundation}} for any fiscal policy is true still more of the taxation of food, and of no country is it so true as of this island. For if you were ever engaged in a war which rendered the highways of the ocean insecure the rise in prices would be such that all food taxes would have to be swept away at once by any Government which desired to use the whole vigour of its people in prosecuting the war.

60|$|The {{discovery}} {{of gold in}} the Black Hills, {{a portion of the}} Sioux Reservation, has had the effect to induce a large emigration of miners to that point.

The negotiations for the relinquishment of the gold fields having failed, it will be necessary for Congress to adopt some measures to relieve the embarrassment growing out of the causes named.

60|$|Homer's Epos, it is remarked, {{is like a}} Bas-relief sculpture: it {{does not}} conclude, but merely ceases. Such, indeed, is the Epos of Universal History itself. Directorates, Consulates, Emperorships, Restorations, Citizen-Kingships succeed this Business in due series, in due genesis {{one out of the}} other. Nevertheless the First-parent of all these may be said to have gone to air in the way we see. A Baboeuf Insurrection, <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>will</b> die in the birth; stifled by the Soldiery. A Senate, if tinged with Royalism, can be purged by the Soldiery; and an Eighteenth of Fructidor transacted by the mere shew of bayonets. (Moniteur, du 5 Septembre 1797.) Nay Soldiers' bayonets can be used a posteriori on a Senate, and make it leap out of window,--still bloodless; and produce an Eighteenth of Brumaire. (9th November 1799, Choix des Rapports, xvii. 1-96.) Such changes must happen: but they are managed by intriguings, caballings, and then by orderly word of command; almost like mere changes of Ministry. Not in general by sacred right of Insurrection, but by milder methods growing ever milder, shall the Events of French history be {{henceforth}} brought to pass.|$|E
60|$|Sir,--Among men of Genius, and {{especially}} among Poets, {{there are some}} to whom we turn with a peculiar and unfeigned affection; there are others whom we admire rather than love. By some we are won with our will, by others conquered against our desire. It has been your peculiar fortune to capture the hearts of a whole people--a people not usually prone to praise, but devoted with a personal and patriotic loyalty {{to you and to}} your reputation. In you every Scot who is a Scot sees, admires, and compliments Himself, his ideal self--independent, fond of whisky, fonder of the lassies; you are the true representative of him and of his nation. <b>Next</b> <b>year</b> <b>will</b> be the hundredth since the press of Kilmarnock brought to light its solitary masterpiece, your Poems; and next year, therefore, methinks, the revenue will receive a welcome accession from the abundance of whisky drunk in your honour. It is a cruel thing for any of your countrymen to feel that, where all the rest love, he can only admire; where all the rest are idolators, he may not bend the knee; but stands apart and beats upon his breast, observing, not adoring--a critic. Yet to some of us--petty souls, perhaps, and envious--that loud indiscriminating praise of 'Robbie Burns' (for so they style you in their Change-house familiarity) has long been ungrateful; and, among the treasures of your songs, we venture to select and even to reject. So it must be! We cannot all love Haggis, nor 'painch, tripe, and thairm,' and all those rural dainties which you celebrate as 'warm-reekin, rich!' 'Rather too rich,' as the Young Lady said on an occasion recorded by Sam Weller.|$|E
