Thus, it is ensured that the actual costs are deducted (<b>net</b> <b>principle).</b> Tax arbitrage is not possible because business expenses do reduce the income of all companies proportionately to their respective share of the overall profit. Companies cannot claim expenses in a high-tax jurisdiction, while profits are taxed in low-tax jurisdictions. However, tax arbitrage is possible in the case of subsidiaries located in third countries. Consequently, the European Commission proposes to introduce an anti-abuse rule which limits the interest deductibility.|$|E

40|$|Because {{broadband}} {{is widely}} {{believed to be a}} precondition for economic prosperity and social progress, many governments have been improving the broadband environments in their respective countries. Net neutrality, which in its most basic form requires "equal" treatment for all Internet traffic, should be considered only as a means of improving broadband rather than as a stand-alone policy goal. Net neutrality has been a major topic of interest for telecom regulators in developed nations for nearly a decade. However, treating net neutrality as the ultimate target may prevent a more important goal from being achieved. Policy targets and priorities should be tailored to the broadband development stage of each market. In this study, the author argues that a strict <b>net</b> neutrality <b>principle</b> is not optimal and should be relaxed to accommodate the local needs of individual markets and reflect their development stages. In addition, discussion, especially in developed nations, should focus not on quality-of-service-based net neutrality but on quality-of-experience for optimal resource allocation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring {{a hybrid}} system {{subjected}} to human actions needs both an {{estimation of the}} system state and {{an analysis of the}} possible conflicts in order to guarantee a safe behavior of the system. Such a monitoring principle is presented in this paper. The estimation of the hybrid system state is performed using the particle Petri net model. Then the estimated state is analysed by checking its consistency with respect to the reachable markings of the Petri <b>net.</b> The <b>principle</b> is applied to aircraft pilot’s activity tracking and conflict detection. 1 Conflict Detection in Hybrid Systems Monitoring hybrid systems is a major topic of research in complex applications. Indeed most of the real systems have a hybrid behavior – i. e. a continuous/discrete evolution of the state – induced both by the dynamics of the system (discontinuities, linear approximations) and by external actions that may be performed by a human operator. Moreover a real system is sensitive to environment modifications such as noises, defects [...] . Therefore such a system need...|$|R

In 2004, The Madison River Communications company was fined US$15,000 by the FCC for restricting their customer’s access to Vonage which was rivaling their own services. AT&T was also caught limiting access to FaceTime, so only those users who paid for the new shared data plans could access the application.
