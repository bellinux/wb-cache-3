500|$|Today, {{commercial}} traffic, {{apart from}} tour boats, has ceased above {{the port of}} Boston (The Haven) and only pleasure craft carry on through the lock at the Grand Sluice into the Witham. Although the lock is only [...] long, {{it is possible for}} longer boats to pass through it at certain states of the tide. Unlike many such sea locks, the reverse-facing gates close on every tide, as the <b>normal</b> <b>high</b> tide <b>water</b> level is <b>higher</b> than the level of the river, while at low tides there is insufficient water in the Haven to allow exit from the lock. Passage is therefore restricted to a brief period approximately two hours before or after <b>high</b> <b>water.</b> It is still possible to navigate many of the drains in small vessels, and a new lock, completed in December 2008, provides entry to the South Forty-Foot Drain from below the Grand Sluice so that vessels will be able to reach the Fens without venturing out to the Wash as part of the Fens Waterways Link.|$|R
40|$|A hydrodynamic-based storm {{severity}} {{scale that}} ranks the damage {{potential of a}} storm at a given coastal area is developed. Seventeen tropical and extratropical storm events at 113 different locations on the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico are examined {{in order to create}} and verify a Storm Severity Index Model (SSIM). The results from the SSIM are then used to create a location-based storm severity scale titled the Twenty-Four Point Storm Severity Scale. The Twenty-Four Point Scale is based on three subsets of factors. The first is the energy flux above the <b>normal</b> mean <b>high</b> <b>water</b> line that the storm produces, the second is the amount of overwash due to wave-induced runup, and the third is the inundation due to surge-induced flooding that occurs during the event. The advantage of this methodology is that it enables the level of risk associated with a storm to be examined for a specific region, rather than having a single broad value define the entire event. Although, the index is intended for use on sandy beaches with or without dunes, the general methodology could be extended to armored beaches...|$|R

40|$|At {{the moment}} the {{occurrence}} of Juncus mutabilis and J. capitatus is mainly determined by activities of man (excavations) and by extreme fluctuations in climatic factors (the occurrence of very low water levels in summer). In the summer of 1972 and 1973 the water levels {{on the island of}} Terschelling were very low. As a consequence some small dune lakes were left dry and J. mutabilis was growing abundantly in two of them, where previously it was absent or of sporadic occurrence. In 1972 and 1973 J. mutabilis was also recorded from two other places, where it occurs in small numbers each year. In the nature reserve Koegelwieck on Terschelling excavation, followed by a lowering of the water level, the land remaining dry, resulted in a new ephemeral habitat of Juncus mutabilis and J. capitatus. In the Netherlands this is the last known locality of J. capitatus; in the former century this species was growing in two other dune slacks on Terschelling. In the dune area on the mainland near Schoorl, province of North-Holland (dunes poor in lime, as is the case at Terschelling), J. mutabilis was growing in a recent excavation. The species has only been found during years in which extremely low water levels occurred. In years with a <b>normal</b> or <b>high</b> <b>water</b> level not a single plant was growing there...|$|R

50|$|Alternative {{sump pump}} {{systems can be}} driven by {{municipal}} water pressure. Water-powered sump pumps are similar to backup-battery-driven systems with a separate pump, float and check valves. During installation, the float is mounted in the sump pit above the <b>normal</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> mark. Under normal conditions, your main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful suction force which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the sump and ejecting it outdoors.

40|$|Drainage and Flood Protection/Flood Control Techniques. (204. 4) The digital Cuny Archive {{was made}} {{available}} {{in part through}} funding assistance from USAID. Seawalls are used primarily to protect areas {{in the rear of}} the beach against the effect of heavy storm action. They are necessarily massive and expensive. Seawalls limit the shoreward movement of the high water line, but under severe wave action they generally promote removal of sand from the beach by wave wash. Under normal wave action, this sand may be returned to the beach but the seawall has no capacity to retain the sand. The function of a seawall is to protect property and it has no value in stabilizing the beach. The layout of seawalls is generally parallel to the shore. They should be placed as far back of the <b>normal</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> line as the development in the rear will economically permit. The minimum distance from the high water line is dependent on the width of beach required. The alignment of seawalls should be as straight as possible. Necessary changes in direction should be accomplished by gradual smooth curves to avoid concentration of wave forces at angles...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{hydrology}} of peatland in Newfoundland despite the extensive tracts of peatland found there. This thesis attemtps to characterize the hydroclimatology of the Old Sams River (2. 55 km²), a small peatland-dominated catchment on the southern Avalon Peninsula. [...] Detailed hydrometeorological investigations were carried out through a 76 -day study period to monitor the transition from wet to dry hydrometeorological conditions typically experienced in spring and summer. The study undertakes a comparative analysis of these data with those of two gauged catchments also located on the Avalon Peninsula, Northwest Brook (53. 3 km²) and Northeast Pond River (3. 63 km²), both of which have much less peatland. [...] Evaluation of the seasonal hydroclimatological representativeness of the study period demonstrates that all three catchments experienced a range of hydrometeorological conditions, undergoing a transition from warmer and wetter than normal conditions to much drier than normal conditions. [...] The analyses demonstrate that in comparison with that experienced at the other two catchments, under the drier than normal conditions {{in the latter part of}} the study period, the Old Sams River gradually released moisture which was stored in its peatlands. However, the hydroclimatology of the Old Sams River catchment is such that its peatlands seldom become sufficiently dry to enable them to act as a regulator of streamflow in this way. Under <b>normal</b> conditions, <b>high</b> <b>water</b> table persists year-round, causing the hydrologically-active layer to encourage rapid, spate-like streamflow response to precipitation. The hydroclimatological conditions at Old Sams River differ from those observed for other peatlands reported in the literature, where runoff can often cease for long periods under dry summer conditions. [...] The importance of the hydrologically active layer in the generation of runoff was demonstrated by the frequent occurrence of depressions in the recession phase of the hydrograph at Old Sams River. These appear to be directly related to the diurnal pattern in the meteorological parameters responsible for evapotranspiration. These evapotranspiration-induced depressions in the hydrograph resulted in a rapid decrease in discharge to a mid-day value between 60. 5 % and 91. 7 % of the previous overnight discharge, and was. 55. 1 % to 96. 7 % of the overnight recovery discharge.
