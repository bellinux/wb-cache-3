5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. The {{political}} climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the hardiness of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, that allowed him to cope so well with the accident.|$|E

25|$|Portuguese {{ordinary}} admissions {{are based}} in a competitive system of <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus,</b> different programmes have different exams needed for admission which may vary from one institution to another.|$|E
25|$|Medicine {{is one of}} the {{university}} faculties implementing <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> ("numero chiuso"): the overall number of medical students admitted every year is constant, as each medical school is assigned a maximum number of new admission per year by MIUR.|$|E
25|$|Yale, {{like other}} Ivy League schools, instituted {{policies}} in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus),</b> {{and was one of}} the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.|$|E
25|$|Right {{after graduating}} from High School with a Baccalaureat, any student can {{register}} at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). At the end of first year, an internal ranking examination takes place {{in each of these}} universities in order to implement the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus.</b>|$|E
25|$|First year {{consists}} {{mainly of}} theoretical classes such as biophysics and biochemistry, anatomy, ethics or histology. Passing first year is commonly considered as challenging and requires hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, the Université René Descartes welcomes about 2000 students in {{first year and}} only 300 after <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another study {{made by the}} University of Lisbon for its own {{students}} in the period 2003–2008, concluded that popular selective courses with restricted <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> and demanding high grades to the new applicants (examples include the university degrees of medicine, fine arts, and pharmacy), are mainly attained by students arrived from a wealthier background than that of those students enrolled at unpopular and less selective degree programmes and departments.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{entry to}} {{universities}} had been {{limited by the}} 1920 <b>Numerus</b> <b>Clausus</b> (closed number) Act, {{which was the first}} antisemitic legislation in 20th century Europe. The law limited Jewish university places to six percent, reflecting their representation within the population, and although the legislation was allowed to lapse eight years later, it affected Kastner's teenage political orientation, and he decided at the age of 15 to become a Zionist.|$|E
25|$|The Belgian medical {{education}} {{is much more}} based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first 3 years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in Flanders, prospective students have to pass an exam, {{as a result of}} the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus.</b> In the French-speaking part of Belgium, only the best students that pass the first year of the bachelor course in medicine are admitted to the second and third year.|$|E
25|$|Candidates {{approved}} {{go through}} a separate <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> or enroll directly {{at the discretion of}} the school's board. As what happens with the Concurso Nacional through the Exames Nacionais do Ensino Secundário (ENES), the Extraordinary Exam Process for over-23 years old candidates is more demanding and has a much higher selectiveness in public universities than in the public polytechnics. Humanities and other non-mathematical-intensive fields have also much higher admission rates than classical university engineerings, economics or medicine. This implies that almost all new students admitted by this extraordinary process enter a polytechnic institution, private institution, or humanities programmes.|$|E
25|$|Local {{admission}} restrictions: For {{degree programs}} where {{only a limited}} number of places is available (<b>numerus</b> <b>clausus,</b> often abbreviated NC), criteria by which applications will be evaluated differ from university to university and from program to program. Commonly used criteria include the final grade of the university entrance qualification (which takes into account the grades of the final exams as well as course grades), a weighted grade point average which increases the weight of relevant school subjects, interviews, motivational letters, letters of recommendation by previous professors, essays, relevant practical experience, and subject-specific entrance exams. Such restrictions are increasingly common at German universities.|$|E
25|$|Enrollment is limited; {{each year}} the {{institution}} establishes the number of places available. This is called the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus.</b> For the public institutions the exam scores count for the final evaluation, which includes the secondary school average marks. Then the students have to choose six institutions/courses they prefer to attend, in preferential order. The ones, who reach the marks needed to attend the desired institution/course, given the attributed vacant, will be admitted. This means that the students could not be admitted at its first or second choice, but be admitted at the third or even sixth choice.|$|E

25|$|About 4,500 Jews {{lived in}} Slovene areas before the mass transportations to the {{concentration}} camps in 1941. Many {{of them were}} refugees from neighboring Austria, {{while the number of}} Slovenian Jews with Yugoslav citizenship was much lower. According to the 1931 census, the Jewish community in the Drava Banovina (the administrative unit corresponding to the Yugoslav part of Slovenia) had less than 1,000 members, mostly concentrated in the easternmost Slovenian region of Prekmurje. In the late 1930s, anti-Jewish legislation was adopted by the pro-German regime of the Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović, supported by also by the largest political party in Slovenia, the conservative Slovene People's Party. The party's leader, Dr. Anton Korošec had a strong antisemitic discourse, and was instrumental in the introduction of the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> in all Yugoslav universities in 1938.|$|E
25|$|With the {{influence}} of the Endecja party growing, antisemitism gathered new momentum in Poland and was most felt in smaller towns and in spheres in which Jews came into direct contact with Poles, such as in Polish schools or on the sports field. Further academic harassment, such as the introduction of ghetto benches, which forced Jewish students to sit in sections of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them, anti-Jewish riots, and semi-official or unofficial quotas (<b>Numerus</b> <b>clausus)</b> introduced in 1937 in some universities, halved the number of Jews in Polish universities between independence (1918) and the late 1930s. The restrictions were so inclusive that – while the Jews made up 20.4% of the student body in 1928 – by 1937 their share was down to only 7.5%, out of the total population of 9.75% Jews in the country according to 1931 census.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, 118 of the 227 of Hubertia's living {{members were}} men in {{forestry}} (~1/2). Of these 118, 83 held {{a state or}} private forestry office {{in the area of}} what is Baden-Württemberg today, formed by combining the former states Baden and Württemberg during the post-war area in 1952. Hence, as there were roughly 240 forestry offices in the area of Baden-Württemberg in 1920, Hubertia had members managing about 1/3 of all the forestry offices in today's state borders. Köhler wanted to minimize this high number of Huberten. His first step was to establish a so-called <b>Numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> for forestry in Freiburg and determined personally about a prospective student's admission in person. During the following ten years, Köhler's selection had its effect on Hubertia's influence: While the fraternity provided 37 prospective forestry officers in 1920, the number fell to only six in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Access {{to public}} higher {{education}} institutions is subject to enrollment restrictions (<b>numerus</b> <b>clausus),</b> and students must compete for admission. Students who hold a diploma of secondary education (12th grade) or the equivalent, who meet all legal requirements, particularly exams in specific subjects in which minimum marks must be obtained, may apply. Any citizen over 23 years old {{who does not have}} the secondary education diploma (12th grade) can attempt to gain admission to a limited number of vacant places available, through special examination which includes an interview (Decree law: Decreto-Lei 64/2006, de 21 de Março). Public university's tuition fees are greater than polytechnics', and polytechnic weekend and evening classes are usually organized. For a large number of academic fields, undergraduate and graduate admission criteria and student evaluation in most public university institutions are usually more selective and demanding than in many private institutions or polytechnic institutions. Access to private {{higher education institutions}} is regulated by each institution.|$|E
25|$|Admission is {{strictly}} merit-based, {{and the university}} has several departments which are known for higher-than-average selectiveness. <b>Numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> is applied to select among competing applicants. To such study programmes like those of medicine, pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and architecture, admission is an extraordinarily difficult process, and demand a minimum grade point average from high school plus the entrance exams, that usually ranges from 170 to 200 (out of 200). Acceptance rates may vary significantly from faculty to faculty or from department to department. Foreign applicants usually {{make up more than}} 10 percent of the applicant pool, and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective state of origin or through bilateral protocols between the governments of Portugal and foreign governments. There are also a number of other extraordinary admission processes for older people (admission for candidates older than 23 years old), sportsmen, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), etc., which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each department or faculty.|$|E
25|$|An anti-Semitic {{campaign}} swept Romanian {{universities in}} the wake of World War I. In this context, at the time the 1920-1921 school year opened, Pușcariu expressed his concern that Jews were disproportionately represented in the Medicine and Law faculties. He suggested they congregated toward those subjects because of surer and more profitable career prospects, given the lack of doctors, administrators and magistrates in Romania's newly acquired provinces. A <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> was enacted in Hungary in September 1920, leading to a surge in Hungarian Jewish enrollment at Cluj. Prompted by the medical faculty's leadership, the university senate discussed introduction of a similar policy. In early 1921, students, later joined by cultural figures, began demanding that sociologist Eugen Ehrlich be fired from his professorship at Cernăuți. Ehrlich was a Jew who had converted to Catholicism, but the primary motivating factor in his firing {{appears to have been a}} campaign to fill teaching posts with ethnic Romanians. Ehrlich, who was rector in 1906-1907, had been instrumental in Pușcariu's being hired at the university. However, no one intervened on his behalf; not even Pușcariu tried to stop his benefactor's dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{education}} in Portugal {{is divided into}} two main subsystems: university and polytechnic education. It is provided in autonomous public universities, private universities, public or private university institutes, polytechnic institutions and higher {{education in}}stitutions of other types. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> is enforced through a national database on student admissions. In addition, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), international students, foreign students from the Lusosphere, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department. Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The oldest such institution, the University of Coimbra, was first established in Lisbon before moving to Coimbra. Historically, within the scope of the now defunct Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded in 1792 the oldest engineering school of Latin America (the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho), as well as the oldest medical college of Asia (the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de Goa) in 1842.|$|E
500|$|Dmowski had {{advocated}} emigration of {{the entire}} Jewish population of Poland as the solution to what he regarded as Poland's [...] "Jewish problem", and over time came to argue for increasing harsh measures against the Jewish minority, though he never explicitly suggested killing Jews. He opposed physical violence, arguing for the boycotts of Jewish businesses instead, later supplemented with their separation in the cultural area (through polices such as <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus).</b> Dmowski made anti-Semitism a central element in Endecja's radical nationalist outlook. Endecja's crusade against Jewish cultural values gained mounting intensity in antisemitism of the 1930s, {{but there were no}} major pogroms or violent attacks on the Jews in Poland until the German Nazis occupied Poland and made it their mission in 1939–44.|$|E
2500|$|Nationwide {{admission}} restrictions: In {{the subjects}} medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy, a nationwide <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> is in place. In these subjects, applications of Germans and foreigners who are legally treated like Germans (e.g., EU citizens) are handled centrally for all universities {{by a public}} trust (Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung). The following quotas are applied in this procedure: ...|$|E
2500|$|Anti-Jewish sentiments {{continued}} {{to be present in}} Poland, even after the country regained its independence.

2500|$|Horthy {{appointed}} Count Pál Teleki {{as prime}} minister in July 1920. His government issued a <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> law that limited the admission of [...] "political insecure elements" [...] (these were often Jews) to universities and took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 3,850km2 from the largest estates into small holdings in order to quiet rural discontent. Teleki's government resigned, however, after Charles, the former emperor of Austria and king of Hungary, attempted unsuccessfully to retake Hungary's throne in March 1921.|$|E

2500|$|In the winter-semester 2006/2007, the {{university}} offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus,</b> {{with an overall}} acceptance rate of 16.3%. Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%, 3.8%, 7.6% and 9.1% respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, {{admission}} to medical schools is currently administered {{jointly by the}} [...] (SfH), a centralized federal organization, and the universities themselves. The most important criterion for admission is the <b>Numerus</b> <b>clausus,</b> the final GPA scored by the applicant on the Abitur (highest secondary school diploma). However, {{in light of the}} recent gain in influence of medical schools in regards to applicant selection, additional criteria are being used to select students for admission. These criteria vary among medical faculties and the final Abitur GPA is always a core indicator and strongly influences admission. Admission remains highly competitive. A very small number of slots per semester are reserved for selected applicants which already hold a university degree (Zweitstudium) and for medical officer candidates (Sanitätsoffizieranwärter).|$|E
2500|$|By 1922-1923, as a nationalist, anti-democratic and anti-Semitic student {{movement}} centered around Corneliu Zelea Codreanu gained ascendancy, {{he was not}} at the forefront of its radical promoters, but rather figured among a group of moderate, respectable academic supporters who countenanced the agitators and lent them an air of general acceptance. In March 1923, he wrote an article applauding the 15,000 {{student movement}} participants; praising the cohesion they showed, rare for Romania, he claimed they represented [...] "a healthy and spontaneous reaction of the national preservation instinct". Addressing students from Bukovina, he called the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> something all those who wished the country well would endorse, for [...] "in our country [...] gained with so many sacrifices, we no longer have air to breathe; the invasion of the foreign element stifles us, chokes us".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the final}} report welcomed the {{expansion}} of higher education, correcting the prior situation of unequal and limited access, the World Bank did not favour further expansion: [...] "...the enrolment represents 8% of the 18–22 age group and could be considered adequate. ...In view of the rapidly increased university enrolments, which represent an uneconomical drain in the economy... gradual introduction of quantitative restraints" [...] (World Bank, 1977 Progress report). At the same time, the World Bank urged the Portuguese authorities to restrain enrolment quotas {{so as to make}} [...] "better use" [...] and rationalise the supply of higher education and improve the management of the system, namely in terms of accountability, coordination, and efficiency. Future expansions should be planned, taking into account manpower needs, and demographic and enrolment trends. Subsequently, the World Bank produced two [...] "Staff Appraisal Reports", which provided insights about the negotiations between the Bank's Mission and the Portuguese government, and further confirmed the Bank's priorities. In the first Report of Assessment (No. 1807-PO, 1978), the Bank insisted on three criteria: balancing the supply of higher education graduates with the economic needs of the country, developing a persistent and consistent policy towards vocational education, and upgrading teacher training programs. The Bank suggested that Portugal needed not only to train high level technicians but also middle level personnel (on a yearly basis: 1400 technicians with short cycle post-secondary education, 500 agricultural technicians and 6000 middle level managers). Subsequently, the government passed Decree-Law 397/77 of 17 September, which established a <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> for every university study programme and eliminated the threat to the new short vocational education programs – that without reducing the supply of engineering jobs, graduates of the technician training institutes would find employment too scarce. The World Bank was critical of the erratic policies toward the existing technical institutes, and of the excessive enrolment in university engineering programs and the lax approach on managing vacancy quotas, and raised the issue of diseconomies of scale in the system, suggesting that there were too many institutions with small dimensions. The government replied to the Bank’s demands with Decree-Law 513-T/79, which established a network of polytechnic institutes, including Higher Schools of Education. The main objectives of Polytechnic education were: to provide education with an applied and technical emphasis and strong vocational orientation, and for training intermediate-level technicians for industries, service companies and educational units (first cycle of basic education).|$|E
50|$|<b>Numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> is {{also used}} in law, {{property}} law in particular, as the principle that the system of estates allows {{only a limited number}} of property rights available in a legal system. The <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> principle has its roots in Roman law. In German law the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> principle has a constitutional foundation and limits property rights in their number (Typenzwang) and content (Typenfixierung). Other European states show equal doctrines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> ("closed number" [...] in Latin) {{is one of}} many {{methods used}} {{to limit the number of}} {{students}} who may study at a university. In many cases, the goal of the <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> is simply to limit the number of students to the maximum feasible in some particularly sought-after areas of studies. However, in some cases, <b>numerus</b> <b>clausus</b> policies were religious or racial quotas, both in intent and function.|$|E
