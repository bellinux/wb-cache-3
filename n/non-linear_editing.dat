5|$|Editing {{took two}} years; Paul Martin Smith started {{the process in}} England and focused on dialogue-heavy scenes. Ben Burttwho was also the film's sound editorwas {{responsible}} for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. <b>Non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999 and the following month the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.|$|E
5|$|The Broadcast and Video Production {{department}} {{is designed to}} teach students about the television industry. Using a hands-on method, students learn about all aspects of television from pre-production to production to post-production. The facility {{is made up of}} a working television studio, a large control room, six edit rooms (each equipped with both linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems), a radio station, and a normal classroom. Students in the program learn to produce everything from commercials and PSAs to dramas, news shows, and sporting events. The advanced classes produce a weekly news show, the Morning Buzz, which airs {{at the beginning of the}} day. The Broadcast and Video department supports the student-run radio station WRHS the Hive, the film club, and the yearly School House Rock concert.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{advancement}} is also {{changing the}} ways news is gathered and edited. The newsreel days are long gone. Reporters {{do not use}} film anymore. Television journalists are capturing images and sound on video and DV. Some stations even begin gathering and reporting news in high-definition television. Even editing and archiving systems are evolving, {{as more and more}} stations convert to <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems, and storing file footage on computer servers rather than tapes.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in {{preparation}} for digital and high-definition television broadcasting, ABS-CBN acquired server and post production technologies developed by EVS Broadcast Equipment, making ABS-CBN the first broadcaster in Southeast Asia to go tapeless. EVS provided ABS-CBN a 100 percent digital and <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> system and post production workflow as well as wireless access through a media access management system servers installed in outside broadcasting van. This will be integrated to technologies developed by Avid Technology, Snell, and Ruckus Wireless.|$|E
500|$|A {{technique}} {{common in}} cut scenes of video games, scripting consists of giving precise {{directions to the}} game engine. A filmmaker can work alone this way, as J. Thaddeus [...] "Mindcrime" [...] Skubis did in creating the nearly four-hour The Seal of Nehahra (2000), the longest work of machinima at the time. However, perfecting scripts can be time-consuming. Unless what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing is available, as in , changes {{may need to be}} verified in additional runs, and <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> may be difficult. In this respect, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd compare scripting to stop-motion animation. Another disadvantage is that, depending on the game, scripting capabilities may be limited or unavailable. Matinee, a machinima software tool included with Unreal Tournament 2004, popularized scripting in machinima.|$|E

2500|$|Other <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems {{indirectly}} support {{closed captioning}} only in Standard Definition line-21. Video files on the editing timeline must be composited with a line-21 VBI graphic layer {{known in the}} industry as a [...] "blackmovie" [...] with closed caption data. [...] Alternately, video editors working with the DV25 and DV50 firewire workflows must encode their DV [...]avi or [...]mov file with VAUX data which includes CEA-608 closed caption data.|$|E
2500|$|This new closed {{captioning}} workflow known as e-Captioning involves making a proxy video from the non-linear system to import into a third-party non-linear {{closed captioning}} software. Once the closed captioning software project is completed, it must export a closed caption file {{compatible with the}} <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> system. In the case of Final Cut Pro 7, three different file formats can be accepted: a [...]SCC file (Scenarist Closed Caption file) for Standard Definition video, a QuickTime 608 closed caption track (a special 608 coded track in the [...]mov file wrapper) for standard-definition video, and finally a QuickTime 708 closed caption track (a special 708 coded track in the [...]mov file wrapper) for high-definition video output.|$|E
