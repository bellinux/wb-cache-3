25|$|Introduced in 1992, the {{competition}} replaced the European Champion Clubs' Cup, or simply European Cup, which had run since 1955, adding a group stage to {{the competition}} and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries. The pre-1992 competition was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champion club of each country. During the 1990s, the format was expanded, incorporating a round-robin group stage to include clubs that finished runner-up of some nations' top-level league. While most of Europe's national leagues can still only enter their national league champion, Europe's strongest national leagues now provide up to four teams for the competition, and will provide up to five teams from the 2015–16 season onwards.

30|$|In {{the cluster}} {{formation}} process, a single-hop communication is formed between {{all levels of}} clusters, based upon link correlation [16]. The key factor in shaping the link correlation is packet reception rate (PRR) [24, 25] which are determined using conditional packet reception probability (CPRP). Initially, each node uses link correlation to choose its cluster head at the next hierarchy level. The nodes will transmit a sequence of ‘hello’ messages to the <b>next-level</b> nodes in short-time duration. ‘t’ {{is the number of}} messages transmitted. The hello messages consist of a sender ID and packet number. The <b>next-level</b> nodes store the hello messages in a separate bitmap format from all possible nodes of a sub-hierarchy level. The bitmap formats consist of 1  s and 0  s for the message reception status as success and failure arranged upon the packet number. After receiving ‘t’ hello messages, the <b>next-level</b> nodes will transmit its bitmap as a packet in the form of node ID, sender ID, and bitmap. The nodes will receive the packet sent from <b>next-level</b> nodes when sender ID in the bitmap packet matches with it, for finding the link correlation using CPRP. The nodes choose its cluster head in the next hierarchy level that is having high link correlation with it. By using this link correlation technique, hierarchies of clusters are formed up to level-k. After establishing a cluster hierarchy, the stored bitmap is cleared to save memory.|$|E

30|$|If the CH at {{each level}} {{randomly}} transmits to its <b>next-level</b> CH, then data loss will occur due to collision. For avoiding data collision, the CH {{at each level}} communicates with the corresponding <b>next-level</b> CH only in its allocated TDMA time slot. Other than the level-k CH, most of the CH incorporates DA {{to reduce the amount}} of data for transmission if needed. Data aggregation [18 – 20] is a suppression technique for removing redundant data that are created due to large deployment of sensor nodes. Since DA is a time-consuming process, the data collection and aggregation are always performed other than its own TDMA time slot with successive cluster heads. For a level-k hierarchy, the data packets are transmitted in a multi-hop communication between cluster heads to reach the base station. This multipath forwarding between cluster heads increases the network traffic. A random linear (RL) [21 – 23] network coding used in level-k cluster heads reduces the data traffic amount, thus increasing the network lifetime.|$|E
