5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust.

Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy is <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 70,000 times the mass of the Sun.
