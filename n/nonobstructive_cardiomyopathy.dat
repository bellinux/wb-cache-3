40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} whether plasma brain natriuretic peptide {{levels are}} abnormally elevated in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy {{compared with other}} cardiac diseases. Background. We previously reported that plasma brain and atrial natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods. We compared plasma concentrations of brain and atrial natriuretic peptide and hemodynamic and echocardiographic data in 50 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (n = 15, mean [±SD] intraventricular pressure gradient 37 ± 16 mm Hg), hypertrophic <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (n = 15), aortic stenosis (n = 10, mean pressure gradient 41 ± 18 mm Hg) and hypertensive heart disease (n = 10, mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure 203 ± 16 / 108 ± 11 mm Hg, respectively) and 10 normal subjects. Results. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels {{were higher in the}} hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy group (397. 1 ± 167. 8 pg/ml*) than in the hypertrophic <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (60. 0 ± 48. 1 pg/ml*†), hypertensive heart disease (53. 9 ± 31. 4 pg/ml*†), aortic stenosis (75. 4 ± 54. 3 pg/ml*†) and normal groups (9. 8 ± 6. 4 pg/ml† [* p < 0. 05 vs. normal group, †p < 0. 05 vs. hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy group]). Although plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were higher in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy group than the other patient groups, the brain/atrial natriuretic peptide ratio in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy group was higher (4. 5 ± 2. 3) than those in the other three patient groups (1. 1 to 1. 4) and the normal group (0. 7 ± 0. 5). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index were similar among the four patient groups. The interventricular septal thickness and the ratio of interventricular septal thickness to left ventricular posterior wall thickness were similar between the hypertrophic obstructive and <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> groups. Conclusions. Abnormal elevations of plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels are difficult to explain on the basis of hemodynamic and echocardiographic data and are a special feature of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} unique heteroplasmic T-to-C {{transition}} at nucleotide 9997 in the mitochondrial tRNA(glycine) gene in a multiplex family who manifested <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> The degree of mtDNA heteroplasmy generally {{correlated with the}} severity of the symptoms. This T-to-C transition disrupts hydrogen bonding in the region adjacent to the acceptor stem of the tRNA molecule. The thymine residue at position 9997 is highly conserved in mammals, as well as in various vertebrates and invertebrates. A PCR diagnostic test for the presence of the 9997 T-to-C transition revealed that the base change was always present in high proportion in affected family members, not present in unaffected family members, and never present in control subjects from various ethnic groups (25 groups sampled, 42 individuals), thus ruling out the possibility that this change represents a polymorphic variant in the general population. The degree of heteroplasmy in lymphoblast cultures also correlated with the level of enzyme activity present for cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) and succinate cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complexes II and III). The absence of previously reported mtDNA mutations associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was verified by both PCR diagnostic procedures and sequence analysis. All mitochondrial tRNA genes, as well as genes encoding ATPase subunits 6 and 8, were sequenced and found not to possess base changes consistent with the clinical profile. More detailed biochemical and molecular biological investigations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sanfilippo A syndrome, {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} type IIIA, {{is caused}} by a deficiency of heparan sulphamidase activity, and usually presents in childhood with neurodegeneration leading to death in teenage years. Visceral symptoms are limited to coarsening and diarrhea. We now describe an adult patient who presented with cardiomyopathy. At age 45 years she had hypertension, and the next year she developed a progressively worsening cardiomyopathy with prominent apical hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation. At age 53, she had severe concentric hypertrophic <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> in both ventricles. There was no coarsening of features. Neurologic function, skeleton, cornea, liver, and spleen were normal. Percutaneous endomyocardial biopsy showed ballooned cardiomyocytes with storage vacuoles, containing acid mucopolysaccharides. Leucocytes, uterus, and brain biopsy did not show this storage material. There was a slight increase in total urine mucopolysaccharides, with an increased proportion of heparan sulfates. Heparan sulphamidase activity was deficient in leukocytes and heparan sulphamidase protein and activity were reduced in cultured fibroblasts. No mutations were identified after sequencing of the heparan sulphamidase gene at the cDNA and the genomic level. This new clinical presentation expands the clinical spectrum of Sanfilippo A syndrome to include a primary visceral presentation of cardiomyopathy without neurologic symptoms in the adult. The late onset {{may be related to the}} residual heparan sulphamidase activity. The genetic basis of this new variant is still unclear. Physicians evaluating adults must remain aware of possible new adult presentations of storage conditions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a genetic}} disorder with {{the prevalence of}} 1 in 500 globally. HCM is clinically characterized by thickening of {{the wall of the}} heart, predominantly left ventricle (LV), and interventricular septum (IVS). Our study aims to report the demographical, clinical and genetic profile of Indian HCM patients. Methods: HCM patients were recruited on the basis of WHO criteria. The clinical phenotypes were analyzed using electrocardiography, two-dimensional electrocardiography, and hotspot region of the MYH 7 gene was sequenced for all patients as well as for controls. Results: There were 59 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HCM with a preponderance of disease in males with a ratio (men, women) of 5. 5 : 1. Average age of onset of the disease was late 30 s (39. 2 ± 14. 5) with familial HCM accounting for 18 % (n = 9) for total HCM families (n = 50). Nonobstructive kind of HCM was more prevalent as compared to obstructive HCM (66. 1 % vs. 33. 9 %). Average posterior wall LV thickness of the HCM patients was 16 ± 4. 8 mm and IVS thickness was 21 ± 8. 3 mm with familial patients having greater wall thickness as compared to sporadic patients. Sequencing of hotspot region of MYH 7 identified three mutations in three different patients. Two mutations were found to be segregating in familial cases. Conclusion: HCM is more prevalent in males with a predominance of hypertrophic <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> form. Eighteen percent of cases were familial and showed an early onset of the disease and worse prognosis as compared to sporadic cases. Hotspot sequencing of MYH 7 only explains 6 % of its genetic basis. More of the candidate genes need to be screened through advanced techniques like next generation sequencing to identify the causal genes which could make us understand the mechanistic pathways...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{amyloidosis}} {{is caused}} by amyloid deposits derived from different human plasma proteins. It can lead to cardiac conduction disturbances, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and low output heart failure. The heart is variably involved during the development of systemic amyloidosis {{and seems to be}} more frequently affected in immunoglobulin (primary) than in reactive (secondary) amyloidosis. Amyloid is common in the elderly. Isolated atrial amyloid, for which a major subunit is the atrial natriuretic peptide, seems to be three times more frequent than senile cardiac amyloid, which is derived from normal prealbumin (transthyretin). Like polyneuropathy, cardiac amyloidosis is a prominent clinical feature of hereditary amyloidosis, namely of the autosomal dominant transthyretin (TTR) type. All 28 cases of TTR amyloidoses reported so far were heterozygotes for a single nucleotide change in the gene for TTR that resulted in amino acid substitutions in the mature protein. A new TTR genetic variant is reported in a German family where the index patient presented at the age of 63 with anginal pain and arrhythmia. Electrocardiography was suggestive of a pseudoinfarction pattern, and echocardiography and cardiac catheterisation showed signs of hypertrophic <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> with increased ventricular filling pressures and a prominent "a" wave. Amyloid of the TTR type was identified by immunohistochemistry in the endomyocardial biopsy specimen. Hybrid isoelectric focusing established heterozygosity by showing normal TTR protein and an electrically neutral TTR variant differing from all known TTR variants so far. The patient died in an accident before investigations were complete. Electrophoretic analysis of the plasma from his first degree relatives (son, daughter, brother, and mother) identified the asymptomatic 22 year old son as an apparently heterozygous carrier of the mutant TTR protein. Comparative tryptic peptide mapping and sequencing showed that isoleucine at position 68 of the amino acid sequence was replaced by leucine...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the left {{ventricular}} function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), mechanocardiographic findings were analyzed in 25 cases of HCM and 35 normal subjects. Based on {{the presence or absence}} of pressure gradient (PG) and hypertension, the patients were divided into 3 groups, i. e., 14 cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), 5 cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with hypertension (HOCM with HT) and 6 cases of hypertrophic <b>nonobstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (nonobst. HCM). The results were as follows: 1) The contour of the carotid pulse tracing (CPT) was divided into four types (three types of bisferiens pulse; A, B and C and no bisferiens pulse; D). The bisferiens pulse existed in 20 out of 25 cases of HCM, and PG was found in descending order, type A, B and C. Since all types, A, B and C, were observed in nonobst. HCM, it seems that the bisferiens pulse is not caused by left ventricular outflow-tract-stenosis alone. The systolic second wave (SSW) in the apexcardiogram (ACG) at rest or following isoproterenol (IP) infusion was found in 12 cases, including 3 cases of nonobst. HCM. Therefore, it was concluded that the SSW was not pathognomonic in HOCM. The bulge and absence of the rapid filling wave (RFW) were found in 22 cases and 17 out of 25 cases of HCM, respectively. These results suggested the existence of asynergy and a decrease in left ventricular compliance in HCM. 2) The "a/T" ratio showed markedly higher values in HOCM, HOCM with HT and nonobst. HCM, when compared with normal subjects, but no significant differences were observed among the three groups of HCM. 3) "t-time" (the time from initial upstroke (U-point) to one half of the total height of CPT) was significantly shortened in HOCM, but not significantly changed in either HOCM with HT or nonobst. HCM, when compared with normal subjects. The results suggested the presence of the hyperkinetic state during the initial ejection phase in HOCM. This was supported by the fact that the isovolumetric contraction period (ICP) was shortened significantly in HOCM. ETc was significantly shortened, PEPc lengthened and PEP/ET increased in nonobst. HCM. These results suggested that there might be an inflow disturbance into the left ventricle due to a decrease of left ventriccular compliance and the decrease of the stroke volume in nonobst. HCM. 4) Following IP infusion, the changes in ETc increased significantly in HOCM, while they decreased in normal subjects, which suggested that left ventricular outflow tract stenosis might be augumented by the inotropic action of IP...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{patients}} with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> and only mild localized {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} who had severe symptoms of cardiac failure are described. During a mean follow-up period of 7 years, 6 of these 10 patients showed {{a substantial increase in}} left ventricular internal dimension (6 to 15 mm, mean 10) as assessed with M-mode echocardiography, although absolute left ventricular cavity size remained within normal limits in 5 of the 6. Four patients demonstrated substantial septal thinning (5 to 14 mm, mean 8). Left ventricular diastolic function, assessed by radionuclide angiography in nine patients, was impaired in eight who showed decreased peak filling rate (< 2. 5 end-diastolic volumes/s) and prolonged time to peak rate of filling (≥ 180 ms). Furthermore, left ventricular systolic function, usually supernormal in {{patients with}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was depressed (ejection fraction ≤ 45 % I in six patients. Hence, a subset of patients was identified with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> and only mild localized left ventricular hypertrophy who experienced severe cardiac symptoms.

Methods and Results—Forty-six consecutive patients with symptomatic exercise limitation (peak V ˙ o 2 75 % of predicted) caused by <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (mean age, 550. 26 years) were randomized to perhexiline 100 mg (n 24) or placebo (n 22). Myocardial ratio of phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate, an established marker of cardiac energetic status, as measured by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, left ventricular diastolic filling (heart rate normalized time to peak filling) at rest and during exercise using radionuclide ventriculography, peak V ˙ o 2, symptoms, quality of life, and serum metabolites were assessed at baseline and study end (4. 61. 8 months). Perhexiline improved myocardial ratios of phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate (from 1. 270. 02 to 1. 730. 02 versus 1. 290. 01 to 1. 230. 01; P 0. 003) and normalized the abnormal prolongation of heart rate normalized time to peak filling between rest and exercise (0. 110. 008 to 0. 010. 005 versus 0. 150. 007 to 0. 110. 008 second; P 0. 03).

40|$|The {{calcium channel}} {{blocking}} agent, nifedipine, {{has been shown}} to improve indexes of left ventricular relaxation, diastolic filling and compliance in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The mechanism of action of nifedipine on diastolic properties in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is unclear and could result from an improvement in myocardial inactivation or from systemic vasodilation and left ventricular unloading. To distinguish between these mechanisms, the effects of nifedipine and the vasodilator nitroprusside on left ventricular diastolic properties were compared in 10 patients with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> using simultaneous micromanometer left ventricular pressure and echocardiographic measurements. Left ventricular peak systolic pressure was comparable during nitroprusside infusion (132 ± 38 mm Hg) and after nifedipine (132 ± 32 mm Hg). During nitroprusside infusion, the decrease in left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (22 ± 11 to 17 ± 11 mm Hg, p < 0. 05) was associated with a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. In contrast, the decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure after nifedipine (22 ± 11 to 18 ± 10 mm Hg, p < 0. 05) was associated with no reduction of left ventricular eand-diastolic dimensions, suggesting an increase in left ventricular distensibility. Compared with nitroprusside, nifedipine was associated with less prolongation of the left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time and less depression of the peak left ventricular posterior wall thinning rate and peak left ventricular internal dimension filling rate. These data suggest that the effects of the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, on diastolic mechanics in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy result not only from systemic vasodilation but also from improved cardiac muscle inactivation...|$|R
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy is 1 of {{the most}} frequent cardiac manifestations associated with an unfavorable prognosis. However, many different causes of left ventricular hypertrophy exist. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of common electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters to differentiate Fabry disease (FD), amyloidosis, and <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (HC) from hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and aortic stenosis (AS). In 94 patients with newly diagnosed FD (n = 17), HHD (n = 20), amyloidosis (n = 17), AS (n = 20), and HC (n = 20), common ECG parameters were analyzed and tested for their diagnostic value. A stepwise approach including the Sokolow-Lyon index, corrected QT duration, and PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II to overcome P-wave abnormalities was applied. A corrected QT duration 440 ms and a Sokolow-Lyon index </= 1. 5 mV were found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 85 % and 100 %, respectively, for the diagnosis of amyloidosis and differentiation from HC, AS, and HHD. Moreover, a novel index ([PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II multiplied by corrected QT duration]/Sokolow-Lyon index) proved to be highly diagnostic for the differentiation of amyloidosis (area under the curve 0. 92) and FD (area under the curve 0. 91) by receiver operator characteristic analysis. In conclusion, a combined analysis of PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II, corrected QT duration, and Sokolow-Lyon index proved highly sensitive and specific in the differentiation of FD, amyloidosis, and HC compared to HHD and AS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{dynamics}} of left ventricular ejection in patients with obstructive and <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (HCM). 30 patients with HCM and 29 patients with no evidence of cardiovascular disease were studied during cardiac catheterization. Using a single multisensor catheter, electromagnetically derived ascending aortic flow velocity and high fidelity left ventricular and aortic pressures were recorded during rest (n = 47) and provocative maneuvers (n = 23). Dynamic ventricular emptying during rest was also analyzed with frame-by-frame angiography (n = 46). Left ventricular outflow was independently derived from both flow velocity and angiographic techniques. The HCM patients were subdivided into three groups: (I) intraventricular gradients at rest (n = 9), (II) intraventricular gradients only with provocation (n = 12), and (III) no intraventricular gradients despite provocation (n = 9). During rest, the percentage of the total systolic ejection period during which forward aortic flow existed was as follows (mean +/- 1 SD) : group I, 69 +/- 17 % (flow), 64 +/- 6 % (angio); group II, 63 +/- 14 % (flow), 65 +/- 6 % (angio); group III, 61 +/- 16 % (flow), 62 +/- 4 % (angio); control group, 90 +/- 5 % (flow), 86 +/- 9 % (angio). No significant difference was observed between any of the HCM subgroups, but compared with the control group, ejection was completed much earlier in systole independent of the presence or absence of intraventricular gradients. These results suggest that "outflow obstruction," as traditionally defined by the presence of an abnormal intraventricular pressure gradient and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, does not impede left ventricular outflow in HCM...|$|R

We compared cardiovascular outcomes in 293 patients HC (96 nonobstructive, 114 labile-obstructive, and 83 obstructive) referred for exercise echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging and followed for 3. 3 ± 3. 6 years. A subgroup (34 nonobstructive, 28 labile-obstructive, 21 obstructive) underwent positron emission tomography. The mean number of sudden cardiac death risk factors was similar among groups (nonobstructive: 1. 4 vs labile-obstructive: 1. 2 vs obstructive: 1. 4 risk factors, p = 0. 2). Prevalence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was similar across groups but more non-obstructive patients had late gadolinium enhancement ≥ 20 % of myocardial mass (23 [30 %] vs 19 [18 %] labile-obstructive and 8 [11 %] obstructive, p = 0. 01]. Fewer labile-obstructive patients had regional positron emission tomography perfusion abnormalities (12 [46 %] vs nonobstructive 30 [81 %] and obstructive 17 [85 %], p = 0. 003]. During follow-up, 60 events were recorded (36 ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, including 30 defibrillator discharges, 12 heart failure worsening, and 2 deaths). Nonobstructive patients were {{at greater risk of}} VT/VF at follow-up, compared to labile obstructive (hazed ratio 0. 18, 95 % confidence interval 0. 04 to 0. 84, p = 0. 03) and the risk persisted after adjusting for age, gender, syncope, family history of sudden cardiac death, abnormal blood pressure response, and septum ≥ 3 cm (p = 0. 04). Appropriate defibrillator discharges were more frequent in nonobstructive (8 [18 %]) compared to labile-obstructive (0 [0 %], p = 0. 02) patients.

CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, perhexiline, a modulator of substrate metabolism, ameliorates cardiac energetic impairment, corrects diastolic dysfunction, and increases exercise capacity. This study supports the hypothesis that energy deficiency contributes to the pathophysiology and provides a rationale for further consideration of metabolic therapies in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|The morphologic {{concepts}} of the "athlete heart" have been enhanced and clarified over the last 10 years by virtue of M-mode echocardiographic studies performed on more than 1, 000 competitive athletes. Long-term athletic training produces relatively mild but predictable alterations in cardiac structure that result {{in an increase in}} calculated left ventricular mass. This increase in mass observed in highly trained athletes is due to a mild increase in either transverse end-diastolic dimension of the left ventricle or left ventricular wall thickness, or both. Cardiac dimensions in athletes compared with matched control subjects show increases of about 10 % for left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, about 15 to 20 % for wall thickness and about 45 % for calculated left ventricular mass. Furthermore, there is evidence that the modest degree of "physiologic" left ventricular hypertrophy (both the cavity dilation and wall thickening) observed in athletes is dynamic in nature, that is, it may develop rapidly within weeks or months after the initiation of vigorous conditioning and may be reversed in a similar time period after the cessation of training. Several echocardiographic studies also suggest that the precise alterations in cardiac structure associated with training may differ {{depending on the type of}} athletic activity undertaken (that is, whether training is primarily dynamic [isotonic] or static [isometric]). Although the ventricular septal to free wall thickness ratio (on M-mode echocardiogram) is almost always within normal limits (< 1. 3), occasionally an athlete will show mild asymmetric thickening of the anterior basal septum (usually 13 to 15 mm). This circumstance may mimic certain pathologic conditions characterized by primary left ventricular hypertrophy such as <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> The long-term significance of increased left ventricular mass in trained athletes has not been conclusively defined. However, there is no evidence at this time suggesting that this form of hypertrophy is itself deleterious to the athlete or predisposes to (or prevents) the natural occurrence of cardiovascular disease later in life...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the possible interdependence of the left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) rotational mechanics. BACKGROUND: Although myocardial fiber architecture {{and the effect of}} various pathologic conditions on LV torsional mechanics have already been investigated through multiple studies using different methods, there is still a significant debate about the actual presence and functional significance of RV rotational mechanics. METHODS: We perform a cross-sectional prospective study of 118 subjects, including 19 normal subjects (NS, 35 ± 7 years), 34 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS, 44 ± 16 years), 26 patients with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> (HCM, 46 ± 18), and 39 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM, 39 ± 13 years). LV and RV rotational parameters were measured using velocity vector imaging. Total LV and RV apical segment rotations as well as the rotation of the free wall of RV apex were measured separately. Interdependence of the LV and RV rotational mechanics was assessed using the Spearman rho test. RESULTS: Both LV (7. 3 °± 4. 1 ° in NS, 11 °± 4. 6 ° in AS, 7. 7 °± 5. 2 ° in HCM, and 1. 9 °± 2 ° in DCM, P=<. 0001) and RV apexes (4. 7 °± 2 ° in NS, 6. 1 °± 4 ° in AS, 3. 2 °± 3. 7 ° in HCM, and 2. 4 °± 3. 6 ° in DCM, P=<. 0001) rotated counterclockwise in all the four study groups. Interventricular apical rotation interdependence was stronger in the AS (Spearman rho [ρ]:. 716; P=. 000) and in the HCM (ρ:. 395; P=. 04) subgroups than in the NS (ρ:. 26; P=. 27) and DCM (ρ:. 215; P=. 18). In DCM patients, RV apex rotation appeared to be independent of LV rotation. RV free wall apical rotation was larger than its corresponding value for the total apical segments in all studied groups. This difference was significant only in the AS (P=. 007). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated a close correlation between RV and LV apical rotation parameters in different cardiac conditions as well as in normal subjects. However, in DCM patients, we also showed some independent rotation of the RV from the LV apex...|$|R
40|$|Case 1 : The {{patient is}} now a 56 -year-old man with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (HCM). At 35 years of age, his brother (aged 39) died {{suddenly}} with a new diagno-sis of HCM made at autopsy. A diag-nostic evaluation ensued, and nonob-structive HCM was identified with a ventricular septal thickness of 31 mm. Because of the family history of sud-den death (and his marked hypertro-phy), an implantable cardioverter- de-fibrillator (ICD) was implanted for primary prevention of sudden death. Five years later, during sleep (1 : 00 AM), the ICD aborted an episode of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and re-stored sinus rhythm (Figure 1). Nine years passed without incident, and at 50 years of age, an identical VF event occurred during sleep, similarly termi-nated by a defibrillation shock. Now, at 56 years of age, the patient contin-ues to be asymptomatic and active. His clinical course with HCM has been punctuated only by these 2 unpredict-able sudden-death events effectively treated by an ICD prophylactically im-planted for high-risk status. Case 2 : The patient is a 53 -year-old female elementary school teacher with obstructive HCM. She presented at 44 years of age, asymptomatic, but with a strong family history of sudden deaths due to HCM in 2 brothers (aged 20 and 34 years, respectively). An ICD was implanted prophylactically, and 2 years later (at 46 years of age), VF was defibrillated during sleep. Over the next 6 years, 4 more appropriate inter-ventions for ventricular tachycardia (VT) /VF followed. Ventricular septal thickness is 21 mm; left ventricular outflow obstruction is absent at rest, although provoked with exercise (gradient, 70 mm Hg). By 51 years of age, exertional dyspnea and functional limitation had progressed de-spite maximum medical management, with the patient disabled in New York Heart Association functional class III. Surgical septal myectomy abolished both the outflow gradient and the pa-tient’s heart failure–related symptoms. Once again, at 53 years of age, she is asymptomatic and active, having experi-enced 2 adverse disease pathways, ie, sudden-death risk, and heart failure due to outflow tract obstruction, {{both of which were}} amenable to effective treat-ment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a primary}} myocardial disease in which symptoms may frequently result from impaired left ventricular relaxation, filling and compliance. In the present investigation, Doppler echocardiography was utilized to measure transmitral flow velocity and thereby assess left ventricular diastolic performance noninvasively {{in a group of}} 111 patients representative of the broad clinical spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, all Doppler indexes of diastolic relaxation and filling differed significantly (p < 0. 001) from those obtained in 86 control subjects without heart disease, namely, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation (94 ± 24 versus 78 ± 12 ms) and of the early diastolic peak of flow velocity (244 ± 55 versus 220 ± 28 ms), as well as slower deceleration (3. 4 ± 1. 4 versus 4. 9 ± 1. 3 m/s 2) and reduced maximal flow velocity in early diastole (0. 5 ± 0. 2 versus 0. 6 ± 0. 1 m/s). As an apparent compensation for impaired relaxation and early diastolic filling, the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling was increased, as shown by increased late diastolic flow velocity (0. 4 ± 0. 3 versus 0. 3 ± 0. 1 m/s) and reduced ratio of maximal flow velocity in early diastole to that in late diastole (1. 4 ± 0. 8 versus 2. 1 ± 0. 9). The vast majority of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (91 [82 %] of 111) showed evidence of impaired left ventricular diastolic performance, as assessed from the Doppler waveform. Abnormal Doppler diastolic indexes were identified with similar frequency in patients with (78 %) or without (83 %) left ventricular outflow obstruction, as well as in patients with (84 %) or without (80 %) cardiac symptoms. However, patients with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> showed more severe alterations in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function than did patients with obstruction. Thus, abnormal diastolic performance as assessed by Doppler echocardiography was apparent {{in the vast majority of}} the study patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, independent of the presence or absence of cardiac symptoms or a subaortic pressure gradient. The high frequency with which diastolic abnormalities are identified in asymptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests that impaired diastolic performance may be present at a time in the natural history of the disease when functional limitation is not yet evident...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether true obstruction to left ventricular ejection exists {{in patients with}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a subaortic gradient, pulsed Doppler echocardiography was {{used to analyze the}} patterns of left ventricular emptying in 50 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (20 with and 30 without evidence of obstruction) and in 20 normal subjects. In obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection was characterized by early and rapid emptying (76 ± 14 % of aortic flow velocity in the initial one-third of systole). The proportion of forward flow velocity occurring before initial mitral-septal contact (and hence, by inference before the onset of the subaortic gradient) was variable, but averaged 58 %. In contrast, the proportion of forward flow velocity occurring after mitral-septal contact (and, therefore, concomitant with the gradient and increased intraventricular pressure) was considerable, averaging over 40 %. Mid-systolic impedance to left ventricular outflow was suggested by the rapid deceleration in aortic flow velocity concomitant with mitral-septal contact and premature partial aortic valve closure. Furthermore, left ventricular ejection was prolonged (384 ± 40 ms) and the ventricle continued to empty and shorten during the period when both the pressure gradient and markedly increased intraventricular pressures were present. In 16 of 20 patients, a relatively small second peak in flow velocity appeared in late systole. Since marked systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was still present, the late systolic portion of forward flow velocity also appeared to be largely ejected during imposition of a mechanical impediment to outflow. In contrast, patients with <b>nonobstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> showed no evidence of impedance to left ventricular ejection. Aortic flow velocity waveforms were similar to those of normal subjects, with flow persisting to aortic valve closure; significant mitral systolic anterior motion and partial mid-systolic aortic valve closure were absent, and the systolic ejection period was normal (303 ± 27 ms). It is concluded that in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: 1) systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve produces a mechanical obstruction to left ventricular emptying, and a considerable portion of the stroke volume is impeded in its egress from the left ventricle; 2) the subaortic gradient appears to be of pathophysiologic importance because the left ventricle continues to contract in the presence of markedly increased intraventricular pressures; and 3) left ventricular ejection characteristics differ markedly between patients with and without mitral systolic anterior motion or a subaortic gradient...|$|R
