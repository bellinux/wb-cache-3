5|$|Player {{selection}} {{during the}} previous stages of the Open Cup was a challenge due to key personnel receiving call-ups for the World Cup. The Sounders had depth that could withstand losing players, and did <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> starters in the lead-up to the final game. The Union rested several starters {{during the previous}} weekend's league match. Philadelphia's Casey, Le Toux, and Cristian Maidana were significant attacking threats, while Seattle had the striking pair of Martins and Clint Dempsey. Defensively, Edu was Philadelphia's strongest player. Seattle also had a strong defense with young national team prospect DeAndre Yedlin, and eventual MLS Defender of the Year Chad Marshall.|$|E
5|$|The club did <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> {{long after}} winning the European Cup: more highly {{regarded}} players were brought into the fold {{in the form of}} Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 1996–97 and 1997–98 Serie A titles, as well as the 1996 UEFA Super Cup and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup. Juventus reached the 1997 and 1998 Champions League finals during this period, but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid respectively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, also {{according}} to the Tao Te Ching (77.4) a wise person acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> (arrogantly) in it: – he {{does not wish to}} display his superiority.|$|E
25|$|Yet events did <b>not</b> <b>rest.</b> To the south, Arab Islamic armies {{began to}} stir, unified and {{energized}} by {{the teachings of}} the Prophet, Muhammad (570–632). In 636 at the Battle of Yarmuk to the east of the Sea of Galilee, the Arabs decisively defeated the Byzantine forces.|$|E
25|$|Bode, {{despite all}} the high distinctions he received, both from Academia and Government, did <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> on his laurels. He {{believed}} that engineering, as an institution, deserved {{a place in the}} Pantheon of academia as much as science did. With typical engineering resourcefulness he solved the problem by helping create another academy.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Boulier, a surly {{accountant}} for Éditions Dupuis, {{the publishers}} of the magazine. He {{states that he}} will <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> until he has tracked down every useless expense in the company, and in particular those of Gaston. However, his attempts to cause Gaston grief backfire in spectacular ways. He represents the more serious side of the comics publishing business.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalytic theory did <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> on {{classification}} of distinct disorders, but pursued analyses of unconscious conflicts and their manifestations within an individual's life. It dealt with neurosis, psychosis, and perversion. The concept of borderline personality disorder and other personality disorder diagnoses were later formalized from such psychoanalytic theories, though such ego psychology-based lines of development diverged substantially from the paths taken elsewhere within psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{heavy losses}} at Suphanburi, the Burmese army had to march on towards Ayutthaya. They could <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> since the monsoon season {{was a little}} over a month away. As Ayutthaya was {{surrounded}} by several rivers, laying siege in the rainy season would have been a daunting task. The whole country would be under several feet of water. Half of the remaining Burmese forces were down with dysentery and Alaungpaya himself was not well.|$|E

25|$|Yet events {{along the}} {{imperial}} frontier did <b>not</b> <b>rest.</b> To the south, the Arab {{peoples of the}} desert began to stir {{under the influence of}} a new monotheistic vision, being unified and energized by the foundational teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (570–632). In 636 at the Battle of Yarmuk to the east of the Sea of Galilee the Arab Islamic armies decisively defeated the Byzantine forces. Soon the recently lost and regained Roman provinces of Syria and Egypt would be lost again by the Byzantines—with finality—to emerging Islam.|$|E
25|$|Amarthiel has Laerdan {{transported to}} Angmar, where she learns from him under torture where her Ring is. In a brave attempt to save both Laerdan and the ring Narchuil, the player {{is able to}} get to them before Amarthiel does, but only half of the ring was found. Laerdan confesses to Elrond he has broken the Narchuil in two, and reveals where the other part should be. But then he swears an oath upon Elbereth that he will <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> before he has saved his daughter, and leaves the Council.|$|E
60|$|The Major {{peered over}} the edge of the roof to watch him. He had a sleepy look about his eyes, as if he had <b>not</b> <b>rested</b> well. Uncle John was snoring with gentle {{regularity}} and the girls were still asleep.|$|R
50|$|Characters have {{an energy}} level, {{restored}} by sleep, rest, fluids or injections. Moving, using stealth and getting hit saps energy. Tired mercs who have <b>not</b> <b>rested</b> {{for a long}} time become exhausted faster. Exhausted characters will fall to the ground until they regain some energy.|$|R
60|$|After this I {{remember}} no more, for I went to sleep, and so {{remained for}} about twenty-four hours. This was not wonderful, seeing that {{for two days}} and nights practically I had <b>not</b> <b>rested,</b> during which time I went through much fatigue and many emotions.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{thereafter}} there ensued {{a massive}} famine, {{and everyone was}} reduced to devouring not only grapes, but all sorts of plants and even animals {{in an attempt to}} satiate their hunger. Of them only Hwang-gung 황궁(黃穹) came forth to Mago 마고(麻姑) and begged her for forgiveness. He swore he would <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> until mankind could recover its pure nature. From her he obtained the Three Heavenly Heirlooms, and great knowledge. He then called together all the people of the earth, taught them agriculture, and gave each clan leader a Heavenly Heirloom and then sent them off in different directions to people the earth.|$|E
25|$|Apollinaire took Picasso to {{the opening}} of the {{exhibition}} in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8. At about the time of this exhibition, Gleizes, through the intermediary of Apollinaire, meets Picasso and sees the work of Picasso and Braque for the first time. He gives his reaction in an essay published in another shortlived Abbaye dominated literary magazine, La Revue Indépendante. He considers that Picasso and Braque, despite the great value of their work, are engaged in an 'Impressionism of Form', {{which is to say that}} they give an appearance of formal construction which does <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> on any clearly comprehensible principle.|$|E
25|$|Ball: It is made {{of either}} rubber or {{synthetic}} material (pliable plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. It is from 18 to 20cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any color. The ball should rest in the gymnast's hand and <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> against the wrist or {{be able to be}} grasped. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing or rolling. The gymnast must use both hands and work on the whole floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnasts flowing lines and body difficulty.|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  3, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the {{fundamental}} frequencies of both stiffened spherical and cylindrical shell panels decrease with increased number of stiffeners for both cases: <b>resting</b> and <b>not</b> <b>resting</b> on elastic foundation. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that mass effect by stiffeners activates larger than stiffness effect.|$|R
50|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for this injury {{consists of the}} RICE protocol — rest, ice, compression and elevation. The RICE method is primarily used to reduce bleeding and damage within the muscle tissue. Lower grade strains can easily become worse if the hamstring is <b>not</b> <b>rested</b> properly. Complete ruptures require surgical repair and rehabilitation.|$|R
50|$|On paper this {{looked like}} Jamaica's {{advantage}} {{and just to}} be prepared, Jamaica ran Rasheed Dwyer to rest their star Usain Bolt in the heats. The United States employed a rare strategy of <b>not</b> <b>resting</b> anybody, even though Remontay McClain and Isiah Young were signed up, they used their A team in the heats.|$|R
25|$|The {{course of}} the {{massacre}} showed an almost identical pattern in every city he visited. Before his arrival, {{there were only a}} few killings, despite his orders. When Dessalines arrived, he first spoke about the atrocities committed by former French authorities, such as Rochambeau and Leclerc, after which he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area's French population be carried out. Reportedly, he also ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that blame would <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> solely on the black population. Mass killings then took place on the streets and on places outside the cities. In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Ramírez's {{name was}} put in the hit list of the cartel and it did <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> until {{it was able to}} break through his {{security}} to avenge the damage he did to its criminal network. On November 17, 1986, when he was returning with his family to Bogotá, men in a green Renault 18 began to shoot at his car on a bridge between the municipalities of Mosquera and Fontibón, taking advantage {{of the fact that he}} was without a convoy. Colonel Ramírez lost control of his car and crashed against a rock, not far from a police station. The assassins approached his car and shot him in front of his wife and sons.|$|E
25|$|Confusion, however, did <b>not</b> <b>rest</b> on the American side alone. The Filipinos also {{succumbed to}} indecision. Colonel Lucio Lucas, who was under Luna's direct command, had responded {{immediately}} {{after hearing the}} signal for attack. His objective was to march into the Meisic police station, which the Americans {{had turned into a}} barracks. However, en route Lucas' troops were met by a large American contingent at Azcarraga Street. Thinking of retreat, Lucas had reconsidered the belief that it was better to die fighting than die burning. The houses at their rear were already on fire, so he ordered his men to attack the Americans with only daggers in their hands. In the ensuing fight three Filipinos and eight Americans were killed.|$|E
