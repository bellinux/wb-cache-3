50|$|The Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) is {{a global}} {{consortium}} of development institutions that work collaboratively to advance the systematic and science-based measurement of sustainability in agriculture. COSA applies a pragmatic and collective approach for using scientific methods to develop indicators and tools to measure sustainability through performance monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment. These sustainability measurements assess the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices. COSA’s approach and indicators have a basis in international treaties and <b>normative</b> <b>references</b> such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) eight fundamental Conventions, the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Water Quality and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

40|$|Many {{indicator-based}} {{methods for}} the environmental assessment of farming systems have been developed. It is not the absolute values of the indicators that reveal whether {{the impact of a}} system is acceptable, but rather the distance between these values and some reference values. We reviewed eight frameworks {{for the environmental}} assessment of agricultural systems that define reference values for their indicators. We analyzed the methods used to establish reference values and explored how to improve these methods to increase their usage and relevance. This analysis revealed a striking diversity of terminology, sources, and modes of expression of results. <b>Normative</b> <b>reference</b> values allow the assessment of a single system with a previously defined value; Relative reference values are based on indicator values for similar systems or a <b>reference</b> system. <b>Normative</b> <b>reference</b> values can be Science-based or Policy-based. A science-based <b>normative</b> <b>reference</b> value can be a Target value, which identifies desirable conditions, or an Environmental limit, which is the level beyond which conditions are unacceptable. The quantification of the uncertainty of reference values is a topic which is barely explored and warrants further research. Reference values present a means of introducing site specificity into methods for environmental assessment which seems, at present, largely under-exploited. value; threshold; fair earthshare; critical flow; sustainability standard; critical threshold values; baseline value; environmental minimum requirement...|$|R
40|$|Materiality is {{a central}} concept in the process which is applied during the {{external}} audit of company annual financial statements. Guidelines issued by professional standard-setting bodies generally state that the determination of audit materiality is primarily a matter of professional judgement. A normative analysis and description of the materiality concept in auditing led to the formulation of specific normative principles in respect of determining audit materiality which are presented in this article. These normative principles are summarised and discussed in a <b>normative</b> <b>reference</b> framework for determining audit materiality. The <b>normative</b> <b>reference</b> framework represents the factors which should influence the external auditor's decisions in respect of determining audit materiality and, therefore, provides external auditors with specific guidance in this regard.

Our aim was {{to determine}} the <b>normative</b> <b>reference</b> values of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and to establish the proportion of subjects with low CRF suggestive of future cardio-metabolic risk. Methods: A total of 7244 children and adolescents attending public schools in Bogota, Colombia (55. 7 % girls; age range of 9 – 17. 9 years). We expressed CRF performance as the number of shuttle-runs completed and the estimated peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak) and smoothed percentile curves were calculated. In addition, we also present the prevalence of low CRF after applying a previously suggested correction factor, to account for the impact of Bogota’s altitude (2, 625 meters over sea level) on CRF assessment and we calculated the number of participants who fell below health-related FITNESSGRAM cut-points for low CRF. 2018 - 07 - 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The first aim was {{to extend}} the {{reference}} values and curves of the Muscle Power Sprint Test (MPST) in children with typical development. The second {{aim was to}} examine test/retest and intertester reliability of the MPST. Methods: A total of 683 children aged 6 to 18 years (mean = 11. 9 ± 3. 8 years) were tested on the MPST. Test/retest reliability was examined in 71 children and intertester reliability in 77 children.

Results: Sex-specific MPST curves were generated for children aged 6 to 18 years. Test/retest reliability was good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 90) and intertester reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 97).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop <b>normative</b> <b>reference</b> of functional fitness and an overall functional fitness index (OFFI) for 60 - to 69 -year-old men. A total of 112 older men living in Florianópolis/SC and Rio Claro/SP, who had been participating in structured and supervised physical activities on a regular basis for the past 6 months, were evaluated by the AAHPERD test battery. This battery consists of five tests that evaluate flexibility, coordination, balance and agility, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity. Percentile scores were calculated for the raw scores obtained in each test and the sum of percentiles was used as the OFFI. The 20 th, 40 th, 60 th and 80 th percentiles were taken as limits to classify the components and OFFI as very weak, weak, fair, good, and very good, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACTConservation Units, as any {{organization}} interested {{in improving the}} environmental performance of its activities, products and services, has, at its disposal, <b>normative</b> <b>references</b> to support a systemic and voluntary approach of its environmental and organizational aspects. Among the <b>normative</b> <b>references,</b> there are instruments of voluntary application such as MEG – Management Excellency Model, which directs the organization {{to the state of}} the art of management. Based on MEG, we intend to investigate the management maturity of four units of full protection conservation units in the State of Tocantins, to describe its scenario of current management and verify which management practices were adopted by the Conservation Units. The analysis of the information collected pointed out that most of the conservation units presented many gaps in their management. From the areas studied, one presented an advanced level of maturity, and three presented a preliminary level of maturity. The poor performance can be related to management culture of not considering the units as organizations depending on a complex proceeding of relationships, both internal and external. Although it appears that there are benefits, it is possible that the main factors that have influenced the units can be attributed to bad application of existing human, material, financial and technical resources...|$|E
