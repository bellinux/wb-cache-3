5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} {{hijacking}} of two cruise missiles with live <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> {{which had been}} taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, a SPECTRE agent. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima Blush, another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, {{in search of the}} missing <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, a B-52H {{ferrying}} AGM-129 ACM {{cruise missiles}} from Minot Air Force Base to Barksdale Air Force Base for dismantling was mistakenly loaded with six missiles with their <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> The weapons {{did not leave}} USAF custody and were secured at Barksdale.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|The Tsetse primary {{was used}} in the US B43 nuclear bomb, W44 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> W50 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> B57 <b>nuclear</b> bomb, and W59 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> {{according}} to researcher Chuck Hansen.|$|R
50|$|The W40 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> was an American fusion-boosted fission <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> {{developed}} in the late 1950s and which saw service from 1959 to 1972.|$|R
50|$|Hansen's {{research}} indicates that the Tsetse primary {{was used in the}} US B43 nuclear bomb, W44 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> W50 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> B57 <b>nuclear</b> bomb, and W59.|$|R
5|$|Simulations {{showed that}} the {{aircraft}} would be essentially unstoppable by existing or projected air defenses; even surface-to-air missiles armed with <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> could do no better than force the aircraft to change course to avoid the fringe effects of the explosions.|$|E
5|$|The large caliber {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> was developed subsequently.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of , Duke (Channing Tatum) has become {{the leader of the}} G.I. Joe unit, which is framed for {{stealing}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> from Pakistan by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce). The unit is subsequently eliminated in a military air strike with Duke as one of the casualties. The only survivors are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki).|$|E
50|$|The W40 {{design was}} {{reportedly}} the common Python primary or fission core {{used by the}} US B28 nuclear bomb, W28 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> and W49 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b>|$|R

5|$|Norway {{prohibited}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> to {{be stored}} on its soil, preventing Banak from serving in a role {{as a base for}} US nuclear-armed bombers. NATO's military interest for Banak peaked during the late 1960s. Increased range of Soviet aircraft during the 1970s diminished the need for troops in Finnmark; combined with Norwegian tension and nuclear policies, this caused the United States to favor Vestfjorden and Troms over Banak as the primary areas of defense.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{attempt to}} board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, {{in search of}} the missing <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> Bond finds Domino. He {{attempts}} to make Largo jealous by kissing Domino in front of a two way mirror. Largo becomes enraged, traps Bond and takes him and Domino to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa. Largo coldly punishes Domino for her betrayal by selling her to some passing Arabs. Bond subsequently escapes and rescues her.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads)</b> have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|E

50|$|In December 1957 the Army {{requested}} the Atomic Energy Commission {{to develop a}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> for the HAWK low- to medium-altitude surface-to-air missile. In July 1958 the military characteristics were approved for the new warhead and the design released. Two months later the requirement for a HAWK with a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> was cancelled.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missiles in combat against the Allied forces. The missiles arrived too late to alter {{the course of the}} war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction by providing each superpower with Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles that could carry <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b>|$|E
5|$|Project E <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> {{were also}} used on the sixty Thor Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles which were {{operated}} by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under Project Emily. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its Corporal missiles in 1958. The United States subsequently offered the Honest John missile as an interim replacement, and it remained in service until 1977, when it was in turn superseded by the Lance missile. Eight-inch and 155mm nuclear artillery rounds were also acquired under Project E. A maritime version of Project E known as Project N provided nuclear depth bombs used by the RAF Coastal Command. The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, {{with a range of}} 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, with a range of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry ballistic missiles receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E

5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E
5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, the US offered the Honest John missile. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John {{missiles}} with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments, the 24th at Nienburg (and later Paderborn), the 39th at Sennelager, and the 50th at Menden, with two batteries each. In addition, each regiment had two batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers (later replaced by M110 howitzers) with W33 <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> A British nuclear artillery round project was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met {{the same fate}} on 10 August 1962. The Honest Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. One of the Honest John regiments, the 50th Missile Regiment, Royal Artillery, was then re-equipped with the Lance missile, with its W70 nuclear warhead. The W48 was acquired for the 155mm M109 howitzers. Both it and the W33 would remain in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the Davy Crockett, but had decided against it by February 1962.|$|E
5|$|In response, a 5 September news {{briefing}} at the Pentagon by Press Secretary Geoff Morrell {{stated that}} {{at no time}} was the public in any danger and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times. The USAF announced that {{within days of the}} incident, the USAF relieved the Minot munitions squadron commander of duty and eventually disciplined 25 airmen. USAF Major General Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident. The USAF inventory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> was checked to ensure that all warheads were accounted for. In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel, called the Defense Science Board, would study the mishap {{as part of a larger}} review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons. On 28 September, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General John Corley, effective 2 October.|$|E
50|$|The R-11M had {{a maximum}} range of 270 km, but when {{carrying}} a <b>nuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> this {{was reduced to}} 150 km.

5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main concern was {{that they could not}} reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also to serve {{as a part of the}} nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
5|$|Set reveals to the Resistance {{that the}} Nazis' {{discovery}} {{of one of}} the Da'at Yichud caches, which included advanced technology centuries ahead of its time, is what allowed Germany to surpass the Allies in military might and ultimately win the war. Set agrees to assist the Resistance by revealing the location of one such cache, but states that the Resistance requires a U-boat to access it. Blazkowicz obtains a U-boat, but discovers that it is the flagship of the Nazis' submarine fleet, and is equipped with a cannon designed to fire <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> which requires codes from the Nazi lunar research facility to operate. Blazkowicz uses the technology found in the Da'at Yichud cache, namely the Spindly Torque—a sphere that destroys the super-concrete—to steal the identity of a Nazi Lunar scientist and infiltrate the Lunar Base. He succeeds at obtaining the codes, but upon returning to earth, he discovers that Deathshead has mounted an assault on the Resistance base, capturing some of the members.|$|E
5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling {{of nuclear weapons and}} delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating that they are not armed with <b>nuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear weapons from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E
