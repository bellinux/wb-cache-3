40|$|Many states nationalized large {{portions}} of their railroad network between 1860 and 1912. This paper uses new cross-country data on the incidence and extent of <b>nationalizations</b> to examine which factors contributed to <b>nationalizations,</b> and how <b>nationalizations</b> influenced railroad mileage growth. I find evidence that <b>nationalizations</b> were greater in countries with less democracy or low constraints on {{the executive branch of}} government, with French and German civil law systems, and where neighboring countries had higher military capability. I also find evidence that countries experienced lower mileage growth after substantial <b>nationalizations,</b> and that part of the decrease in mileage growth was caused by <b>nationalizations.</b> The results are consistent with the hypotheses that external military threats increased the necessity of <b>nationalizations,</b> while legal and political institutions limiting {{the power of the state}} raised the costs of <b>nationalizations.</b> They also suggest that <b>nationalizations</b> reduced the investment incentives of both private companie...|$|R
40|$|NATIONALIZATIONS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND FRANCE 1945 - 1948 This thesis {{deals with}} process of <b>nationalizations</b> in Czechoslovakia and France from 1945 to 1948. It tries to compare an {{approach}} of Czechoslovak and French {{government to the}} restrictions of private property ownership after the Second World War. The First Chapter is theoretical and introductory to the topic. It starts with prehistory of <b>nationalizations</b> and presents the differences between capitalist and socialist notion of liberty, equality and private property and transformation of <b>nationalizations</b> from {{the economic and political}} concept to the legal institute. It also tries to outline the differences between <b>nationalizations</b> and related legal institutes as expropriation, confiscation and national administration. The Chapter Two targets on similarities and differences of <b>nationalizations</b> in Czechoslovakia and France during the years 1945 - 1948 and seeks to respond a question to what extent the Czechoslovak reforms resembled the way the Western States dealt with new economic, political and social situation in Europe after the war. It describes economic, political and social conditions of the post-war <b>nationalizations</b> in Europe and process of <b>nationalizations</b> in France and Czechoslovakia during the above-mentioned period.

5|$|In October 1961, Nasser {{embarked}} on a major <b>nationalization</b> program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution. The charter called for universal health care, affordable housing, vocational schools, greater women's rights and a family planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal.|$|E

In the mid 13th century, the Song government led by Jia Sidao began confiscating portions of estates owned by the rich {{in order to raise}} revenues in a land <b>nationalization</b> scheme. This had the negative effect of alienating the wealthy landowners and hastening the collapse of the empire, as wealthy landlords and merchants favored what they deemed the inevitable Mongol conquest and rule than the other alternative of paying higher taxes for continual, exhaustive warfare.|$|E

We also find some more nuanced evidence that zombie banks’ market shares in crisis countries evolve together with interventions. A higher frequency of interventions coincides with greater zombie bank presence, and increases in competition are larger when zombie banks occupy bigger market shares...|$|R

5|$|After the <b>nationalization,</b> {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial <b>nationalization</b> in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|By June 1954, 1.4 {{million acres}} of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had {{received}} land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial credit {{to the people who}} received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was twice as much as the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it. The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954.

5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the <b>nationalization</b> of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E

25|$|State {{ownership}} of firms was, of course, {{consistent with the}} <b>nationalizations</b> but reflected {{a different kind of}} policy objective. Whereas the <b>nationalizations</b> were intended to gain greater Peruvian control over the country's resources and to reduce the scope of foreign influence, the proliferation of state-owned firms was meant to increase direct control by the government over the economy. State firms were seen as a means to implement government economic policies more directly than possible when working through private firms, whether domestic or foreign-owned. The goal was not to eliminate the private sector—it was encouraged at the same time by tax favors and protection—but to create a strong public sector to lead the way toward the kind of economy favored by the state.|$|R

It proved an economic success; while gross domestic product had been $3.8 billion in 1969, it had risen to $13.7 billion in 1974, and $24.5 billion in 1979. In turn, the Libyans' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of Gaddafi's administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like Italy and the U.K.|$|E

According to the HDZ, this process proved a useful distraction from dealing with the baggage of post World War II communist <b>nationalizations.</b> In fact it was the HDZ in 1992 which enacted into law the right of corporations (the vast majority of which were under state ownership) the right to finally formally register themselves as the owners of nationalized property, thus completing their own version of a process of quasi-nationalization started by the communist regime after WWII, in different targeted areas for their own gain.|$|R
