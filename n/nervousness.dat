5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid. Folk medicine has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and <b>nervousness,</b> coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E
5|$|After he {{inadvertently}} {{discovers the}} presence of walkers in the Greene barn, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) begs Glenn (Steven Yeun) {{to keep it a}} secret. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) quickly notices Glenn's <b>nervousness,</b> and when he talks privately to Glenn, Glenn blurts out about the walkers as well as his knowledge that Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) is pregnant. Dale confronts Hershel (Scott Wilson) about the walkers. Hershel believes they are still people, including his wife and stepson, and can be cured, and refuses to kill them after Dale explains the danger. Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Lori argue on what to do with Hershel's demand to leave the farm, now that Carl (Chandler Riggs) is healed.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and <b>nervousness.</b> In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent {{spoofing}} himself, whether it was the affected <b>nervousness</b> of the treasurer in The Treasurer's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E
5|$|The {{promotion}} {{strategy for}} the film played on nationalist sentiment by announcing that La tragedia del silencio was the first authentically Colombian movie. It was first screened to the public on 18 July 1924 in Faenza theatre in Bogotá, attracting a large audience. There were several technical problems including power failure and projector errors, caused in particular by the <b>nervousness</b> of the director and his son, {{the director of the}} theatre Joaquín Francisco, and operator Gustavo Francisco. However, the film was well received by the public and the press, although some viewers complained about the poor image quality. The theatre was crowded during the seventeen showings of the film, but it was not very successful financially.|$|E
5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of <b>nervousness</b> when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than her mother could give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} she ever battled <b>nervousness.</b> The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of <b>nervousness</b> (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle. She left Hollywood {{to look for}} a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, <b>nervousness,</b> and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, <b>nervousness</b> and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E
5|$|Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 – 3 March 2008) was a cricketer {{who played}} for New South Wales and Australia. A {{right-handed}} batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill {{was one of the}} foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959–60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960–61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, {{and at the end of}} the series, had a career average of 58.25. His performances on the 1961 tour of England saw him named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Thereafter his form was less formidable, characterised by <b>nervousness</b> and fidgeting at the start of his innings. Persistent knee problems as well as a controversial media attack on the legality of West Indian bowler Charlie Griffith saw him dropped from the Australian team after 1965. O'Neill also bowled occasional leg spin and was regarded as one of the finest fielders of his era. He later became a cricket commentator and his son Mark O'Neill also played cricket at state level.|$|E
25|$|Varying {{degrees of}} anxiety, {{such as a}} very active mind,irritability, hyperactivity, agitation, restlessness, <b>nervousness,</b> distractible overactivity and panic attacks. In {{addition}} patients may experience vivid dreams and, occasionally, nightmares.|$|E
25|$|Nervous Laugh: A laugh not {{matching}} the situation. This {{could be a}} sign of <b>nervousness</b> or discomfort. When this happens, it may be good to probe with questions to discover the person's true feelings.|$|E
25|$|Consumption of 1–1.5grams per day is {{associated}} with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency {{with a wide range of}} unpleasant symptoms including <b>nervousness,</b> irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and palpitations after caffeine use.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. {{version of}} the film, Jack's {{interview}} with Ullman, whose confident affability contrasts with Jack's seemingly forced nonchalance, is paired with Wendy's meeting with a female doctor, whose somber and professional manner contrasts with Wendy's <b>nervousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stuttering is {{generally}} not {{a problem with the}} physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute <b>nervousness</b> and stress do not cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load (chronic <b>nervousness</b> and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem {{in the manner of a}} positive feedback system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition. Neither acute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to stuttering.|$|E
25|$|Even {{people who}} have {{discontinued}} short term and or long term use of pregabalin have experienced withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, headache, agitation, nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, flu like symptoms, <b>nervousness,</b> major depression, pain, convulsions, hyperhidrosis and dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} ephedra {{consumption}} may include severe skin reactions, irritability, <b>nervousness,</b> dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} withdrawal from benzodiazepines be gradual, as abrupt withdrawal from {{high doses of}} benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, <b>nervousness,</b> rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|CNS effects: <b>Nervousness,</b> depression, restlessness, crying, euphoria, flushing, hostility, unusual dreams, confusion, faintness, hallucinations, dysphoria, {{feeling of}} heaviness, numbness, tingling, unreality. The {{incidence}} of psychotomimetic effects, such as unreality, depersonalization, delusions, dysphoria and hallucinations {{has been shown}} to be less than that which occurs with pentazocine.|$|E

25|$|Atrial flutter {{is usually}} well tolerated {{initially}} (a high heart rate is {{for most people}} just a normal response to exercise), however, people with other underlying heart disease or poor exercise tolerance may rapidly develop symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, nausea and, in some patients, <b>nervousness</b> and feelings of impending doom.|$|E
25|$|In October 2004, the Dixie Chicks {{joined the}} Vote for Change tour, {{performing}} in concerts organized by MoveOn.org in swing states. While the Dixie Chicks' artistic collaborations with James Taylor went well, sharing the stage on many occasions, Maines' comments {{before and during}} the concerts revealed a certain degree of <b>nervousness</b> over the future career path of the Dixie Chicks.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl's {{most common}} side effects (more than 10% of patients) include diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, {{asthenia}} (weakness), sweating, and less frequently (3 to 10 % of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, <b>nervousness,</b> hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use {{has also been}} associated with aphasia.|$|E
25|$|Black bears may {{communicate}} with various vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking and grunting {{are the most}} common sounds and are made in cordial situations to conspecifics, offspring, and occasionally humans. During times of fear or <b>nervousness,</b> bears may moan, huff or blow air. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping. In aggressive interactions, black bears produce deep-throated pulsing sounds. Cubs may squeal, bawl or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched his}} face, {{and it was}} as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of <b>nervousness</b> or haste.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{side effects}} of {{oxycodone}} include reduced sensitivity to pain (beyond the pain the drug is taken to reduce), euphoria, anxiolysis, feelings of relaxation, and respiratory depression. Common {{side effects of}} oxycodone include constipation (23%), nausea (23%), vomiting (12%), somnolence (23%), dizziness (13%), itching (13%), dry mouth (6%), and sweating (5%). Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include loss of appetite, <b>nervousness,</b> abdominal pain, diarrhea, urine retention, dyspnea, and hiccups.|$|E
25|$|The Temptations {{originally}} hired Ricky Owens, {{from the}} Los Angeles-based vocal group the Vibrations, to replace Kendricks. However, Owens only played two dates {{with the group}} before he was fired for forgetting the words to his solo numbers due to <b>nervousness.</b> For several weeks of the spring of 1971, the Temptations were without a fifth member. Owens meanwhile returned to the Vibrations and died in Los Angeles, California on December 6, 1996, {{at the age of}} 57.|$|E
25|$|Cusack {{made his}} debut for Ireland in a one-day match against Middlesex on 10 June 2007. He bowled two {{expensive}} overs, conceding 29runs, however he did score 29 batting at number six from Ireland's total of 175; Ireland {{went on to}} lose the match by six wickets. Trent Johnston, his captain, attributed Cusack's lack of success in his first match to <b>nervousness.</b> However, Cusack was much more effective on his international debut, {{in which he was}} named man-of-the-match.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} pseudoephedrine therapy include {{central nervous system}} stimulation, insomnia, <b>nervousness,</b> excitability, dizziness and anxiety. Infrequent ADRs include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy {{may be associated with}} mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also {{play a role in the}} precipitation of episodes of paranoid psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{inhalation}} of {{high concentrations}} causes {{a wide variety}} of cognitive, personality, sensory, and motor disturbances. The most prominent symptoms include tremors (initially affecting the hands and sometimes spreading {{to other parts of the}} body), emotional lability (characterized by irritability, excessive shyness, confidence loss, and <b>nervousness),</b> insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular changes (weakness, muscle atrophy, muscle twitching), headaches, polyneuropathy (paresthesia, stocking-glove sensory loss, hyperactive tendon reflexes, slowed sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities), and performance deficits in tests of cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|Anime and manga artists often {{draw from}} a common canon of iconic facial {{expression}} illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts. These techniques are often different in form {{than their counterparts in}} Western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused. A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict <b>nervousness,</b> visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.|$|E
25|$|Fidgeting is the act {{of moving}} about restlessly. Fidgeting may {{be a result of}} <b>nervousness,</b> agitation, boredom or a {{combination}} of these. It may be a result of genes and is often an unconscious act. Fidgeting may involve playing with one's fingers, hair, or items of clothing. A common act of fidgeting is to bounce one's leg repeatedly. Rings are another common focus of fidgeting; variations include ring spinning, twirling or rolling along a table. Parents often consider fidgeting to be a bad habit, especially in schoolchildren.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{a series}} of quick fixes {{followed}} to ensure that American forces would not be caught completely off guard {{in the event of}} war. More important was the sensitivity with which American officials now treated the <b>nervousness</b> of their European counterparts; the Americans now became more willing to take steps to boost morale in Europe and ease the now-widespread anxieties there. The coup and the Berlin Blockade that June made clear that constant reassurance was needed to bind the Europeans to the U.S. system; hence, the remobilization of U.S. armed forces began.|$|E
25|$|Joseph {{provided}} {{well for}} their family, {{but he was}} unfaithful. His affairs included one with Gloria Swanson. When Rose was eight months pregnant with the couple's fourth child, Kathleen, she temporarily {{went back to her}} parents, returning to Joseph after her father told her divorce was not an option. In turning a blind eye to her husband's affairs, Rose depended heavily on medication. Ronald Kessler found records for prescription tranquilizers Seconal, Placidyl, Librium, and Dalmane to relieve Rose's <b>nervousness</b> and stress, and Lomotil, Bentyl, Librax, and Tagamet for her stomach.|$|E
