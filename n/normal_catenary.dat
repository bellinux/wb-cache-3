2500|$|This {{hyperbolic}} cosine function describes {{the shape of}} a catenary. A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; the chain is purely in tension. Likewise, an inverted catenary arch that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear. The catenary arch is the stablest of all arches since [...] "the thrust passes down through the legs and is absorbed in the foundations, whereas in other arches, the pressure tends to force the legs apart." [...] The Gateway Arch itself is not a common catenary, but a more general curve of the form y=Acosh (Bx). This makes it an inverted weighted catenary. Saarinen chose a weighted catenary over a <b>normal</b> <b>catenary</b> curve because it looked less pointed and less steep. In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, [...] "This arch is not a true parabola, as is often stated. Instead it is a catenary curve—the curve of a hanging chain—a curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch." [...] William V. Thayer, a professor of mathematics at St. Louis Community College, later wrote to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calling {{attention to the fact that}} the structure was a weighted catenary.|$|E

On Ziegelgraben Bridge a third rail was laid instead of the <b>normal</b> overhead <b>catenary.</b> At the same time the Deutsche Reichsbahn erected a power line over the Strela Sound to supply the island network whenever the Ziegelgraben Bridge was opened.|$|R

In the area of Cologne-Bonn a single operational system (of so-called above ground lines or Hochflurstrecken) was created by the Cologne Stadtbahn and the Bonn Stadtbahn, opened in 1974, from the conversion of two former railway lines (the Rheinuferbahn and Vorgebirgsbahn belonging to the old Köln-Bonner Eisenbahnen). Further developments led to tram-train networks that rather resembled an S-Bahn. This idea was first realised in 1992 in Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Stadtbahn), where as part of the Karlsruhe model even so-called dual system railbuses were used, which in addition to the direct current of Straßenbahn lines (750 V) could also draw power from the 15-kV-alternating current from <b>normal</b> DB <b>catenary.</b> In Karlsruhe this network reached as far as Heilbronn, 84 km away, where a Stadtbahn network was created going out from this line. Both in Karlsruhe and in Heilbronn the Stadtbahn filled both the roles of a classic tramway system as well as an S-Bahn. The Karlsruhe mixed-operation concept was also adopted by the Saarbahn in Saarbrücken. This model is today referred to in France as the tram-train.|$|R
