40|$|FUSOBACTERIUM necrophorum {{infection}} {{is known to}} cause sporadic disease in ruminants. In bovines, it is most commonly associated with interdigital <b>necrobacillosis</b> or 'foul-in-the-foot', (Weaver 1974), hepatic abscessation and rumenitis (Scanlan and Hathcock 1983), oral <b>necrobacillosis</b> or 'calf diphtheria' (Langworth 1977) and anterior vena cava thrombosis (Breeze and Petrie 1977). In sheep, infection by this bacterium results in footrot and <b>necrobacillosis</b> in ewes and lambs (Scott and Henderson 1991).

40|$|Only a small {{proportion}} of animals tested were found to be excreting Fusobacterium necrophorum biovar A, the causative organism of <b>necrobacillosis,</b> in the faeces (3 of 69 wallabies, 1 of 66 deer, 2 of 81 cattle). The two positive cattle belonged to a single group of calves on a farm with a history of <b>necrobacillosis</b> and the litter underfoot also readily yielded biovar A organisms.

Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with FN suspended in sub-lethal doses (0. 1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. Undiluted culture of a strain of Escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of FN to less than 10 organisms; in the <b>necrobacillosis</b> lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered E. coli. A heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of E. coli culture had little if any effect on FN.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{prevalence}} {{study was to determine}} the prevalence of digital dermatitis, interdigital hyperplasia and interdigital <b>necrobacillosis</b> on farms in the Netherlands. This is relevant due to the effects of lameness, a common symptom of these three diseases, on animal welfare and economic results. The data were collected within a clinical trial, required for the authorisation of a new topical treatment for digital dermatitis, set in October to December of 2013. Trained veterinary students collected data for this paper. The front and hind claws of each cow participating in the trial were inspected whilst the cow was in a trimming chute. Herds preferably contained over 100 cows, had a herd digital dermatitis prevalence level of 20 % or more, were housed in cubicle systems, were of the Holstein Friesian breed and no preventive claw treatment on herd-level was executed in the three weeks prior to the trial. After visiting four farms, the goal of inspecting at least 300 cows was met, with a total of 373 animals. Prevalence was calculated per farm and an overall prevalence was calculated after visiting all four farms for each disease. A 95 % confidence interval was calculated for each disease to establish whether the results differed significantly from values found in literature. Herd prevalence for digital dermatitis varied from 23. 0 % to 59. 3 %. For interdigital <b>necrobacillosis,</b> values varied from 0. 0 % to 1. 6 %.

40|$|Poverty is {{the single}} most {{important}} risk indicator for noma (cancrum oris), a severe gangrene of the soft and hard tissues of the mouth, face, and neighbouring areas. The risk factors associated with an increased probability of noma developing include the following: malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, and a state of debilitation resulting from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, measles, and other childhood diseases prevalent in the tropics. There are many similarities between noma and <b>necrobacillosis</b> of the body surface of wallabies (Macropus reforgriseus), and it is proposed that noma results from oral contamination by a heavy load of Bacteroidaceae (particularly Fusobacterium necrophorum) and a consortium of other microorganisms. These opportunistic pathogens invade oral tissues whose defences are weakened by malnutrition, acute necrotizing gingivitis, debilitating conditions, trauma, and other oral mucosal ulcers. The current escalation in the incidence of noma in Africa can be attributed to the worsening economic crisis in the region, which has adversely affected the health and well-being of children through deteriorating sanitation, declining nutritional status and the associated immunosuppression, and increased exposure to infectious diseases. Prevention of noma in Africa will require measures that address these problems, and most importantly, eliminate faecal contamination of foods and water supplies...|$|E

40|$|The Flemish {{veal calf}} {{industry}} is a niche market, which is specialized in rearing dairy, mixed breed or Belgian Blue calves on an iron deficient milk powder diet {{in order to produce}} white veal meat. The sector is for 90 % integrated, implicating a rigid economical approach of production characteristics, diseases and treatment. Veterinary costs are kept at a minimum and therefore diagnostic efforts and non-antimicrobial preventive measures (e. g. vaccinations) are not performed. Objective data on causes of morbidity and mortality in the Flemish veal sector are lacking and data from other countries with similar industries is limited as well. Preliminary results on the first 7 farms of an extensive longitudinal survey are currently available. One round per farm was surveyed, with a total number of 2458 calves. Data on morbidity (individual and group treatments) and mortality were daily recorded. In total 478 calves (19 %) were treated individually at least once. The main reason for individual treatment was bovine respiratory disease (BRD) (64 %). Other reasons were diarrhea (13 %), otitis (8 %), polyserositis (6 %), arthritis (5 %), <b>necrobacillosis</b> (2 %), omphalitis (0. 7 %), neurological disease (0. 4 %) and miscellaneous diseases (1. 5 %). A typical age related distribution of morbidity was seen on all farms, with diarrhea (week 1 - 3) shortly after arrival, followed by respiratory problems (week 2 - 7) with the peak incidence at 4 weeks after arrival. The average number of individual treatment days per production round was 334. 4 days with 4. 5 days per treated calf. Antimicrobial treatments of the entire group were performed on average 7 times per production round. Overall mortality was 5. 2 % (127 calves). Three important causes of mortality were identified: pneumonia (25 %), polyserositis (20 %) and acute ruminal acidosis/ruminitis (15 %). Polyserositis is a pathology that only recently emerged on these farms, which is mainly characterised as a peritonitis without any visible primary source, with or without pleuritis or pericarditis. In most cases pneumonia was present as well. Other causes of mortality were enterotoxaemia (7 %), diarrhea (6 %), omphalitis (4 %), euthanasia due to arthritis (4 %), perforating abomasal ulceration (3 %), neurological disease (3 %) and <b>necrobacillosis</b> (2 %). Mortality was higher in the Belgian Blue calves than in the mixed breed and the dairy breed. Next to the three main causes of mortality, enterotoxaemia in the Belgian Blue breed is a disease of high significance, because it causes mortality {{at the end of the}} production cycle, when animals have a high economic value. Further research on the etiologic agents, the pathological mechanisms and risk factors involved in these diseases is needed in order to create an evidence based preventive approach of veal production. With the issues of antibiotic resistance and animal welfare, such an approach can no longer be delayed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Necrobacillosis</b> {{occurs in}} man and animals. The typical {{forms of the}} disease in animals are caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum biovar A; biovar B strains are much less pathogenic. In this study the {{pathogenicity}} for mice of eight human isolates of F. necrophorum was {{compared with that of}} animal biovar A and B strains. By subcutaneous inoculation seven of the human strains differed from biovar A but resembled biovar B in (1) producing, at the most, mild local lesions that rapidly healed, and (2) showing no enhancement of infectivity when suspended in sub-lethal doses of Staphylococcus aureus broth culture. The eighth human strain (A 2433) resembled biovar A but differed from biovar B in (1) producing severe lesions, and (2) showing greatly enhanced infectivity in the presence of S. aureus. Nonetheless, strain A 2433 differed from biovar A, both {{in the nature of the}} lesions produced and in its failure to cause severe general signs of illness and rapidly fatal infection. By intravenous inoculation one of two biovar B strains and all except one of the eight human strains produced purulent lesions, often severe, in the liver and elsewhere, but infection was not usually associated with general signs of illness. In contrast, intravenous injection of a biovar A strain gave rise to a rapidly fatal infection, with severe lesions in the liver or elsewhere. The results suggest that the term 'necrobacillosis' as used in human and veterinary medicine refers to diseases that differ in important respects...|$|E
