5|$|As well {{as being}} kept as pets, cats are also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts {{have been used for}} superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} minute of extra time, Leicester medical staff {{indicated}} they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a blood injury replacement for Dan Hipkiss, and elected to bring Julien Dupuy, who had been substituted in the last 10 minutes of regular time, back onto the field as the replacement. The match officials requested the Leicester physiotherapist demonstrate an open wound by wiping the blood from the cut, and satisfied the injury was legitimate, allowed the replacement. With the penalty shoot-out approaching, Cardiff decided to use a substitution to bring Ceri Sweeney, an experienced goal-kicker, onto the field in place of Jamie Roberts.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a mental map.|$|E

The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E

The division was part of the Army Signal Corps's Aviation Section. Its headquarters were in Portland, Oregon, and its main operations center was at Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington. Workers in the division were members of the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, a union specifically established to support the army's wood production operations.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Digital Devil Saga was principally {{composed}} by Shoji Meguro, {{who had worked}} on multiple previous Megami Tensei titles. Some tracks from the first game were composed by Kenichi Tsuchiya. While he had previously been restricted in his music quality by the limited storage space of the CD medium, Meguro was able to play half the tracks using real-time streaming. For the sound compression, Meguro used ATRAC3 compression software. Using the software, Meguro was able to fit in high-quality music alongside the sound effects and voice track. Nevertheless, he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some compromises on tracks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> interchangeable parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.|$|E

5|$|In February 2002, Haze {{appeared}} in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money and build her career. The company to her {{was more than just}} a business, but a family too. She also enjoyed the idea of having a group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E
5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission‚Äìfusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
5|$|More {{extensive}} coverage {{has been given}} by some sites. VentureBeat noted that, while comparable with other similar campaigns, Operation Rainfall was notable for maintaining civility during its efforts. Zach Kaplan of Nintendo Life said that the campaign <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a clear mark, showing {{that the success of}} the then-announced Xenoblade Chronicles was not a fluke. In a later feature for the same website, Thomas Whitehead said that the otherwise niche and slightly unremarkable Pandora's Tower had been granted a level of mystique and anticipation among fans through its inclusion in the Operation Rainfall campaign. In an interview feature conducted after the announcement of a North American release for Pandora's Tower, PC World noted that Operation Rainfall was going against the trend with its complete success in pushing to bring all three titles to North America. In particular, it compared them to the unsuccessful efforts by fans to bring Japan-exclusive entries of the Mother series to the West.|$|E
