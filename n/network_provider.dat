5|$|Inacom, {{founded in}} Omaha in 1991, was a {{technology}} company that customized computer systems for large businesses, {{and was on}} the Fortune 500 list from 1997 until 2000, when it filed for bankruptcy. Northwestern Bell, the Bell System affiliate for Northwestern states, had its headquarters in Omaha from its founding in 1896 until it moved to Denver in 1991 as US West. Level 3 Communications, a large Tier 1 <b>network</b> <b>provider,</b> was founded in Omaha in 1985 as Kiewit Diversified Group, a division of Kiewit Corporation, a Fortune 500 construction and mining company still headquartered in Omaha; Level 3 moved to Denver in 1998. World Com was founded by a merger with Omaha's MFS Communications, started as Metropolitan Fiber Systems in 1993. MFS, backed by Kiewit Corporation CEO Walter Scott and Warren Buffett, purchased UUNET, one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, for $2 billion in 1996. The now-infamous Bernie Ebbers purchased the much larger MFS for $14.3 billion in 1997 under his World Com. He moved headquarters of the merged company from Omaha to Mississippi.|$|E

India {{is the second}} largest market of mobile <b>network</b> <b>providers</b> {{in the world and}} there is intense {{competition}} among existing players. In such a competitive market, customer satisfaction becomes a key issue. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a customer satisfaction model of mobile <b>network</b> <b>providers</b> in Kolkata. The results indicate that generic requirements (an aggregation of output quality and perceived value), flexibility, and price are the determinants of customer satisfaction. This study offers insights for mobile <b>network</b> <b>providers</b> to understand the determinants of customer satisfaction...|$|R

This was ABC's {{final year of}} consecutive baseball coverage (teaming with NBC, which had telecast Saturday afternoon games since 1966 and Major League Baseball in general since 1947) due to CBS signing a four-year contract (spanning from 1990–1993) to become the exclusive national broadcast <b>network</b> <b>provider</b> for Major League Baseball games.|$|E

Wesley's IT infrastructure includes over 4,000 notebook, 1,000 desktop computers and 850 network printers. In 2005 wireless internet was launched college-wide. In 2007 Wesley introduced tablet styled notebook computers and was the first educational institution in Australia to do so, but by 2010 were no longer being issued. In 2008, Art students were using Wacom pen-tablets for drawing use. Wesley introduced interactive whiteboards across all classrooms and some lecture theatres in 2008, allowing notes to be printed to a nearby printer or emailed to students. The College also began trialling electronic reading devices in 2008.|$|E

Virgin Media signed an agreement with Cable & Wireless to become the unbundled local loop (LLU) <b>network</b> <b>provider,</b> providing access to 4million homes outside of the Virgin Media cable franchise network and would include linear pay broadcast channels and video on demand. This was originally scheduled to be released during 2008 but was delayed and scaled back as Virgin Media concentrated on improving its cable broadband proposition instead of focusing on competing with Sky in the premium television market. As of 2010, no further developments have been announced and the plans appear to have been abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of EconomicsDennis L. WeismanThe Internet is {{a network}} that {{consists}} of content providers and users connected to {{each other through the}} communication lines managed by <b>network</b> <b>providers.</b> <b>Network</b> neutrality rules are designed to protect independent content providers from unjust discrimination by <b>network</b> <b>providers.</b> This report explores the economic rationale for net neutrality rules, how the regulation should be enforced, and its potential effects on competition. The report finds that net neutrality encourages competition among content providers by subsidizing content provider access but concentrates the market for <b>network</b> <b>providers</b> by forcing <b>network</b> <b>providers</b> to compete primarily through price competition. It considers this to be a beneficial arrangement for economic growth, but observes that there is a potential for all sides of the market to be subsidized by advertiser fees. It also shows that despite the Federal Communications Commission's heavy involvement with network neutrality rules, these rules are actually based in a long history of antitrust regulation. It concludes, however, that the current regulatory environment is sufficient for enforcing net neutrality rules...|$|R
