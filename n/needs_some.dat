5|$|After Princess Bubblegum {{falls into}} the Lich's well of power, she is rushed to the Candy Kingdom {{hospital}} and saved. However, the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn, but Finn angrily scolds him and tells {{him to leave the}} kingdom. Finn and Jake then focus their energy on taking care of Princess Bubblegum, whose behavior seems off. At first, she claims that she <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> rest, but soon she begins acting strangely, such as convulsing in her bed. Finn leaves to acquire items that Bubblegum requests—which includes weapons-grade plutonium, ammonium, and gasoline among other items—and Jake tries to cheer Bubblegum up with a song.|$|E
5|$|While {{the global}} {{financial}} system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national <b>needs.</b> <b>Some</b> nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E

5|$|Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer), the station's counselor, has {{concerns}} with Nog {{living in a}} fictional world and speaks to Fontaine, who explains {{that he has a}} plan to rectify the situation. Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of UV can outweigh manageable risks. UV light causes {{the body to}} produce vitamin D, which is essential for life. The human body <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> UV radiation in order for one to maintain adequate vitamin D levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} also an above ground {{pipeline}} was tested as a storage system, giving some good results. Obviously {{the cost of}} the system is higher, but it can be placed wherever the designer chooses, while an underground system <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> particular geologic formations (salt domes, aquifers, depleted gas mines..etc.).|$|E

25|$|A show jumping rider {{will have}} a shorter stirrup than other English riders, in order to {{maximize}} the jumping effort of the horse. However, the rider also has the challenge of staying on over the fence and controlling the horse through rapid changes of pace and direction, so still <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> length of leg for stability.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{understanding}} {{needed by the}} mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all {{in much the same}} terms.|$|E
25|$|Jesse James {{remains a}} {{controversial}} symbol, {{one who can}} always be reinterpreted in various ways according to cultural tensions and <b>needs.</b> <b>Some</b> of the neo-Confederate movement regard him as a hero. But renewed cultural battles over {{the place of the}} Civil War in American history have replaced the long-standing interpretation of James as a Western frontier hero.|$|E

25|$|District heating has rather little legal {{framework}} in Germany. There is no law {{on it as}} most elements of district heating are regulated in governmental or regional orders. There is no governmental support for district heating networks but a law to support cogeneration plants. As in the European Union the CHP Directive will come effective, this law probably <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Various poverty {{reduction}} strategies are broadly categorized here {{based on whether}} they make more of the basic human needs available or whether they increase the disposable income needed to purchase those <b>needs.</b> <b>Some</b> strategies such as building roads can both bring access to various basic needs, such as fertilizer or healthcare from urban areas, as well as increase incomes, by bringing better access to urban markets.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{several of}} the indoor arenas would be {{assembled}} elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, so {{it might be more}} accurate to call them legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing <b>needs,</b> <b>some</b> of them would be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will have paid for an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium.|$|E

25|$|Frederick Herzberg {{also came}} up with the concept of job enrichment, which expands jobs to give {{employees}} a greater role in planning, performing, and evaluating their work, thus providing the chance to satisfy their motivators <b>needs.</b> <b>some</b> suggested ways would be to remove some management control, provide regular and continuously feedback. Proper job enrichment, therefore, involves more than simply giving the workers extra tasks to perform. It means expanding the level of knowledge and skills needed to perform the job.|$|E
25|$|Arthrodesis: {{the fusion}} of the two bones of the pastern joints {{eliminates}} the instability of the joint, and thus the inflammation. This procedure may then eliminate the horse's lameness as well. However, surgical alteration of the joint can promote the growth of bone in the area, which is cosmetically displeasing. Arthrodesis of the coffin joint is usually not performed due {{to the location of}} the joint (within the hoof) and because the coffin joint <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> mobility for the horse to move correctly (unlike the pastern joint, which is very still).|$|E
25|$|In {{characteristic}} p {{the most}} obvious analogue of the crystalline site defined above in characteristic 0 does not work. The reason is roughly {{that in order to}} prove exactness of the de Rham complex, one <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> sort of Poincaré lemma, whose proof in turn uses integration, and integration requires various divided powers, which exist in characteristic 0 but not always in characteristic p. Grothendieck solved this problem by defining objects of the crystalline site of X to be roughly infinitesimal thickenings of Zariski open subsets of X, together with a divided power structure giving the needed divided powers.|$|E

25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include moistening food {{and helping to}} create a food bolus. This lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Only about 30% starch digestion {{takes place in the}} mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still <b>needs</b> <b>some</b> time to develop.|$|E
25|$|These {{features}} {{tend to make}} legal writing formal. This formality {{can take}} the form of long sentences, complex constructions, archaic and hyper-formal vocabulary, and a focus on content to the exclusion of reader <b>needs.</b> <b>Some</b> of this formality in legal writing is necessary and desirable, given the importance of some legal documents and the seriousness of the circumstances in which some legal documents are used. Yet not all formality in legal writing is justified. To the extent that formality produces opacity and imprecision, it is undesirable. To the extent that formality hinders reader comprehension, it is less desirable. In particular, when legal content must be conveyed to nonlawyers, formality should give way to clear communication.|$|E
25|$|Many {{parts of}} the Americas are still {{populated}} by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Greenland, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. At least a thousand different indigenous languages are spoken in the Americas. Some, such as the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guaraní, Mayan languages, and Nahuatl, count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, social organization, and subsistence practices. Like most cultures, over time, cultures specific to many indigenous peoples have evolved to incorporate traditional aspects, but also cater to modern <b>needs.</b> <b>Some</b> indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from Western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples.|$|E
