40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a so-called neutron <b>noise</b> <b>simulator</b> is reported. This simulator calculates both the direct and the adjoint reactor transfer function between a stationary noise source and its induced neutron noise for any 2 -dimensional heterogeneous critical system. The main advantage of this neutron <b>noise</b> <b>simulator</b> is that any realistic core can be modelled, since the simulator is designed to rely on a set of material constants corresponding to the actual reactor operating conditions. The calculations are performed in the 2 -group diffusion approximation and in the frequency domain. The spatial discretisation is carried out with respect to the finite difference scheme. The noise source, expressed as an "absorber of variable strength" type, is defined directly from the fluctuations of the macroscopic cross-sections and can be spatially distributed over the core or concentrated in a few discrete nodes. If the noise source is a point-source, the simulator actually estimates the 2 -dimensional 2 -group discretised Green's function of the system. From the calculated Green's function, the neutron noise induced by a "vibrating absorber" type of noise source can also be determined. Different benchmark cases show that this neutron <b>noise</b> <b>simulator</b> works satisfactorily...|$|E

Numerical calculations have been performed based on a 2 D model of the ESFR core with 33 energy groups and 8 groups of delayed neutron precursors. Localized perturbations of several cross section types {{near the center of}} the core were assumed to investigate the behaviour of the amplitude and phase of the induced space-dependent noise in a wide range of frequency, e. g. 0. 1 - 100 Hz...|$|E

A subsonic transport aircraft and Langley's 14 - by 22 -foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel were chosen to test the proposed "low noise" technology. The present experiment studies the basic components of propulsion-airframe shielding in a representative flow regime. To this end, a 5. 8 -percent scale hybrid wing body model was built with dual state-of-the-art engine <b>noise</b> <b>simulators.</b> The results will provide benchmark shielding data and key hybrid wing body aircraft noise data.

40|$|Quantum {{computers}} (QCs) {{have many}} potential hardware implementations ranging from solid-state silicon-based structures to electron-spin qubits on liquid helium. However, all QCs {{must contend with}} gate infidelity and qubit state decoherence over time. Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) {{have been developed to}} protect program qubit states from such noise. Previously, Monte Carlo <b>noise</b> <b>simulators</b> have been developed to model the effectiveness of QECCs in combating decoherence. The downside to this random sampling approach is that it may take days or weeks to produce enough samples for an accurate measurement. We present an alternative noise modeling approach that performs combinatorial analysis rather than random sampling. This model tracks the progression of the most likely error states of the quantum program through its course of execution. This approach has the potential for enormous speedups versus the previous Monte Carlo methodology. We have found speedups with the combinatorial model on the order of 100 X- 1, 000 X over the Monte Carlo approach when analyzing applications utilizing the [[7, 1, 3]] QECC. The combinatorial noise model has significant memory requirements, and we analyze its scaling properties relative {{to the size of the}} quantum program. Due to its speedup, this noise model is a valuable alternative to traditional Monte Carlo simulation. ...|$|R

To some degree, all these studies have relied on modeling of JWST's theoretical instrument noise.

The concepts were developed by Lockheed Martin (LM), Rolls-Royce Liberty Works (RRLW), and General Electric Global Research (GEGR) as part of an N+ 2 (next generation forward) aircraft system study initiated by the Supersonics Project in NASA s Fundamental Aeronautics Program. The {{experiments were}} conducted in the Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The exhaust concepts presented here utilized lobed-mixers and ejectors. A powered third-stream was implemented to improve ejector acoustic performance. One concept was found to produce stagnant flow within the ejector and the other produced discrete-frequency tones (due to flow separations within the model) that degraded the acoustic performance of the exhaust concept.

40|$|The {{corruption}} of signals due to capacitive and inductive coupling of interconnects {{has become a}} significant problem {{in the design of}} deep submicron circuits (DSM). <b>Noise</b> <b>simulators,</b> based on worstcase assumptions, are overly pessimistic. As a result, when they are used on industrial ICs with hundreds of thousands of nets, thousands of nets are reported as having potential noise violations. There is a need to prioritize the problem nets based on the likelihood of the noise and possibly even eliminate them from further consideration if the likelihood is negligable. In this paper, a probabilistic approach is described which allows for a quantitative means to prioritize nets based on the likelihood of the reported noise violation. We derive upper bounds on the probability that the total noise injected on a given victim net by a specific set of aggressors exceeds a threshold. This bound is then used to determine a lower bound on the expected number of clock cycles (ENC) before the first violation occurs on a given net. Nets can be prioritized based on the ENC. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through experiments carried out on a large industrial processor design using a state-ofthe -art industrial noise analysis tool.

As a result, “a little annoying ” corresponds to 69 dB, “annoying ” to 78 dB and “very annoying ” to 82 dB.

These systems have shorter stroke actuators, lower bandwidth, and higher noise. The influence of these characteristics on pilot perception and control behaviour is unknown, and can be investigated by simulating a model of a simulator with limited capabilities on a high-end simulator. The platform limitations, such as a platform filter, time delay, and <b>simulator</b> <b>noise</b> characteristics, can then be removed one by one and their effect on control behaviour studied in isolation. By applying a cybernetic approach, human behaviour can be measured objectively in target-following disturbance-rejection control tasks. Experimental results show that small changes in time delay and <b>simulator</b> <b>noise</b> characteristics do not negatively affect human behaviour in these tasks. However, the motion system bandwidth has a significant effect on performance and control behaviour. Participants barely use motion cues when these have a low bandwidth, and instead rely on visual cues to generate lead to perform the control task. Therefore, simulator motion cues must be considered carefully in piloted control tasks in simulators and measured results depend on simulator characteristics as pilots adapt their control behaviour to the available cues...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} for the explanation of the space-dependence of the so-called decay ratio (DR) {{which is used to}} quantify the stability properties of boiling water reactors (BWRs). The study was prompted by the observation of a strongly space-dependent decay ratio in an instability event at the Swedish Forsmark- 1 BWR. Prior to that event, the space-dependence of the DR was neither observed, nor assumed possible in the theoretical models of instability. The model proposed here is based on a previous suggestion by one of the authors on how to model the estimation of the DR in case of two different types of oscillations (instabilities) being present in the core simultaneously. The model was earlier only used in a space-independent form, but here its applicability is extended such that space-dependence of the oscillations is also accounted for, by using a <b>noise</b> <b>simulator.</b> The investigations show that the DR, as determined by the individual LPRMs (neutron detectors) at different positions, can be strongly space-dependent if at least two different oscillations with differing DR and space-dependence exist in the core simultaneously.

This study describes a simulation methodology to test automated controllers and its application in {{a comparison of}} two published controllers for Bispectral Index (BIS) -guided propofol administration. Methods: A patient simulator was developed to compare controllers. Using input scripts to dictate patient characteristics, target BIS values, and {{the time course of}} surgical events, the simulator continuously monitors the infusion pump under control and generates BIS values as a composite of modeled response to drug, perceived stimulation, and random <b>noise.</b> The <b>simulator</b> formats the output stream of BIS data as input to the controller under test to emulate the serial output of the actual BIS monitor. A published model-based controller and a classic proportional integral derivative controller were compared when using the BIS value as a controlled variable. Each controller was tested using a set of 10 virtual patients undergoing a fixed surgical profile that was repeated with BIS targets set at 30, 50, and 70. Controller performance was assessed using median (absolute) prediction error, divergence, wobble, and percentage time within BIS target range metrics. Results: The median prediction error was significantly smaller for the proportional integral derivative controller than for the model-based controller. The median absolute prediction error was smaller for the model-based controller than for the proportional integral derivative controller for each BIS target, reaching statistical significance for targets 30 and 50. Conclusions: When simulating closed-loop control of BIS using propofol, the use of a patient-individualized, model-based adaptive closed-loop system with effect site control resulted in better control of BIS compared with a standard proportional integral derivative controller with plasma site control. Even under extreme conditions, the modeled-based controller exhibited no behavioral problems...|$|R

With the UVa/Padova simulator, the robustness against CGM noise and delays was tested. A higher percentage of time in target was obtained with iPID as compared to standard PID with reduced time spent in hyperglycemia. Two different T 1 D simulators tests showed that iPID detects meals and reacts faster to meal perturbations as compared to a classic PID. The intelligent part turns the controller to be more aggressive immediately after meals without neglecting safety. Thus, postprandial hyperglycemia is reduced with less late postprandial hypoglycemia. The simple structure iPID is a step for PID like controllers since it combines the classic PID nice properties with new adaptive features...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{simulator}} for indoor power-line channels is presented. Its behavioral model {{includes both}} the long- and short-time {{variation of the}} channel. The long-time variation {{is due to the}} electrical appliances switching and is modeled in a statistical way. The cyclic short-time variation is related to the presence of the mains voltage and is characterized modeling the channel response as a linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) system and including an additive cyclostationary noise term. The cyclic model is simplified by using a slow variation approach, so that the channel can be modeled by means of a cyclic sequence of LTI systems with stationary noise terms. Channels according to the behavioral model are generated based on the physical structure of the network. The model for this physical structure comprises: the wiring, characterized as a set of terminated transmission lines connected in a tree-like fashion; and the electrical appliances, which are modeled as electric bipoles acting as impedances and <b>noise</b> sources. The <b>simulator</b> can perform the calculation of the channel frequency response and noise power spectral density at the receiver given a network topology. Afterwards, a channel simulation can be carried out using two banks of filters, one for the LPTV channel response and the other to obtain cyclostationary noise by filtering AWGN. Some test results for the channel generation and simulation are presented, and practical applications of this simulator are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Motion {{simulators}} {{are widely}} employed in basic and applied research {{to study the}} neural mechanisms of perception and action during inertial stimulation. In these studies, uncontrolled simulator-introduced noise inevitably leads to a disparity between the reproduced motion and the trajectories meticulously designed by the experimenter, possibly resulting in undesired motion cues to the investigated system. Understanding actual simulator responses to different motion commands is therefore a crucial yet often underestimated step towards the interpretation of experimental results. In this work, we developed analysis methods based on signal processing techniques to quantify the noise in the actual motion, and its deterministic and stochastic components. Our methods allow comparisons between commanded and actual motion {{as well as between}} different actual motion profiles. A specific practical example from one of our studies is used to illustrate the methodologies and their relevance, but this does not detract from its general applicability. Analyses of the simulatorrsquo;s inertial recordings show direction-dependent noise and nonlinearity related to the command amplitude. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio is one order of magnitude higher for the larger motion amplitudes we tested, compared to the smaller motion amplitudes. Simulator-introduced noise is found to be primarily of deterministic nature, particularly for the stronger motion intensities. The effect of <b>simulator</b> <b>noise</b> on quantification of animal/human motion sensitivity is discussed. We conclude that accurate recording and characterization of executed simulator motion are a crucial prerequisite for the investigation of uncertainty in self-motion perception...|$|R
