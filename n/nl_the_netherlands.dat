40|$|Rationale: The optimal {{exercise}} training {{intensity and}} strategy for individualized exercise training in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is not clear. Objectives: This study compares {{the effects of}} nonlinear periodized exercise (NLPE) training used in athletes to traditional endurance and progressive resistance (EPR) training in patients with severe COPD. Methods: A total of 110 patients with severe COPD (FEV 1 32 % predicted) were randomized to EPR or NLPE. Exercise training was performed three times per week for 10 weeks. The primary outcomes were cycling endurance time and health-related quality of life using the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire. The difference in change between EPR and NLPE was assessed using linear mixed-effects modeling. Measurements and Main Results: NLPE resulted in significantly greater improvements in cycling endurance time compared with EPR. The difference in change was + 300. 6 seconds (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 197. 2 - 404. 2 s; P < 0. 001). NLPE also resulted in significantly greater improvements in all domains of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire compared with EPR, ranging from + 0. 48 (95 % CI = 0. 19 - 0. 78) for the domain, emotions, to + 0. 96 (95 % CI = 0. 57 - 1. 35) for dyspnea. Conclusions: NLPE results in greater improvements in cycle endurance and health-related quality of life in patients with severe COPD than traditional training methods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fibrocaps, a ready-to-use, dry-powder {{fibrin sealant}} {{containing}} human plasma-derived thrombin and fibrinogen, {{is being developed}} as an adjunct for surgical hemostasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Safety and efficacy of Fibrocaps applied directly or by spray device, in combination with gelatin sponge, was {{compared with that of}} gelatin sponge-alone in two randomized, single-blind controlled trials: FC- 002 US (United States) and FC- 002 <b>NL</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Netherlands).</b> A total of 126 adult patients were randomized (Fibrocaps: n = 47 [FC- 002 US], n = 39 [FC- 002 NL]; gelatin sponge alone: n = 23 [FC- 002 US], n = 17 [FC- 002 NL). One bleeding site was treated during a surgical procedure (n = 125). Time to hemostasis (primary end point) was measured, with a 28 -d safety follow-up. Four surgical indications included hepatic resection (n = 58), spinal procedures (n = 37), peripheral vascular procedures (n = 30), and soft tissue dissection (n = 1). RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) time to hemostasis was significantly shorter after Fibrocaps treatment than after gelatin sponge alone (FC- 002 US: 1. 9 [1. 3] versus 4. 8 min [3. 1], P < 0. 001; FC- 002 NL: 2. 2 [1. 3] versus 4. 4 min [3. 1], P = 0. 004). The incidence of hemostasis was greater after Fibrocaps compared with that of gelatin sponge alone within 3 min (FC- 002 US: 83 % versus 35 %, P < 0. 001; FC- 002 NL: 77 % versus 53 %, P = 0. 11), 5 min (94 % versus 61 %, P = 0. 001; 95 % versus 71 %, P = 0. 022), and 10 min (100 % versus 78 %, P = 0. 003; 100 % versus 82 %, P = 0. 025). Adverse events were consistent with surgical procedures performed and patients' underlying diseases and generally similar between treatment arms; most were mild or moderate in severity. Non-neutralizing antithrombin antibodies were detected in 5 % of Fibrocaps-treated patients on day 29.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} stress-induced martensite (SIM) formation in a Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al (Ti- 1023) alloy under compressive loading has been studied. At low temperatures, the stress level at which martensite starts to form increases linearly with the deformation temperature, while the stress at which the deformation switches to regular plastic deformation is roughly temperature independent. A thermostatistical model for dislocation evolution is employed to describe deformation twinning in martensite. Combined effects of twinning induced plasticity and solid solution strengthening are considered in terms of temperature variations. The SIM effect disappears on deformation at temperatures beyond s 233 C, which {{is close to the}} predicted Ms temperature of 240 C. The thermostatistical model predicts a transition from twinned martensite to pure slip at 250 C. By providing a model to predict stress induced martensite formation, and by describing deformation twinning, the present work provides a number of tools that may be employed to conceive new titanium alloys combining improved strength and ductility(Project number:MC 5. 05206) of the Materials Innovation Institute (www. m 2 i. <b>nl)</b> in <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands.</b> Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Project no.

The change in the transport properties is smaller in a diamagnetic gas, because the magnetic moment is not intrinsic (as it is in a paramagnetic gas), but induced by the rotation of a nonspherical molecule. The importance of the effect is that it provides information on the angular dependence of the intermolecular potential.

40|$|Background: When the resting energy {{expenditure}} (REE) of overweight and obese adolescents cannot {{be measured by}} indirect calorimetry, {{it has to be}} predicted with an equation. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the validity of published equations for REE compared with indirect calorimetry in overweight and obese adolescents. Design: Predictive equations based on weight, height, sex, age, fatfree mass (FFM), and fat mass were compared with measured REE. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry, and body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The accuracy of the REE equations was evaluated on the basis of the percentage of adolescents predicted within 10 % of REE measured, the mean percentage difference between predicted and measured values (bias), and the root mean squared prediction error (RMSE). Results: Forty-three predictive equations (of which 12 were based on FFM) were included. Validation was based on 70 girls and 51 boys with a mean age of 14. 5 y and a mean (Â±SD) body mass index SD score of 2. 93 Â± 0. 45. The percentage of adolescents with accurate predictions ranged from 74 % to 12 % depending on the equation used. The most accurate and precise equation for these adolescents was the Molnar equation (accurate predictions: 74 %; bias: - 1. 2 %; RMSE: 174 kcal/d). The often-used Schofield-weight equation for age 10 - 18 y was not accurate (accurate predictions: 50 %; bias: + 10. 7 %; RMSE: 276 kcal/d). Conclusions: Indirect calorimetry remains the method of choice for REE in overweight and obese adolescents. However, the sex-specific Molnar REE prediction equation appears to be the most accurate for overweight and obese adolescents aged 12 - 18 y.
