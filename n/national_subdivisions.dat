5|$|After the Act of Union 1800, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Act of Union 1801, the unreformed House of Commons was composed of 658 members, of whom 513 represented England and Wales. There were two types of constituencies; counties and boroughs. County members were supposed to represent landholders, while borough members were supposed to represent the mercantile and trading interests of the kingdom. Counties were historical <b>national</b> <b>subdivisions</b> established between the 8th and 16th centuries. They were not merely parliamentary constituencies: many components of government (including courts and the militia) were organised along county lines. The members of Parliament chosen by the counties were known as Knights of the Shire. In Wales each county elected one member, while in England each county elected two members until 1826, when Yorkshire's representation was increased to four, following the disenfranchisement of the Cornish borough of Grampound.|$|E

50|$|During its {{existence}} from 1919 to 1991, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic consisted of many administrative divisions.

5000|$|Prior to Peter's rule, Russia's {{administrative}} system was relatively antiquated {{compared to that}} in many Western European nations.

In 1708, Peter abolished these old <b>national</b> <b>subdivisions</b> and established in their place eight governorates (guberniyas): Moscow, Ingermanland, Kiev, Smolensk, Archangelgorod, Kazan, Azov, and Siberian.

50|$|Quadripoints {{can exist}} {{at the meeting}} of {{political}} subdivisions of any type(s) or level(s). The most common are in the United States and Canada, where the grid-based Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and Dominion Land Surveys (DLS), respectively, resulted in {{a large number of}} quadripoints at the corners of survey units such as DLS townships, PLSS townships, sections, and various other gridded subdivisions. The borders of U.S. counties and towns are often defined by survey townships. There are dozens of quadripoints between U.S. counties, hundreds between U.S. municipalities, and indeed thousands (of usually bilateral ones) on the edges of checkerboard-patterned Indian reservations and other federally reserved territories.

50|$|Khorasgan Town lies east of Isfahan {{on either}} side of Jey Highway {{connecting}} the city of Isfahan to southern and eastern provinces. It is located in Jey historical area, the town Salman Farsi, the fertile Zayandehrood Plain. Khorasgan stands at 15 degrees and 44 minutes east longitude of Greenwich meridian and 14 minutes of the north latitude of the Equator. It is 1548 meters above sea-level with an approximate 2.5% gradient to the north-east and a mean annual rainfall of 110 mm. The monograph on the geography of Khorasgan cites the area of this town and of the suburbs, residential and agricultural, as 47 km2. Viewed within the <b>national</b> <b>subdivisions,</b> Khorasgan is an affiliate of the Isfahan Province and the nucleus for the central division of this province with a population of over 70,000. Up until a few decades ago Khorasgan was outside Isfahan, but now linked to Isfahan, it has expanded several kilometers beyond Khorasgan, transforming into an area within Isfahan. The distance of Khorasgan Central Square to Ahmadabad Square is 4.5 km.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{role of the}} Anopheles vector in malaria {{transmission}} {{and the effect of}} climate on Anopheles populations are well established. Models of the impact of climate change on the global malaria burden now have access to high-resolution climate data, but malaria surveillance data tends to be less precise, making model calibration problematic. Measurement of malaria response to fluctuations in climate variables offers a way to address these difficulties. Given the demonstrated sensitivity of malaria transmission to vector capacity, this work tests response functions to fluctuations in land surface temperature and precipitation. Methods This study of regional sensitivity of malaria incidence to year-to-year climate variations used an extended Macdonald Ross compartmental disease model (to compute malaria incidence) built on top of a global Anopheles vector capacity model (based on 10 [*]years of satellite climate data). The predicted incidence was compared with estimates from the World Health Organization and the Malaria Atlas. The models and denominator data used are freely available through the Eclipse Foundation’s Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeller (STEM). Results Although the absolute scale factor relating reported malaria to absolute incidence is uncertain, there is a positive correlation between predicted and reported year-to-year variation in malaria burden with an averaged root mean square (RMS) error of 25 % comparing normalized incidence across 86 countries. Based on this, the proposed measure of sensitivity of malaria to variations in climate variables indicates locations where malaria is most likely to increase or decrease in response to specific climate factors. Bootstrapping measures the increased uncertainty in predicting malaria sensitivity when reporting is restricted to national level and an annual basis. Results indicate a potential 20 x improvement in accuracy if data were available at the level ISO 3166 – 2 <b>national</b> <b>subdivisions</b> and with monthly time sampling. Conclusions The high spatial resolution possible with state-of-the-art numerical models can identify regions most likely to require intervention due to climate changes. Higher-resolution surveillance data can provide {{a better understanding of how}} climate fluctuations affect malaria incidence and improve predictions. An open-source modelling framework, such as STEM, can be a valuable tool for the scientific community and provide a collaborative platform for developing such models. </p...|$|E
