5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, {{to the belief that}} he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E
5|$|Hitsugaya {{lived with}} his {{grandmother}} and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain {{in the history of}} Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru of foul play as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed Sōsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin on the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it by appealing to the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated.|$|E
5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E

[...] "If a man is second best, {{he might as well}} be dead," [...] says McGuire. He travels to a town with the {{intention}} of forcing a duel with Marshal Dan Blaine (Glenn Ford), who's renowned for his skill with a gun.|$|R
25|$|Lee {{refused to}} be killed {{in the same manner}} for his conviction, {{requesting}} instead that he be executed by firing squad, rejecting the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed to atone for the Mountain Meadows massacre.|$|E
25|$|Coffey also {{dismissed}} the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever received information about Kelli Ryan or her case in advance {{or that he}} ever met with A's Eric Leven. This runs contrary to Leven working alongside Coffey in several episodes and also is contrary to interviews given by Coffey where he clearly states that he meets with producers to learn and strategize about how to proceed with walkthroughs.|$|E
25|$|Working {{diligently}} on {{his defense}} at first base, McGwire bristled at the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a one-dimensional player. He was {{generally regarded as}} a good fielder in his early years, even winning a Gold Glove Award in 1990 – {{the only one that}} New York Yankees legend Don Mattingly would not win between 1985 and 1994. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense.|$|E

It was contrary to Spanish <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should receive from Dolores in private any assurance that the proposal {{in which she was}} so largely concerned was one to which she assented willingly, but her father at once fetched her in and formally presented her to Geoffrey as his promised wife, and a month later the marriage was solemnized at the church of St. Dominic.|$|R

25|$|The {{advocates of}} this anti-systematic {{interpretation}} {{do not see}} a contradiction between Plato's criticism of writing and the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> communicated his entire philosophy {{to the public in}} writing. They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues are not like this but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{historian}} Gordon S. Wood {{presented the}} first complete argument against Lee's authorship. Wood {{argues that the}} letters were almost certainly not written by Lee; nothing in Lee's papers or memoirs supported the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the author. Lee is not known ever to have written an extended piece for public consumption, and Wood concludes that the production of 181 pages of pamphlets in {{less than half a}} year was not his style.|$|E
25|$|During {{the congressional}} investigations, some {{passengers}} testified {{that during the}} voyage they heard Ismay pressuring Captain Edward J. Smith to go faster, in order to arrive in New York ahead of schedule and generate some free press about the new liner. The book The White Star Line: An Illustrated History (2000) by Paul Louden-Brown states that this was unlikely, and that Ismay's record {{does not support the}} <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had any motive to do so.|$|E

25|$|Strom's first notable {{incident}} since {{returning to}} the league that received attention by the NBA front office was during the 1974–75 NBA season. Strom officiated a game in Seattle and inadvertently pushed a woman who approached him at the scorer's table {{at the conclusion of}} the game. Seattle SuperSonics guard Fred Brown pushed Strom into the crowd as retaliation for what he had done to the woman. Bill Russell, who was coaching the SuperSonics at the time and referee Hugh Evans separated Strom and Brown from a further altercation. Strom originally was going to be suspended six games by commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, but was changed to a $600 fine. Strom went to the referees union to appeal the fine based on the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was trying to defend himself. The union did not follow through with the appeal, but the fine was rescinded a year later by new commissioner Larry O'Brien and Strom was reimbursed his fine payment.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 {{election}}, Bagapsh had {{run with}} Stanislav Lakoba as Vice Presidential candidate. The power-sharing deal between Bagapsh and Khajimba {{to end the}} post-election crisis meant that Lakoba could no longer become Vice President. Instead, after the new election on 12 January 2005, Lakoba was appointed Secretary of the Security Council on 17 February. When Khajimba resigned as Vice President on 28 May 2009 he declared that within the government he had received most support by Lakoba. On 18 August Lakoba himself handed his resignation over the Abkhazian citizenship crisis. In an interview with Caucasian Knot on 3 September Lakoba stated {{that he would not}} participate in the December 2009 presidential election and he called absurd the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would join the opposition. Nevertheless, {{in an interview with the}} newspaper Nuzhnaya on 17 November, Lakoba stated that as a private citizen he supported Khajimba's candidacy and he praised his work in the Security Council. On 4 December Lakoba had a statement read out on Abkhazian television in which he stressed that this was only his private opinion and that it should not be used by any of the election campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{arose from}} the media and other {{politicians}} that Patel's home ministry had failed to protect Gandhi. Emotionally exhausted, Patel tendered a letter of resignation, offering to leave the government. Patel's secretary persuaded him to withhold the letter, seeing it as fodder for Patel's political enemies and political conflict in India. However, Nehru sent Patel a letter dismissing any question of personal differences or desire for Patel's ouster. He reminded Patel of their 30-year partnership in the independence struggle and asserted that after Gandhi's death, it was especially wrong for them to quarrel. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and other Congressmen publicly defended Patel. Moved, Patel publicly endorsed Nehru's leadership and refuted any suggestion of discord, and dispelled any <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sought to be prime minister. Though the two committed themselves to joint leadership and non-interference in Congress party affairs, they would criticise each other in matters of policy, clashing {{on the issues of}} Hyderabad's integration and UN mediation in Kashmir. Nehru declined Patel's counsel on sending assistance to Tibet after its 1950 invasion by the People's Republic of China and on ejecting the Portuguese from Goa by military force. Nehru also tried to scuttle Patel's plan with regards to Hyderabad. During a meeting, according to the then civil servant MKK Nair in his book “With No Ill Feeling to Anybody”, Nehru shouted and accused Patel of being a communalist. Patel also one on occasion called Nehru, a Maulana, for appeasing Muslims.|$|E
25|$|His {{relations}} with Dobrogeanu-Gherea was tense, but, in 1890, Zamfirescu {{approved of the}} decision taken by the Theodor Rosetti cabinet to award the Romanian citizenship to the philosopher (at a time when his Jewish ethnicity {{would have made it}} extremely hard to obtain). The same year, Dobrogeanu-Gherea published a study of Zamfirescu's works. The two opposed each other over economic ideas and Dobrogeanu-Gherea's application of Marxism to the Romanian society—examining the works of Achille Loria, Zamfirescu collected Marxist-inspired <b>notions</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> believed, contradicted Dobrogeanu-Gherea from inside his own camp. When Maiorescu and the Romanian Marxists were engaged in a lengthy polemic, he added his own arguments in support of the former.|$|R
60|$|If a {{conjecture}} may be hazarded, {{the decision}} will probably depend mainly on one consideration, viz., {{which of the}} two systems is consistent with the greatest amount of human liberty and spontaneity. It is yet to be ascertained whether the communistic scheme would be consistent with that multiform development of human nature, those manifold unlikenesses, that diversity of tastes and talents, and variety of intellectual points of view, which not only form a great part of the interest of human life, but, by bringing intellects into stimulating collision and by presenting to each innumerable <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not have conceived of himself, are the mainspring of mental and moral progression.|$|R

He also cited the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a poor defender due to the belief that he lacked speed, while D'Antoni stated that Lin [...] "was one of the quickest athletes we've ever worked out".

500|$|Kruger {{was never}} more popular {{domestically}} {{than during the}} 1897–98 election campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier {{than he had been}} in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet—12,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and Schalk Willem Burger's 3,753—and was sworn in as President for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as President, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotzé, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a tyrant.

500|$|Favre spoke {{publicly}} {{for the first}} time about his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008, interview with Greta Van Susteren on the Fox News Channel's On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. In the interview, Favre said he was [...] "guilty of retiring early", that he was [...] "never fully committed" [...] to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the NFL Draft and the start of the free agent signing period. Favre disputed the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not want to play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same. He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team. Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.|$|E

As he proceeds through Dracula's castle, he learns that Dracula, the longtime antagonist of the Castlevania series, had been truly defeated, and that a prophecy had been made dictating that Dracula's powers would be passed down to his reincarnation. After defeating , who had harbored the <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Dracula's reincarnation, Soma realizes that he himself is Dracula's reincarnation. As a result, he is confronted by , the latest member of the Belmont clan, a group of vampire hunters sworn to hunt Dracula until his demise.

5000|$|In {{an essay}} written in 1996, Johnson {{wrote of the}} {{intelligent}} design movement that [...] "My colleagues and I speak of 'theistic realism' — or sometimes, 'mere creation' — as the defining concept of our movement. This means that we affirm that God is objectively real as Creator, and that the reality of God is tangibly recorded in evidence accessible to science, particularly in biology." [...] Johnson presents theistic realism as a philosophical justification for intelligent design in his 1998 book, Reason in the Balance. According to Johnson, true knowledge begins with the acknowledgment of God as creator of the universe, the unifying characteristic {{of which is that}} it was created by God. Theistic realism relies on a concept of God which involves the <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> is real, personal, and acting in the world through mechanistic creationism.|$|R
