The selectivities to primary alcohols with an optimized C 2 -C 5 slate usually exceeded the 50 wt % level, and the combined selectivities to 1 -alcohols/ 1 -alkenes reached up to ∼ 73 wt % for CO conversions ranging between ∼ 5 % and nearly 20 %. The bimodal <b>nanosized</b> <b>particle</b> distribution, achieved through oxalate coprecipitation, contained Co-Cu particles with sizes ranging from 25 to 40 nm.

Good predictions are obtained of major oxidation and pyrolysis products, as well as of trace species, particulate concentrations, and particle size distributions.

40|$|Drug nanocrystals are a {{versatile}} option for drug delivery purposes, {{and while the}} number of poorly soluble drug materials is all the time increasing, more research in this area is performed. Drug nanocrystals have a simple structure—a solid drug core is surrounded by a layer of stabilizing agent. However, despite the considerably simple structure, the selection of an appropriate stabilizer for a certain drug can be challenging. Mostly, the stabilizer selection is based purely on the requirement of physical stability, e. g., maintaining the <b>nanosized</b> <b>particle</b> size as long as possible after the formation of drug nanocrystals. However, it is also worth taking into account that stabilizer can affect the bioavailability in the final formulation via interactions with cells and cell layers. In addition, formation of nanocrystals is only one process step, and for the final formulation, more excipients are often added to the composition. The role of the stabilizers in the final formulation can be more than only stabilizing the nanocrystal particle size. A good example is the stabilizer’s role as cryoprotectant during freeze drying. In this review, the stabilizing effect, role of stabilizers in final nanocrystalline formulations, challenges in reaching in vitro–in vivo correlation with nanocrystalline products, and stabilizers’ effect on higher bioavailability are discussed...|$|E

However, the removal mechanisms of <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> are far from clear, especially because no direct experimental data are available to backup theoretical models in the literature. This study combines a theoretical approach based on a force analysis with an experimental study of the removal of <b>nanosized</b> slurry <b>particles.</b> In the theoretical part, all forces affecting the adhesion and the removal of particles are evaluated to determine which are dominant in two extreme removal mechanisms: lifting and rolling. In the experimental part, the removal efficiency of 34 nm SiO 2 particles is investigated by using the haze approach. Based on a study of the aging of contaminated wafers, conditions are selected where no chemical bonds are formed between a particle and a substrate. Force analysis and experimental observations both show that <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> cannot be lifted directly by a brush. Instead, rolling should be the main particle-removal mechanism. The average fluid film thickness between brush and wafer surface is determined based on power measurements of the brush motor and a friction analysis, indicating that the system is in a hydrodynamic lubrication regime across a wafer in average.

40|$|The use of MgO {{nanoparticles}} in polyethylene {{for cable}} insulation has attracted considerable interest, although in humid media the surface {{regions of the}} nanoparticles undergo a conversion to a hydroxide phase. A facile method to obtain MgO nanoparticles with a large surface area and remarkable inertness to humidity is presented. The method involves (a) low temperature (400 °C) thermal decomposition of Mg(OH) 2, (b) a silicone oxide coating to conceal the nanoparticles and prevent interparticle sintering upon exposure to high temperatures, and (c) heat treatment at 1000 °C. The formation of the hydroxide phase on these silicone oxide-coated MgO nanoparticles after extended exposure to humid air was assessed by thermogravimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction.

For theoretical treatment of the salting-out effect on the swelling behaviors, this study proposes a nonrandom contact (NRC) model that considers the occupation of salt molecules on the nearest lattice sites of gel molecules, inspired from Guggenheim&# 39;s approach. To be specific, salt-dependent interchange energy ((epsilon) over tilde (salt)) is introduced to the mixing contribution term to overcome a major limitation of classical Donnan-type approaches, which is that such approaches have poor applicability of conventional ionic models to noncharged gel systems and thermosensitivity. This study then combined three closed-packed lattice models (modified double lattice (MDL) model, modified Flory-Huggins (MFH) model, and Xin model) with the NRC model to evaluate its general applicability. Remarkably improved results are observed with one additional model parameter from the NRC model when applied to the three lattice models.

30|$|Controlled {{delivery}} of drug using carrier materials {{is based on}} two strategies: active and passive targeting. The former is technical sophisticated and suffering from many difficulties. Otherwise, the latter is easier to implement practically [46]. Many formulations {{have been used in}} the representative passive-targeting strategies based on the EPR effect [47]. Tumor vessels are often dilated and fenestrated due to rapid formation of vessels that can serve the fast-growing tumor while normal tissues contain capillaries with tight junctions that are less permeable to <b>nanosized</b> <b>particle</b> [11, 48]. The EPR effect is that macromolecules can accumulate in the tumor at concentrations five to ten times higher than in normal tissue within 1 to 2 days [49]. Besides, biomaterials with diameters more than 100 nm tend to migrate toward the cancer vessel walls [50]. Therefore, the EPR effect enables ECCNSs (secondary nanoparticles) to permeate the tumor vasculature through the leaky endothelial tissue and then accumulate in solid tumors. On one hand, the uptake of ECCNSs by tumor cells can lead to the direct release of etoposide into intracellular environment to kill tumor cells. On the other hand, the pH-sensitive drug release behavior for ECCNSs may lead to the low release of etoposide from ECCNSs in pH neutral blood, and the rapid release of the drug in relatively acidic extracellular fluids in the tumor. In this way, the targeted {{delivery of}} etoposide to tumor tissues may be possible by ECCNSs.|$|E
