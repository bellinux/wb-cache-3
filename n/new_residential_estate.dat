5000|$|The {{architect}} Rafael Masó Valentí {{was instructed}} by the Ensesa family {{to design a}} <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estate</b> at S'Agaró. It {{was designed as a}} self-contained garden city. At the same time swimming pools at Sant Pol were built as well as the luxurious Monumental Hotel and the Hotel Gavina. In 1962 as part of new tourist development the municipality changed its name from Fanals d'Aro to Platja d'Aro. The council moved their offices at the same time from Castell d'Aro to Platja d'Aro. The town sought to promote itself internationally; in 1964 an offer was made for a week holiday to 50 couples celebrating their silver wedding anniversary. Another campaign focused on honeymooners with the slogan [...] "love is found in Platja d'Aro".|$|E
40|$|Parklakes 2 is a <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estate</b> on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. Runoff {{from the}} {{development}} was originally {{planned to be}} treated by a 2. 6 ha constructed wetland. The estimated {{costs associated with the}} constructed wetland were significant. In addition, any potential water quality improvements would not be realised until approximately 60 % of the estate was completed. As an alternative solution, Covey Associates, in collaboration with the University of the Sunshine Coast and the local Council, developed a novel approach where the constructed wetland would be replaced by a lake with a 2, 100 m 2 floating wetland treatment system (FWTS). A construction cost comparison of the two treatment approaches was conducted and {{it was found that the}} FWTS approach yielded savings of almost $ 1 million compared to the constructed wetland. In addition to the cost savings, the FWTS will be operational by the first stage of the development, which provides greater water quality benefits, as well as higher amenity for residents. Increased open water areas are known to translate to higher property values and social benefits for the whole development which could potentially lead to further increased sales and property values. The development is also the subject of an on-going stormwater quality evaluation study...|$|E

In 1987, the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line began operation, connecting most of these housing estates and the city centre.|$|R
50|$|In July 2008, Herts and Essex High School and Bishop's Stortford High School {{submitted}} a planning application to merge {{to a single}} site funded by the building of <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> on their existing land. This met with vigorous opposition, most notably from the Bishop's Stortford Civic Federation. Over 930 letters of objection were received, and eventually the plan collapsed in September 2009 {{just prior to the}} planning hearing when the schools withdrew their application.|$|R
50|$|A {{primary school}} opened in 1980, {{relieving}} pressure on that of nearby Eaton, and {{was followed by}} a high school which opened in 1987. <b>New</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> opened, and in the mid-1980s the State Government and the Shire of Harvey made plans to relocate most of the industries to a new industrial park at nearby Kemerton. By 2001, Australind was predominantly residential, the census reporting over 10,000 residents, more than half of whom were first- or second-generation British immigrants, with a notable Italian minority.|$|R
25|$|As {{the name}} implies, the line connects central Singapore to the {{north-eastern}} and south-western {{parts of the}} island. It passes through busy areas such as Chinatown, Clarke Quay and Dhoby Ghaut (which have historical and cultural value), and through the mature and <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> at Potong Pasir, Serangoon, Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol. The North East Line passes through the Eu Tong Sen Street, Serangoon Road, Bendemeer Underpass, Upper Serangoon Road and the Upper Serangoon Viaduct.

50|$|The {{sites of}} all three new {{stations}} were in semi-rural locations and, as it had elsewhere, it was intended that {{the opening of the}} new section of Underground line would stimulate the construction of <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> that the stations would then serve. After the war, new legislation was introduced to limit the continuing expansion of urban areas into their surrounding countryside. This legislation created the Metropolitan Green Belt around London and the area designated included the area covered by the new Northern line extension. Without the possibility of constructing the new housing estates, the new line had no purpose and the plans for the extension were cancelled in 1950.|$|R
50|$|The village {{contains}} facilities {{such as a}} school, churches, community {{hall and}} convenience retail outlets and low to medium order services. Recent development includes the construction of <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> to the north-west of the village and {{to the south of}} Main Street. The village centre comprises Main Street and includes retail, commercial, institutional, educational and residential functions. Landmark buildings include St. Canice's Church, Roman Catholic, the Ossory of Borris-in-Ossory, and former courthouse. The renovated O’Brien Hall has a communal and recreational role within the local community. As of 2011, the O'Brien Hall is now used as a meeting place for the town's revived Youth Club, among other activities.|$|R

5000|$|Drogheda Port {{advanced}} {{plans to}} develop {{the mouth of the}} Boyne around the tower as a modern deepwater port facility in the late 1990s but the inability to locate the owner of the old boathouse there delayed the project. A road corridor had already been laid into the development plan of the area disallowing residential building along the route from the Dublin Road. The lands were however designated as the Boyne Estuary (1996) and Boyne Coast and Estuary SACs (Special Areas of Conservation) by Dúchas and this put paid to the plans. However initial dredging of the river channel took place in 1999-2000, and the facility at Tom Roe's Point went ahead after renewed dredging in the channel of the river in 2006. Plans for an East Meath deep-water port shifted to the Gormanston/Bremore area at the same time. Thereafter much of the Mornington area in 2005 was rezoned by Meath County Council and has since been developed for <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{campus is}} home to the UWS Rotary Observatory, {{designed}} by Dr. Ragbir Bhathal, consisting of two observing domes of 4.5m and 2.9m diameter respectively, opened on 15 July 2000. The observatory is principally utilised for Optical S.E.T.I. research but also hosts community astronomy nights, in collaboration with Macarthur Astronomical Society. In 2013 the observatory was relocated {{to make way for a}} <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> housing <b>estate</b> to the south of the campus. It was reopened in a new location on 2 October 2014. The campus also provides the venue for the Macarthur Astronomy Forum.|$|R
40|$|As global populations grow, {{cities are}} {{stretching}} their urban boundaries into {{rural areas and}} bringing the challenges of biodiversity conservation into the backyards of homeowners. Planning controls can attempt to regulate residents’ behaviours to support conservation actions for threatened species but need to consider whether community attitudes align with conservation objectives. This study investigated community attitudes towards planned management interventions in a new conservation strategy designed to protect endangered Southern Brown Bandicoots in <b>new</b> <b>residential</b> <b>estates</b> around Cranbourne, Australia. A survey (n =  318, response rate 15. 2 per cent) investigated current resident attitudes towards bandicoot conservation, cat ownership and effectiveness of current planning controls. Results indicate community support {{for a range of}} bandicoot conservation actions including confinement of domestic cats and non-lethal cat controls and for new developments being cat-free with bandicoot habitat corridors. Awareness of bandicoots correlated with higher support for conservation actions while cat owners were less supportive overall, particularly to limitations on cat ownership. Potential barriers to management interventions include inadequate knowledge, perceived associated risks and housing turnover. This information is valuable for conservation planning for new developments and to improve implementation of planning controls in existing residential areas for delivery of long-term protection for threatened species like Southern Brown Bandicoots...|$|R
