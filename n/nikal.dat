2500|$|In May 2004 the Phoenix {{announced}} {{that they had the}} funding to construct a new temporary ice rink but problems arose as to exactly where to locate the facility.

5000|$|For example, en Hindi-Urdu, <b>nikal</b> gayā (निकल गया, نِکَل گَیا, lit. [...] "exit went") means 'went out', while <b>nikal</b> paṛā (निकल पड़ा, نِکَل پَڑا, lit. [...] "exit fell") means 'departed' or 'was blurted out'. In these {{examples}} <b>nikal</b> (निकल, نِکَل, lit. [...] "exit") {{is the primary}} verb, and gayā (गया, گَیا, lit. [...] "went") and paṛā (पड़ा, پَڑا, lit. [...] "fell") are the vectors or [...] "light verbs". Compound verbs in Hindi-Urdu have the additional property of alternation. That is, under partly specifiable conditions as negation compound verbs like <b>nikal</b> gayā and <b>nikal</b> paṛā are replaced with a non-compound counterpart [...] {{with little or no}} change in meaning. However, the phenomenon of alternation is not found in all languages that have compound verbs.|$|E
