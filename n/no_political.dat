5|$|Eventually {{the central}} {{positions}} of the royal household became little else than honorary titles bestowed upon the greatest families, and not necessarily even dependent on attendance at court. In Flanders, by the thirteenth century, the offices of constable, butler, steward and chamberlain had become the hereditary right of certain high noble families, and held <b>no</b> <b>political</b> significance.|$|E

Henry gave the Château of Chenonceau, which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, {{who took her}} place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, then-Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing {{said that}} if a {{minority}} candidate leaves their group representation constituency (GRC), a by-election will not be called.

5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} contexts {{and not in}} daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have <b>no</b> <b>political</b> implications as the region is not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders. In some circumstances, the term Skåneland, {{as opposed to the}} terms Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, can also be used as a figure of speech for the province Scania.|$|E
5|$|Although, the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad had <b>no</b> <b>political</b> {{power the}} office {{continued}} to be held by the second Nawab Bahadur Syed Wasif Ali Meerza Khan Bahadur, who had held the office since 1906, and {{after his death in}} 1959, he was succeeded by his son, Syed Wasif Ali Meerza Khan Bahadur. Waris Ali Meerza died in 1969, survived by his three sons and three daughters. According to the Nawab’s law, the eldest son of the Nawab succeeded him, however, Waris Ali's eldest son, Wakif Ali Meerza Bahadur, was excluded from the succession by his father for contracting a non-Muslim marriage and for not professing the Muslim religion.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had <b>no</b> <b>political</b> value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E

The Saudi press is strictly censored and articles on Saudi dissidents are banned. Saudi censorship is considered among the most restrictive {{in the world and the}} country blocks broad swathes of the Internet. After protests occurred in early 2011, the government banned all public demonstrations and marches.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with <b>no</b> <b>political</b> office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it {{to him as a}} gift on his return to Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|The Plebeian Council (concilium plebis) was the {{principal}} popular gathering of the Roman Republic. As the name suggests, the Plebeian Council was organized as a Council, and not as an Assembly. It functioned as a gathering through which the Plebeians (commoners) could pass laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. This council had <b>no</b> <b>political</b> power until the offices of Plebeian Tribune and Plebeian Aedile were created in 494 BC, due to the Plebeian Secession that year.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{soon became}} a major entrepôt thanks to its free port status, {{attracting}} new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe. The society, however, remained racially segregated and polarised under early British colonial policies. Despite {{the rise of a}} British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas such as Victoria Peak. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had <b>no</b> <b>political</b> representation in the British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population.|$|E
5|$|In {{his article}} of 2002, Alan A. Stone, {{who as a}} member of team had {{examined}} Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was <b>no</b> <b>political</b> abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted {{that it was time for}} psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone's words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.|$|E

5|$|Michael Hart {{arrived in}} Lyttelton {{with his wife}} and their two sons on the Cressy on 27 December 1850, one of the First Four Ships {{reaching}} Canterbury. Before he came out to New Zealand, he had been a plumber. Hart founded the White Hart on the corner of High and Cashel Streets, the first hotel in Christchurch. The hotel opened on 15 November 1851, {{less than a year after}} the organised settlement of Christchurch. In December 1852, Hart catered for 150 guests who had assembled to farewell John Robert Godley, the founder of Canterbury who returned to England after his short stay in the colony. A well-known man, Hart had <b>no</b> <b>political</b> experience; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had <b>no</b> <b>political</b> representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
5|$|The Vance {{plan was}} {{designed}} to stop fighting in Croatia and allow negotiations to proceed without the impact of ongoing hostilities. It offered <b>no</b> <b>political</b> solutions in advance. The plan entailed the deployment of the 10,000-strong United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the three major conflict areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). The plan listed specific municipalities that were {{to be included in}} each UNPA, but the exact borders of each UNPA were not defined clearly because several municipalities were only to be partially included. The task of defining the exact borders of each UNPA was delegated to the UN liaison officers deployed in advance, in co-operation with authorities in each area. Creation of the UNPAs was necessary for acceptance of the plan by Milošević and Tuđman. The Serb-dominated authorities of Yugoslavia originally requested the deployment of a UN force along a zone between Serb and Croatian areas, reflecting the Serb desire to see the peacekeeping force securing the confrontation lines. Croatia wanted the UN force deployed along its international borders. The UNPAs served to formally satisfy both parties.|$|E
