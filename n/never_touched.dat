5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on one corner of the dome in the 1930s. An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E
5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep concern in the {{personal}} welfare of all players, which extended to finding {{the location of the}} nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E

500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if you have it all the time—the passion is only for something that you don't have. You have to work to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E

[...] On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details.

500|$|In October 1994, film {{students}} Heather, Mike, and Josh set out {{to produce}} a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, and interview residents about the legend. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit {{who lived in the}} woods and kidnapped eight children in the 1940s. After spending the night at a motel, the students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to research the legend. Along the way, they meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted. He also tells them of a young girl named Robin Weaver who went missing in 1888. When she returned three days later, she talked about [...] "an old woman whose feet <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> the ground." [...] However, his companion is skeptical of the story. The students then hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century, their bodies later disappearing. The group then camps for the night.|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} play Padres catcher Michael Barrett {{attempted}} to block home plate from Holliday's slide while receiving {{the ball on}} a throw from Brian Giles. Holliday arrived at the plate before the ball did and the ball bounced away from Barrett. Some controversy arose after the game as to whether Holliday had actually touched home plate or if Barrett had successfully blocked him. Several sportswriters, such as Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports and Mark Kiszla of The Denver Post, said outright that Holliday <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> the plate. Kiszla referred to the moment humorously, saying [...] "When folks retell this story 100 years from now, he still will not have touched home plate." [...] Padres manager Bud Black and first base umpire Ed Montague both agreed with McClelland's safe call. Barrett said he was unsure but [...] "never, ever second-guessed Tim McClelland at home plate." [...] If McClelland had ruled Holliday had not touched the plate during his slide Barrett {{would have had the}} chance to tag out Holliday, preventing the winning run.|$|E

500|$|In the 1985–86 season, Wark made 18 appearances, scoring six times, {{but missed}} out on the club's run-in to their League and FA Cup [...] "double", due to a broken ankle {{suffered}} just {{after the turn of}} 1986, followed by an Achilles tendon injury. [...] He eventually regained his fitness but struggled to regain his place in the Liverpool team until injury to Steve McMahon allowed him back in. [...] Wark came on as a late substitute (but according to him, <b>never</b> <b>touched</b> the ball) when Liverpool lost the 1987 League Cup Final to Arsenal. No longer a part of manager Kenny Dalglish's plans following the arrival of new midfielders including John Barnes, Wark was sold back to Ipswich on 4 January 1988 for £100,000. [...] In spite of more financially lucrative offers from both Watford and Coventry City, he followed Bobby Robson's advice: [...] "Money isn't everything—go where you will be happiest."

[...] Rob Lowman of the Los Angeles Daily News enjoyed the show and Chopra's performance, saying: [...] "Although a bit over-frenetic at times, the series seems to take inspiration from a man-on-the run Hitchcock thriller. Only in Quantico's case it's a woman, and they have a charismatic star in Chopra. I was immediately struck by her dynamic screen presence. So far it’s one of the most-promising new shows, and Chopra is someone worth keeping an eye on." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter, in a lukewarm review, found its pilot [...] "just good enough to make you watch another." [...] Although TheWrap's Tim Grierson wrote that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", [...] "For a show about highly trained, incredibly intelligent agents, Quantico often succumbs to lame-brained plotting and a less-than-convincing portrayal of its specialized milieu. This new show's fluffy, which doesn’t fit so well with the darker, somber tones meant to be struck by the introduction of a cataclysmic terrorist attack." ...|$|E
