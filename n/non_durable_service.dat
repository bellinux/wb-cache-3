40|$|I {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} long-run consumption growth risk and housing consumption risk on asset prices. Current asset values {{are affected by the}} risk-return tradeoff in the long-run. Housing {{plays an important role in}} the economy both as an asset and as a consumption component. As an asset, it is particularly sensitive to long-run riskreturn trade off; as a consumption component, it accounts for one fifth of the total expenditures in <b>non</b> <b>durable</b> goods and <b>services.</b> The investment horizon for housing is usually distant in the future. Investors fear shocks that affect the value of their house for a long period of time. Such shocks vary substantially the services obtained from the house and its price as an asset as well. I use a non-separable utility function with non-housing consumption and consumption of housing services, which generates an intertemporal composition risk, besides the traditional consumption growth risk. The composition risk determines the valuation of cash flow growth fluctuations far into the future due to the persistence of consumption growth. I provide a closed form solution for the valuation function and discount factor of the consumers. This allows me to quantify the price of risk in the long-run with inputs from vector autoregressions.

For that, we propose a new form of Stone-Lewbel (SL) cross section prices developed under latent separability that explore individual specific variation in the composition of the bundles of exclusive goods. The estimation of demand system under latent separability needs the choice of at least one exclusive good per group. We estimate Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QAIDS) under weak and latent separability using traditional aggregate price indices and SL prices. Our empirical analysis is based on fifteen <b>non</b> <b>durable</b> goods of a Tunisian Family Expenditure Survey Data.

To this end, standard consumption equations are estimated and then compared, in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive ability, with corresponding models which differ from them {{only because of the}} presence of the confidence indicator. Unlike mainstream literature, the present work focuses on the relationships between subjective and objective information at a less aggregate level. In particular, the overall sentiment index is divided into four sub-indices related to the opinion about the i) current, ii) future, iii) general, and iv) personal situation. In turn, the total private consumption is divided in five items. The idea behind is to check if one attitudinal measure is more or less informative than another, and if some outlay is more or less “sentiment sensitive” than another. It is shown that the qualitative information obtained from household surveys improves both the goodness- of-fit of consumption equations and their forecasting performances.

There are two features of our study. (1) We install a spring structure {{for the sake of}} reducing the damage rate of glare shields. When glare shields suffer from strong wind, a flexible structure located at base can let glare shields curve and spring back to original position, and therefore endures more powerful wind hit. In addition, the spring back function lets the guide post automatically return to original position to block strong light and protect drivers. This structure will have more <b>durable</b> <b>service</b> life, so, {{it can be used to}} reduce the maintenance times, and cost for the users. (2) We add solar LED light on the body of a glare shield, that can enhance the alert function when attacked by strong wind on the night time or insufficient light and then reduce the accident rate...|$|R
