5|$|Historians <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> {{that there}} was likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command of}} João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E
5|$|At 16:00 the {{regiment}} was attacked in force, but the Turks withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. But the British attack elsewhere had failed, and some units {{had been forced}} to retire, leaving {{the regiment}} exposed. They fought off attacks throughout the night, until 05:00 the next morning. Then for two hours they were harassed with sniper fire and hand grenades. Meldrum asked the brigade for reinforcements and more ammunition. There were no reserves of ammunition available and the only reinforcements were forty men from the 6th Battalion Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) who were sent to assist, but did not arrive until noon. At 14:00 Meldrum reported he could <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> out until nightfall and at 22:30 they were relieved {{by the rest of the}} Loyal Regiment and the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment. In the day's fighting the regiment, from a total of 173 all ranks, had lost forty-three dead and seventy-four wounded.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{more recent}} {{theories}} <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> that, if the Egyptian kingdom was divided, the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice, Francesco Tiradritti and Wolfgang Helck {{point to the}} once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Sakkara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen successfully {{took place during the}} entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E

25|$|The University of Southern California Trojans {{returned}} to the Rose Bowl Game presented by Citi in the first BCS game of 2007 on New Year's Day in Pasadena, California. Historically, the Rose Bowl has pitted the Pac-10 and Big Ten regular season champions. The Pac-10 champion Trojans played in a non-traditional Rose Bowl matchup with the University of Michigan Wolverines. What made this game a not-so-traditional matchup is that Michigan entered as the runner-up of the Big Ten, as the Big Ten champions Ohio State instead participated in the BCS Championship Game due to their No. 1 national ranking. Thanks to their win, the Trojans <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> a 6–2 lead in their eight meetings against the Wolverines in Pasadena.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Warner Bros. {{acquired}} the Peanuts catalog from Paramount {{for an undisclosed}} amount of money. As aforementioned, they <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> the worldwide distribution rights for all Peanuts properties including over 50 television specials—these are originally managed by Warner Bros. Television and Warner Bros. Television Animation. Warner has made plans to develop new specials for television {{as well as the}} direct to video market, as well as short subjects for digital distribution, and some of these have in fact already been released via Warner Premiere. Paramount retains the rights to the theatrical releases, as the first two movies (A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home) are owned by CBS and distributed for home video through Paramount while CTD distributes for television, and the other two (Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!)) were handled in-house by Paramount, with Trifecta holding TV distribution rights.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{the target}} failed to stay {{centered}} in the sighting telescope {{when it was first}} set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured ground speed used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over {{a short period of time}} of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> an extremely accurate measurement of the exact ground speed and heading. Better yet, these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with much more time to adjust his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.|$|E
25|$|Robb's forces dwindle further at the Battle of Duskendale, {{wherein the}} eastern half of the Stark's armies, under the command of Roose Bolton, are ambushed by a joint army under Gregor Clegane and Lord Randyll Tarly. More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile, the Greyjoys <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin, thus barring Robb from {{returning}} to his homeland. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord Hoster Tully dies, Catelyn's brother Edmure becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that Balon Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon's brothers, as well as his daughter Asha, vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb's marriage.|$|E
25|$|On {{the provincial}} level of government, the Progressive Conservatives, Liberals, and the New Democrats all hold electoral {{districts in the}} GTA. While the GTA {{provided}} a strong base {{of support for the}} Progressive Conservative government between 1995 and 2003, Dalton McGuinty and the Ontario Liberal Party roared to victory in the region during the 2003 election and has enjoyed strong support from the region ever since. In the 2011 election, the Liberals won 33 of the 44 available seats in the GTA. The 2014 election was an even bigger electoral landslide for the Liberals, as they <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> 38 seats in the region, including ridings like Durham, Burlington, Newmarket-Aurora and Halton, which had voted PC for decades. The PCs hold no seats in the Peel Region, and only one seat in each of the Halton, York, and Durham regions. While the NDP has been weak in the GTA since the 1995 election, they have seen some successes in Brampton and the Durham Region, where they hold one seat each.|$|E

25|$|The choreography for the {{character}} of Nikiya went through a renaissance in when performed by the virtuoso ballerina Dudinskaya, whose revisions to the choreography remain the standard. Although her interpretation of the tragic Nikiya was looked on as unsuitable for the stellar ballerina, she nevertheless excelled in The Kingdom of the Shades, where Petipa's strict academic patterns prevailed. In the Variation de Nikiya (often {{referred to as the}} Scarf Duet) Ponomarev and Chabukiani changed the original staging of Petipa - originally, this variation called for Nikiya to perform her variation alone, with a long veil connected by wire to a fly-space above the stage, with the veil flying upward upon the final moments of the variation. The variation was changed so that Solor would <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> one end of the veil as Nikiya danced, departing the stage half-way through her solo offstage. Dudinskaya studded the choreography with multiple tours en arabesque, and included, for the first time, airy splits in her Grand jetés during the Entrée de Nikiya, as well as adding fast piqué turns in the Grand coda. The choreography for Solor went through a renaissance as well with the great Premier danseur Chabukiani in the role. Although the dances for the role of Solor had become far more prominent since La Bayadère had been performed in Imperial Russia, Chabukiani's revisions to the choreography would become the standard for all proceeding male dancers.|$|E

500|$|Princes {{of royal}} blood could once more hold {{administrative}} titles, a prerogative {{they had lost}} during the early Fifth Dynasty. At the same time, viziers could <b>now</b> <b>hold</b> the prestigious titles of Iry-pat and Haty-a and, as [...] "overseer of the royal scribes", became {{the head of the}} scribal administration. At least one vizier, Seshemnefer III, even bore the title of [...] "king's son of his body", one of the most distinguished titles at the time and normally reserved to princes of royal blood. Yet neither Seshemnefer III's father nor his mother seems to have belonged to the royal family. For the period spanning the reign of Djedkare until that of Teti, viziers were furthermore responsible for the weaponry of the state, both for military and other purposes. Following the reforms undertaken by Djedkare, three viziers would be in office at the same time: two in the Memphite region and a Southern one, the [...] "governor of Upper Egypt", with a seat at Abydos. In total six viziers were appointed during Djedkare's reign.|$|E
