25|$|In May 2011 Lennart Poettering {{proposed}} systemd as a GNOME dependency. As systemd {{is available}} only on Linux, the proposal led {{to a discussion of}} possibly dropping support for other platforms in future GNOME releases. Since GNOME 3.2 multiseat support has been only available on systems using systemd. In November 2012 the GNOME release team concluded that systemd can be relied upon for <b>non-basic</b> functionality.|$|E
25|$|Land cards tap {{to produce}} mana {{that is used}} to cast spells and {{activate}} abilities. They cost no mana to play; however, a player may play no more than one land per turn, and only during the main phase {{of his or her own}} turn. There are six types of basic lands (Mountain, Plains, Forest, Island, Swamp, and Wastes), one for each color (plus Wastes for colorless). These lands can each be tapped to produce one mana of the appropriate color. Other lands are <b>non-basic</b> and may produce other combinations or amounts of mana, or may have other abilities. Lands are not spells and cannot be countered. Playing a land does not use the stack and therefore occurs immediately, with no way for any player to stop it. Players are allowed to have any number of basic lands in a deck, but nonbasic lands follow the usual restriction of four copies of any one card per deck.|$|E

Those are the key {{questions}} examined in this report, using data from the UK FES between 1975 and 1999. It looks not only at broad changes in total spending, but also at how the division of expenditure between basics and <b>non-basics</b> and between durable goods, non-durable goods and services has altered over time. ...|$|R
40|$|Proofs {{are given}} that only {{singularly}} can real 1750 �-� 2007 competitive price ratios be 'natural', {{in the sense}} of being invariant under changes in demand tastes. Proofs are given that both 1750 �-� 1870 discrete technologies or 1890 �-� 2007 continuum technologies, with convexity properties sufficient for arbitrage-proof supply-demand equilibria, will be 'intertemporally Pareto optimal', immune to leaving any deadweight (inefficient) losses on the table. Sraffa (1960), ignoring the vast post- 1945 linear and non-linear programming mathematical literature of Danzig, Kuhn-Tucker-Bellman, von Neumann, Ramsey literature does not quite arrive at attainable distribution solutions. Where it tolerates increasing or decreasing returns to scale, there can be no competitive equilibria. When its matrix equations do obey first-degree-homogeneous functions, the book's stress on Basics or <b>non-Basics</b> is an irrelevancy leading to bizarre novel interpretations of Ricardo. Old age overtakes us all. Alas, Sraffs's proposed critique of twentieth century political economy we {{will never be able to}} know.

2500|$|The {{first row}} defines the {{objective}} function {{and the remaining}} rows specify the constraints. (Note, different authors use different conventions as to the exact layout.) If the columns of A can be rearranged so that it contains the identity matrix of order p (the number of rows in A) then the tableau {{is said to be}} in canonical form. The variables corresponding to the columns of the identity matrix are called basic variables while the remaining variables are called nonbasic or free variables. If the values of the nonbasic variables are set to 0, then the values of the basic variables are easily obtained as entries in b and this solution is a basic feasible solution. The algebraic interpretation here is that the coefficients of the linear equation represented by each row are either , , or some other number. Each row will have [...] column with value , [...] columns with coefficients , and the remaining columns with some other coefficients (these other variables represent our <b>non-basic</b> variables). By setting the values of the <b>non-basic</b> variables we ensure in each row that the value of the variable represented by a [...] in its column is equal to the [...] value at that row.|$|E

50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} feature of ID is its distinction between basic and <b>non-basic</b> needs.

50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and <b>non-basic</b> needs.

Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, participatory economics guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.
