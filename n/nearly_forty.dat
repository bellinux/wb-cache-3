5|$|Around 1700 the Tsikoa began uniting {{around a}} series of {{powerful}} leaders. Ramanano, the chief of Vatomandry, was elected in 1710 {{as the leader of}} the Tsikoa ("those who are steadfast") and initiated invasions of the northern ports. According to oral histories, Ramanano established an armed militia at Vohimasina which he sent on incursions to burn neighboring villages, desecrate local tombs, and enslave the women and children, contributing to his reputation as a cruel and unpopular leader. A northern Betsimisaraka zana-malata named Ratsimilaho, who was born to the daughter of a local filohany and a British pirate named Tom Tew around 1694 and had briefly traveled with his father to England and India, led a resistance to these invasions and successfully united his compatriots around this cause despite his young age. He captured Fenerive in 1712, causing the Tsikoa to flee across soggy red fields of clay that stuck to their feet, earning them the new name of Betanimena ("Many of Red Earth"). Ratsimilaho was elected king of all the Betsimisaraka and given a new name, Ramaromanompo ("Lord Served by Many") at his capital at Foulpointe. He gave his northern compatriots the name Betsimisaraka to reaffirm their unity in the face of their enemies. He then negotiated peace with the Betanimena by offering their king control over the port of Tamatave, but this settlement fell apart after six months, leading Ratsimilaho to recapture Tamatave and force the Betanimena king to flee south. He established alliances with the southern Betsimisaraka and the neighboring Bezanozano, extending his authority over these areas by allowing local chiefs to maintain their power while offering tribute of rice, cattle and slaves; by 1730 he was one of the most powerful kings of Madagascar. By the time of his death in 1754, his moderate and stabilizing rule had provided <b>nearly</b> <b>forty</b> years of unity among the diverse clans within the Betsimisaraka political union. He also allied the Betsimisaraka with the other most powerful kingdom of the time, the Sakalava of the west coast, through marriage with Matave, the only daughter of Iboina king Andrianbaba.|$|E

40|$|Communities {{around the}} U. S. are {{beginning}} to see the ill-effects of traditional methods of waste disposal. Landfill sites are filling to the brim with wasted materials that have the potential to be re-used in non-traditional, sustainable practices of disposal. More than 25 % of U. S. waste being buried and forgotten about is composed of organic material—material that is not only biodegradable, but material that {{has the potential to be}} used as a source of renewable energy. For the City of Durango, CO, harnessing this potential energy for the benefit of its residents is not an improbable idea. Durango Wastewater Treatment Facility (DWTF) is in possession of the primary infrastructure needed for capturing this energy, a technology called an Anaerobic Digester. Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a process which breaks down organic content such as food waste and sewage sludge in an environment free of oxygen. After complex stages that continuously break apart the organic contents take place, a by-product of biogas and digestate are left-over, both with beneficial attributes. To fully understand this process, I have conducted interviews with the DWTF manager of operations Larry Clinton. Further secondary resources have also been used throughout my research, including case studies of community treatment facilities that already utilize AD for a source of renewable energy. DWTF is currently “energy-independent” as a result of the energy its Anaerobic Digester produces, meaning it relies on no outside resources for energy/electricity to heat and operate the facility. In fact, there is <b>nearly</b> a <b>forty</b> percent over-production of energy necessary to operate the facility on a daily basis. For the City of Durango, I suggest in this thesis that utilization of the existing Anaerobic Digester at DWTF could further maximize the capture of renewable energy from organic waste. Through the integration of additional organic contents (co-digestion) and the installation of a second methane turbine, the community can then make efficient use of locally generated food waste. A final analysis of the collected data will allow for a recommendation of the necessary steps to apply this source of renewable energy to Durango’s power grid...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that virus receptors {{are the main}} determinants for permissiveness as shown for poliovirus by Holland and Mc Laren <b>nearly</b> for <b>forty</b> years. The early steps of reproduction of human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV 14) were studied to what ex-tent the virus receptor ICAM- 1 alone determinates the infection of cells. BHK cells that lacks the virus receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM 1) were not suscepti-ble by HRV- 14. As permissive cells HeLa cells were used. To study {{the influence of the}} virus receptor about the susceptibility of cells BHK cells were transfected with ICAM- 1 (BHK-ICAM- 1 cells). I could show for HeLa cells that HRV- 14 is internalized via coated pits and coated vesicles by receptor-mediated endocytosis. A pH-dependent entry mechanism could by demonstrated by exploiting the action of monensin as an ionophore which raises the pH in the acidic endosomes and lysosomes. The progeny of new rhinoviruses was detected by transmission electron microscopy and the measure of infectious virus by plaque titration. Differently, the HRV- 14 infection proceeded at BHK-ICAM 1 -cells. In contrast to HeLa cells virus internalization into BHK-ICAM- 1 cells were receptor mediated, too. But nei-ther a synthesis of viral RNA nor a production of infectious rhinoviruses was detected. Long chains of virus particles were located in membrane tubes. Virus particles were lined up in these channels like pearls on a string, but did not induce a productive infec-tion. ICAM- 1 acts as a functional virus receptor on the transfected cells as shown in infection experiments with coxsackievirus A 21. This virus, as HRV- 14, utilizes ICAM- 1 as its receptor. Coxsackievirus A 21 replicated in BHK-ICAM- 1 cells in titers similar to those of HeLa cells. These results suggest that ICAM- 1 was not sufficient to render transfected BHK cells permissive to HRV- 14. The replication of HRV- 14 in BHK-ICAM- 1 cells was blocked directly during its uncoating or shortly after. It is not clearly if the blockade is localizing at the step of the initiation of viral translation or the step of the initiation of viral transcription...|$|R

6000|$|... § 12. I say [...] "perfectly horizontal," [...] meaning, of course, {{in general}} tendency. It {{is more or}} less {{irregular}} and broken, but so nearly horizontal that, after some prolonged examination of the data I have collected about the Matterhorn, I am at this moment in doubt which is its top. For as, in order to examine the beds on its flanks, I walked up the Zmutt glacier, I saw that the line a b in Fig. 31 gradually lost its steepness; and about half-way up the glacier, the conjectural summit a then bearing <b>nearly</b> S. E. (<b>forty</b> degrees east of south), I found the contour was as in Fig. 32. In Fig. 33, I have given the contour as seen from Zermatt; and in all three, the same letters indicate the same points. In the Figures 32 and 33 I measured the angles with the greatest care,[61] from the base lines x y, which are accurately horizontal; and their general truth, irrespective of mere ruggedness, may be depended upon. Now in this flank view, Fig. 32, what was the summit at Zermatt, a, becomes quite subordinate, and the point b, far down the flank in Forbes's view taken from the Riffelhorn, is here the apparent summit. I was for some time in considerable doubt which of the appearances was most trustworthy; and believe now that they are both deceptive; for I found, on ascending the flank of the hills {{on the other side of}} the Valais, to a height of about five thousand feet above Brieg, between the Aletsch glacier and Bietschhorn; being thus high enough to get a view of the Matterhorn on something like distant terms of equality, up the St. Nicholas valley, it presented itself under the outline Fig. 34, which seems to be conclusive for the supremacy of the point e, between a and b in Fig. 33. But the impossibility of determining, at the foot of it, without a trigonometrical observation, which is the top of such an apparent peak as the Matterhorn, may serve to show the reader how little the eye is to be trusted for the verification of peaked outline.|$|R
60|$|An {{elevator}} is as ugly {{a monster}} {{as has been}} yet produced. In uncouthness of form it outdoes those obsolete old brutes who used to roam about the semi-aqueous world, and live a most uncomfortable life with their great hungering stomachs and huge unsatisfied maws. The elevator itself consists of a big movable trunk--movable as is that of an elephant, but not pliable, and less graceful even than an elephant's. This {{is attached to a}} huge granary or barn; but in order to give altitude within the barn for the necessary moving up and down of this trunk--seeing that it cannot be curled gracefully to its purposes as the elephant's is curled--there is an awkward box erected {{on the roof of the}} barn, giving some twenty feet of additional height, up into which the elevator can be thrust. It will be understood, then, that this big movable trunk, the head of which, when it is at rest, is thrust up into the box on the roof, is made to slant down in an oblique direction from the building to the river; for the elevator is an amphibious institution, and flourishes only on the banks of navigable waters. When its head is ensconced within its box, and the beast of prey is thus nearly hidden within the building, the unsuspicious vessel is brought up within reach of the creature's trunk, and down it comes, like a musquito's proboscis, right through the deck, in at the open aperture of the hole, and so into the very vitals and bowels of the ship. When there, it goes to work upon its food with a greed and an avidity that is disgusting to a beholder of any taste or imagination. And now I must explain the anatomical arrangement by which the elevator still devours and continues to devour, till the corn within its reach has all been swallowed, masticated, and digested. Its long trunk, as seen slanting down from out of the building across the wharf and into the ship, is a mere wooden pipe; but this pipe is divided within. It has two departments; and as the grain-bearing troughs pass up the one on a pliable band, they pass empty down the other. The system, therefore, is that of an ordinary dredging machine only that corn and not mud is taken away, and that the buckets or troughs are hidden from sight. Below, within the stomach of the poor bark, three or four laborers are at work, helping to feed the elevator. They shovel the corn up toward its maw, so that at every swallow he should take in all that he can hold. Thus the troughs, as they ascend, are kept full, and when they reach the upper building they empty themselves into a shoot, over which a porter stands guard, moderating the shoot by a door, which the weight of his finger can open and close. Through this doorway the corn runs into a measure, and is weighed. By measures of forty bushels each, the tale is kept. There stands the apparatus, with the figures plainly marked, over against the porter's eye; and as the sum mounts <b>nearly</b> up to <b>forty</b> bushels he closes the door till the grains run thinly through, hardly a handful at a time, so that the balance is exactly struck. Then the teller standing by marks down his figure, and the record is made. The exact porter touches the string of another door, and the forty bushels of corn run out at the bottom of the measure, disappear down another shoot, slanting also toward the water, and deposit themselves in the canal boat. The transit of the bushels of corn from the larger vessel to the smaller will have taken less than a minute, and the cost of that transit will have been--a farthing.|$|R
