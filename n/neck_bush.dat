40|$|AbstractFlexible {{composite}} pipes are advantageous in ultra high strength, high modulus, pH and {{corrosion resistance}} and light weight, {{but there are}} still some hidden safety troubles because they are poorer in thermostable capacity. Therefore, test samples of flexible composite pipes were prepared with high-temperature polythene (PE-RT) as the <b>neck</b> <b>bush</b> and aramid fiber as the reinforcement layer. Experimental study was conducted by using HPHT vessel and differential thermal scanner for different working conditions, different temperatures, whole-pipe pressure-bearing capacity and 1000  h viability. It is shown by the environmental compatibility test that high temperature has little effect on the weight, Vicat softening temperature, mechanical properties and structures of <b>neck</b> <b>bush</b> PE-RT, but exerts an obvious effect on the tensility and whole-pipe water pressure blasting of the reinforcement aramid fiber. Besides, the drop of whole-pipe pressure-bearing capacity is caused by deformation and breaking of aramid fibers when the reinforcement layer is under the force of internal pressure. Finally, disorientation and crystallization of molecular thermal motion occur with the rise of temperature, so amorphous orientation reduces, crystallinity factor and crystalline orientation factor increase gradually, thus, disorientation of macromolecular chains increases and tensile strength decreases. It is concluded that this type of flexible composite pipe can smoothly pass 1000  h viability test. And it is recommended that it be used in the situations with temperature not higher than 95  °C and internal pressure not higher than 4  MPa...|$|E

"Well, {{we passed}} on till, having crossed the first glade where I {{had seen the}} lions, we reached the <b>neck</b> of <b>bush</b> that {{separated}} it from the second glade, where the dead elephants were.

6000|$|As I {{waited for}} the reports with breathless attention, I was much struck at that moment by the {{singularity}} of {{the circumstances in which}} we were placed. On our left stood the rhinoceros, not fifteen yards off; on our right the giraffe raised his long <b>neck</b> above the <b>bushes,</b> about twenty yards distant, apparently uncertain whether it was safe to advance to the water; while in front lay the lake, reflecting the soft, clear moonlight, and beyond that the phalanx of elephants, enjoying themselves vastly.

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{ostriches}} do not bury {{their heads in}} sand to avoid danger. This myth likely began with Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79), who wrote that ostriches [...] "imagine, when they have thrust their head and <b>neck</b> into a <b>bush,</b> that the whole of their body is concealed." [...] This {{may have been a}} misunderstanding of their sticking their heads in the sand to swallow sand and pebbles to help digest their fibrous food, or, as National Geographic suggests, of the defensive behavior of lying low, so that they may appear from a distance to have their head buried. Another possible origin for the myth lies with the fact that ostriches keep their eggs in holes in the sand instead of nests, and must rotate them using their beaks during incubation; digging the hole, placing the eggs, and rotating them might each be mistaken for an attempt to bury their heads in the sand.|$|R
