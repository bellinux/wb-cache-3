40|$|In this project, {{the basic}} problem is to {{automatically}} separate test samples into one of two categories: clean or corrupt. This type of classification problem {{is known as a}} two-class classification problem or detection problem. In what follows, we refer to clean examples as negative examples and corrupt examples as positive examples. In a detection problem, a classifier decision on any one sample can be grouped into one of four decision categories: <b>true</b> <b>negative,</b> <b>true</b> positive, false <b>negative</b> and false positive. These four categories are illustrated by Table 1. <b>True</b> <b>negatives</b> and <b>true</b> positives are cases where the classifier has made the correct decision. False positives are cases where the classifier decides positive when {{the true nature of the}} sample was negative, and false negatives are cases where the classifier decides negative when the sample was actually positive. To evaluate the performance of a classifier, we run the classifier on all the samples of a data set and then count all the instances of <b>true</b> <b>negatives,</b> <b>true</b> positives, false <b>negatives,</b> and false positives. All of the performance metrics in this report are then formed from a combination of these four basic decision categories...|$|R

They maintain that Logical Pluralism is compatible with monism about metaphysical modality, according to which there is just one correct logic of metaphysical modality. Wyatt [2004] contends that Logical Pluralism is incompatible with monism about metaphysical modality. We first suggest that if Wyatt were right, Logical Pluralism would be strongly implausible because it would get upside down a dependence relation that holds between metaphysics and logic of modality. We then argue that Logical Pluralism is prima facie compatible with monism about metaphysical modality. I.
