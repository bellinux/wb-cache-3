40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{relationships}} of serum T₄ (thyroxine) levels and liver <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>coenzyme</b> (NAD and NADP) levels with production of traits of beef cattle were investigated at both weaning (182 kg) and following performance testing (363 kg). In addition, {{the value of}} these parameters as selection criteria for improved performance was determined. Blood and liver samples were collected from 83 bulls and 41 heifers of the Hereford and Angus breeds in the years 1972 and 1973. The levels of T₄ present in the serum were determined by the Tetrasorb- 125 method (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois), T₄ levels at weaning were found to be positively associated with weaning age, while T₄ levels determined following performance testing were negatively associated with final age. This was due to the opposite influence of T₄ upon growth at the two different weights. Although T₄ level at 182 kg was found to be a significant predictor of subsequent rate and efficiency of gains, the relationship of T₄ to rate of gain was of small magnitude and its biological importance was negligible. In the case of feed per unit gain, an increase of one unit in T₄ level at 182 kg was found to result in a decrease of 0. 098 kg of feed required per kg of gain. Fluorometric determination of the liver concentrations (μg /g of frozen liver tissue) of nicotinamide nucleotide coenzymes showed that NAD and NADPH were present in excess over NADH and NADP⁺ respectively. No significant differences in coenzyme concentrations due to age were detected within the sampling weight groups. Coenzyme levels were significantly higher at 363 kg than at 182 kg. The oxidized forms (NAD⁺ and NADP⁺) were found to positively influence rate and efficiency of gains, while these traits were influenced negatively by the reduced forms (NADH and NADPH). No biologically important predictive relationships between coenzyme levels at 182 kg and production traits were found that would have value in selecting for improved performance in beef cattle...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This {{investigation}} {{for the first}} time reports information on the correlation of various forms and ratios of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>coenzymes</b> in the liver tissue and endocrine glands weight with various production traits. Fifty-five inbred and line cross beef bulls raised under standard management conditions and slaughtered at 1000 lbs. body weight were used in the study. Fluorometeric determinations of the <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>coenzymes</b> showed that NADH was present in lower concentration per gram of frozen liver tissue than NAD⁺ while the concentration of NADP⁺ was lower than NADPH per gram of frozen liver tissue. All forms of coenzymes showed a positive significant correlation with age (at 1000 lbs. body weight) and percent fat in the body. The coenzymes in the meantime also showed a significant negative correlation with percent lean in the carcass. Thyroid gland weight also showed a negative correlation with age, percent fat in the carcass and all the coenzymes which were positively associated with age and percent fat in the carcass. Thyroid gland weight was positively correlated with the NADP⁺/NADPH ratio since this ratio had a negative association with percent fat in the carcass. There was a positive correlation of thyroid weight with the NADP⁺/NADPH ratio. The latter ratio showed a significant positive association with feed per unit gain. Feed per unit gain, in the meantime, was positively associated with NADP⁺ and negatively associated with NAD⁺, percent lean in the carcass and gain per day. As age at 1000 lbs. body weight increases, the amount of thyroid tissue at 1000 lbs. body weight decreases and simultaneously feed per unit gain and percent fat in the carcass increases while percent lean and gain per day decreases. No significant correlation of any kind was observed between pituitary gland weight and production traits. This was attributed to the involvement of this gland with various hormones that may have antagonistic inducing action on these coenzymes. Evidence obtained, however, indicates both hormones (STH and TSH) increases percent lean, water content and gain per day and decreases percent fat in the carcass. Based on this evidence a model for the action of these hormones was presented. Inbreeding showed a negative significant correlation with percent lean in the carcass. In the meantime inbreeding was positively associated with total coenzymes (NAD⁺ + NADP⁺, NADH + NADPH). These coenzymes all have a significant negative correlation with percent lean in the carcass. Heterozygosity, therefore, seems to have a heterotic effect on growth as it increases percent lean in the carcass whereas it shows a negative heterotic effect on coenzyme concentration in liver tissue. This seems proper since the above coenzymes have a significant negative correlation with percent lean in the carcass. High percent lean and low coenzyme levels were characteristics associated with the line crosses while the opposite was true of inbred animals. Lines and line crosses showed statistically significant differences in coenzymes and production traits. This trend was also true for the average of parents compared with their offspring. Although statistically significant differences were not obtained when all inbreds of 17 and 21 percent inbreeding were compared with line crosses, a trend indicating higher gain per day, lower feed per unit gain and lower coenzyme levels, was noted in the line crosses. Diallel analysis showed no general combining ability for either the coenzymes or production traits. Specific combining ability and reciprocal effects were shown to exist for various coenzymes and production traits...|$|R

Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 369, 477 - 486] prompted us to investigate further the biosynthesis of this sialic acid in mouse liver. Free [14 C]Neu 5 Ac, CMP-[14 C]Neu 5 Ac and [14 C]Neu 5 Ac glycosidically bound by Gal alpha 2 - 3 - and Gal alpha 2 - 6 -GlcNAc beta 1 - 4 linkages to fetuin were employed as potential substrates in experiments with fractionated mouse liver homogenates. The only substrate to be hydroxylated was the CMP-Neu 5 Ac glycoside. The product of the reaction was identified by chemical and enzymic methods as CMP-Neu 5 Gc. All of the CMP-Neu 5 Ac hydroxylase activity was detected in the high-speed supernatant fraction. The hydroxylase required a reduced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> [NAD(P) H] <b>coenzyme</b> and molecular oxygen for activity. Furthermore, the activity of this enzyme was enhanced by exogenously added Fe 2 + or Fe 3 + ions, all other metal salts tested having a negligible or inhibitory influence. This hydroxylase is therefore tentatively classified as a monooxygenase. The cofactor requirement and CMP-Neu 5 Ac substrate specificity are identical {{to those of the}} enzyme in high-speed supernatants of pig submandibular gland, suggesting that this is a common route of Neu 5 Gc biosynthesis. The relevance of these results to the regulation of Neu 5 Gc expression in sialoglycoconjugates is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + uptake and {{the effect}} of the uptake inhibitors palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine were {{examined}} in two preparations of dog cardiac mitochondria. Mitochondria prepared by using the Nagarse technique was 2. 5 -fold more active in respiration-dependent Ca 2 + uptake than were mitochondria isolated by using the Polytron procedure. Palmitoyl-CoA and palmitoylcarnitine inhibited Ca 2 + uptake in both preparations uncompetitively, with Ki,app 0. 4 and 20 μm. Ca 2 +-uptake rates were related to, or influenced by, the concentration of mitochondrial reduced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> with uptake slowing as this concentration decreased. When most of the <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides</b> was oxidized, Ca 2 + release and respiratory stimulation were observed. In the presence of Ruthenium Red and palmitoyl-CoA, oxidation of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides</b> was abolished and the time to Ca 2 + release was shortened corresponding to the time of onset of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidation in the absence of Ruthenium Red. The results suggest that NAD(P) H oxidation in the presence of rotenone was a consequence of Ca 2 + re-uptake and that net Ca 2 + release could be observed as reduced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> concentrations declined. Although <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidation occurred in the presence of rotenone, it was not linked in an apparent manner to acyl-group metabolism (palmitoylcarnitine was less effective than palmitoyl-CoA). Therefore either a by-pass of the rotenone block or a direct interaction of NAD(P) H with the Ca 2 +-uptake process was possible. Loss of NADH occurred before respiratory stimulation, and this loss may relate to decreased coupling efficiency at sites 2 and 3 of the respiratory chain, as suggested by others [Bhuvaneswaran & Wadkins (1978) Biochem.

40|$|Glutamine, in the {{presence}} of alpha-oxoglutarate, stimulates <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidation by crude extracts of pea roots and leads to a reductant-dependent formation of glutamate. Commercially available asparagine also stimulates <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidation in {{the presence}} of alpha-oxoglutarate, but the reaction causing the stimulation can occur {{in the absence of a}} reductant, is inhibited by transaminase inhibitors, and is additive to the glutamine reaction. The asparagine used was found to be contaminated with aspartate. Repurified asparagine, chromatographically free of aspartate, did not stimulate the rate of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidation, and it is probable that the original stimulation was due to aspartate contamination. It is concluded that pea-root glutamine (amide) -alpha-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (glutamate synthase), in common with the enzyme in leaves, is specific for glutamine as the N donor and alpha-oxoglutarate as the N acceptor.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{catabolism}} of glucose by proliferating {{and resting}} cells of two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been examined, {{with respect to}} the nature and participation of concurrent glucose pathways by means of the radiorespirometric method. The <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> content, and <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidase activities in these cells were also examined. Data from the radiorespirometric experiments indicated that both strains of S. cerevisiae catabolized glucose by way of the EMPTCA and the PP pathway although relative participation of these two pathways were different. The pentose phosphate pathway is playing a much more important role in strain 2 of the bakers' yeast. Examination of the radiorespirometric pattern as well as the data on the incorporation of substrate carbon atoms into cellular constituents revealed that when bakers' yeast of strain 2 is permitted to utilize glucose under resting conditions, the data observed on the yields of respiratory C¹⁴O₂ cannot be used for the purpose of pathway estimation. This is true since under resting conditions, the slow rate of glucose utilization permits considerable interaction of glucose intermediates, thereby resulting in randomization of the two labeled carbon atoms. The contents of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides</b> as well as the activities of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> oxidases in these cells were determined and found that they cannot be correlated with relative participation of glucose pathways...|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 + efflux from rat liver {{mitochondria}} {{can occur}} when endogenous <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides</b> are oxidized. It {{is suggested that}} <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> induced by acetoacetate sensitizes the mitochondria to damaage resulting from the accumulation of Ca 2 + {{in the presence of}} Pi. Thus, acetoacetate-induced Ca 2 + efflux is associated with a loss of respiratory control. Both the effluxes induced by acetoacetate and by high Ca 2 + accumulation are prevented by ATP plus oligomycin, although these agents do not prevent the endoagenous <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides</b> from becoming oxidized on addition of acetoacetate. Acetoacetate addition only results in Ca 2 + release if the Ca 2 + and Pi concentration are above a critical value. The acetoacetate-induced Ca 2 + effflux is exactly paralled by the virtually complete collapse of the membrane potential. The presence of acetoacetate decreases the concentration of total Ca 2 + necessary to induced mitochondrial damage by about 130 nmol of Ca 2 +/mg of protein. It is concluded that acetoacetate-induced efflux occurs by reversal of the Ca 2 + uniporter {{after the collapse of the}} membrane potential...|$|R

PHB synthesis was not enhanced by limiting inorganic ions. The activity of CS, which competes with KT for acetyl-CoA, was lower when cells were grown in LB+glucose compared with other media. The NADPH level and the NADPH/NADP ratio were high in LB+glucose. Examination of the time profiles of the specific PHB synthesis rate, key enzyme activities, and the levels of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides</b> showed that PHB synthesis is most significantly affected by the NADPH level. Even though the NADH level and the NADH/NAD ratio were also high during the synthesis of PHB, no direct evidence of their positive effect on PHB synthesis was found. Low activity of CS was beneficial for PHB synthesis due to the availability of more acetyl-CoA to PHB biosynthetic pathway. In recombinant E. coli, the level of NADPH and/or the NADPH/NADP ratio seem to be the most critical factor regulating the activity of AAR and, subsequently, PHB synthesis. ope...|$|R

40|$|Normal thymocytes and thymoma {{cells have}} been exposed to the toxic action of tert-butyl {{hydroperoxide}} (t-BOOH) to study the mechanisms of oxidative lethal cell injury and the sensitivity of normal and tumor cells to an oxidative stress. From our data, we can suggest that: (a) In thymoma cells two mechanisms can operate in determining t-BOOH toxicity: the first one, involving glutathione peroxidase and <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> leads to cell death by alteration of calcium homoeostasis, and the second one, involving potent oxygen reactive species, affects cell viability by ATP depletion. The first mechanism is demonstrated by the decrease of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> the partial protection from lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (40 %) and by dithiothreitol (DTT) (52 %). The second mechanism is based on the partial protection of LDH release by deferoxamine (42 %) and glucose (50 %) and by total protection of ATP depletion by glucose. In agreement with these observations, DTT and deferoxamine in combination totally prevent cell death as well as EGTA and glucose do. (b) In normal thymocytes only the mechanism involving oxygen radical species is implicated. t-BOOH-induced death is not related to modifications of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotide</b> pool. No changes are observed in LDH release by the addition of EGTA and DTT. In contrast, deferoxamine totally prevents cell death. Mechanisms depending on cellular ATP are involved in t-BOOH-induced oxidative damage. Glucose completely prevents t-BOOH-mediated ATP depletion and completely protects from LDH release.

Depending {{on the presence}} of ADP or ATP, rotenone caused an increase or a decrease in the level of reduction of the matrix <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>nucleotides.</b> The increase in the reduction induced by rotenone in the presence of ADP was linked to the oxidation of the malate resulting from the oxidation of succinate. Depending on the experimental conditions, malic enzyme (at pH 6. 6 or in the presence of added CoA) or malate dehydrogenase (at pH 7. 9) were involved in this oxidation. At pH 7. 9, the oxaloacetate produced progressively inhibited the succinate dehydrogenase. In the presence of ATP the production of oxaloacetate was stopped, and succinate dehydrogenase was protected from inhibition by oxaloacetate. However, previously accumulated oxaloacetate transitorily decreased the level of the reduction of the NAD+ driven by succinate, by causing the reversal of the malate dehydrogenase reaction. Under these conditions (i. e. presence of ATP), rotenone strongly inhibited the reduction of NAD+ by succinate-driven reverse electron flow.
