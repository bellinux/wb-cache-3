All four group members are also seen pacing through a dark city wearing figure hugging outfits. The video {{draws to a close}} when the man who the group have built an unhealthy fixation to is seen tied to a chair as the group walks towards him, before the words 'To Be Continued' appear on the screen.

25|$|In 2013, Al-Buthe (who {{was one of}} the {{directors}} of the Ashland chapter and who had been wiretapped by the US government) was taken off a United Nations list of people subject to sanctions for ties to Al-Qaeda but remained on a similar US list. His attorney Tom <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> the UN action is some vindication for his client, but that Al-Buthe is a victim of the post-9/11 anti-terrorism paranoia.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Nelsons was one {{of several}} {{companies}} to be exposed by BBC Newsnight as encouraging patients to take a homeopathic anti-malarial tablet, without also advising them to visit their general practitioner for an anti-malarial medicine. Scientists said that companies doing this could be putting lives at risk. [...] "There is no scientific proof that homeopathic remedies are effective in either preventing or treating malaria." [...] <b>Nelsons</b> <b>said</b> they reiterated to their staff that this should be done.|$|R

Murphy later said Baker likely meant it in a joking manner, {{although}} Mike <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> that he deliberately avoided encountering Baker while the two happened to be staying at the same hotel. Jeff Lieberman, director of Squirm, was also quite angry at the MST3K treatment of his film.|$|E
25|$|Bowen {{took part}} in the first {{bombardment}} of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 5 July, and worked with Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson to prepare plans for an assault on the town. In the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 24 July Bowen was assigned to lead the landing parties onto the mole. At the head of forty or fifty of his men he gained the mole, took the battery covering the harbour by storm and spiked its guns, and was advancing into the town in pursuit of the fleeing Spanish. As he did so the Spanish fired a large round of grapeshot onto his party, causing heavy casualties. Bowen and his first lieutenant (George Thorp) were among those killed, while Nelson and his men, who were just landing, were caught in the fire, Nelson being hit in his right arm. Bowen's body was recovered the next morning and returned to the British ships after the withdrawal. <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> of Bowen that '...a more enterprising, able, and gallant officer, does not grace His Majesty's naval service!' Bowen was buried at sea on 27 July.|$|E
500|$|According to Hollywood {{historian}} and biographer James Parish, Mansfield's hourglass figure (she claimed dimensions of 40–21–35), unique [...] walk, breathy baby talk and cleavage-revealing costumes made a lasting impact on popular culture.

5000|$|Irwin Cotler, {{a former}} lawyer for <b>Nelson</b> Mandela, <b>said</b> it was anti-semitic to call Israel an {{apartheid}} state because [...] "it involves {{a call for}} dismantling Israel." [...] He links this to efforts to delegitimize the Jewish State.|$|R
500|$|Analysis by {{political}} experts {{pointed to the}} record-low voter turnout–around 43.6%–and that 39,000 more people voted for Democratic Congressman Peter Welch than voted for Shumlin {{as a sign of}} dissatisfaction with Shumlin. University of Vermont political science professor Garrison <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "the people who showed up are the angry ones" [...] and that, unlike Shumlin, [...] "Welch demonstrated an appeal far beyond just the Democratic base." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael J. Nelson, the show's head {{writer who}} also plays the {{character}} of the same name, said the staff initially felt strange making jokes at the expense of Rondo Hatton and his real-life illness; however, <b>Nelson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Then you realize it's {{the whole point of the}} movie: he's a guy with a big ugly face...And he is a terribly bad actor." [...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work. Yet it can seem exploitative of misfortune." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} visuals, Tanner {{stated that the}} {{graphics}} are [...] "better than {{a big chunk of}} PS2 games" [...] and that it is the [...] "best-looking game on the PSP thus far." [...] Pereira said that it looks as good if not better than other handheld games available. <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> the graphics are [...] "the best you've ever seen on a handheld." [...] He also said that it makes the first two God of War games on the PlayStation 2 look dated. GameTrailers said [...] "you'll be treated to the very best visuals the PSP has to offer". Parkin described the set-pieces as [...] "incredible" [...] for a handheld platform, however, he stated they [...] "seem tired" [...] in comparison to the opening scenes of God of War III.|$|E

500|$|Nelson gave {{only a few}} {{interviews}} {{before leaving}} Chicago for the suburbs, and then Graceland to avoid the press. On {{the advice of his}} friends, Nelson stayed away from his graduation ceremony on May 14, 1988. He turned down a $15,000 (1988, $22,000 in 2008) offer for the painting, calling it a [...] "grossly inflated" [...] price. He also turned down a separate opportunity to appear on Phil Donahue's syndicated talk show, saying that he never watched the show and was genuinely uninterested in the offer. Other than the interview with WLUP, Nelson's views were expressed by Harvey Grossman, the legal director for the ACLU. Through Grossman, <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> he would not press for the returning of the painting, as it had fulfilled its purpose of [...] "drawing attention to his 'iconoclastic' work".|$|E
500|$|<b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> the video's {{production}} was ambitious, stating: [...] "It's an incredible challenge {{to make a}} creative clip of a song without the artist." [...] He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously {{because he was the}} first to commit to his role as the bellboy. Nelson says that Coolio's role [...] "provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video." [...] Yvette Lang, who executive produced the clip for F.M. Rocks, described the filming to be like a [...] "big party" [...] to show their support for Shakur. Ice-T's role as the hotel concierge was not originally intended. At first, there was a comedian set to play his role, but he ended up cancelling at the last minute. Since Ice-T was only available to shoot in the morning, Nelson decided to make him the concierge. The director called it a [...] "strange blessing" [...] since he is more memorable as a concierge, rather than his intended role.|$|E
500|$|At E3 2014, a re-release of {{the game}} was {{announced}} for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. This enhanced version features an increased draw distance, finer texture details, denser traffic, upgraded weather effects, and new wildlife and vegetation. It features more than 162 new songs across the game's radio stations. Players may transfer Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression between some platforms and gain exclusive content like activities, weapons and vehicles. The re-release features a new on-foot first-person view option that players may configure to personal preference (for example, by making the view toggle to third-person when taking cover). Animation director Rob <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> that a first-person option was raised during PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 development, but their relatively smaller banks of memory were already being pushed, such that adding new first-person animations would have inhibited the open world render. According to Nelson, the first-person view required more development effort than simply repositioning the camera, {{because of the need}} to adapt combat to a different view. The weapons were upgraded to a higher resolution, and new animations including weapon recoil, reload and switch were added. [...] "I think we created 3,000 animations on weapons alone", said Nelson.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by {{the first week of}} live shows of The X Factor (UK) where Little Mix were the favourites to be eliminated and felt disheartened by hearing the odds in the show's green room. Group member Jesy Nelson also recalled, [...] "the paps waiting outside to shoot us were all shouting 'See you on This Morning on Monday' because that's where the losers go. I was like: 'Oh, right, thanks!'" [...] Further inspiration came from Nelson who as an aspiring singer was told by her teachers that she would end up working at Tesco. Little Mix also wrote the song as an uplifting message for their fans. <b>Nelson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "There's nothing wrong with writing songs about clubs and partying but I think it's cool to do a song with meaning." [...] Prior to [...] "Wings", the group had been vocal about standing up to bullying and wanted the song to have a similar message that listeners would be able to relate to. However, they did not want it to sound cheesy or as if they were preaching and instead wrote it with a theme of maternal advice.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its success, country music {{experienced}} an immediate increase in popularity. According to music writer Daniel Cooper, [...] "the album raised the genre's profile", specifically Nashville sound, which Charles had covered. Benefiting from this were songwriters, music publishers, and country singers who covered the subgenre's material. As noted by Cooper, {{by the end of}} 1962, Nashville country publishers were being held as [...] "the hottest source of music material in the record business these days." [...] Charles's success with the stylistic fusion of country and soul on Modern Sounds led to similar efforts from artists such as Candi Staton and Solomon Burke, who were greatly influenced by the album. Many country music artists such as Willie Nelson and Buck Owens have cited Charles's take on the genre with the album as a major influence. In an interview for Country Music Television, <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> that the album [...] "did more for country music than any one artist has ever done." [...] Doug Freeman of the Austin Chronicle wrote of Charles's influence through the album, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} race, Oxford's bow man, Alex Woods, {{collapsed}} and lost consciousness. [...] After receiving treatment {{on the bank}} of the river, he was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he made a complete recovery. [...] Oxford's coach Sean Bowden suggested that the loss of one of Oxford's blades had driven Woods to push himself [...] "beyond his limits". [...] As a result of the disruption and the concern for Woods' condition, the traditional award ceremony was cancelled. [...] Woods later apologised to the Cambridge crew and coach for his collapse that [...] "prevented their celebrations" [...] while thanking them for their [...] "sportsmanlike behaviour". Cambridge boat club president <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I feel bad. Finishing the race there was a lot of raw emotion and some of the celebrations seem pathetic in retrospect" [...] while his coach Steve Trapmore commented [...] "it's not the way anyone wants to take away the win". [...] Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo made a request that the race be re-rowed as a result of the broken blade, but the appeal was dismissed by umpire Garrett, who said [...] "I listened to Oxford’s complaint but I explained I did not see the clash as being the reason for the eventual result".|$|E

500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood {{for a minute or two}} before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|Into Temptation {{received}} generally positive reviews. Variety magazine writer Rob Nelson {{called it}} a well-photographed film of [...] "occasionally irreverent wit", and that Coyle [...] "strikes a near-perfect balance between humor and holiness". <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> the film [...] "falters only in its hokey characterization" [...] of the Chenoweth character. Colin Covert of the Star Tribune {{called it a}} [...] "haunting, carefully crafted movie" [...] with simple [...] "matter-of-fact" [...] direction, a [...] "trim and efficient" [...] screenplay, strong acting and solid characters. Covert said, [...] "This is one of very few American films to deal with religious beliefs about faith and salvation with empathy and insight." [...] OC Weekly writer Matt Coker said Into Temptation had a cohesive script which [...] "strikes just the right cord of reverence for the Catholic faith". He also praised the moments of comic relief with Sisto and Baumgartner, which he said complimented some of the film's heavier moments. L. Kent Wolgamott of the Lincoln Journal Star called Into Temptation a well-made film that [...] "gets the mood right from start to finish". He complimented the performances and said although pornography and prostitution were familiar film topics, [...] "the film's nuanced understanding of the priest and his conflicted role in trying to save Linda adds a new element to the old story." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry <b>Nelson</b> <b>said</b> that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{began playing}} in South Africa with Kaizer Chiefs, before {{transferring}} to Leeds United, {{where he played}} 200 matches for the Yorkshire side. During his spells at these clubs, {{he picked up the}} nicknames [...] "Rhoo" [...] and [...] "The Chief". He became captain of Leeds United and also of the South African national team, most notably at World Cup 2002. <b>Nelson</b> Mandela <b>said</b> of Radebe: [...] "This is my hero." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nelson</b> Mandela <b>said</b> of him, [...] "Michael’s life {{represents}} a compelling metaphor: We {{read about a}} foreigner who came to our country and was transformed {{by what he saw}} of the injustices of apartheid.
