5|$|There are tragic {{consequences}} one snowy {{night when}} the Castillo brothers' car veers {{off the road and}} into a tree. Cesar, {{in the back seat of}} the vehicle, is barely hurt, but Nestor, having driven the car, is killed. The life of Cesar, shattered, is <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> To honor his brother's memory, Cesar opens his own small club, which is well received. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing Nestor's song for her.|$|E
5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings {{caused him to}} lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again.|$|E

25|$|The revolts {{failed because}} of the {{overwhelming}} force used by the U.S. military, the U.S. National Guard, the FBI, the CIA, and the Puerto Rican Insular Police - {{all of whom were}} aligned against the Nationalists. This force included the machine-gunning of Nationalists all over the island, and the aerial bombing of the town of Jayuya. Hundreds of cadets and Nationalists, among them Corretjer, were arrested by mid-November 1950, and the party was <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} of the Austin music {{scene from the}} mid-seventies progressive country scene to the punk/new wave and alternative influence that followed is captured in Jesse Sublett's memoir, <b>Never</b> <b>the</b> <b>Same</b> Again: A Rock n' Roll Gothic, which details Sublett's experiences with the Skunks and other bands during that time period. Sublett has also documented the Austin music scene in his music-themed crime novels, Rock Critic Murders, Tough Baby, and Boiled in Concrete.|$|E

Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble.

Nagai said Ohtaki approached him to collaborate on a picture book, also titled A Long Vacation, {{which was published in}} 1979. He also claimed that the musician was inspired by his pieces when writing the songs that became the album. After the album's release, Nagai's life was <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> and he was flooded with requests for similar work. The artist provided the cover for several other albums by Ohtaki.|$|E

25|$|The revolt {{failed because}} of the {{overwhelming}} force used by the US military and Puerto Rican police forces against the Nationalists. Hundreds of Nationalists were arrested and the party was <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Law 53, the Gag Law (or La Ley de la Mordaza {{as it is known}} in Puerto Rico), was repealed in 1957. In 1964, David M. Helfeld wrote in his article Discrimination for Political Beliefs and Associations that Law 53 was written with the explicit intent of eliminating the leaders of the Nationalist and other pro-independence movements, and to intimidate anyone who might follow them - even if their speeches were reasonable and orderly, and their activities were peaceful.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, {{the trade}} {{appeared}} to make some sense from the Sixers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get nearly enough in return. The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.|$|E

Blues is about how you feel today. One day, you're down; another day is real happy and giddy. We're all laughing. Randy's direction captures that. It's always so personal, bringing the audience into the piece." [...] As well as African music, the revue includes [...] "country, gospel, the old blues, Appalachian music," [...] featuring music by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mahalia Jackson, Jimmy Rogers, Nina Simone and Muddy Waters.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{while on}} a tour of Czechoslovakia with Port Vale, Matthews met 44-year-old Mila, who was the group's {{interpreter}} for the trip. Matthews was still married to Betty, but as he was convinced he had found the true love of his life in Mila, he and Betty divorced. He and Mila spent the ensuing years living at various times in Malta (specifically Marsaxlokk), South Africa and Canada. They also travelled extensively as Matthews's coaching jobs and guest appearances dictated. After Mila died on 5 May 1999 at the age of 76, according to Les Scott (who helped Matthews write his autobiography), Matthews [...] "was <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person".|$|E

Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E
