5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static <b>non-directional</b> lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, <b>non-directional,</b> patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E
25|$|WRVA is {{well known}} for its 24-hour {{broadcasts}} on the clear channel frequency at 1140kHz, with a 50,000 watt <b>non-directional</b> signal, intended to reach rural areas. At night (when the AM signals travel farther), WRVA can be heard throughout the Eastern and Central U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Expansion {{continued}} in the early 1970s including ILS Category II equipment, lengthening existing runway to , installation of a <b>non-directional</b> beacon (NDB), diesel generators, taxiways, etc. This work made handling the Boeing 747 and Concorde possible. Several runway and apron extensions were carried out through the decade to meet growing demand.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. <b>Non-directional</b> beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with marker beacons at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|E
25|$|Celle Air Base is {{equipped}} with a <b>non-directional</b> beacon (Frequency: 311 MHz, Identification: CEL). This is used for approach and departure procedures of Celle {{as well as for the}} airports Hanover and Braunschweig-Wolfsburg and as a waypoint for two airways (J803 und T803) in radio navigation. Additionally, the airfield {{is equipped}} with a precision approach radar (PAR-80) and airport surveillance radar (ASR-910).|$|E
25|$|Solids {{that are}} {{composed}} of small, weakly bound molecules are mechanically weak and have low melting points; an extreme case is solid molecular hydrogen, which melts at 14K (−259°C). The <b>non-directional</b> nature of dispersion forces typically allows easy plastic deformation, as planes of molecules can slide over one another without seriously disrupting their attractive interactions. Molecular solids are typically insulators with large band gaps.|$|E
25|$|WOWO (1190 kHz) is an {{independent}} news/talk radio station owned by Pathfinder Communications Corporation. Its studios are located along Maples Road in Fort Wayne, Indiana, while its transmitter and its three towers are located along U.S. Highway 24 in Roanoke, midway between Fort Wayne and Huntington. It transmits with 50,000 watts during daytime using a <b>non-directional</b> antenna, and with 9,800 watts during nighttime using a three-tower directional antenna.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-directional</b> markers ("cookies") are purely {{personal}} markers {{that mark}} specific spots, or {{the direction of}} one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape {{does not provide a}} tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.|$|E
25|$|The {{control tower}} {{was located in}} a cabin which was placed on a hill shelf {{overlooking}} the quay at Hjellestad. A radio mast was erected at Sandkleivane and a windsock installed don Kuholmen. <b>Non-directional</b> beacons were installed at Espeland and Bjelkarøy. Ship traffic near Hjellestad had to be alerted in case of incoming flights; this was announced through the hoisting of a black and yellow ball on the flag pole at the control tower.|$|E
25|$|A <b>non-directional</b> marker {{indicates}} {{the presence of}} a diver or team beyond a point and is mainly useful for that team. They may be used to indicate the direction the team came from and intend to exit by when the intersection is already marked by arrows, particularly if there are alternatives available which the team does not want to use. To avoid confusing other divers, these temporary markers are removed on the way out.|$|E
25|$|One {{interesting}} {{difference between}} a woodwind instrument and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are <b>non-directional.</b> This means that the sound produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, {{with most of the}} sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also {{plays a major role in}} some performance situations, such as in marching bands.|$|E
25|$|George Gaylord Simpson was {{responsible}} for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with paleontology in his 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution. Simpson's work was crucial because so many paleontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, {{with the idea that}} natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the evolution of the horse) that earlier paleontologists had used as support for neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the fossil record was consistent with the irregular, branching, and <b>non-directional</b> pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.|$|E
25|$|The initial Europe wide ban only {{applied to}} general-purpose, <b>non-directional</b> {{incandescent}} bulbs, so {{did not affect}} any bulbs with reflective surfaces (e.g. spotlights and halogen down lighters) or special purpose bulbs including those used in devices such as household appliances, traffic lights, infrared lamps and automotive lighting. The sale of the most inefficient bulbs was phased out. The first types to go were non-clear (frosted) bulbs, which were taken off the market in September 2009. Also from September 2009 clear bulbs over 100 W were made of more efficient types. This limit was moved down to lower wattages, and the efficiency levels raised {{by the end of}} 2012.|$|E
25|$|Airport {{employees}} {{started their}} new jobs on 1 March 1972. The same day Braathens SAFE opened a ticket office at Godtfred Lies plass in downtown Molde. The office also handled local {{sale of tickets}} for Widerøe. The official opening of the airport took place on 5 April and was attended by between seven and eight thousand people. The airport initially had fourteen employees. At the time of opening the instrument landing system was not yet installed. A <b>non-directional</b> beacon was installed on Tautra and a visual approach slope indicator at the runway. Later in 1972 two localizers were installed. The airport received a café.|$|E
25|$|Solids with purely {{metallic}} bonding are characteristically ductile and, {{in their}} pure forms, have low strength; melting points {{can be very}} low (e.g., Mercury melts at 234K (−39°C). These properties are consequences of the <b>non-directional</b> and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms (and planes of atoms in a crystal lattice) to move past one another without disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by introducing crystal defects (for example, by alloying) that interfere with the motion of dislocations that mediate plastic deformation. Further, some transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding; this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some {{of the characteristics of}} a covalent solid (an intermediate case below).|$|E
25|$|Developments in {{genetics}} persuaded field naturalists such as Bernhard Rensch and Ernst Mayr {{to abandon}} neo-Lamarckian ideas about {{evolution in the}} early 1930s. By the late 1930s, Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky had synthesized the ideas of population genetics {{with the knowledge of}} field naturalists about the amount of genetic diversity in wild populations, and the importance of genetically distinct subpopulations (especially when isolated from one another by geographical barriers) to create the early 20th century modern synthesis. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson integrated paleontology into the synthesis by statistically analyzing the fossil record to show that it was consistent with the branching <b>non-directional</b> form of evolution predicted by the modern synthesis, and in particular that the linear trends cited by earlier paleontologists in support of Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not stand up to careful analysis. Mayr wrote {{that by the end of}} the synthesis natural selection together with chance mechanisms like genetic drift had become the universal explanation for evolutionary change.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-directional</b> and hybrid {{personal}} line markers {{are used to}} indicate {{the identity of a}} diver who has passed along the line and has not yet returned to that point. They are attached to the line {{in the same way as}} cave arrows, and are deployed on the way into the cave, usually at critical points such as forks or jumps, and are used to indicate to other divers that someone is further in along the line. They are marked to identify the diver, and are recovered by the diver on the way out. Cookies (round markers), Rectangular referencing exit markers and clothes pegs are used for this purpose. The round and rectangular markers are attached to the line in the same way as arrows, and may be personalised in any way that the owners can easily recognise. Colour is often used, but as there are a limited number of standard colours available, and they are often poorly distinguishable in the dark, modifications to shape may be used which can be recognised by touch.|$|E
500|$|In the 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution, George Gaylord Simpson {{showed that}} the fossil record was {{consistent}} with the irregular <b>non-directional</b> pattern predicted by the developing evolutionary synthesis, and that the linear trends that earlier paleontologists had claimed supported orthogenesis and neo-Lamarckism did not hold up to closer examination. In 1950, G. Ledyard Stebbins published Variation and Evolution in Plants, which helped to integrate botany into the synthesis. The emerging cross-disciplinary consensus on the workings of evolution would be known as the modern synthesis. It received its name from the 1942 book [...] by Julian Huxley.|$|E
500|$|On board were 130 passengers, of whom 3 were children, {{consisting}} of Arktikugol employees and their families. Waiting {{at the airport}} for the return flight were 120 other employees and their families. The aircraft left Vnukovo Airport at 04:44 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or 08:44 Moscow Summer Time. Estimated flight time was 3 hours and 30 minutes, and alternative airports were Murmansk Airport and Severomorsk-3, both in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. The flight proceeded normally until descent, following the routing W 29 from Moscow to Padun (west of Murmansk), before crossing to Bodø Flight Information Region over the Barents Sea cruising at FL 350 at an average airspeed of [...] It then proceeded over Bjørnøya <b>non-directional</b> beacon (NDB), Isfjord NDB and Advent NDB.|$|E
500|$|From its {{beginning}} in the early 1930s, the LFR was augmented with Low Frequency <b>Non-directional</b> beacons (NDBs). [...] While the LFR required a complex ground installation and only a simple AM receiver on board the aircraft, NDB ground installations were simple single-antenna transmitters requiring somewhat more complex equipment on board the aircraft. [...] The NDB's radio emission pattern was uniform in all directions in the horizontal plane. The NDB's on-board receiver was called a radio direction finder (RDF). [...] The NDB-RDF combination allowed pilots to determine the direction of the NDB ground station relative to the direction the airplane was pointing. [...] When used in conjunction with the on board magnetic compass, the pilot could navigate to or from the station along any chosen course radiating from the station.|$|E

2500|$|Plants {{may respond}} both to {{directional}} and <b>non-directional</b> stimuli. [...] A {{response to a}} directional stimulus, such as gravity or sunlight, is called a tropism. [...] A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as temperature or humidity, is a nastic movement.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing unusual was {{reported}} via radio during {{the flight from}} Turku to Mariehamn, which was flown at 2000 feet. The aircraft was nearing the <b>non-directional</b> beacon [...] "MAR" [...] from northwest {{so that it was}} aligned for the final approach already in Godby. It flew past the <b>non-directional</b> beacon at 16:57-16:58 GMT and was prepared to land on runway 20. However, the aircraft struck trees 1480 meters before the runway and 50 meters before the final approach beacon ("Locator S"). The airplane had been perfectly aligned for the runway {{at the time of the}} contact. The plane hit the ground after rotating leftwards on its longitudinal axis, landing upside down and immediately catching fire.|$|E
2500|$|Yarmouth Airport {{facilities}} {{include a}} modern airport terminal building and combined services building which houses a maintenance garage. The airport has two runways, two taxiways and separate parking aprons for commercial and general aviation. In {{the summer of}} 2013, its Category I instrument landing system (ILS) was decommissioned, however, GPS (RNAV) approaches exist for all runways, and a VHF omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) and <b>non-directional</b> beacon (NDB) remain active. The airport property has [...] of easily accessible, industrial real estate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight plan}} {{that had been}} {{approved}} in 1977 by the New Zealand Department of Transport Civil Aviation Division was along a track directly from Cape Hallett to the McMurdo <b>non-directional</b> beacon (NDB), which, coincidentally, entailed flying almost directly over the [...] peak of Mount Erebus. However, the printout from Air New Zealand's ground computer system presented at the 9 November briefing corresponded to a southerly flight path {{down the middle of}} the wide McMurdo Sound, leaving Mount Erebus approximately [...] to the east. The majority of previous flights had also entered this flight plan's coordinates into their aircraft navigational systems and flown the McMurdo Sound route, unaware that the route flown did not correspond with the approved route.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} <b>non-directional</b> markers in cave diving were clothes pegs, but {{the circular}} plastic [...] "cookies" [...] were developed later, {{based on the}} successful line-arrow design, and are more secure when placed on a guideline. They {{can be used to}} mark reference points, to distinguish lines at an intersection, or can be placed by each member of a team on a jump or gap line to identify who is still on the line if the team gets separated. As they are commonly used to identify the presence of a diver, they generally have some kind of personal identification, such as initials or drawings and may have notches, or holes added so they can be identified by feel.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 1903, {{which had}} {{departed}} Manchester at 16:08 local time, encountered {{air traffic control}} (ATC) delays in the Paris area, resulting in a change of route.

During taxi, at 16:06 the flight received its departure route clearance: a routing known as the [...] "Dover One Standard Instrument Departure". This Standard Instrument Departure involved taking-off to the west over the Instrument Landing System localiser and middle marker beacon of the reciprocal Runway 09 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom <b>Non-Directional</b> Beacon (NDB) (to be passed at [...] or more), and then proceeding to Dover. Key advised the tower that he was ready for take-off and was cleared to do so. He subsequently reported an unspecified technical problem and remained at the holding point for two minutes to resolve it.|$|E
2500|$|Smolensk North Airport is {{a former}} {{military}} airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use.

2500|$|Radio {{technology}} {{and the ability to}} construct a radio telescope are presumed to be a natural advance for technological species, theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the Solar System, for example, would note unusually intense radio waves for a G2 star due to Earth's television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. It should be noted however that the most sensitive radio telescopes currently available on Earth {{would not be able to}} detect <b>non-directional</b> radio signals even at a fraction of a light-year, so it is questionable whether any such signals could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization. [...] Such signals could be either [...] "accidental" [...] by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the Arecibo message. A number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through the SETI organization. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.|$|E
