40|$|<b>Neurotoxicology</b> is a {{relatively}} young discipline that has undergone significant growth during the last 25 years. During the late 1970 s and 1980 s, numerous national and international conferences and meetings were devoted {{to the topic of}} <b>neurotoxicology,</b> the formation of societies or specialty sections related to <b>neurotoxicology,</b> and the establishment of two independent peer-reviewed journals devoted to <b>neurotoxicology.</b> This decade was also associated with a rapid increase in our knowledge of chemical effects on the structure and function of the nervous system. During the 1990 s, regulatory agencies such as the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency accepted <b>neurotoxicology</b> as a crucial end point and neurotoxicity testing and risk assessment guidelines were published. <b>Neurotoxicology</b> has also been accepted at the international level as evidenced by environmental criteria documents published by the International Programme on Chemical Safety and testing guidelines by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. In recent years, there has been increased concern that the etiology of some neurodegenerative diseases may be associated with exposure to neurotoxic agents and that subpopulations of humans such as children and the elderly may be differentially sensitive to neurotoxic exposure. In the future, mechanistic information derived from basic research will be used in the identification and characterization of chemicals with neurotoxic potential.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the research}} field of <b>neurotoxicology</b> is mainly {{focused on the}} potential effects of chemicals on development, structure and function of the human nervous system. There is general agreement {{within the field of}} toxicology that state-of-the-art toxicity testing includes tiered testing strategies that focus on the pathways that are critical for adequate functioning of cells, organs, and organisms, using different testing strategies to collect information on exposure and toxicity. This includes an emphasis on non-animal models, including integrated genomic and proteomic analyses of chemical-induced effects. This principle is embraced in the <b>neurotoxicology</b> research field and many efforts are focusing on developing and optimizing non-animal test systems to model such effects by increasing their sensitivity and specificity [123].|$|E
40|$|This paper sets a {{framework}} for the discussion of neurotoxicity as a potentially major contributor to the etiology of many types of mental retardation and developmental disabilities. In the past the literatures on developmental <b>neurotoxicology</b> and on mental retardation have evolved independently, yet {{we know that the}} developing brain is a target for neurotoxicity in the developing central nervous system through many stages of pregnancy as well as during infancy and early childhood. Our definitions and theories of mental retardation and developmental disabilities affect the models of neurotoxicity we espouse. For instance, models of developmental risk in <b>neurotoxicology</b> have guided environmental regulation to reduce the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. On the other hand, models of developmental risk for mental retardation aim not only at primary prevention,but also at secondary and tertiary prevention through early intervention. In the future, dynamic models of neuroplasticity based on the study of gene-brain-behavior relationships are likely to guide our views of developmental <b>neurotoxicology</b> and prevention of mental retardation and other disabilities. words: brain development, developmental disability, environmental toxins, mental retardation, neurotoxicity, risk assessment. - Environ Health Perspect 1 08 (suppl 3) : 395 - 399 (2000).

40|$|Children {{around the}} world are working in {{hazardous}} or unsafe conditions and they are at risk to injury through manual labor and susceptible to poisoning due to chemical exposures in the work place. Because of their behavior and the developmental changes occurring throughout childhood and adolescence children are more vulnerable to injury. Often children work because of economic necessity, coming from families living in extreme poverty, with poor housing conditions, unsafe water supplies, poor sanitation, and inadequate food supplies making them even more vulnerable to poor developmental outcomes. This presents a multifaceted problem that can be challenging to address. Although many studies have examined occupational risks among adults very few studies have examined the impact of these risks on children. This paper reflects a summary of the talks from the symposium "Using Epidemiology and <b>Neurotoxicology</b> to Reduce Risks to Young Workers" presented at the 13 th International <b>Neurotoxicology</b> Association Meeting and the 11 th International Symposium on Neurobehavioral Methods and Effects in Occupational and Environmental Health in Xi'an China in June 2011. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that children are exposed to various neurotoxicants, show increased symptoms and health problems and are working in hazardous conditions with minimal safety restrictions. Other studies have identified <b>neurotoxicology</b> effects in children from occupational exposures. Prevention methods have potential for reducing risks to young workers short of eliminating child labor and should be addressed to multiple stakeholders, parents, employers and children.

40|$|Five decades ago, lead {{toxicity}} {{in childhood}} was thought in nonlethal cases {{to be without}} residual effect. This misconception was corrected in 1943 by Randolph Byers, who began the modern era of lead <b>neurotoxicology</b> by asserting that lead not only killed cells, but interfered with the normal development of central nervous system neurons. The human data from Byers forward is reviewed, with particular attention on methodological issues that have emerged. The papers on human <b>neurotoxicology</b> presented at the NIEHS lead conference held in Research Triangle Park, NC, in 1974 are examined to demonstrate the progress made over the last 15 years. Seven methodological solecisms have clouded judgment over the question of lead toxicity at low dose: worship of the sacrament of p = 0. 05; inaccurate causal modeling; drawing conclusions from studies with inadequate power; positing phantom covariates; underestimating the importance of "small" effects; demanding proof of causality; and evaluating studies in isolation. The principles behind these errors are discussed. Lead exposure is associated with hyperactivity, and hyperactivity is {{a risk factor for}} antisocial behavior. The relationship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior is estimated. A plan for the effective removal of one major lead source, housing stock, is presented...|$|E
