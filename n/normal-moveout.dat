Here, we derive the Fréchet kernel for FWI of multicomponent data from a 2 D VTI (tranversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) medium. The kernel is obtained by linearizing the elastic wave equation using the Born approximation and employing the asymptotic Green's function. The amplitude of the kernel (‘radiation pattern’) yields the angle-dependent energy scattered by a perturbation in a certain model parameter. The perturbations are described in terms of the P- and S-wave vertical velocities and the P-wave <b>normal-moveout</b> and horizontal velocities.

For a dipping TTI layer with the symmetry axis confined to the dip plane of the reflector, estimation of the symmetry-direction velocity VP 0, the anisotropy parameters ε and δ, and the tilt ν of the symmetry axis proves to be ambiguous despite the borehole constraints. If the symmetry axis is orthogonal to the reflector (a model typical for dipping shale layers), VP 0 and δ can be recovered with high accuracy, even when the symmetry axis deviates by ± 5 ◦ from the reflector normal. The parameter ε, however, cannot be constrained for dips smaller than 60 ◦ without using nonhyperbolic moveout. To invert for the interval parameters of layered TTI media, we apply 2 D stacking-velocity tomography supplemented with the same borehole constraints.

40|$|Moveout {{analysis}} of wide-azimuth reflection data seldom {{takes into account}} lateral velocity variations {{on the scale of}} spreadlength. However, velocity lenses (such as channels and reefs) in the overburden can cause significant, laterally varying errors in the moveout parameters and distortions in data interpretation. Here, we present an analytic expression for the <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) ellipse in stratified media with lateral velocity variation. The contribution of lateral heterogeneity (LH) is controlled by the second derivatives of the interval vertical traveltime with respect to the horizontal coordinates, along with the depth and thickness of the LH layer. This equation provides a quick estimate of the influence of velocity lenses and can be used to substantially mitigate the lens-induced distortions in the effective and interval NMO ellipses. To account for velocity lenses in nonhyperbolic moveout inversion of wide-azimuth data, we propose a prestack correction algorithm that involves computation of the lens-induced traveltime distortion for each recorded trace. The overburden is assumed to be composed of horizontal layers (one of which contains the lens), but the target interval can be laterally heterogeneous with dipping or curved interfaces. Synthetic tests for horizontally layered models confirm that our algorithm accurately removes lens-related azimuthally varying traveltime shifts and errors in the moveout parameters.

The geometrical-spreading factor and the number of caustics that determine the shape of the reflected pulse are then generally obtained by integrating the so-called dynamic ray-tracing system down and up to the two-way normal incidence ray. Assuming that this ray is already known, we show that one integration of the dynamic ray-tracing system in a downward direction with only the initial condition of a point source at the earth's surface is in fact sufficient to obtain both results. To establish the Fresnel zone of the zero-offset reflection upon the reflector requires the same single downward integration. By performing a second downward integration (using the initial conditions of a plane wave at the earth's surface) the complete Fresnel volume around the two-way normal ray can be found. This should be known to ascertain the validity of the computed zero-offset event. A careful analysis of the problem as performed here shows that round-trip integrations of the dynamic ray-tracing system following the actually propagating wavefront along the two-way normal ray need never be considered. In fact some useful quantities related to the two-way normal ray (e. g., the <b>normal-moveout</b> velocity) require only one single integration in one specific direction only.

However, lateral heterogeneity associated with stratigraphic lenses such as channels and reefs can significantly distort the moveout parameters, even when the structure is relatively simple. Here, we discuss nonhyperbolic moveout inversion for 2 D models that include a low-velocity isotropic lens embedded in a VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) medium. Synthetic tests demonstrate that a lens can cause substantial, laterally varying errors in the <b>normal-moveout</b> velocity (Vnmo) and the anellipticity parameter η. The area influenced by the lens can be identified using the residual moveout after the nonhyperbolic moveout correction and the dependence of errors in Vnmo and η on spreadlength. To remove lens-induced traveltime distortions from prestack data, we propose an algorithm that involves estimation of the incidence angle of the ray passing through the lens for each recorded trace. Using the velocity-independent layerstripping method of Dewangan and Tsvankin, we compute the lens-induced traveltime shift from the zero-offset time distortion (i. e., from “pull-up ” or “push-down ” anomalies). Synthetic tests demonstrate that this algorithm substantially reduces the errors in the effective and interval parameters Vnmo and η.

40|$|Although it is {{believed}} that natural fracture sets predominantly have near-vertical orientation, oblique stresses and other mechanisms may tilt fractures away from the vertical. Here, we examine an effective medium produced by a single system of obliquely dipping, rotationally invariant fractures embedded in a VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) background rock. This model is monoclinic with a vertical symmetry plane that coincides with the dip plane of the fractures. Multicomponent seismic data acquired over such a medium possess several distinct features that make it possible to estimate the fracture orientation. For example, the vertically propagating fast shear wave (and the fast converted PS-wave) is typically polarized {{in the direction of the}} fracture strike. In contrast, the polarization vector of the slow shear wave at vertical incidence does not lie in the horizontal plane – an unusual phenomenon that can be used to detect oblique fractures. The <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) ellipses of horizontal events are co-oriented with the dip and strike directions of the fractures, which provides an independent estimate of the fracture azimuth. Both the fracture and background parameters can be obtained from multicomponent wide-azimuth data using the vertical velocities and NMO ellipses of P-waves and two split S-waves (pure shear modes can be replaced by PSwaves) reflected from horizontal interfaces.

Here, we develop analytic solutions based on the linear-slip theory to examine wave propagation through an eective anisotropic medium that contains two microcorrugated, vertical, orthogonal fracture sets in isotropic back-ground rock. The o-diagonal elements of the compliance matrix associated with the corruga-tion cause the deviation of the polarization vectors of the vertically traveling S-waves from the horizontal plane. Also, the shear-wave splitting coecient at vertical in-cidence becomes sensitive to uid saturation, especially for tight, low-porosity host rock. In contrast to the model with two orthogonal sets of penny-shaped cracks, the NMO (<b>normal-moveout)</b> ellipses of all three re ection modes (P, S 1, S 2) are rotated 1 {{with respect to the}} fracture strike directions. Another unusual property of the fast shear wave S 1, which can help to distinguish between models with one and two mi-crocorrugated fracture sets, is the misalignment of its polarization vector at vertical incidence and the semi-major axis of the NMO ellipse. The model analyzed here may adequately describe the orthogonal fracture sets at Weyburn Field in Canada, where the axes of the P-wave NMO ellipse deviate from the S 1 -wave polarization direction.

In this paper, we examine the distortions in <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) velocities caused by the intralayer vertical heterogeneity unaccounted for in velocity anal-ysis. To match P-wave moveout measurements from a horizontal or a dipping reflector overlaid by a ver-tically heterogeneous isotropic medium, the effective homogeneous overburden has to be anisotropic. This apparent anisotropy is caused not only by velocity mono-tonically increasing with depth, but also by random velocity variations similar to those routinely observed in well logs. Assuming that the effective homogeneous medium is transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI), we express the VTI parameters through the ac-tual depth-dependent isotropic velocity function. If the reflector is horizontal, combining the NMO and ver-tical velocities always results in nonnegative values of Thomsen’s coefficient –. For a dipping reflector, the in-version of the P-wave NMO ellipse yields a nonneg-ative Alkhalifah-Tsvankin coefficient · that increases with dip. The values of · obtained by two other methods (2 -D dip-moveout inversion and nonhyperbolic move-out analysis) are also nonnegative but generally dif-fer from that needed to fit the NMO ellipse.

40|$|We {{develop a}} rock physics model based on {{nonlinear}} elas-ticity {{that describes the}} dependence of the effective stiff-ness tensor {{as a function of}} a 3 D stress field in intrinsically anisotropic formations. This model predicts the seismic ve-locity of both P- and S-waves in any direction for an arbitrary 3 D stress state. Therefore, the model overcomes the limi-tations of existing empirical velocity-stress models that link P-wave velocity in isotropic rocks to uniaxial or hydrostatic stress. To validate this model, we analyze ultrasonic velocity measurements on stressed anisotropic samples of shale and sandstone. With only three nonlinear constants, we are able to predict the stress dependence of all five elastic medium parameters comprising the transversely isotropic stiffness tensor. We also show that the horizontal stress affects vertical S-wave velocity with the same order of magnitude as vertical stress does. We develop a weak-anisotropy approximation that directly links commonly measured anisotropic Thomsen parameters to the princi-pal stresses. Each Thomsen parameter is simply a sum of corresponding background intrinsic anisotropy and stress-induced contribution. The stress-induced part is controlled by the difference between horizontal and vertical stresses and coefficients depending on nonlinear constants. Thus, isotropic rock stays isotropic under varying but hydrostatic load, whereas transversely isotropic rock retains the same values of dimensionless Thomsen parameters. Only un-equal horizontal and vertical stresses alter anisotropy. Since Thomsen parameters conveniently describe seismic signa-tures, such as <b>normal-moveout</b> velocities and amplitude-variation-with-offset gradients, this approximation is suit-able for designing new methods for the estimation of 3 D subsurface stress from multicomponent seismic data...|$|E

This wide-angle wavefield contains arrivals that are returned from within and below the basalt flows, including the diving wave through the basalts as the first arrival and P-wave reflections {{from the base of the}} basalts and from sub-basalt structures. The velocity structure of basalt flows can be determined to first order from traveltime information by ray-tracing the basalt turning rays and the wide-angle base-basalt reflection. This can be refined by using the amplitude variation with offset of the basalt diving wave. Synthetic seismogram models with varying flow thicknesses and velocity gradients demonstrate the sensitivity to the velocity structure of the basalt diving wave and of reflections from the base of the basalt layer and below. The diving wave amplitudes of the models containing velocity gradients show a local amplitude minimum followed by a maximum at a greater range if the basalt thickness exceeds one wavelength, and beyond that an exponential amplitude decay. The offset at which the maximum occurs can be used to determine the basalt thickness. The velocity gradient within the basalt can be determined from the slope of the exponential amplitude decay. The amplitudes of sub-basalt reflections can be used to determine seismic velocities of the overburden and the impedance contrast at the reflector.

Here, we propose an efficient methodology to correct long-spread, wide-azimuth reflection data for the geometrical spreading in stratified azimuthally anisotropic media. The P-wave geometrical-spreading factor is expressed through the reflection traveltime described by a nonhyperbolic moveout equation that has the same form as in VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) media. The adapted VTI equation is parameterized by the <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) ellipse and the azimuthally varying anellipticity parameter η(α). To estimate the moveout parameters, we apply the 3 D nonhyperbolic semblance algorithm of Vasconcelos and Tsvankin that operates simultaneously with traces at all offsets and azimuths. The es-timated moveout parameters are used as the input in the geometrical-spreading com-putation. Numerical tests for models composed of orthorhombic layers with strong, depth-varying velocity anisotropy confirm the high accuracy of our travetime-fitting procedure and, therefore, of the geometrical-spreading correction. Since our algorithm is entirely based on the kinematics of reflection arrivals, it can be readily incorporated into the processing flow of azimuthal AVO analysis. In combination with the nonhyperbolic moveout inversion, the method was applied to wide-azimuth P-wave data collected at Weyburn field in Canada. The geometrical-spreading factor for the reflection from the top of the fractured reservoir is clearly influenced by the azimuthal anisotropy in the overburden, which should cause distor-tions in the azimuthal AVO attributes.

For a dipping TTI layer with the symmetry axis confined to the dip plane of the reflector, estimation of the symmetry-direction velocity VP 0, the anisotropy parameters ǫ and δ, and the tilt ν of the symmetry axis proves to be ambiguous despite the borehole constraints.

The generated reflectivity amplitude variations with offset have been increasingly used in seismic interpretation and more recently tested on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data to characterize nonaqueous-phase liquid contaminants. Phase and frequency sensitivities of the reflected signals are generally not used, although they contain useful information. The present study aims to evaluate the potential of these combined properties to characterize a thin bed using GPR data acquired along a common-midpoint (CMP) survey, carried out to assess velocity variations in the ground. It has been restricted to the simple case of a thin bed embedded within a homogeneous formation, a situation often encountered in fractured media. Dispersive properties ofthe dielectric permittivity of investigated materials (homogeneous formation, thin bed) are described using a Jonscher parameterization, which permitted study of the dependency of amplitude and phase variation with offset (APVO) curves on frequency and thin-bed properties (filling nature, aperture).

The reflection from the lower crust in Antarctica has not been surveyed yet and is an important target for explosion experiments in Antarctica. The reflection pattern in the crust is as useful as the velocity structure for study of evolution of the continent. Seismic refraction data which were obtained during the JARE- 21 seismic explosion experiments were re-analyzed to detect reflected waves from the lower crust. This study is aimed at obtaining a preparatory image of reflection of the crust where seismic reflection and refraction studies are planned to be conducted in the near future. The data were obtained by seismic refraction experiments on the Mizuho Plateau, East Antarctica in 1980. An explosion in the sea with 3000 kg of explosive gave well recorded seismic waves at 27 stations along a measuring line of about 300 km from the coast inland. The data were processed using simple procedures of reflection seismology, such as filtering, gain recovery and <b>normal-moveout.</b> A record section band-pass filtered at 10 - 15 Hz with a reduction velocity of 6 km/s shows clear phases of large amplitudes in a range of 8 to 16 s of two-way travel time; these are considered to have been reflected from the lower crust. The reflection depths correspond to about 18 to 48 km. The reflected waves are large enough to be detected without gain-recovery, assuming the existence of reflectors in the crust of Mizuho Plateau. However, the spacing of observation stations was too sparse to provide a clear image of reflection in the lower crust...|$|E
40|$|Moveout {{analysis}} of long-spread P-wave data {{is widely used}} to estimate the key time-processing parameter η in layered VTI media. Inversion for interval η values, however, suffers from instability caused by the tradeoff between the effective moveout parameters and by the subsequent error amplification during Dix-type layer stripping. Here, we propose an alternative approach to interval parameter estimation based on the velocity-independent layer-stripping method of Dewangan & Tsvankin (2006). This method {{makes it possible to}} compute the interval moveout in a layer of interest without knowledge of the medium parameters in the overburden. Then the interval traveltimes are inverted for the <b>normal-moveout</b> velocity (Vnmo) and η using the single-layer nonhyperbolic moveout equation. Thus, the layer stripping of η in the conventional method is replaced by the much more stable stripping of reflection traveltimes. We also develop the 3 D version of the layer-stripping method and apply it to interval parameter estimation for orthorhombic media using wide-azimuth P-wave data. The superior accuracy and stability of our algorithm is illustrated on ray-traced synthetic data for typical layered VTI and orthorhombic models. Even small correlated noise in reflection traveltimes produces substantial distortions in the effective η, and for some models, even in the effective Vnmo. As a result, the inter val η values estimated by the conventional Dix-type method may be highly inaccurate. In contrast, the output of our layer-stripping algorithm proves to be insensitive to mild correlated traveltime errors. The algorithm is also tested on wide-azimuth P-wave reflection data recorded above a fractured reservoir at Rulison field in Colorado. The interval moveout parameters estimated by the velocity-independent layer stripping in the shale layer above the reservoir are more plausible and stable than those obtained by the Dix-type method...|$|E

Conventional spiking deconvolution was applied to increase the high-f requency content of seismic data. The seismic data set was processed by CMP sorting, f ieldstatic corrections, velocity analysis, <b>normal-moveout</b> corrections, residual-static corrections besides corrections, residual-static corrections besides deconvolution. Before performing deconvolution, the effect of the design-window length, deconvolutionoperator length, and the location of the design window were investigated. From the analyses of the above parameters, it was shown that the location of window has the greatest effect on deconvolution. When the deconvolution operator was calculated, three methods of deconvolution were tested. They are I) the deconvolution operator was calculated for every trace in every CDP gather and the operator was applied to its trace and the traces are stacked, 2) deconvolution operators are calculated for each stacked trace and applied to the stacked trace from which it was calculated, and 3) the average is deconvolution operator obtained by averaging the operators from the second method and applied the stacked traces. From the observation of the stacked sections obtained using each method, it appears the third method generated the best results. This method requires one more step than second method but the result is much better. Synthetic seismograms were generated by two methods. one used the reflection-coefficients model and the other used the impulse-response model (including multiples). These results were convolved with a Ricker wavelet to generate synthetic seismograms. The results from both methods are similar each other and they are well correlated with stacked trace...|$|E
40|$|Parameter {{estimation}} from elliptical {{variations in}} the <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) velocity in azimuthally anisotropic media is sensitive to the angular separation between the survey lines in 2 D, or equivalently source-to-receiver azimuth in 3 D, and to the set of azimuths used in the inversion procedure. The accuracy in estimating {{the orientation of the}} NMO ellipse, the parameter cr, in particular, is also sensitive to the strength of anisotropy. To invert for the parameters the NMO ellipse, at least three NMO-velocity measurements along distinct azimuth directions are needed. In order to maximize the accuracy and stability in parameter estimation, it is best to have the azimuths for the three source-to-receiver directions 60 ° apart. Having more than three distinct source-to-receiver azimuths (e. g., full azimuthal coverage) provides a useful data redundancy that enhances the quality of the estimates. In orthorhombic media, inverting for the semi-axes of the NMO-ellipse allows the computation of the difference in the anisotropic parameters δ[superscript (1) ] and δ[superscript (2) ]. Additional information such as well data, is necessary in order to determine δ[superscript (1) ] and δ[superscript (2) ]. Furthermore, the accuracy in estimating the semi-axes of the NMO-velocity ellipse is about the same for any strength of anisotropy. To maximize quality in the inversion process, it is recommended that at the design stage of seismic data acquisition to have small sector sizes (≤ 10 °) with adequate fold and offset distribution. For three azimuth directions, 60 ° apart, to perform the inversion, an azimuthally anisotropic layer overlain by an azimuthally isotropic overburden (as might happen for fractured reservoirs) should have a time thickness, relative to the total time, of at least the ratio of the error in the NMO (stacking) velocity to the interval anisotropy strength of the fractured layer. Coverage along more than three azimuths, however, improves this limitation, which is imposed by Dix differentiation, by at most 50 % depending on the number of observations (NMO Velocities) that enter the inversion procedure.

40|$|As {{the results}} of seismic {{reflection}} and ground penetrating radar (GPR) studies become more prevalent as input for quantitative groundwater and engineering studies, {{it is important to}} evaluate traditional approaches to data processing and analysis. Where conventional methods fail it is necessary to investigate and/or develop non-traditional approaches to data analysis. I present five stand-alone studies that are focused on characterizing shallow aquifers using seismic reflection and GPR data processing and analysis. Each of the projects involves a new approach to data analysis either through alternative processing strategies that are not widely applied in environmental studies or development of new processing methods and/or algorithms. The first two studies are focused on seismic reflection imaging problems that arise in the shallow environment. I first present a detailed discussion of the errors that can result from conventional <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) processing, and the application of pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) to improve image accuracy. Second, I apply dip-moveout (DMO) processing to a data set from the Puget Sound. DMO is rarely applied in environmental studies, but can improve velocity analysis and image quality where there are dipping layers or scattering events. The final three studies are focused on attribute analysis of GPR and seismic reflection data in direct detection studies. Over the past 10 [...] 15 years, direct detection has been used successfully in the energy industry to identify oil and gas reserves from exploration scale seismic reflection data, but is a new approach to the analysis of GPR and shallow seismic reflection data. Direct detection studies use reflected wave attributes such as amplitude, frequency content, and phase to estimate material properties. I first present a detailed discussion of GPR amplitude vs. offset (AVO) analysis for direct detection of free phase non-aqueous phase liquid contaminants (NAPLs). The analysis is not straightforward and requires careful consideration of electromagnetic dynamic properties. Second, I present a shallow seismic case study where a predictable AVO response was detected.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. One of the major goals of seismic data processing is to produce an accurate image of the subsurface of the earth. Unfortunately, when dipping events or diffractions are present, or when velocities vary laterally, the <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) correction applied in common midpoint (CMP) stacking fails to convert even primary events on non-zero offset traces to true zero offset. Dip moveout (DMO) is a process that converts non-zerooffset data to true zero offset after NMO has been applied. Direct comparison of compressional (P) and shear (S) wave data in a fractured reservoir can show whether amplitude anomalies on the P-wave section are associated with the presence of gas or change of lithology. The P-wave and S-wave data selected for this study were shot in Burleson County, Texas. After processing, the P-wave and S-wave sections were interpreted. No gas-related DHf (direct hydrocarbon indicator) was seen in both sections. Comparison of both sections before and after DMO shows that DMO has helped imaging the fractures in the Austin Chalk and provided a clear image of the subsurface after migrating the DMO data. Major reflectors such as the Pecan Gap, "Top-of-the-Austin-Chalk", "Bottom-of-theAustin-Chalk", and Buda correlate well with seismic events on the synthetic seismogram which was generated from the sonic log of the Lancier Brinckman # 1 well. The difference in depth between the sonic log and the P-wave seismic section is small. The sonic log depths are deeper than the P-wave seismic section depths. The top and bottom of the Austin Chalk reflectors on both sections display laterally varying amplitudes (surface locations 55 to 68).

40|$|Horizontal {{transverse}} isotropy (HTI) is the simplest azimuthally anisotropic model {{used to describe}} vertical fracturing in an isotropic matrix. Using the elliptical variation of P-wave <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) velocity with azimuth, measured in three different source-to-receiver orientations, we can obtain the vertical velocity V[subscript Pvert], anisotropy parameter δ[superscript (V) ], and the azimuth a of the symmetry-axis plane. Parameter estimation from variations in the moveout velocity in azimuthally anisotropic media is quite sensitive to the angular separation between the survey lines in 2 D, or equivalently source-to-receiver azimuths in 3 D, and to the set of azimuths used in the inversion procedure. The accuracy in estimating the parameter α, in particular, is also sensitive {{to the strength of}} anisotropy. The accuracy in resolving δ[superscript (V) ] and [subscript Pvert] is about the same for any strength of anisotropy. In order to maximize the accuracy and stability in parameter estimation, it is best to have the azimuths for the three source-to- receiver directions 60 ° apart. In land seismic data acquisition having wide azimuthal coverage is quite feasible. In marine seismic data acquisition, however, where the azimuthal data coverage is limited, multiple survey directions are necessary to achieve such wide azimuthal coverage. Having more than three distinct source-to-receiver azimuths (e. g., full azimuthal coverage) provides useful data redundancy that enhances the quality of the estimates, and sets the stage for a least-square type of inversion in which the errors in the parameters estimates are minimized in a least-square sense. In layered azimuthally anisotropic media, applying Dix differentiation to obtain interval moveout velocity provides sufficient accuracy in the inversion for the medium parameters, especially where the direction of the symmetry planes is uniform. In order to obtain acceptable parameter estimates, an HTI layer overlain by an azimuthally isotropic overburden (as might happen for fractured reservoirs) should have a thickness (in time) relative to the total thickness. The total thickness should be equal to or greater than the ratio of the error in the NMO (stacking) velocity to the interval anisotropy strength of the fractured layer.

40|$|Anisotropy {{can exist}} in the {{subsurface}} as an intrinsic property, or as an induced property, or as a combination of both. Induced anisotropy can result due to preferred orientation of grains, thin layering, and/or the presence of fractures. In this thesis, we study the reflection moveout for Compressional and Shear waves in horizontally stratified azimuthally anisotropic media. Reflection moveout in common-midpoint (CMP) gathers is generally treated by an azimuthally-isotropic hyperbolic equation. Recently, special treatment for the reflection moveout in azimuthally anisotropic media has been introduced {{due to the fact}} that the moveout in such cases is azimuthally dependent. Here, the normal moveout (NMO) equation parameterized by the exact <b>normal-moveout</b> (NMO) velocity is studied. We verify numerically (through synthetic data) the accuracy of the exact (i. e., analytic) azimuthal description of the NMO velocity. We show that the azimuthal variation of the NMO velocity has, in general, a relatively simple elliptical form. We also show that the NMO equation is sufficiently accurate for P- and Shear-wave propagation on conventional spreadlengths (e. g., lenghts close to the reflector depth). The influence of anisotropy causes the deviation of the moveout curve from a hyperbola, even in a homogeneous anisotropic layer with a horizontal interface. Hence, reflection moveout in azimuthally anisotropic media is not only azimuthally dependent but it is also nonhyperbolic. (cont.) To account for the nonhyperbolic moveout, we have derived an exact expression for the azimuthally dependent quartic coefficient of the Taylor series expansion for the two-way traveltimes [t 2 (x 2) ] that is valid for any pure mode of wave propagation. As a result, we introduce an analytic representation for the quartic coefficient for pure mode reflection in anisotropic medium with an arbitrary strength of anisotropy. In addition, we present an analytic expression for large-offset, nonhyperbolic reflection moveout (NHMO). Special attention is given in this study toward P-wave propagation in orthorhom-about the same for any strength of anisotropy. To invert for the NMO ellipse parameters at least three NMO-velocity measurements along distinct azimuth directions are needed. In order to maximize the accuracy and stability in parameter estimation, it is best to have the azimuths for the three source-to-receiver directions 60 Ê» apart. Having more than three distinct source-to-receiver azimuths (e. g., full azimuthal coverage) enhances the quality of the estimates. The azimuthal variation of the NMO velocity in azimuthally anisotropic media can be utilized to invert for some of the medium parameters which can be useful in characterizing the zone of interest. In HTI media, for example, and using the P-wave reflection moveout, we can estimate three key parameters: the vertical velocity Vpvert, anisotropy parameter 6 (V), and the azimuth a of the symmetry-axis [...] .
