50|$|The EN plating of {{metallic}} nickel from {{aqueous solution}} {{in the presence}} of hypophosphite was first noted as a chemical accident by Wurtz in 1844. In 1911, Roux reported that metal was inevitably precipitated in the powder form; however these works were not in practical applications. In its early stage, progress in the field remained slow until World War II. In 1946, Brenner and Riddell developed a process for plating the inner walls of tubes with nickel-tungsten alloy, derived from the citrate based bath using an insoluble anode, which brought out the unusual reducing properties of hypophosphite. The U.S. Patent Office says that the patent it issued in 1950 differed from the earlier patent in that Roux reaction was spontaneous and complete, while the Brenner and Riddell process was a controlled catalytic process so that deposition occurred only on catalytic surfaces immersed in the bath. Brenner later wrote that his patent was an accidental discovery similar to the work of Wurtz and Roux, but said that he took out a patent to protect U.S. government rights. In fact, a declassified U.S. Army technical report written in 1963 goes on extensively about Wurtz and Roux work, and gives more of the discovery credit to them than to Brenner. This plating process was attributed to the action of chemical reduction of Ni ions. During the 1954-59 period, Gutzeit at GATC (General American Transportation Corporation) worked on full scale development of electroless plating by chemical reduction alone, as an alternate process to conventional electroplating. Initially, the co-deposition of particles was carried out for electrodepositing Ni-Cr by Odekerken, during the year of 1966. In that study, in an intermediate layer, finely powdered particles like aluminum oxide, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin were distributed within a metallic matrix. A layer in the coating is composite but other parts of the coating are not. The first commercial application of their work used the electroless Ni-SiC coatings on the wankel internal combustion engine and another commercial composite incorporating polytetrafluoroethylene (Ni-P-PTFE) was co-deposited, during the year of 1981. However, the co-deposition of diamond and PTFE particles was more difficult than that of composites incorporating Al2O3 or SiC. The feasibility to incorporate the fine second phase particles, in submicron to <b>nano</b> <b>size,</b> within a metal/alloy matrix has initiated a new generation of composite coatings.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The general aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{investigate}} early bone response to titanium implants modified with <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures. Therefore, 1. a model to evaluate titanium implants modified with <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures was validated; 2. a suitable detection method of <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures was implemented. Materials and Methods A rabbit model was selected and healing time was 4 weeks in all experiments. A smooth cylindrical implant design was selected {{in order to control}} the macrothreads and micro-structures. Thus, early bone response could be related to added <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures alone. A stabilization plate was utilized to ensure adequate fixation of the attached implant. Smooth implants were obtained through polishing techniques (electrical and mechanical) and were used as control surfaces and, after relevant modifications, as experimental surfaces. Six surface modifications were investigated: 1. mechanically polished, 2. electropolished, 3. nano hydroxyapatite (HA), 4. nano titania, 5. blasted (TiO 2) and 6. fluoride-modified. The implant surface topography was measured with an interferometer and an atomic force microscope. Surface roughness parameters were calculated and <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures dimension and distribution were characterized. Surface morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Surface chemical composition was monitored with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The bone response was measured with removal torque tests and histological and histomorphometrical analyses. Results The model tested to evaluate smooth implants was found adequate. Atomic force measurements combined with image processor analyses software was suitable to characterize <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures at the implant surface. Nano HA modified implants enhanced bone formation at 4 weeks of healing compared to electropolished implants. However, placed in a gap healing model the nano HA modified implants showed similar bone formation compared to electropolished implants. If both test and control implants were modified with nano structures, so-called bioactive nano HA and bioinert nano titania, respectively; enhanced bone response of 24 % was found to the “bioinert” nano titania implants, although not statistically significant. The beneficial effect of <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures on the experimental model was tested on screw shaped moderately rough implants. The oral implants that exhibited particular nano structures (fluoride and nano HA) showed a tendency of higher removal torque values compared to control (blasted) implants, that lacked such structures. Conclusions Based on in vivo animal experiments, enhanced bone formation was demonstrated to smooth and moderately rough titanium implants modified with <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> structures with different chemical composition...|$|E

The results show that the use of 80 % <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> palm oil fuel ash has produced higher compressive strength at the age of 28 days by 32 % compared to the control mortar. Grinding the palm oil fuel ash to a <b>nano</b> <b>size</b> particle has improved the reactivity of the ash and because of it is a waste material it reduces the cost of the mortar.
