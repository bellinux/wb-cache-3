5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|TsSO-P {{took part}} in the 1961 and 1962 Soviet Project K <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> above the Sary Shagan range {{to examine the effects of}} high {{altitude}} nuclear explosions on missile defence hardware.|$|E
5|$|Above-ground <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s and by France into the 1970s and 1980s spread a {{significant}} amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world. Additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents.|$|E

5|$|Greenpeace is a {{non-governmental}} {{environmental organization}} which {{emerged from the}} anti-nuclear and peace movements in the 1970s. Its ship, the Rainbow Warrior, frequently tried to interfere with <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> and whaling operations. The movement now has branches in forty countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which {{approved}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E
5|$|Southern Cross is {{the sole}} wordless novel by Canadian artist Laurence Hyde (1914–1987). Published in 1951, its 118 wood-engraved images narrate the impact of atomic testing on Pacific islanders. Hyde made the book to express his anger at the US military's <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> in the Bikini Atoll.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 North Korean <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> was the {{underground}} detonation {{of a nuclear}} device conducted on Monday, May 25, 2009 by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This was its second <b>nuclear</b> <b>test,</b> the first test, a fizzle, having taken place in October 2006. Following the <b>nuclear</b> <b>test,</b> Pyongyang also conducted several missile tests. A scientific paper later estimated the yield as 2.35 kilotons.|$|R
5000|$|... Iranian Foreign Ministry {{spokesman}} Ramin Mehmanparast stated {{after the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> that all <b>nuclear</b> weapons should be [...] "destroyed". However, {{it has been}} reported that Iran had a senior representative monitoring the <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
25|$|Scientists {{and diplomats}} have debated nuclear weapons policy {{since before the}} atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The public became {{concerned}} about <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>testing</b> from about 1954, following extensive <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
5|$|This is {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|Two more Fat Man {{bombs were}} detonated during the Operation Crossroads <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 Fat Man units were {{produced}} between 1947 and 1949, {{when it was}} superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Stevens Institute of Technology and New York University, Reines joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in 1944, working in the Theoretical Division in Richard Feynman's group. He became a group leader there in 1946. He participated {{in a number of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> culminating in his becoming the director of the Operation Greenhouse test series in the Pacific in 1951.|$|E
25|$|On October 17 North Korea denounced UN {{sanctions}} {{over its}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> as {{a declaration of}} war and the United States and other nations suspected that North Korea was seeking to conduct a second <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> despite international pressure.|$|R
50|$|On 22 April 2014, South Korea {{reported}} that North Korea had {{stepped up its}} activity at its main <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> site, meaning they may be preparing for their fourth underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b> The United States urged North Korea to refrain from testing.|$|R
25|$|On May 25, 2009, North Korea {{conducted}} {{its second}} underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b> The U.S. Geological Survey calculated its origin in {{proximity of the}} site of the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b> The test was more powerful than the previous test, estimated at 2 to 7 kilotons. The same day, a successful short range missile test was also conducted.|$|R
5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range ballistic missile. They were seen {{as an attempt to}} display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests.</b> The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as}} a national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in the area, are resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E
50|$|On October 6, 2006, Japan's Kyodo News agency {{reported}} that a US military aircraft, equipped to detect radiation from a <b>nuclear</b> <b>test,</b> took off from southern Japan. This {{was believed to be}} part of US efforts to prepare to monitor a North Korean <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
50|$|The public became {{concerned}} about <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>testing</b> from about 1954, following extensive <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific. In 1961, {{at the height}} of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Nuclear</b> weapons <b>tests</b> are {{experiments}} {{carried out}} to determine the effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability of nuclear weapons. Throughout the twentieth century, most nations that developed <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>tested</b> them. <b>Testing</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons can yield information about how the weapons work, {{as well as how}} the weapons behave under various conditions and how personnel, structures, and equipment behave when subjected to <b>nuclear</b> explosions. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
5|$|For Sarah's nuclear {{nightmare}} scene, Robert and Dennis Skotak of 4-Ward Production {{constructed a}} cityscape of Los Angeles using large-scale miniature buildings and realistic roads and vehicles. The pair, after having studied actual footages of <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> then simulated the nuclear blast by using air mortars to knock over the cityscape, including the intricately built buildings.|$|E
5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, and to confirm <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> by states such as North Korea.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Tests,</b> caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year {{when there were no}} tests and it was cited as evidence that the previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E
50|$|By the 1960s {{steps were}} taken to limit both the {{proliferation}} of nuclear weapons to other countries and the environmental effects of <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> The Partial <b>Nuclear</b> Test Ban Treaty (1963) restricted all <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> to underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing,</b> to prevent contamination from nuclear fallout, whereas the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968) attempted to place restrictions on the types of activities signatories could participate in, {{with the goal of}} allowing the transference of non-military nuclear technology to member countries without fear of proliferation.|$|R

2500|$|The final <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{detonation}} at Nevada Test Site was Operation Julin's [...] "Divider" [...] on 23September 1992, {{just prior}} to the moratorium temporarily ending all <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> Divider was a safety experiment test shot that was detonated {{at the bottom of a}} shaft sunk into Area3.|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s, whistle-blower Avon Hudson {{disclosed}} {{details of}} the Maralinga testing program to the Australian media at risk of incarceration. His disclosures related to the inadequacy of clean-up measures, persistent contamination and associated health risks of ionizing radiation. Hudson gave testimony to the Royal Commission into British <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> in Australia in 1984 and 1985 and has since continued {{to work as a}} spokesperson for nuclear veterans in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous land {{owners have}} {{consistently}} opposed uranium mining and have spoken {{out about the}} adverse impact it has on their communities. The British <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> at Maralinga {{were found to have}} left significant radiation hazards in land given back to the Maralinga Tjarutja people, and the issue continues to cause indigenous opposition.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers is a {{military}} science fiction novel by U.S. writer Robert A. Heinlein. Written {{in a few weeks}} in reaction to the U.S. suspending <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> the story was first published as a two-part serial in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction as Starship Soldier, and published as a book by G. P. Putnam's Sons in December 1959.|$|E
50|$|After Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1966, {{the nuclear}} program was {{consolidated}} when physicist Raja Ramanna joined the efforts. Another <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> by China {{eventually led to}} India's decision toward building nuclear weapons in 1967 and conducted its first <b>nuclear</b> <b>test,</b> Smiling Buddha, in 1974.|$|R
