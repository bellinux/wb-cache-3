Stomatal crypts can be an adaption to drought and dry climate conditions when the stomatal crypts are very pronounced. However, dry climates {{are not the only}} places where they can be found. The following plants are examples of species with stomatal crypts or antechambers: <b>Nerium</b> oleander, conifers, and Drimys winteri which is a species of plant found in the cloud forest.|$|E
25|$|Members of this genus are leathery, {{tough to}} kill and fake death. Since they are {{unpleasant}} to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to sip from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the pyrrolizidine alkaloids which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and <b>Nerium</b> oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, Galveston has been {{popularly known as}} the 'Oleander City' because of {{a long history of}} {{cultivating}} <b>Nerium</b> oleander, a subtropical evergreen shrub which thrives on the island. Oleanders are a defining feature of the city; when flowering (between April and October) they add masses of color to local gardens, parks, and streets. Thousands were planted in the recovery following the Hurricane of 1900 and Galvestonians continue to treasure the plant for its' low water needs, tolerance of heat, salt spray and sandy soils. This makes them especially resistant to the after-effects of hurricanes and tropical storms. Galveston is reputed to have the most diverse range of Oleander cultivars in the world, numbering over 100, with many varieties developed in the city and named after prominent Galvestonians. In 2005 the month of May was declared [...] "Oleander Month" [...] by the City of Galveston and there are also Oleander-themed tours of the city exploring the history of the plant on the island. Since 1967 the International Oleander Society has operated in Galveston, which promotes the cultivation of the plant, organizes an Oleander festival every spring and maintains a commemorative Oleander garden in the city.|$|E

Biodiversity and {{endemism}} {{levels are}} much higher in the Tibesti than in the Aïr Mountains or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation's coverage is highly dependent on rainfall. A number of oases lie along the courses of the enneris such as Enneri Yebige, which is virtually unexplored. These oases, which are more numerous {{to the north and}} west of the range, have vegetation of the genera Acacia, Ficus (fig trees), Hyphaene and Tamarix. Most gueltas are lined with macrophytes including Cyperus laevigatus, Equisetum ramosissimum, Juncus fontanesii and Scirpus holoschoenus. Acacia nilotica grow near these water basins. Myrtus nivellei and <b>Nerium</b> oleander grow between elevations of [...] {{in the western part of}} the range, while Tamarix nilotica grow at similar elevations in its northern part.

2500|$|Nomenclatural {{issues were}} {{reviewed}} by Alexander N. Sennikov in 2011. Although pre-Linnaean authors {{had used the}} name Chamaenerion, which may have originated as early as 1561, in 1753 Carl Linnaeus preferred Epilobium. Chamaenerion {{is derived from the}} Greek chamai (χαμαί), meaning [...] "low", [...] "near the ground", and nerion (νήριον), the oleander, <b>Nerium</b> oleander. Some authors continued to use Chamaenerion (or the alternative spelling Chamaenerium), but this name was not published legitimately under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) until Jean-François Séguier did so in 1754. It was assumed by some later authors that Séguier's name was a superfluous replacement for Linnaeus' Epilobium, but Sennikov argues that a strict application of the ICN shows that it was legitimate. Ludwig K.G. Pfeiffer in 1873 used Chamaenerion in a more restricted sense than Linnaeus' Epilobium, designating Epilobium angustifolium L. as the type species. Thus the correct name for a genus separated from Epilobium and including Linnaeus' Epilobium angustifolium is Chamaenerion.|$|E
