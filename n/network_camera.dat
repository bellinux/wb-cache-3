2500|$|On May 16, 2010, a 7-year-old Detroit {{girl named}} Aiyana Jones {{was shot and}} killed during a [...] "special weapons and tactics" [...] (SWAT) raid that was filmed by The First 48 cameras. Detroit SWAT unit raided the duplex while searching for a {{homicide}} suspect. On October 5, 2011, prosecutors charged the Detroit police officer with the involuntary manslaughter of Jones. Allison Howard, an A Television <b>Network</b> <b>camera</b> operator filming that night, was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice after lying under oath. She pleaded no contest to obstruction of justice and was sentenced to two years of probation.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Axis Communications {{introduced}} the industry's first <b>network</b> <b>camera,</b> the AXIS 200. This was followed in 1999 by the AXIS 2100 {{which was the}} first volume product using an embedded Linux. In 2004, the company {{introduced the}} AXIS 206, the then smallest <b>network</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
50|$|Axis Communications {{develops}} {{and sells}} network cameras for many applications.

50|$|There {{continues}} to be much debate over the merits and price-for-performance of <b>Network</b> <b>cameras</b> as compared to analog cameras. Many in the CCTV industry claim that many analog <b>cameras</b> can outperform <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> at a lower price.|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{the first}} {{software}} iteration was to control a <b>networked</b> <b>camera</b> using a customized program {{without the use of}} the supplied camera web interface or vendor-specific camera-management software included with most <b>network</b> <b>cameras.</b> One of the advantages of utilizing <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> is that the camera control interface can be implemented through sending simple HTTP commands. To demonstrate this, a 10 -line Python script was written for sending manual control commands to a camera. Once it was shown that it was easy to control the cameras, work started on a C++ application for the actual image processing.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> and their connection to a PC. <b>Network</b> <b>cameras</b> are analyzed in terms of internal structure, external structure and aspects of their use. Communication with the PC and the user is provided with a communication interface and control software. The most important function {{in the use of}} <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> is their output – a video. It is composed of several individual factors, such as the encoding method, compression and frame rate. The theory is applied in practice as proposed by the best camera, the method of connection and programming of custom control applications in the Java programming language...|$|R

5000|$|Because <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> are {{embedded}} devices, {{and do not}} need to output an analogue signal, resolutions higher than closed-circuit television 'CCTV' analogue cameras are possible. A typical analogue CCTV camera has a PAL (768×576 pixels) or NTSC (720×480 pixels), whereas <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> may have VGA (640×480 pixels), SVGA (800×600 pixels) or quad-VGA (1280×960 pixels, also referred to as [...] "megapixel") resolutions.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{improvements}} in technology, {{it is necessary}} to make a distinction between a VMS and the built-in features of modern <b>network</b> based security <b>cameras.</b> Many modern <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> offer internal capabilities to record and review video directly themselves via a web browser and without the use of a VMS. However a camera's built-in web interface is typically exclusive to the camera itself and does not normally provide a shared access capability across other <b>network</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{estimation}} of grow index of tealeaves based on Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function: BRDF measurements with ground based <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> is proposed. Due to {{a fact that}} Near Infrared: NIR camera data is proportional to total nitrogen while that shows negative correlation to fiber contents, {{it is possible to}} estimate nitrogen and fiber contents in tealeaves with ground based NIR camera data and remote sensing satellite data. Through regressive analysis between measured total nitrogen and fiber contents and NIR reflectance of tealeaves in tea estates, it is found that there is a good correlation between both then regressive equations are created. Also it is found that monitoring of a grow index of tealeaves with BRDF measured with <b>networks</b> <b>cameras</b> is valid. Thus it is concluded that a monitoring of tea estates with <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> of visible and NIR is appropriate...|$|R

The server acquires video streams from <b>network</b> <b>cameras</b> and transcodes the video feeds into one-second video segments at multiple resolutions. The transcoded video supports random access into any region-of-interest (RoI) within the video.

50|$|An {{analogue}} or {{digital camera}} {{connected to a}} video server acts as a <b>network</b> <b>camera,</b> but the image size is restricted {{to that of the}} video standard of the camera.

50|$|Corridor {{format is}} a video {{surveillance}} format for HDTV network cameras making {{full use of}} the 16:9 aspect ratio when monitoring narrow view areas such as staircases, hallways, aisles or tunnels. When using the regular landscape video surveillance format for narrow view areas, the full resolution of a HDTV <b>network</b> <b>camera</b> is not utilized as large parts of the field of view are redundant. Corridor format technology turns the 16:9 aspect ratio into 9:16 while HDTV standards such as full frame rate and resolution are maintained. Either the HDTV <b>network</b> <b>camera</b> is installed sideways or the 3-axis lens is rotated 90 degrees when mounting the camera. Then the video image is rotated back 90 degrees by the internal camera software. Corridor format can be accessed by software vendors through an open API.|$|E

50|$|Embedded {{systems such}} as <b>networked</b> <b>cameras</b> and <b>networked</b> power {{distribution}} devices, which lack a user interface, can use so-called ARP stuffing to make an initial network connection, although this is a misnomer, as ARP is not involved.|$|R
50|$|Some DVRs {{also allow}} digital {{broadcasting}} {{of the video}} signal, thus acting like a <b>network</b> <b>camera.</b> If a device does allow broadcasting of the video, but does not record it, then it's called a video server.

50|$|Network cameras can be {{used for}} very cheap {{surveillance}} solutions (requiring one <b>network</b> <b>camera,</b> some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV monitors become computers with TFT screens and specialised software.

50|$|P-Iris (Precise Iris Control) {{is a type}} of <b>network</b> <b>camera</b> lens that {{together}} with specialized software installed in the camera itself regulates the iris opening {{through the use of a}} stepper motor for contrast, clarity, resolution and depth of field.
