40|$|The ding-a-ling {{model is}} a kind of half lattice and half hard-point-gas (HPG) model. The {{original}} ding-a-ling model proposed by Casati et. al does not conserve total momentum and has been found to exhibit <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> conduction behavior. Recently, a modified ding-a-ling model which conserves total momentum has been studied and <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> conduction has also been claimed. In this work, we propose a full lattice ding-a-ling model without hard point collisions where total momentum is also conserved. We investigate the heat conduction and energy diffusion of this full lattice ding-a-ling model with three different nonlinear inter-particle potential forms. For symmetrical potential lattices, the thermal conductivities diverges with lattice length and their energy diffusions are superdiffusive signaturing anomalous heat conduction. For asymmetrical potential lattices, although the thermal conductivity seems to converge as the length increases, the energy diffusion is definitely deviating from normal diffusion behavior indicating anomalous heat conduction as well. No <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> conduction behavior can be found for the full lattice ding-a-ling model. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous (non-Fourier's) heat {{transport}} {{is no longer}} just a theoretical issue since it has been observed experimentally in a number of low-dimensional nanomaterials, such as SiGe nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and others. To understand these anomalous behaviors, exploring the microscopic origin of <b>normal</b> (Fourier's) <b>heat</b> transport is a fascinating theoretical topic. However, this issue has not yet been fully understood even for one-dimensional (1 D) model chains, in spite of a great amount of thorough studies done to date. From those studies it has been widely accepted that the conservation of momentum is a key ingredient to induce anomalous {{heat transport}}, while momentum-nonconserving systems usually support <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> transport where Fourier's law is valid. But if the nonconservation of momentum is the reason, what is the underlying microscopic mechanism for the observed <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> transport? Here we carefully revisit a typical 1 D momentum-nonconserving ϕ^ 4 model and present evidence that the mobile discrete breathers or, in other words, the moving intrinsic localized modes with frequency components above the linear phonon band can be responsible for that.

40|$|Making {{connections}} {{is critical}} in fabrication of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems). It is also complicated, because the temperature during joining affects both the bond produced and the structure and mechanical properties of the moving parts of the device. Specifications for MEMS packaging require that the temperature not exceed 240 [*]°C. However, usually, temperatures can reach up to 300 [*]°C during conventional thermosonic wire bonding. Such a temperature will change the distribution of dopants in CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) circuits. In this {{paper we propose a}} new heating process. A semiconductor laser (wavelength 808 nm) is suggested as the thermal source for wire bonding. The thermal field of this setup was analyzed, and specific mathematical models of the field were built. Experimental results show that the heating can be focused on the bonding pad, and that much lower heat conduction occurs, compared with that during the <b>normal</b> <b>heating</b> method. The bond strength increases with increasing laser power. The bond strengths obtained with laser heating are slightly lower than those obtained with the <b>normal</b> <b>heating</b> method, but can still meet the strength requirements for MEMS...|$|E

40|$|A general {{interface}} {{model is}} presented for thermal conduction and characterized by two jump relations. The first one expresses that the temperature jump across an interface {{is proportional to}} the interfacial average of the <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> flux while the second one states that the <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> flux jump {{is proportional to the}} surface Laplacian of the interfacial average of the temperature. By varying the two scalar proportionality parameters, not only the Kapitza resistance and highly conducting interface models can be retrieved but also all the intermediate cases can be covered. The general interface model is numerically implemented by constructing its weak form and by using the level-set method and XFEM. The resulting numerical procedure, whose accuracy and robustness are thoroughly tested and discussed {{with the help of a}} benchmark problem, is shown to be efficient for solving the problem of thermal conduction in particulate composites with various imperfect interfaces...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{great number}} of {{situations}} of practical interest, the interfaces between the constituent phases of a composite turn out to be imperfect. In the context of thermal conduction, an interface is said to be imperfect if the requirement that both the temperature and the <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> flux be continuous across the interface is not satisfied. A powerful method based on mathematical asymptotic analysis has been proposed and developed in the literature by several authors for the derivation of linear imperfect interface models of thermal conduction. This method consists in replacing an interphase of small uniform thickness between two-phases by an imperfect interface of null thickness characterized by the temperature and <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> flux jump relations deduced by carrying out an appropriate asymptotic analysis. The objective of the present work is threefold. Firstly, it aims to explicitly show and emphasize the key role played by Hadamard's relation in the method. Secondly, it has the purpose of using a coordinate-free differential geometry theory and Hadamard's relation to render the method coordinate-free. Thirdly and most importantly, the present work gives a weak formulation for the problem concerning the steady thermal conduction in a composite with the interfaces described by the general temperature and <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> flux jump relations derived. This weak formulation is a key step toward solving the problem by the extended finite element method (XFEM) presented in a companion paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Comparisons between coronal spectroheliograms and photospheric magnetograms are {{presented}} {{to support the}} idea that as coronal magnetic fields interact, a process of field-line reconnection usually takes place as a natural way of preventing magnetic stresses from building up in the lower corona. This suggests that the energy which would have been stored in stressed fields is continuously released as kinetic energy of material being driven aside {{to make way for the}} reconnecting fields. However, this kinetic energy is negligible compared with the thermal energy of the coronal plasma. Therefore, it appears that these slow adjustments of coronal magnetic fields cannot account for even the <b>normal</b> <b>heating</b> of the corona, much less the energetic events associated with solar flares...|$|E

For a given lattice width W, a dimensional crossover is generally observed to occur at a W-dependent {{threshold of the}} lattice length. Lattices shorter than W will display a 3 D behavior while lattices longer than W will display a 1 D behavior. In the 3 D regime, the heat current autocorrelation function was found to show a power-law decay {{as a function of}} the time lag tau as tau(beta) with beta = - 1. 2. This indicates <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> conduction. However, the decay exponent deviates significantly from the conventional theoretical value of beta = - 1. 5. A flat power spectrum S(omega) of the global heat current in the low-frequency limit was also observed in the 3 D regime.

40|$|This {{research}} presents how {{to improve}} the heat pump efficiency by using Discharge Superheat Control (DSH). <b>Normal</b> <b>heat</b> pump uses Suction Superheat Control (SSH) about 5 K. At this condition, it is an optimum condition for cooling COP {{but it is not}} the highest cooling capacity. To improve Heat Pump efficiency, it needs to get maximum heat from Evaporator and internal heat of Compressor to discharge at Condensing. This condition needs to be controlled at SSH ~ 0 K. Unfortunately <b>normal</b> <b>heat</b> pump can not be controlled at this condition because of limitation of expansion valve controlling and operating limit of some compressor. New control method under this condition, is called Discharge Superheat Control (DSH). It uses discharge temperature for controlling refrigerant flow to get the maximum heat at Evaporator and Compressor.

Previous researches require the weld surfaces to be painted which adds to the unnecessary process. Without using a <b>normal</b> <b>heating</b> source, such as lasers or flashlamps, ultrasonic waves were considered as an ideal heating source because they can generate heat inside the study object.

40|$|The {{temperature}} distribution in copper and martensitic steel spheres {{has been investigated}} for the initial stage of field-activated sintering (FAST) /spark plasma sintering (SPS) using capacitor discharges (CD) with applied voltages from one to 15 V as model experiments.

The results show the reduction in the contact resistance after discharge with increasing electrical load, yet no significant dependence on the length or number of the discharge pulses. Thereby the initial resistance is only decreased distinctly if at least a certain minimal voltage was applied. Subsequently, the melting of thin coatings of different metals on copper spheres has been studied and the occurrence of molten phase and its melting point were assigned to the corresponding discharge current. Extrapolation from the currents necessary to melt the coating layers in the CD experiments to lower values typical for FAST was used to estimate the contact overtemperature in the latter case.

Parts of the material in this paper were presented at the AMS Ninth Technical Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology, May 1975, Miami, Fla. Solutions to the wave-CISK (conditional instability of the second kind with cumulus heating being induced by low-level internal wave convergence} system are obtained to study the vertical structure of marginally unstable waves. Adiabatic heating profile is specified that resembles those observed and those theoretically derived from simple parameterization schemes. Upper and lower bounds for the vertical wavelength of the unstable waves under <b>normal</b> <b>heating</b> conditions are established through analysis of the frequency (stability) equation. The lower bound excludes the possibility of excitation or maintenance of short vertical wavelengths (relative to the vertical scale of heating) by wave-CISK. The calculated growth rates indicate that this result is basically insensitive to the vertical heating profile. The vertical structure of the most unstable waves is also computed and the possible roles played by CISK in large-scale tropical waves are discussed in light of these results...|$|E
