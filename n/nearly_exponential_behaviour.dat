40|$|We {{study the}} {{phase-space}} behaviour of nearby trajectories in integrable potentials. We {{show that the}} separation of nearby orbits initially diverges very fast, mimicking a <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>behaviour,</b> while at late times it grows linearly. This initial exponential phase, known as Miller's instability, is commonly found in N-body simulations, and {{has been attributed to}} short-term (microscopic) N-body chaos. However we show here analytically that the initial divergence is simply due to the shape of an orbit in phase-space. This result confirms previous suspicions that this transient phenomenon is not related to an instability in the sense of non-integrable behaviour in the dynamics of N-body systems.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some years that the uniform-density problem for neural {{networks}} has a positive answer: Any real-valued, continuous function can be uniformly approximated by a neural network with one hidden layer. We contribute here to the related complexity problem. We call an activation function oe : R ! R <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> if, after suitable affine transformations in the source and target spaces R, oe approximates the exponential function arbitrarily closely on the negative half line. This class of functions contains the functions 1 =(1 + e), tanh(t), and e 1. A neural network is of <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> type if the hidden neurons carry <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> activation functions. We show among other things that the order of approximation of a Lipschitz-continuous function by neural networks of <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> type is O(N), N being the number of hidden neurons. We also expose constants in the estimates and derive an algorithm for effictive approximation of a continuous function by a neural network of given <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> type. The method of proof consists in approximating the continuous function by exponential sums and these, in turn, by neural networks of <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> type...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} known for some years that the uniform-density problem for forward neural {{networks}} has a positive answer: Any real-valued, continuous function on a compact subset of Rd can be uniformly approximated by a sigmoidal neural network with one hidden layer. We design here algorithms for efficient uniform approximation by a certain class of neural networks with one hidden layer which we call <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential.</b> This class contains, e. g., all networks with the activation functions 1 =(1 + e t), tanh (t), or et ^ 1 in their hidden layers. The algorithms flow from a theorem stating that such networks attain the order of approximation O (N 1 =d), d being dimension and N the number of hidden neurons. This theorem, in turn, is a consequence of a close relationship between neural networks of <b>nearly</b> <b>exponential</b> type and multivariate algebraic and exponen-tial polynomials. The algorithms need neither a starting point nor learning parameters; they do not get stuck in local minima, and the gain in execution time relative to the backpropagation algorithm is enormous. The size of the hidden layer can be bounded analytically {{as a function of the}} precision required.
