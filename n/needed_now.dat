5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were <b>needed</b> <b>now</b> that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
25|$|In {{drawing up}} AWPD-1, George had {{predicted}} that two very heavy bombers {{that were on}} the drawing board, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the Consolidated-Vultee B-36, would be ready in time {{to take part in the}} attack on Germany. Delays in both programs kept them from consideration in Europe. In AWPD-42, the B-29 was shifted to attacks on Japan, and the B-36 development at Consolidated-Vultee was slowed in favor of manufacturing more B-24 Liberators. The extra long range of the B-36 would not be <b>needed</b> <b>now</b> that the United Kingdom appeared secure from attack.|$|E
25|$|He {{also ran}} into {{conflict}} with President Lincoln and others who wanted to organize the army into divisions. Scott argued that in the Mexican War, no commands larger than brigades had been needed and that none were <b>needed</b> <b>now,</b> even though the Army of the Potomac was more than triple the size of Scott's army in Mexico. McClellan, the ambitious new field commander, wanted Scott out and had many influential political friends. Scott resigned on November 1, 1861. McClellan then succeeded him as general-in-chief. Although officially retired, Scott was still occasionally consulted by Lincoln for strategic advice during the war.|$|E

The Treaty of Oliva was signed in May, after Charles Gustav's death. The Polish side <b>needed</b> <b>now</b> to preserve strength for the struggle with Russia and the old demarcation line was mostly agreed to, with the Commonwealth keeping Courland and southeastern Livonia, including Daugavpils. The Protestants in Royal Prussia were guaranteed religious freedoms, Frederick William had to return his conquests in Swedish Pomerania to Sweden. John II Casimir relinquished his claims to the Swedish throne. The Treaty of Oliva involved the Commonwealth, Brandenburg and Sweden and was guaranteed by Louis XIV of France.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one flat car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they <b>needed</b> <b>now</b> was a ramp at the right height.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} before World War I, pacifism and patriotism often came into conflict, and the BSA was {{sometimes}} in the middle. [...] Some thought that the BSA was too militaristic, especially as characterized by their military style uniforms and discipline, while others felt that the BSA was unpatriotic in their stance against military training. [...] In 1912, a member of another organization, the [...] American Boy Scouts, shot another boy with a rifle. West quickly distanced the BSA from the ABS program and any military training or discipline. [...] He refused to allow the BSA Supply group to sell the Remington rifle endorsed by the ABS and de-emphasized the Marksmanship merit badge. [...] The National Rifle Association lobbied the Executive Board to issue the badge. [...] In 1914, Colonel Leonard Wood resigned from the Board after a pacifistic article was published in Boys' Life that he considered to be [...] "almost treasonable". [...] Eventually, the rhetoric calmed down, and the BSA began to issue the Marksmanship merit badge. On the issue of militarism and Scouting, Baden-Powell said he had seen enough of war and that [...] "...the boys should be kept away from {{the idea that they}} are being trained so that some day they might fight for their country. It is not war Scouting that is <b>needed</b> <b>now,</b> but peace Scouting." [...] Baden-Powell also thought the BSA was too bureaucratic.|$|E
