40|$|Abstract Background Differences {{in sweet}} taste {{perception}} among species depend on structural {{variations of the}} sweet taste receptor. The commercially used isovanillyl sweetener <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> activates the human but not the rat sweet receptor TAS 1 R 2 +TAS 1 R 3. Analysis of interspecies combinations and chimeras of rat and human TAS 1 R 2 +TAS 1 R 3 suggested that the heptahelical domain of human TAS 1 R 3 is crucial for the activation of the sweet receptor by <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone.</b> Results By mutational analysis combined with functional studies and molecular modeling we identified a set of different amino acid residues within the heptahelical domain of human TAS 1 R 3 that forms the <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> binding pocket. Sixteen amino acid residues in the transmembrane domains 2 to 7 {{and one in the}} extracellular loop 2 of hTAS 1 R 3 influenced the receptor's response to <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone.</b> Some of these seventeen residues are also part of the binding sites for the sweetener cyclamate or the sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. In line with this observation, lactisole inhibited activation of the sweet receptor by <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> and cyclamate competitively, whereas receptor activation by aspartame, a sweetener known to bind to the N-terminal domain of TAS 1 R 2, was allosterically inhibited. Seven of the amino acid positions crucial for activation of hTAS 1 R 2 +hTAS 1 R 3 by <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> are thought {{to play a role in}} the binding of allosteric modulators of other class C GPCRs, further supporting our model of the <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> pharmacophore. Conclusion From our data we conclude that we identified the <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> binding site at the human sweet taste receptor, which overlaps with those for the sweetener cyclamate and the sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. This readily delivers a molecular explanation of our finding that lactisole is a competitive inhibitor of the receptor activation by <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> and cyclamate. Some of the amino acid positions crucial for activation of hTAS 1 R 2 +hTAS 1 R 3 by <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> are involved in the binding of allosteric modulators in other class C GPCRs, suggesting a general role of these amino acid positions in allosterism and pointing to a common architecture of the heptahelical domains of class C GPCRs. </p...|$|E
40|$|The electrooxidation of {{flavonoids}} {{has been}} investigated in non-aqueous solution at a platinum electrode. The process of oxidation and its kinetics {{has been investigated}} using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The electrochemical oxidation of flavonoids is an irreversible reaction at a platinum electrode. For <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> silymarin, 7 -aminoflavone and trihydroxyethylenorutin, {{the first step in}} the electrooxidation is the exchange of one electron during the oxidation of the hydroxyl group in ring B. The hydroxyl groups in ring A are likely oxidised in a subsequent step. <b>Neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> oxidation was the easiest, and trihydroxyethylenorutin was the hardest, which was confirmed by the half-wave potential (E 1 / 2) of the first electrode step in the electrooxidation of the flavonoids.

As a consequence, they are introduced into the environment by different pathways, affecting aquatic life. In this study, a method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) has been developed and validated for the determination of eight sweeteners (saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, acesulfame, <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> sucralose, stevioside and glycyrrhizic acid) in river water and wastewater. To get the maximum recoveries in SPE, several commercial sorbents were tested and Oasis HLB gave the best results, with recoveries higher than 41 % {{for all of the}} compounds in the different matrices. Method limits of detection were in the range of 0. 001 - 0. 04. μg/L in river water and 0. 01 - 0. 5. μg/L in influent and effluent wastewater. Method reproducibility between days (n= 5) was below 15 % for all compounds. The method was applied to the determination of sweeteners in various river waters and wastewaters in Catalonia. Cyclamate, aspartame, <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> acesulfame and sucralose were found in river water, with the two last compounds being present at the highest values (1. 62 μg/L for acesulfame and 3. 57. μg/L for sucralose).

This paper reports the isolation and full spectroscopic characterization of compounds 1 and 2 by NMR, UV, IR and MS data. Background Oxytropis is an important genus of the family Leguminosae, also known as “Locoweed”. The whole plant of Oxytropis myriophylla (Leguminosae) is an important Mongolian medicine, widely distributed in the southeast and northwest areas of China. It has traditionally been used to treat various diseases of rubella and influenza, applied to swelling and throat pain, together with different types of bleeding. Pharmacological research on this plant showed anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [1, 2]. Primary investigation on this plant has led to the isolation of several flavonoids, triterpene glycosides and ligans [3, 4], and in a continuation of studies on its minor constituents, the new natural product <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> (1) and the known phloridzin (2), the first reported from the genus Oxytropis were obtained. This paper reports the isolation and full spectroscopic characterization of compound 1 by NMR, UV, IR and MS data. Results and Discussion The phytochemical study of 70 % ethanol extract obtained from the whole plant of O. myriophylla afforded two compounds, including a new natural product 1 <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> and a known metabolite phloretin- 4 ’-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (2) (Figure 1).

With regard to this background, <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> (NHDC) effect was investigated toward porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA), and found to be an activator of the enzyme. The maximal activation (up to threefold) was found to occur at 4. 8 mM of NHDC, which could be considered {{to have a high}} activation profile, with regard to the alpha and beta parameters (alpha< 1 <beta).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} zinc sulfate (5, 25, 50 mM) to inhibit the sweetness of 12 chemically diverse sweeteners, which were all intensity matched to 300 mM sucrose [800 mM glucose, 475 mM fructose, 3. 25 mM aspartame, 3. 5 mM saccharin, 12 mM sodium cyclamate, 14 mM acesulfame-K, 1. 04 M sorbitol, 0. 629 mM sucralose, 0. 375 mM <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> (NHDC), 1. 5 mM stevioside and 0. 0163 mM thaumatin]. Zinc sulfate inhibited the sweetness of most compounds in a concentration dependent manner, peaking with 80 % inhibition by 50 mM. Curiously, zinc sulfate never inhibited the sweetness of Na-cyclamate. This suggests that Na-cyclamate may access a sweet taste mechanism {{that is different from}} the other sweeteners, which were inhibited uniformly (except thaumatin) at every concentration of zinc sulfate.

40|$|AbstractSweet {{enhancing}} {{effect of}} <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> (NHDC) or cyclamate {{has been reported}} to be synergistic in human sensory tests. However, little is known about whether these synergisms are caused by the mechanism mediated by the human sweet-taste receptor. Here, we examined the sweetness intensity of sweet tastant mixtures by measuring the responses of cultured cells stably expressing the human sweet-taste receptor. The results showed that the cell response to sucrose was synergistically potentiated by the addition of NHDC or cyclamate. Moreover, a point mutation in the transmembrane domain of hT 1 R 3 almost completely eliminated the enhancing effects of NHDC and cyclamate. These results suggest that ligand–receptor interactions in the transmembrane domain of hT 1 R 3 are necessary for NHDC and cyclamate to elicit the synergistic potentiation of the receptor activation. Our results may provide the foundation of a molecular basis for receptor-based synergisms of sweet tastes in mixtures of diverse sweet substances...|$|E
40|$|Sucrose {{and other}} saccharides, which produce an {{appealing}} taste in rats, {{were found to}} significantly stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase in membranes derived from the anterior-dorsal region of rat tongue. In control membranes derived from either tongue muscle or tongue non-sensory epithelium, the effect of sugars on adenylate cyclase activity was either much smaller or absent. Sucrose enhanced adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-related manner, and this activation was dependent {{on the presence of}} guanine nucleotides, suggesting the involvement of a GTP-binding protein ('G-protein'). The activation of adenylate cyclase by various mono- and di-saccharides correlated with their electrophysiological potency. Among non-sugar sweeteners, sodium saccharin activated the enzyme, whereas aspartame and <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> did not, in correlation with their sweet-taste effectiveness in the rat. Sucrose activation of the enzyme was partly inhibited by Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +, in agreement with their effect on electrophysiological sweet-taste responses.

40|$|<b>Neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> (NHDC) is an {{intensive}} sweetener, obtained by alkaline hydrogenation of neohesperidin. In this investigation a supposed taste enhancing {{effect of this}} substance was tested. A three-step procedure was used. In the first experiment, using a pool of 31 subjects, NHDC and sucrose detection thresholds were measured. In the second experiment, psychophysical functions for both tastants were determined. Then, 15 participants closest to the group threshold who, in addition, had produced monotonic psychophysical taste functions were selected {{to participate in the}} next two experiments. In the third experiment, taste enhancement was tested. Three psychophysical sucrose functions were constructed, one with a near-threshold amount of NHDC added to each of seven sucrose concentrations, one with a near-threshold amount of sucrose added (control 1) and one without any addition (control 2). No difference was found between the NHDC-enriched sucrose function and the sucrose-enriched sucrose function. Finally, in experiment 4, differential threshold functions were constructed with either NHDC or sucrose added. Neither the overall shape of the functions nor a comparison of the points of subjective equality showed enhancement.

The conversions were achieved over 85 % under the catalysis of lipase Novozyme 435 in acetone at 45 °C at semi-preparative scale. The conjugates were purified via solvent partition and silica gel chromatography and achieved 90 – 98 % in purity. The NMR {{analysis of the}} conjugates confirmed that the fatty acid carbon chain was linked onto the primary –OH group on the glucose moiety of the flavonoids. The purified flavonoid conjugates alongside their original flavonoids were analyzed for antioxidant activities via 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay, and anti-peroxidation test via peroxide values measured during a 1 -week fish oil storage trial. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) assay was conducted with 1, 10, and 100 μM of naringin and grapefruits and their conjugates, respectively, and total VEGF levels were measured at 24 and 48 h, respectively, using ELISA and dot blot analysis.

The crystal data are as follows: a= 15. 125 (5), b= 30. 523 (5), c= 41332 (5) Å, orthorhombic, space group C 2221.

The dimeric units, formed by head-to-head assemblies of CD molecules, each with its guest, are self-assembled in columns. The stability of the columns is provided by host-guest attractive interactions, thus showing a key role of the guest molecules in the crystal architecture.

40|$|The {{commensal}} bacteria Lactobacillus {{are widely}} used as probiotic organisms conferring a heath benefit on the host. They have been implicated in promoting gut health via the stimulation of host immunity and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as protecting the intestinalmucosa against pathogen invasion. Lactobacilli grow by fermenting sugars and starches and produce lactic acid as their primary metabolic product. For efficient utilisation of varied carbohydrates, lactobacilli have evolved diverse sugar transport and metabolic systems, which are specifically induced by their own substrates. Many bacteria are also capable of sensing and responding to changes in their environment. These sensory responses are often independent of transport or metabolism and are mediated through membrane-spanning receptor proteins.

40|$|Phloretin {{hydrolase}} catalyzes the hydrolytic C-C cleavage of phloretin to phloroglucinol and 3 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) {{propionic acid}} during flavonoid degradation in Eubacterium ramulus. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by screening a gene library for hydrolase activity. The insert of a clone conferring phloretin hydrolase activity was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an {{open reading frame}} of 822 bp (phy), a putative promoter region, and a terminating stem-loop structure. The deduced amino acid sequence of phy showed similarities to a putative protein of the 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthetic operon from Pseudomonas fluorescens. The phloretin hydrolase was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was approximately 55 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the deduced amino acid sequence of phy indicated molecular masses of 30 and 30. 8 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the enzyme is a homodimer. The recombinant phloretin hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of phloretin to equimolar amounts of phloroglucinol and 3 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid. The optimal temperature and pH of the catalyzed reaction mixture were 37 °C and 7. 0, respectively. The Km for phloretin was 13 ± 3 μM and the kcat was 10 ± 2 s− 1.

The NHDC treatment was well tolerated and all animals survived till the end of the study. Body weights (bw) and body weight gains did not differ between controls and NHDC treatment groups. The intake of NHDC was 0. 8 - 0. 9, 1. 6 - 1. 7, and 3. 1 - 3. 4 g/kg bw/day for the low-, mid-, and high-dose group, respectively. Except for cecal enlargement, there were no changes observed at necropsy which could be related to the NHDC treatment. All dams had viable fetuses. The fecundity and gestation index, the number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live and dead fetuses, early and late resorptions, pre- and post-implantation losses, and sex-ratio were not affected by the treatment. There were no differences for the mean weight of the gravid and empty uterus, ovaries, and placenta between the NHDC treatment groups and the controls. Examination of the fetuses for external, visceral, and skeletal changes did not reveal any fetotoxic, embryotoxic or teratogenic effects of NHDC. In conclusion, no adverse effects were observed at NHDC levels of up to 5 % of the diet, the highest dose level tested, at which the rats consumed about 3. 3 g/kg body weight/day. The observed cecal enlargement is a well-known physiological, adaptive response to the ingestion of high doses of a low-digestible substance and is generally accepted to lack toxicological relevance. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Low- and no-calorie sugar subtistutes are {{compounds}} that provide food with its sweet taste. As the term suggests, they have lower or no food energy and usually {{are characterized by}} higher sweetness than sucrose. For that reason, these substances are especially used during the treatment of diabetes mellitus, to reduce the energy content of food or in prevention of dental caries. Natural sweeteners were discovered a long time ago, during the search for sustenance. For example Stevia was used by South American Natives even before the European conquest of the territory. However, the history of artificial sweeteners is not too significant, because it relates to breaking the laboratory rules. That is how saccharin was invented in 1878. Sugar substitutes are added to food on purpose, adjusting the taste or extending the shelf life of foods. In the EU, every approved sweetener has got an E-code, which is displayed on the label. Sugar substitutes can be grouped according to their origin, their nutrition value or their chemical structure. This thesis discusses low- and no-calorie sugar substitutes that can be synthetic or natural. Mentioned synthetic sweeteners typically contain less then 21 kJ per portion. These intensive food additives possess many times the sweetness of sucrose. The main representatives of this group are saccharin, cyclamate, acesulfame K, sucralose and aspartame with its derivatives. The group of natural sugar substitutes constits of substances like erythritol, D-tagatose, trehalose, <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone,</b> stevioside and thaumatin. There are some limitations confirmed by expert studies. For example, patients suffering from diabetes mellitus should mainly use synthetic sweeteners, because of their low nutritional value. Even though in some states certain sweeteners are forbidden, safety studies {{say that there are}} no adverse effects, if the recommended daily intake is respected. Sugar substitutes, therefore, can be considered safe...|$|E

The analytes were separated in gradient elution mode on C 18 column and detected by mass spectrometer working with an electrospray source in negative ion mode. To confirm that analytical method is suitable for its intended use, several validation parameters, such as linearity, limits of detection and quantification, trueness and repeatibilty were evaluated. Calibration curves were linear within a studied range of concentrations (r 2 [*]≥[*] 0. 999) for six investigated sweeteners (CYC, ASP, ALI, DUL, NHDC, NEO). Three compounds (ACS-K, SAC, SCL) gave non-linear response in the investigated concentration range. The method detection limits (corresponding to signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3) were below 0. 25  μg mL− 1 (μg g− 1), whereas the method quantitation limits (corresponding to S/N ratio of 10) were below 2. 5  μg mL− 1 (μg g− 1).

The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of the nine sweeteners in drinks, yoghurts and fish products. The procedure described here is simple, accurate and precise and is suitable for routine quality control analysis of foodstuffs...|$|E
40|$|In an {{intensive}} livestock production, a shorter suckling period allows more piglets to be born. However, this practice {{leads to a}} number of disorders including nutrient malabsorption, resulting in diarrhoea, malnutrition and dehydration. A number of strategies have been proposed to overcome weaning problems. Artificial sweeteners, routinely included in piglets' diet, were thought to enhance feed palatability. However, it is shown in rodent models that when included in the diet, they enhance the expression of Na+/glucose co-transporter (SGLT 1) and the capacity of the gut to absorb glucose. Here, we show that supplementation of piglets' feed with a combination of artificial sweeteners saccharin and <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> enhances the expression of SGLT 1 and intestinal glucose transport function. Artificial sweeteners are known to act on the intestinal sweet taste receptor T 1 R 2 /T 1 R 3 and its partner G-protein, gustducin, to activate pathways leading to SGLT 1 up-regulation. Here, we demonstrate that T 1 R 2, T 1 R 3 and gustducin are expressed together in the enteroendocrine cells of piglet intestine. Furthermore, gut hormones secreted by the endocrine cells in response to dietary carbohydrates, glucagon-like peptides (GLP) - 1, GLP- 2 and glucose-dependent insulinotrophic peptide (GIP), are co-expressed with type 1 G-protein-coupled receptors (T 1 R) and gustducin, indicating that L- and K-enteroendocrine cells express these taste elements. In a fewer endocrine cells, T 1 R are also co-expressed with serotonin. Lactisole, an inhibitor of human T 1 R 3, had no inhibitory effect on sweetener-induced SGLT 1 up-regulation in piglet intestine. A better understanding of the mechanism(s) involved in sweetener up-regulation of SGLT 1 will allow the identification of nutritional targets with implications for the prevention of weaning-related malabsorptio...|$|E

In M. murinus the effects of the taste modifiers gymnemic acid and miraculin on the CT response were recorded. Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) experiments in M. murinus and two-bottle preference (TBP) tests in E. mongoz were also conducted. We found that all of the above t. astants except thaurnatin elicited a CT response in both species. The CT A technique showed that M. mwinus generalized from sucrose to monellin but not to thaurnatin. The intake of aspartame, ranging in concentrat ion from 0. 1 to 30 mM was measured in E. mongoz with TBP tests. At no concentration did we see a preference, but there was a significant rejection of 10 and 30 mM aspaname (?< 0. 025). Miraculin had no effects on the CT response to acids, and gymnemic acid did not selectively suppress the CT response to sucrose or that of any other sweeteners. The absence of ability to taste thaumatin in these species supports the dichotomy between catarrhine and non-catarrhine species. The difference in results with thaumatin and monellin indicate that their sweet moieties are not identical. It also points to a phylogenetic difference in taste within the prosin 1 ian group. Further, the results with aspartame indicate that the perception of sweetness from aspartame is limited to catarrhine species. Finally, neither miraculin nor gymnemic acid exhibit the sam, taste modifying effects in lemurifomes as they do in hominoidea. Thus the results with gymnemic acid and miraculin corroborate those obtained earlier in other prosimians...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbsorption of glucose {{from the}} lumen of the {{intestine}} into enterocytes {{is accomplished by}} sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT 1). In the majority of mammalian species, expression (this includes activity) of SGLT 1 is upregulated in response to increased dietary monosaccharides. This regulatory pathway is initiated by sensing of luminal sugar by the gut-expressed sweet taste receptor. The objectives of our studies were to determine (1) if the ruminant intestine expresses the sweet taste receptor, which consists of two subunits [taste 1 receptor 2 (T 1 R 2) and 3 (T 1 R 3) ], and other key signaling molecules required for SGLT 1 upregulation in nonruminant intestines, and (2) whether T 1 R 2 -T 1 R 3 sensing of artificial sweeteners induces release of glucagon-like peptide- 2 (GLP- 2) and enhances SGLT 1 expression. We found that the small intestine of sheep and cattle express T 1 R 2, T 1 R 3, G-protein gustducin, and GLP- 2 in enteroendocrine L-cells. Maintaining 110 -d-old ruminating calves for 60 d on a diet containing a starter concentrate and the artificial sweetener Sucram (consisting of saccharin and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone; Pancosma SA, Geneva, Switzerland) enhances (1) Na+-dependent d-glucose uptake by over 3 -fold, (2) villus height and crypt depth by 1. 4 - and 1. 2 -fold, and (3) maltase- and alkaline phosphatase-specific activity by 1. 5 -fold compared to calves maintained on the same diet without Sucram. No statistically significant differences were observed for rates of intestinal glucose uptake, villus height, crypt depth, or enzyme activities between 50 -d-old milk-fed calves and calves maintained on the same diet containing Sucram. When adult cows were kept on a diet containing 80 : 20 ryegrass hay-to-concentrate supplemented with Sucram, more than a 7 -fold increase in SGLT 1 protein abundance was noted. Collectively, the data indicate that inclusion of this artificial sweetener enhances SGLT 1 expression and mucosal growth in ruminant animals. Exposure of ruminant sheep intestinal segments to saccharin or <b>neohesperidin</b> <b>dihydrochalcone</b> evokes secretion of GLP- 2, the gut hormone known to enhance intestinal glucose absorption and mucosal growth. Artificial sweeteners, such as Sucram, at small concentrations are potent activators of T 1 R 2 -T 1 R 3 (600 -fold>glucose). This, combined with oral bioavailability of T 1 R 2 -T 1 R 3 and the understanding that artificial sweetener-induced receptor activation evokes GLP- 2 release (thus leading to increased SGLT 1 expression and mucosal growth), make this receptor a suitable target for dietary manipulation...|$|E
