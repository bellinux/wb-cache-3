40|$|Smoothness and {{symmetry}} are {{two important}} properties of a re <b>nable</b> function. It {{is known that}} the Sobolev smoothness exponent of a re <b>nable</b> function can be estimated by computing the spectral radius of a certain nite matrix which is generated from a mask. However, the increase of dimension {{and the support of}} a mask tremendously increases the size of the matrix and therefore makes the computation very expensive. In this paper, we shall present a simple and ecient algorithm for the numerical computation of the smoothness exponent of a symmetric re <b>nable</b> function with a general dilation matrix. By taking into account the symmetry of a re <b>nable</b> function, our algorithm greatly reduces the size of the matrix and enables us to numerically compute the Sobolev smoothness exponents of a large class of symmetric re <b>nable</b> functions. Step by step numerically stable algorithms are given. To illustrate our results by performing some numerical experiments, we construct a family of dyadic interpolatory masks in any dimension and we compute the smoothness exponents of their re <b>nable</b> functions in dimension three. Several examples will also be presented for computing smoothness exponents of symmetric re <b>nable</b> functions on the quincunx lattice and on the hexagonal lattice...|$|R

40|$|The {{protease}} inhibitor leupeptin prevented multiple s ep replication of an influenza virus (A/swine/ 1976 / 31, HINl) mediated by staphylococcal proteases. It also suppressed virus eplication {{and development of}} fatal pneumonia in mice co-infected with the virus and Staphylococcus aureus. With avian influenza viruses it could be demonstrated convincingly that post-translational proteolytic leavage of the viral haemagglutinin glycoprotein by cellular proteases i essential for infectivity, spread of the virus in the host organism and pathogenicity (Rott & Klenk, 1986). In a host cell where an appropriate protease for cleavage is not present, {{and as a consequence}} infectious virus cannot be produced, infectivity can be recovered by treatment ofnon-infectious virus by trypsin in vitro (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz & Choppin, 1975). Recently it could be shown that Staphylococcus aureus, which is most frequently isolated from patients with influenza pneumonia (Stuart-Harris etal., 1985), secretes serine proteases that activate the infectivity of several influenza A viruses by proteolytic cleavage of the haemagglutinin (Tashiro et al., 1987 a, b).

40|$|This study {{explored}} the differential effects of strategy training on German and American elementary-school children and assessed {{the role of}} parents {{in the development of}} their children's strategic behav-ior and metacognition. 184 German and 161 American children were pretested on memory and metamemory tasks. Children were then assigned to either an organizational strategy training condi-tion or a control condition. All children were tested on the maintenance and far-transfer of the strategy and task-related metamemory 1 week following training. Parents completed questionnaires about strategy instruction i the home. Strategy maintenance and metacognition were reassessed 6 months following training. German children were more strategic than American children. In-structed children performed better than control children. German parents reported more instruc-tion of strategies inthe home. These data suggest that formal education isresponsible for aspects of cognitive development that have sometimes been viewed as a function of age. Much of memory development {{is not so much a}} product of age but of education. Schooling promotes the development of efficient memory skills that might not ordinarily occur or de-velop as rapidly in nonschool environments (Stevenson, 1987; Wagner, 1981). One way in which teachers and parents facilitate cognitive development is by nurturing the development of chil-dren's metacognition [...] their understanding about and applica-tion of learning strategies.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new iteration method to estimate asteroid coordinates, {{which is based}} on the subpixel Gaussian model of a discrete object image. The method operates by continuous parameters (asteroid coordinates) in a discrete observational space (the set of pixels potential) of the CCD frame. In this model, a kind of the coordinate distribution of the photons hitting a pixel of the CCD frame is known a priori, while the associated parameters are determined from a real digital object image. The developed method, being more flexible in adapting to any form of the object image, has a high measurement accuracy along with a low calculating complexity due to a maximum likelihood procedure, which is implemented to obtain the best fit instead of a least-squares method and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for the minimisation of the quadratic form. Since 2010, the method was tested as the basis of our CoLiTec (Collection Light Technology) software, which has been installed at several observatories of the world with the aim of automatic discoveries of asteroids and comets on a set of CCD frames. As the result, four comets (C/ 2010 X 1 (Elenin), P/ 2011 NO 1 (Elenin), C/ 2012 S 1 (ISON), and P/ 2013 V 3 (Nevski)) as well as more than 1500 small Solar System bodies (including five NEOs, 21 Trojan asteroids of Jupiter, and one Centaur object) were discovered. We discuss these results that allowed us to compare the accuracy parameters of a new method and confirm its efficiency. In 2014, the CoLiTec software was recommended to all members of the Gaia-FUN-SSO network for analysing observations as a tool to detect faint moving objects in frames.

40|$|Abstract We {{extend a}} new {{waveform}} inversion scheme (Aoi et al., 1995) for estimating underground structure with an irregular-shaped basement {{as a target}} o cases where plane waves with an arbitrary azimuth impinge on the structure, i. e., from a direction ot necessarily perpendicular tothe major axis of the structure. We proved the validity of this scheme by numerical experiments. We had already achieved the formulation and numerical experiments for the cases where an SH wave impinges on a 2 D basin structure and had shown that we could estimate the entire basin structure with seismic waveforms from only a few surface stations by using whole waveforms that include the surface waves. However, when the epicenter is located {{out of the plane}} including the observation stations, even the cases of 2 D structure cannot be treated as a simple 2 D (SH or P-SV) problem because of the wave with an azimuth that is not 0 °. Therefore, by dealing with 3 D wave fields in the present study, we extend the inversion scheme in order to apply it to incident waves with an arbitrary azimuth. The differential seismograms, which represent the sensitivity of change in the waveform, show different patterns in three components, and we demonstrate that inversion with three components, compared with the inver-sion with only one of them, leads to a linearized equation system with a smaller condition number and a more stable computation. Furthermore, we detect certain parts that are estimated with much less difficulty than others, depending on the di-rection from which the incident wave impinged. In the latter case, we can estimate the entire structure by employing simultaneously several data from incident waves arriving from different directions. We thus demonstrate by numerical experiments that the extension of our inversion method to cases where the incident wave with an arbitrary azimuth impinges on the structure <b>nables</b> us to estimate with increased accuracy an underground structure under more general conditions of the epicenter locations...|$|E

We call a speci cation formalism fully decidable {{if it is}} constructively closed under {{boolean operations}} and has a decidable satis ability (nonemptiness) problem. There are two important, robust classes of!-languages that are de <b>nable</b> by fully decidable formalisms.

The counter-free!-regular languages are de <b>nable</b> by temporal logic, or equivalently,by the rst-order fragmentoftheSequential Calculus. The gap between both classes can be closed by nite counting (using automata connectives), or equivalently,by projection (existential second-order quanti cation over letters).

40|$|In this note, we are {{interested}} in the symmetry property of a re <b>nable</b> function with a general dilation matrix. We investigate the symmetry group of a mask so that its associated re <b>nable</b> function with a general dilation matrix has a certain kind of symmetry. Given two dilation matrices which produce the same lattice, we demonstrate that if a mask has a certain kind of symmetry, then its associated re <b>nable</b> functions with respect to the two dilation matrices are the same; therefore, the two corresponding derived wavelet systems are essentially the same. Finally, we illustrate that for any dilation matrix, orthogonal masks, as well as interpolatory masks having nonnegative symbols, can be easily constructed with any preassigned order of sum rules by employing a linear transform. Without solving any equations, the method in this note on constructing masks with certain desirable properties is simple, painless and general. Examples of quincunx wavelets and wavelets with respect to the checkerboard lattice are presented to illustrate the general theory.
