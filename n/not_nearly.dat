5|$|Despite the announcement, {{the ambitious}} project became {{inactive}} and was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted and <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> {{enough of the}} S$250,000 funds had been raised. In 1985, the alumni announced that the funds collected earlier would be rediverted to other projects, such as providing scholarships.|$|E
5|$|Flat Creek, a small southeast-flowing stream, {{rises in}} two forks and empties into the Sacramento River {{upstream}} of Spring Creek. The stream receives contaminated runoff from the Minnesota Flats Tailing Pile, but is <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as polluted or acidic as Spring Creek. Another stream, Rock Creek, rises in three forks and flows east {{to meet the}} Sacramento River downstream of Spring Creek and the Keswick Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of STS-124, severe damage was seen at the pad where bricks were blasted from the walls, but NASA {{officials}} stated the damage from the STS-125 launch was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as severe and should not impact {{the launch of}} STS-127 in June.|$|E

5|$|Q*bert {{became one}} of the most merchandised arcade games behind Pac-Man, {{although}} according to John Sellers it was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as successful as that franchise or Donkey Kong. The character's likeness appears on various items including coloring books, sleeping bags, frisbees, board games, wind-up toys, and stuffed animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by Yuri Andropov. Andropov only held {{the office of}} General Secretary for {{less than two years}} until his 1984 death. Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality, {{although}} <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> to the same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally. Their passing defense was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as successful. On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E

5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions that would have allowed for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{attorney}} William Shea {{was attempting}} to create the Continental League, a rival league to Major League Baseball. Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league. Wismer was willing; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins' principal owner, George Preston Marshall, and realized he would never own the Washington franchise. Wismer, while wealthy, was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as rich as the other potential team owners.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October, {{following}} his exclusion from {{the starting lineup}} of a match against Toronto FC by manager Mauro Biello, Drogba refused {{to play for the}} team that night, removing his name from the squad. With both his fitness, due to a lingering back injury, and his role in the team in question, Drogba did not travel with the team to, although he was in attendance at, their first postseason match at D.C. United, a 4â€“2 victory on 27 October. Drogba did <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> experience the same level of success in his second regular season compared to the first, scoring only 10 goals while appearing in only 22 games.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg lived most of {{his later}} life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and {{publishing}} the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied {{a group of scientists}} who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> focused enough on hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.|$|E
5|$|Tech quarterback Reggie Ball was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as acclaimed. Despite {{leading the}} ACC with 20 {{touchdown}} passes and being named an All-ACC honorable mention, there were doubts about Ball's effectiveness. Since starting at quarterback in his freshman year, Ball went 0-4 against Tech rival Georgia, and was excoriated for his inconsistency. After suffering a game-losing fumble against the Bulldogs, commentators questioned how well Ball would recover from the setback before the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
40|$|Sharp {{declines in}} {{semiconductor}} prices are {{largely responsible for}} observed declines in computer prices. Although communications equipment also has a large semiconductor content, communications equipment prices do <b>not</b> fall <b>nearly</b> as fast as computer prices. This paper partly resolves the puzzle-first noted by Flamm(1989) -by demonstrating that prices for chips used in communications equipment do <b>not</b> fall <b>nearly</b> as fast as prices for those chips used in computers, and those differences are large enough to potentially explain all of the output price differences.

5|$|The {{following}} year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due {{to strongly}} worded {{orders from the}} high commands of both sides prohibiting fraternisation. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of the Somme and Verdun, and the incorporation of poison gas.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E

5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|October 3, 2001: At {{approximately}} 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted {{the driver}} of his bus, attempting to slit his throat, and causing the bus to crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> to the same level as airports or train stations.|$|E
5|$|Phips and {{the crew}} were rewarded by the investors with medals, and Phips was knighted by James in June. James also rewarded Phips with the post of provost marshal general (chief sheriff) of the Dominion of New England, serving under Sir Edmund Andros. In September 1687 Phips {{returned}} to the wreck, {{though he did not}} command the venture. Admiral Narborough elected to personally lead the expedition, but it was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> as successful. The wreck had been discovered by others, and the arrival of the English scattered more than 20 smaller ships. Treasure worth Â£10,000 was recovered before Narborough's death in May 1688 brought the expedition to an end. Phips had by then already left the wreck site in early May, sailing for Boston for what seems to have been his first time home in four and a half years, to take up his new post as provost marshal general.|$|E
