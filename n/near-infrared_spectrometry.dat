This approach is decomposed in two steps: first a sparse representation of the coefficients matrix is obtained using a simultaneous greedy method. Then, a ℓ 1 penalty regularization on the derivative of nonzero coefficients enforces a piecewise constant variation along the rows of the solution. The regularization problem is solved efficiently using the ADMM (Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers) optimization method. The approach is applied on <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> dataset of wood wastes. This allows to select among the 1647 wavelengths of the spectra those suitable for classification.

As previously described in introduction, more information about termite resistance of hinoki families should be obtained. However, termite test is not a non-destructive method. Therefore an easy, rapid and especially non-destructive method for estimation of termite resistance should be developed. In the decay resistance of Togolose teak (Tectona grandis), for example, the relationship of L* with mass loss was shown to be highly significant; thus, {{the use of}} colorimetry as a rapid and cheap tool to estimate short-term natural durability could be considered [25]. In hinoki families, the relationships between color indexes and termite resistance were significant; however, the correlation coefficients were small (Fig.  3).

This study aimed at determining the compatibility of TiO 2 with F-NIRS. Three dry cows were fed a standard hay-based diet for three weeks supplemented with a daily dose of 0. 1 % (10 g) TiO 2 during the last two weeks of the experiment. Faeces samples were collected every day and analysed for TiO 2 and F-NIRS. Results suggest that TiO 2 did not interfere with F-NIRS analyses. The calculations of crude protein, NDF, ADL contents, as well as dry matter intake did not change over time with increasing TiO 2 in the faeces (P > 0. 05). Slight differences observed for other predicted parameters seemed to be independent from TiO 2. The higher Mahalanobis distance (H) for chemical composition (H = 7. 2) independent from TiO 2 inclusion could indicate that faecal spectra did not correspond exactly to the prediction database.

Un-sweetpotato populations and varieties which may have use both for fresh consumption and in processed forms are therefore under development at the Sweetpotato Support Platform for West Africa, and drawing on a global genetic resource base at CIP headquarters in Lima, Peru. In Ghana base populations were assembled from locally adapted regional germplasm, including released varieties, farmers' varieties, breeding lines from IITA reported to be un-sweet, and from exotic germplasm reported to be unsweet. Seed populations were also introduced for assessment from Sweetpotato Support Platforms in Uganda and Mozambique, and from Japan and the USA.

40|$|World ethanol {{production}} rose to nearly 13. 5 billion gallon in 2006. Ethanol {{has been part}} of alcoholic beverages for long time, but its application has expanded much beyond that during the 20 th Century. Much of the recent interest is in the use of ethanol as fuel. In this paper, we have reviewed published literature on current {{ethanol production}} and separation methods, and chemical and sensory analysis techniques. Ethanol produced by fermentation, called bioethanol, accounts for approximately 95 % of the ethanol production. It is recently widely used as an additive to gasoline. Corn in the Unites States and sugarcane in Brazil are widely used as raw materials to produce bioethanol. Cellulosic materials are expected to be the ultimate major source of ethanol and also represent a value-adding technology for agricultural coproducts. While bioethanol is considered as a sustainable energy source, it requires further purification for uses other than fuel. The most common purification technique utilized in the ethanol industry is rectification by further distillation. However, distillation has critical disadvantages including high cost and limited separation capacity. Several alternatives have been proposed to replace distillation such as non-heating fractional distillation by ultrasonic irradiation, oxidation of impurities by ozone, and adsorption of impurities by activated carbon or zeolite. Chemical and sensory analyses are used to determine the quality of alcohol and to optimize various steps in production. <b>Near-infrared</b> (NIR) <b>spectrometry,</b> high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and mass spectrometry (MS), have been developed for chemical analyses.

Methods We conducted three field experiments with different years, wheat varieties and nitrogen rates and determined time-course near-infrared absorbance spectroscopy and total nitrogen content from fresh and dry wheat leaves. The methods of partial least squares (PLS), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and wavelet neural network (WNN) were used to establish the calibration models, and a dataset selected at random was used to evaluate the established models.

In a major {{initiative}} to further improve its nutritive value, a partnership based research has been under way at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) to eventually develop high-yielding hybrids {{with higher levels of}} iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) contents. Objective We investigated some of the factors that can enhance breeding efficiency for these micronutrients. Methods Grain samples from various trials were harvested and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, <b>near-infrared</b> reflectance <b>spectrometry</b> and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) screening techniques. Results Large variability for and high levels of both Fe and Zn content were observed in breeding lines and populations (> 80 ppm Fe and > 60 ppm Zn). The Fe and Zn contents were positively and highly significantly correlated (r = 0. 49 to 0. 71). There were negative correlations (r = – 0. 39 to – 0. 58) between these micronutrients and grain yield, though significant only in the case of Fe content and in only three of the six trials. These micronutrients were not correlated with seed size and time to flower. Both Fe and Zn content were largely under additive genetic control with the predictability ratio of 0. 91. Conclusion These results showed that effective selection for both Fe and Zn content is possible without compromising on grain yield and seed size, and the rapid and cost-effective EDXRF screening technique can accelerate the breeding efficiency.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} the use of <b>near-infrared</b> (NIR) <b>spectrometry</b> for the in vitro quantification of econazole nitrate (EN) and estradiol (EST) in human skin. Methods. NIR spectra were collected from EN and EST powders to verify the presence of NIR chromophores. One percent EN cream, a saturated solution of EN, or 0. 25 % EST solution was applied to human skin. NIR spectra were collected and one-point net analyte signal (NAS) multivariate calibration was used to predict the drug concentrations. NIR results were validated against known skin concentrations measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of solvent extracts. Results. NIR spectroscopy measured dermal absorption from saturated solutions of EN on human skin with an r 2 = 0. 990, standard error of estimation (SEE) = 2. 46 %, and a standard error of performance (SEP) = 3. 55 %, EN cream on skin with an r 2 = 0. 987, SEE = 2. 30 %, and SEP = 2. 66 %, and 0. 25 % solutions of EST on skin with an r 2 = 0. 987, SEE = 3. 30 %, and SEP = 5. 66 %. Despite low permeation amounts of both drugs through the stratum corneum into human tissue, the NIR signal-to-noise ratio was greater than three, even for the lowest concentrations. Conclusion. NIR analyses paralleled the results obtained from HPLC, and thus could serve as a viable alternative for measuring the topical bioavailability/bioequivalence of different EN and EST formulations. Because these experiments were conducted in human tissue, this research suggests an all-optical in vivo method of measurement for dermal absorption could be developed.

The development of generic topical dermatological products has often been hampered due to {{the limited number of}} acceptable approaches, which are capable of determining the BE between generic products and reference list products. The aim of this manuscript is to review different BE assessment approaches of topical dermatological products. Besides, the advances in BE evaluation and biowaivers are also provided. Currently, except in the case of dermatological corticosteroids, the golden rule to establish the BE of most topical dermatological products still heavily relied on clinical endpoint trials, which are often unreliable, time-consuming and expensive. The regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical industries are forging ahead to the development of new surrogate BE assessment approaches for other topical dermatological products. These promising approaches include dermatopharmacokinetic study (DPK), dermal microdialysis (DMD), in vitro studies, pharmacokinetic study (PK), <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (NIR), and confocal Raman spectroscopy (CRS). In addition, the expansion of biowaivers for topical dermatological products has been explored by pharmaceutical scientists. In conclusion, to accelerate the development and approval of topical dermatological products, emphasis should be put on the following areas, i. e., optimizing and standardizing the existing BE assessment methods, exploring novel alternatives of BE assessment approaches, and expanding biowaivers for topical dermatological products...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} sample {{movement}} on spectral response during fiber probe diffuse reflectance <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (NIR) sampling was characterized. This is of central importance in Process Analytical Chemistry (PAC) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT). The incitement {{to this study}} was the observation of spectral artifacts during measurements of powder samples in process streams when using a mechanically scanning spectrometer. Artifacts appeared as momentary changes in the spectral response during acquisition of a scan. These transitions emanate from continuous replacement of the sample subfraction seen by the probe and are typical for turbid media where sample properties may vary locally with respect to scattering and/or absorption. The impact on qualitative and quantitative analysis using chemometric methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression was evaluated through experimental and theoretical simulations. It was generally found that spectra with the smallest residuals after projection onto the models came from non-moving samples or samples moving only slowly. It is shown that the magnitude of the spectral residuals is directly connected to the effective sample size, which relates both to sample speed {{as well as to the}} sample area presented to the probe.

The reasons for this increased interest are several including its wide applicability, the possibility of in situ applications, {{and the availability of}} powerful multivariate statistical treatments. It is our primary goal in this research project to develop new instruments for the near-IR region. New methods that are sensitive to either the concentration of chemicals or the physical-chemical properties of the solutions will then be developed using these instruments. The first part of our research focused on the development of a near-IR thermal lens spectrophotometer. This method has applicability and selectivity that are similar to other near-IR spectrometric techniques, but has superior sensitivity. The performance of the near-IR thermal lens spectrophotometer was tested in several assays of chemical and isotopic purity of solvents and in the determination of nucleotides. The second part of our research focused on the applications of the near-IR thermal lens technique to the determination of the structure of water solutions.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is to apply remote sensing data on {{problems}} concerning the climate system. It is grouped into two parts. Part I (Chapters 1, 2) is devoted to spectroscopic measurements of HDO, H 2 O and column CO 2, and Part II (Chapters 3 - 5) is devoted to variations in the Earth's reflectance. In Chapter 1, we derive the first simultaneous measurements of HDO and H 2 O in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. This is made possible by extending the retrievals of the Atlas- 3 Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) data deeper into the troposphere. The derived HDO/H 2 O ratio demonstrates that convection has {{a major influence on}} the moisture budget and the dehydration processes in this region. The objective of Chapter 2 is to determine the precision to which column averaged CO 2 volume mixing ratio (VMR) can be measured by <b>near-infrared</b> (NIR) <b>spectrometry</b> of reflected sun light. The key idea in this study is the simultaneous use of the CO 2 (1. 58 -&# 956;m and 2. 06 -&# 956;m) and O 2 (0. 76 -?m) bands. This approach allows small changes in the spectrum arising from variations of column CO 2 VMR to be distinguished from those arising from variations of other atmospheric/surface parameters. Using prototype retrieval simulations based on a practical satellite instrument design, we show that the 3 -band, high-resolution, spectrometric approach using NIR reflected sunlight has the potential for highly accurate column CO 2 VMR measurements. In Chapters 3 - 5, we examine the interannual variations in the Earth's reflectance. Chapter 3 introduces the Nimbus- 7 TOMS reflectance measurements and provides an overview on the interannual variability of the Earth's reflectance. Variations in the globally averaged reflectance are also used to examine a postulated cosmic ray-cloud-climate connection. In Chapter 4, we relate interannual reflectance variations over the summertime polar icy areas to variations in the microwave-derived sea ice concentration. The results provide independent confirmation on sea ice variations observed by microwave instruments, and quantify the role of clouds in shielding the reflectance effect of sea ice variations. An interesting hemispheric asymmetry is found: a 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Normalization of {{brachial artery}} flow-mediated {{dilation}} (FMD) to individual shear stress area under the curve (peak FMD:SS AUC ratio) {{has recently been}} proposed as an approach to control for the large inter-subject variability in reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress; however, the adoption of this approach among researchers has been slow. The present {{study was designed to}} further examine the efficacy of FMD normalization to shear stress in reducing measurement variability. Methods Five different magnitudes of reactive hyperemia-induced shear stress were applied to 20 healthy, physically active young adults (25. 3 ± 0. 6 yrs; 10 men, 10 women) by manipulating forearm cuff occlusion duration: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min, in a randomized order. A venous blood draw was performed for determination of baseline whole blood viscosity and hematocrit. The magnitude of occlusion-induced forearm ischemia was quantified by dual-wavelength <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (NIRS). Brachial artery diameters and velocities were obtained via high-resolution ultrasound. The SS AUC was individually calculated for the duration of time-to-peak dilation. Results One-way repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated distinct magnitudes of occlusion-induced ischemia (volume and peak), hyperemic shear stress, and peak FMD responses (all p AUC (p = 0. 785). Conclusion Our data confirm that normalization of FMD to SS AUC eliminates the influences of variable shear stress and solidifies the utility of FMD:SS AUC ratio as an index of endothelial function. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} spectrometers {{developed in}} three distinct spectral {{regions in the}} early 1960 s. Pierre Connes and his coworkers in France developed remarkably sophisticated step-scan interferometers that permitted near-infrared spectra to be measured with a resolution of better than 0. 0 1 cm{sup {minus} 1 }. These instruments may be considered the forerunners of the step-scan interferometers made by Bruker, Bio-Rad (Cambridge, MA, USA) and Nicolet although their principal application was {{in the field of}} astronomy. Low-resolution rapid-scanning interferometers were developed by Larry Mertz and his colleagues at Block Engineering (Cambridge, MA, USA) for remote sensing. Nonetheless, the FT-IR spectrometers that are so prevalent in chemical laboratories today are direct descendants of these instruments. The interferometers that were developed for far-infrared spectrometry in Gebbie's laboratory,have had no commercial counterparts for at least 15 years. However, {{it could be argued that}} these instruments did as much to demonstrate the power of Fourier transform spectroscopy to the chemical community as any of the instruments developed for mid- and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrometry.</b> Their performance was every bit as good as today's rapid-scanning interferometers. However, the market for these instruments is so small today that it has proved more lucrative to modify rapid-scanning interferometers that were originally designed for mid-infrared spectrometry than to compete with these instruments with slow continuous scan or step-scan interferometers...|$|E
40|$|Strategies for {{monitoring}} patients recovering after congenital heart surgery have evolved considerably as technology continues to progress. Monitoring techniques traditionally {{centered around the}} comprehensive physical examination {{have been replaced by}} a number of revolutionary technologies developed to objectively evaluate various components of the cardiovascular system. Despite scant evidence that these methodologies actually improve outcomes, some have been embraced by clinicians. We developed an Internet survey designed to describe current practices of clinicians who care for patients after congenital heart surgery. There were 162 respondents to our survey with the majority from the United States. The views of cardiologists, intensivists, those dual trained in both cardiology and critical care medicine, and surgeons are all robustly represented in the results. Serial lactate monitoring was the strategy that was utilized most often by respondents (94 %), followed by multisite <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (NIRS, 67 %). There were 78 % who utilized the combination of serial lactate and NIRS monitoring. Serial lactate monitoring was the technique that was thought to best represent cardiovascular well-being after heart surgery (40 %). The results of this survey suggest that despite the paucity of evidence that clinical outcomes of patients recovering after congenital heart surgery are improved by any of these monitoring techniques, there is almost universal acceptance to monitor patients with serial lactate monitoring, NIRS monitoring, or a combination of these techniques...|$|E
40|$|Wheat grain {{quality has}} a complex genetic {{architecture}} {{heavily influenced by}} the growing environment. Consistency in wheat quality not only affects the efficiency of milling and baking but also the quality of end-use products. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) analyze the different wheat quality parameters in Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) grown under different environments, and 2) to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with quality stability in RILs grown under different environments. A set of 180 RILs derived from two spring wheat lines 'Halberd' and 'Len' were grown at Uvalde and College Station TX, in the 2009 / 2010 growing season and at Chillicothe and College Station TX, in 2010 / 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications within each location. Each line was tested for multiple quality traits that included grain hardness, protein content, dough mixing properties and bread baking quality using Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS), <b>Near-Infrared</b> Reflectance <b>Spectrometry</b> (NIRS) analysis, mixograph and the Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Sedimentation (SDSS) test. Genetic linkage map construction was carried out with 116 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the RILs. Then composite interval mapping was carried out to identify QTLs associated with quality traits. The SDSS column height was positively correlated across four environments. Similarly, it was found to have significant positive correlation with mixing tolerance and peak time within and also across locations. However, the SDSS was negatively correlated with the hardness index. The protein percent was not significant with any of the quality traits within and across environments. We were able to detect many QTLs for different quality traits but most of them were site specific. Only a few QTLs were consistent across environments. Most of the QTLs for quality traits i. e., SDSS, peak time, mixing tolerance and hardness index were identified on chromosome 1 B. We were able to detect overlapped QTLs for SDSS column height and mixing tolerance on chromosome 1 B. Furthermore, overlapping QTLs for mixing tolerance and peak time were detected on an unknown chromosome. We also detected overlapping QTLs for hardness index on chromosome 1 B. We identified one stable QTL for SDSS column height on chromosome 4 B. This QTL was detected based on the coefficient of variation (CV) for SDSS in four different environments...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{shown that the}} predictive ability of wavelet models in multivariate calibration problems can be improved by optimizing the filters employed in the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) {{with respect to the}} statistics of the matrix of instrumental responses. However, no attempt has been made at exploiting the statistics of the matrix of predicted parameters in the optimization process. This work addresses this issue and proposes a novel strategy for wavelet filter optimization that aims at directly minimizing the prediction error of a wavelet regression model with respect to a given validation set. Moreover, some theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the angular parameterization of wavelet filters needed for the optimization procedure are clarified. The parameterization is explained in a simple graphical manner. A requirement on the sum of the angular parameters and its implications in the optimization strategy are discussed. Finally, a procedure for obtaining the angular parameters associated to any traditional mother wavelet is provided, both as an algorithm and as a Matlab code. The proposed strategy is illustrated in a simulated multivariate calibration example involving two analytes and also in a problem of total sulphur determination in diesel samples by <b>near-infrared</b> (NIR) absorption <b>spectrometry.</b> Both the simulated and the real examples show that the proposed filter optimization procedure improves the prediction ability of wavelet regression models. Moreover, in the sulphur determination problem, the wavelet models result in a smaller prediction error than a traditional Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) model. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

This work aims to develop models to predict the fatty acid composition, including n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 PUFA) from a near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurement directly on the slaughter line. The infrared measurements were performed on 282 pigs, 50 % coming from the Bleu-Blanc-Coeur label (that guarantees higher levels of n- 3 PUFA). They were performed on the slaughter line on hot carcass and on the backfat, using a near infrared spectrometer (LabSpec 5000, ASD). The samples were collected and their fatty acid compositions were obtained using gas chromatography. The regression method employed was partial least squares (PLS). The results show that the spectral range 800 - 1830 nm provides the best predictions. The models developed for C 18 : 3 n- 3, n- 3 PUFA and total PUFA gave the best results (R²= 0. 87, 0. 86 and 0. 86, respectively) with an associated uncertainty of 1. 2, 1. 5 and 2. 8 points and average values of 2. 4; 3. 2; and 16. 2, respectively. For all other fatty acids, the determination coefficients (R²) were lower than 0. 75. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use NIRS to determine on the slaughter line the n- 3 PUFA content of pigs and enable them to be sorted according to quality criteria of fat...|$|E
