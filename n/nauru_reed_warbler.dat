5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has {{dark brown}} upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{native land}} mammals, {{but there are}} native insects, land crabs, and birds, {{including}} the endemic <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships. The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island, as well as SCUBA diving and snorkelling.|$|E
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed warbler, which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger, and the Oriental reed warbler has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|E

50|$|The Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus orientalis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{of eastern}} Asia {{belonging to the}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> genus Acrocephalus. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. arundinaceus) of western Eurasia.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} sedentary, {{meaning that the}} birds do not {{naturally}} leave Nauru. Banaba is the nearest island, and despite being similar to Nauru, it lacks any warblers. However, {{it is possible that}} populations of the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> existed on other islands until comparatively recently. On the Marshall Islands, traditional stories refer to a small bird, known variously as annañ, anang and annãng. This bird was considered the property of chieftains. Though no physical descriptions exist of the species, it has been described as butterfly-sized, pleasant-smelling and as living among rocks on the shores of north-western islands. Ethnographers Krämer and Nevermann reported that the bird became extinct or extirpated around 1880. Based on descriptions of birds seen on Jaluit, Paul Schnee hypothesised that the annañ may have been a <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> The extinction of the annañ may have been due to hunting by cats, which were introduced to the Marshall Islands by the Russian Otto von Kotzebue in 1817 to hunt rats. They then multiplied before being spread by locals as pets, after which they started to become feral.|$|E
500|$|Though the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} species, some authorities, such as H. E. Wolters in [...] Die Vogelarte der Erde (1980) and Howard and Moore in A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World (1991), have considered it a subspecies of Acrocephalus luscinius, the nightingale reed warbler. Recent DNA studies have affirmed {{its status as a}} separate species. It is considered monotypic, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English common names Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> In the native Nauruan language, it is known as Itsirir.|$|E
500|$|A 2009 phylogenic {{study of}} the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as {{recently}} as 2010 its relation {{with other members of}} the genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a clade with the [...] Australian reed warbler, the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan reed warbler and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas. The closest relative of the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> appears to be the extinct warbler from Pagan. This is currently named as a subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler, A. luscinius yamashinae, but that species is polyphyletic, and the Pagan form, which has been proposed as a new species, the Pagan reed warbler, is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (...) , Acrocephalus rehsei, is a {{passerine}} bird {{endemic to}} the island of Nauru in the Pacific Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two native breeding land-birds on Nauru, the other being the Micronesian pigeon, and it is the only passerine found on the island. It is related to other Micronesian reed warblers, all of which evolved from one of several radiations of the genus across the Pacific. Related warblers on nearby islands include the Carolinian reed warbler, with which the Nauru species was initially confused, and the nightingale reed warbler, which was formerly sometimes considered the same species.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{endemic to}} the island of Nauru, in the Pacific Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two {{indigenous}} land birds which breed on the island, the other being the Micronesian pigeon. The warbler can be found throughout the island, thriving in the scrubland in areas previously used for phosphate mining, as well as the remaining patches of forest on the island's central plateau. It is most common in the remains of forest found on the island's steep slopes. It is also readily observed in gardens and ruderal areas on the island's coast; in 1881, Finsch described the species as abundant, calling it [...] "as common as the House-Sparrow in England." [...] Biologist Donald Buden again found it widespread on the island in 2008.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is a {{medium-sized}} and warmly coloured reed warbler, {{with a relatively}} light build. The entirety of the upperparts are dark brown, with the rump and uppertail coverts slightly brighter than the tail and mantle. When closed, the wing is the same colour as the mantle, short and rounded. The wing does not reach {{the start of the}} tail feathers, which enhances the appearance of a long tail. Close inspection of the wing reveals darker centres to both the greater coverts and tertial feathers. Its face shows little contrast, as the ear coverts, crown, nape, chin and throat are all a similar shade of pale brown. The lores are a dark brown, and there is a pale, creamy supercilium, or [...] "eyebrow", extending from the beak to the ear coverts, which are a cinnamon-brown, darkening and merging with the nape. The beak is long, thin and straight.|$|E

50|$|The {{speckled}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or streaked <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus sorghophilus) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} monotypic, {{and there is}} no {{significant}} geographical variation. The sexes are alike in appearance. Hybridisation with both <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and Blyth's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has been occasionally recorded.|$|R
500|$|Finsch {{described}} the warbler as insectivorous, feeding primarily on dragonflies. Six species of dragonfly {{have been observed}} on the island; Ischnura aurora, Anax guttatus, Diplacodes bipunctata, Pantala flavescens, Tholymis tillarga and Tramea transmarina. Buden did not observe the species feeding on dragonflies, but did see three different feeding habits. Most frequently, the birds were seen moving through trees and shrubs, catching prey on the foliage. Other birds were seen perched close to the floor, darting to the ground, and returning to the perch with prey. In open areas, the birds were observed moving across the ground, [...] "occasionally grasping a presumed prey item". In coastal areas, they have been observed feeding in coconut trees. Potential predators for the birdlife of Nauru in general include feral cats and dogs, {{as well as the}} Polynesian rat and the Tanezumi rat. Feral cats and wild rats in particular are potential threats to the <b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Nauru</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> nests are {{cup-shaped}} and woven from {{grasses and}} twigs. They sometimes include Cassytha filiformis vine or Casuarina equisetifolia needles. The nests {{are bound to}} upright stems in a way typical of warblers. Buden reported that the warblers nest in trees and shrubs at a height of [...] The species may also nest on the ground; the young in ground nests may be more vulnerable to predation by rats. Eggs have variously been reported in December and July, and ornithologist A. Pearson suggested that the species may nest all year round. The clutch size has been reported as two or three eggs. Incubation and fledgling periods are unknown. Pearson reported lower nesting than Buden, recording nests in bushes and undergrowth between [...] from the ground, especially in forked branches of hibiscus and lime. Buden reported that the birds were more vocal in December than in March and April. The song {{has been described as}} similar to that of a song thrush, common blackbird, or willie wagtail, and it is delivered both day and night.|$|E
