40|$|An <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> {{formulation}} for {{transmission line}} matrix modeling is proposed. The approach consists in attenuating the incident pulse propagating toward the <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> only, using an attenuation factor which gradually decreases {{as the sound}} wave propagates along the absorbing medium. The formulation of the damping function followed by the attenuation factor along the <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> is depicted and discussed. The efficiency of the present formulation is validated by comparison with another <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> model and virtual boundary conditions proposed in the literature. Numerical simulations are also given in order to evaluate the effects of both the attenuation factor and the depth on the <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> efficiency. As expected, {{results are consistent with}} <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> implementation in other numerical methods; firstly, the attenuation at the entrance of the <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> must be gentle, and secondly the efficiency increases with the layer depth. Lastly, it is shown that the unwanted reflection seems to vanish over the time when increasing the layer depth, meaning that reflections continuously occur within the <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer</b> and not on the geometrical limits of the <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer.</b> Although the approach is dedicated to outdoor sound propagation modeling (only an example on urban acoustics application is given), the proposed formulation of <b>absorbing</b> <b>layers</b> can be applied in other domains of acoustics. However, its application in shielded areas should be avoided because unwanted reflections due to an insufficient attenuation can be significant in comparison with the ambient noise in such quiet environments...|$|R

A disadvantage of <b>absorbing</b> <b>layers</b> is that they contain case-dependent parameters; thus {{the question is how}} to optimally tune these parameters, so that a desired reduction of reflections can be obtained? As a step towards the answer of these questions, this article presents a theory which predicts reflection coefficients for <b>absorbing</b> <b>layers.</b> The theory is given for 1 D-wave propagation and is then extended to 2 D and 3 D to cover waves of oblique incidence. The theory is validated via flow simulations of regular and irregular pressure waves in air and water, based on Navier-Stokes-type equations and the finite-volume method. Theory predictions and simulation results show good agreement.

The approach is based on the discretization of the propagation wave equation for a dissipative and non-homogeneous medium and from the Perfectly Match Layer formalism of Bérenger. Two solutions are proposed that both give a specific scattering matrix for the Transmission Line Matrix method: one is equivalent to an artificial purely dissipative medium and the other to a non-homogeneous and dissipative artificial medium. The proposed solutions are compared to an existing empirical formulation of <b>absorbing</b> <b>layer.</b> It is shown that the non-homogenous and dissipative solution is less interesting than the purely dissipative one because its efficiency can strongly depend on the receiver location. The purely dissipative solution can outperform the empirical matched connexion law formulation for a large range of incidence angle if an optimized value of the damping factor is used.
