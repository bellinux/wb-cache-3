In general only mixtures of chemically similar solvents, such as <b>n-hexane</b> with n-heptane, form nearly ideal mixtures that come close to obeying Raoult's law.

2500|$|To 2.76 g (25.0mmol) of 1-octyne {{was added}} 25.0 mL of a 1.07 M {{solution}} of diisobutylaluminium hydride (26.8mmol) in <b>n-hexane</b> while {{the temperature was}} maintained at 25–30° {{by means of a}} water bath. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then was heated at 50° for 4 hours.

50|$|Beginning in the 1960s and 70's, {{the high}} {{incidence}} rate of polyneuropathy amongst industrial workers chronically exposed to petroleum benzine and other hydrocarbon solvents prompted {{investigations into the}} safety of chronic exposure to petroleum distillates. Many of the cases of polyneuropathy amongst workers chronically exposed to vapors of petroleum benzine and similar solvents {{have been attributed to}} the <b>n-hexane</b> component of these mixtures. Using an animal model (Wistar-strain male rats), Ono and coworkers reported that chronic exposure (12 h a day for 24 weeks) to hydrocarbon solvent vapors conspicuously impaired peripheral nerve function in the 500 ppm <b>n-hexane</b> group, slightly impaired in the 200 ppm <b>n-hexane</b> group and petroleum benzine II group (containing 500 ppm <b>n-hexane),</b> and barely impaired in the petroleum benzine I group (containing 200 ppm <b>n-hexane).</b> These results suggest that some components in petroleum benzine are likely to antagonize the neurotoxic effects of <b>n-hexane</b> to the peripheral nerves, possibly by inhibiting the oxidation of <b>n-hexane</b> to its more toxic metabolites 2-hexanone and 2,5-hexanedione. Ono and coworkers also observed depressed body weight gains amongst the exposed groups compared to the control group in the order: petroleum benzine II > petroleum benzine I (ccontaining 200 ppm <b>n-hexane)</b> >> 500 ppm <b>n-hexane</b> > 200 ppm <b>n-hexane.</b> These results suggest that other components found in petroleum benzine may have an additive, syngeristic or potentiative effects on the biological effects of <b>n-hexane.</b> Namely, 1000 ppm <b>n-hexane,</b> 3000 ppm n-heptane and 1000 ppm toluene were reported to have the effect of depressing the body weight gain of rats.|$|E
