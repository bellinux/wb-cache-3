25|$|Before {{computing}} {{facilities to}} perform <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regression</b> became available, graphical methods involving linearisation {{of the equation}} were used. A number of these were proposed, including the Eadie–Hofstee diagram, Hanes–Woolf plot and Lineweaver–Burk plot; of these, the Hanes–Woolf plot is the most accurate.

25|$|As {{an attempt}} to correct some of the error due to a non-zero , the usage of local linear {{weighted}} regression with ABC to reduce the variance of the posterior estimates has been suggested. The method assigns weights to the parameters according to how well simulated summaries adhere to the observed ones and performs linear regression between the summaries and the weighted parameters {{in the vicinity of}} observed summaries. The obtained regression coefficients are used to correct sampled parameters in the direction of observed summaries. An improvement was suggested in the form of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regression</b> using a feed-forward neural network model. However, {{it has been shown that}} the posterior distributions obtained with these approaches are not always consistent with the prior distribution, which did lead to a reformulation of the regression adjustment that respects the prior distribution.|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} types of reversible enzyme inhibitors on enzymatic activity can be visualized using graphical representations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, such as Lineweaver–Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots. For example, in the Lineweaver–Burk plots at the right, the competitive inhibition lines intersect on the y-axis, illustrating that such inhibitors do not affect Vmax. [...] Similarly, the non-competitive inhibition lines intersect on the x-axis, showing these inhibitors do not affect Km. However, {{it can be difficult to}} estimate Ki and Ki' accurately from such plots, so it is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regression</b> methods, as described above.|$|E

[...] Therefore, several researchers developed linearisations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, such as the Lineweaver–Burk plot, the Eadie–Hofstee diagram and the Hanes–Woolf plot. [...] All of these linear representations can be useful for visualising data, but none should be used to determine kinetic parameters, as computer software is readily available that allows for more accurate determination by <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regression</b> methods.|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{method for}} {{determining}} the constants [...] and [...] involves running a series of enzyme assays at varying substrate concentrations , and measuring the initial reaction rate [...] 'Initial' here is taken to mean that the reaction rate is measured after {{a relatively short time}} period, during which it is assumed that the enzyme-substrate complex has formed, but that the substrate concentration held approximately constant, and so the equilibrium or quasi-steady-state approximation remain valid.

2500|$|A large {{error in}} the initial {{estimate}} can contribute to non-convergence of the algorithm. To overcome this problem one can often linearise the function that is being optimized using calculus, logs, differentials, or even using evolutionary algorithms, such as the Stochastic Funnel Algorithm. Good initial estimates lie close to the final globally optimal parameter estimate. In <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regression,</b> the sum of squared errors (SSE) is only [...] "close to" [...] parabolic {{in the region of}} the final parameter estimates. Initial estimates found here will allow the Newton-Raphson method to quickly converge. It is only here that the Hessian matrix of the SSE is positive and the first derivative of the SSE is close to zero.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{statistical}} methods seek {{to minimize the}} residual sum of squares, and these are called [...] "methods of least squares" [...] in contrast to Least absolute deviations. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also differentiable, which provides a handy property for doing regression. Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regression</b> is called non-linear least squares. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares, which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) {{as a function of}} the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies evidently actualized <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regressions</b> as a {{step forward}} in {{defining}} {{the true nature of}} the relationships between anthropometric and physical fitness (PF) variables in trained subjects. In this paper we have sampled 1176 nontrained boys aged 14 – 16 years and tested them on (1) five anthropometric predictors, including: body height, body weight, triceps skinfold, upper arm circumference, and body mass index (BMI); and (2) five PF criteria measuring: static (static strength) and dynamic muscle endurance (repetitive strength), aerobic endurance, explosive strength, and coordination. Linear (y = a + bx) and nonlinear (second-order polynomial: y = a + bx + cx 2) regressions were calculated simultaneously. BMI is found to be the most significant anthropometric predictor of PF status. Although the calculation and interpretation of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>regressions</b> are far more complicated in comparison to those of linear regressions, the variance of the criteria are in some cases far better explained through a significant nonlinear model. Even more, we have found evidence that an exclusive discussion of the linear correlation model could lead to serious interpretative mistakes. This mostly relates to the fact that a linear regression model implies a continuous relationship (dependence) between the predictor and the criteria, while a nonlinear one effectively identifies possible breakpoints in the regression line and consequently highlights the real nature of the relationship between variables...|$|R
