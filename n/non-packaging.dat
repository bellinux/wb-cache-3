40|$|The paper explores {{some aspects}} {{related to the}} {{application}} of nanomaterials in food packaging. Therefore, the paper is structured into two sections. In the first section, aspects that could restrict/restrain the application of nanomaterials in food packaging industry in terms of environmental and human risks, the consumer`s rights to be informed regarding the utilization of nano-packages and regulation issues {{in the field of}} large scale application of food nano-packages are discussed. In the second section, the efficiency of a nano-package based on Ag/TiO 2 to preserve for a longer time (6 days) the physical attributes of wheat bread (moisture, specific volume, porosity) by comparison with shorter ranges allowed by the common polyethylene bag (3 days) and <b>non-packaging</b> respectively (1 day) is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{durables}} are <b>non-packaging</b> {{products that}} have varying life spans, including toothbrushes, pens (short-term), computer casings, whitegoods inserts, and automotive parts (long-term). Generally, {{the lifetime of}} the durables is 5 - 10 years, which induces a disposal lag [Scheirs, 1998, 305]. Rapid advances in technology continually reduce the product life span of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE), which is now less than 2 years in some cases [Brennan, 2001]. The properties of recycled engineering plastics in consumer durables can be higher in value than virgin commodities. Their mechanical properties are frequently retained, even after medium to long-term use (~ 10 - 15 years). Typically, engineering plastics currently includes computer and electronic housings as well as automotive plastics. This section looks at decision-making strategies related to recycling materials used for manufacturing durable consumer products...|$|E
5000|$|The 800B was {{available}} with the Comanche package. This package included special paint and decals, chrome trim, sliding travel top windows, and other [...] "high dollar" [...] options such as roof racks, chrome wheels, and upgraded interiors. Line tickets {{of the special}} package Scouts (and some <b>non-package</b> units) were stamped. After the factory assembles the vehicle and the vehicle is shipped and sold, the Lineticket identifies {{such things as the}} engine type, transmission type, drive line, paint codes, gear ratio, and standard and optional equipment, specific to that vehicle. This was, and still is, a very valuable tool when ordering parts later at the dealership by the customer. There was a variety of parts used on these vehicles so the expression [...] "no two are quite the same" [...] is not that far off. Late in 1970 the Sno-Star package appeared (only with the six-cylinder engine), developed especially for snow plow usage.|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: Recent {{legislation}} in USA and Europe aimed to improve information on packaged foods to assist food allergic consumers identify allergens. Legislation {{does not cover}} ‘may contain’ labels. There is little information on how information is used by allergic consumers when purchasing food. METHODS: We studied how peanut and nut allergic individuals use allergy advice boxes, ingredients lists, and other packaging information, excluding ‘may contain’. Thirty-two peanut and/ or nut allergic participants were observed during their normal food shop. Their spoken thoughts were audio-recorded. This {{was followed by a}} semi-structured interview. They were also given 13 potentially problematic packaged foods, and asked to explain whether they would purchase the food and their reasoning for the decision. Transcribed data from the shop, interview and 13 -product task were analysed to explore use of label information. RESULTS: Most participants used the allergy advice box rather than the ingredients list for their primary check. Package-based information was generally considered reliable, but some brands were trusted more than others. Participants suggested a number of improvements, particularly more ‘nut free’ labelling. CONCLUSIONS: Participants used a combination of <b>non-package</b> based strategies (e. g. previous experience), in conjunction with label information to make purchase decisions. Trust of the food producer or supermarket informed interpretation of and confidence in labels. Images and product names, not intended by manufacturers as an allergen risk assessment aid were also used to inform choices...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{statements}} are admittedly a storehouse of valuable information {{of the past}} performance and present position of business entities. They give an accurate picture of a company’s condition and operating results in a condensed form. Accounting professional {{has been a major}} force over the years in shaping up financial statements. These financial statements prepared by accountants are normally prepared for general purpose. Any economic decision based on general purpose financial statements prepared by entities will not give appropriate results unless the financial statements should be analysed. Analysis, comparability and interpretation of financial {{statements are}} necessary so that the difficulties behind these technical documents may be well understood and the real picture brought to light for the benefit of all concerned. Financial statements analyses help in determining the liquidity position, long term solvency, efficiency of using assets productively and profitability of a firm. Ratio analysis shows whether the company is improving or deteriorating in past years. Analysis of statements helps to determine the significance of the financial data. The object {{of this study is to}} examine financial statements of the two hotels, Breeze Beach Club which is Non package hotel type and Veraclub Zanzibar which is Package hotel type. In this way it is possible to comment and comparing their financial performance and conditions by using financial ratios. Specifically, this study focuses on financial ratios to analyse profitability, liquidity, solvency, and efficiency of using assets productively among the type of hotels. The financial statements of the two hotels for year 2008 to 2010 were the core source of data. Based on these financial statements, the financial ratios were computed, interpreted, compared and thereafter results drawn. The results reveal that liquidity, efficiency and solvency ratios are favourable in Package hotel (Veraclub Zanzibar) compared with <b>Non-package</b> hotel (Breeze Beach Club). In terms of profitability both hotels are not well performed during the period of analysis. The paper concludes by identify limitation on such analysis and provide suggestions for further analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the major}} {{limitations}} {{of the use of}} adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a tool for gene therapy is the difficulty in providing sufficient quantities of the virus for pre-clinical and clinical trials. Here, we report a novel approach for amplifying AAV helper functions, which mimics the normal replication of wild type (wt) AAV resulting in a high yield of AAV vectors. Cotransfection of replicating but <b>non-packaging</b> AAV helper constructs in the presence of adenovirus (Ad) produces a high level of Rep and Cap proteins. Yield of AAV 2 /GFP vector obtained from this helper DNA replication system was approximately 20 -fold higher than traditional methods. Molecular analysis suggested that virus yield was associated with capsid protein production. The transfection ratio was optimized using these novel helper constructs, resulting in an additional 2 -fold increase in vector yield without presence of replication competent AAV (rcAAV). This strategy supports development of AAV packaging systems that retain normal virus replication capability without helper virus encapsidation...|$|E
30|$|A patent [20] is {{pertinent}} to dispersions of CNTs {{in a host}} polymer or copolymer with delocalized electron orbitals, so that a dispersion interaction occurs between the host polymer or copolymer and the CNTs dispersed in that matrix. Such a dispersion interaction has advantageous results if the monomers of the host polymer/copolymer include an aromatic moiety, e.g., phenyl rings or their derivatives. It is claimed that dispersion force can be further enhanced if the aromatic moiety is naphthalenyl and anthracenyl. A new non-wrapping approach to functionalizing CNTs has been introduced by Chen et al. [21]. By this approach, the functionalization can be realized in organic and inorganic solvents. With a functionally conjugated polymer that includes functional groups, CNT surfaces can be functionalized in a non-wrapping or <b>non-packaging</b> fashion. Through further functionalization, various other desirable functional groups {{can be added to}} this conjugated polymer. This approach provided the possibility of further tailoring, even after functionalization. A process registered by Stoddart et al. [22] involves CNTs treated with poly{(5 -alkoxy-m-phenylenevinylene)-co-[(2, 5 -dioctyloxy-p-phenylene) vinyl-ene]} (PAmPV) polymers and their derivatives for noncovalent functionalization of the nanotubes which increases solubility and enhances other properties of interest. Pseudorotaxanes are grafted along the walls of the nanotubes in a periodic fashion by wrapping of SWCNTs with these functionalized PAmPV polymers. Many biomolecules can interact with CNTs without producing of covalent conjugates. Proteins are an important class of substrates that possess high affinity with the graphitic network. Nanotube walls can adsorb proteins strongly on their external sides, and the products can be visualized clearly by microscopy techniques. Metallothionein proteins were adsorbed onto the surface of multi-walled CNT, as evidenced by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [23]. DNA strands have been reported by several groups to interact strongly with CNT to form stable hybrids effectively dispersed in aqueous solutions [24, 25]. Kim et al. [26] reported the solubilization of nanotubes with amylose by using dimethyl sulfoxide/water mixtures. The polysaccharide adopts an interrupted loose helix structure in these media. The studies of the same group on the dispersion capability of pullulan and carboxymethyl amylase demonstrated that these substances could also solubilize CNTs but to a lesser extent than amylose. There are also some literatures that reported several other examples of helical wrapping of linear or branched polysaccharides around the surface of CNT [27].|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} {{volatile}} fuel prices and tightening emissions regulations, automobile manufacturers have been increasingly considering {{the use of}} light-weight magnesium {{in their efforts to}} improve fuel economy. While mainly used in minor components now, greater weight savings lie in its replacement of heavier structural components now made of extruded aluminum and stamped steel. However, as a material with generally lower mechanical properties on a volumetric basis and higher unit materials cost, magnesium introduces a strength-weight tradeoff with non-obvious total cost implications. Accordingly, manufacturers could greatly benefit from a method of systematically studying this weight-strength relationship in cost terms for extruded magnesium beams in a variety of loading scenarios. In this paper, we describe the development of an interface within a Process Based Cost Model of the extrusion process for quantifying these relationships on user defined parts. This interface consists of Visual Basic functions which dynamically compute dimensions of hollow Mg or Al extruded tubes necessary to achieve some strength constraint, input them into the cost model, and return the results. (cont.) This capability was demonstrated on a representative system - a 1 m long, 70 or 75 mm wide, 6 or 8 mm thick Mg or Al tube - for three distinct loading conditions - axial loading as quantified by Euler buckling load, deflection from center load, and deflection from end load. Results show that in <b>non-package</b> constrained scenarios, cost and weight savings can be achieved by switching from Al to a larger diameter Mg extrusion of equivalent strength; however, when diameter is constrained, it is neither cost nor weight-effective unless some geometric, processing, or strength constraint is somewhat relaxed. In general, switching to Mg is favorable when specific strength rather than absolute strength is more important. While intrinsic characteristics of the model limit practical usefulness in some cases, it is nevertheless very helpful in studying relative differences between the strength, weight, and cost of extruded Mg and Al beams. by Johann Kasper Komander.

40|$|By {{adopting}} the European Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste in 1994, producer responsibility for packaging material has been initiated in the EU. The implementation in {{the member states}} occurred in different ways. On behalf of the Austrian ARA AG, a comparative analysis of the eco-efficiency of household lightweight and metal packaging waste management in Germany and Austria has been conducted. The comparison is premised on {{an analysis of the}} legal bases (Packaging Ordinances) and on established mass balances. The eco-efficiency has been assessed by evaluation of cost structures and resulting greenhouse gas balances. The systems in Germany and Austria show some basically differences. In Austria, in the reference year 2012 only one system operator offers dispensation of all kinds of packaging waste materials from households. In contrast, in Germany ten system operators are competing. This leads to a minor complexity and less administrative efforts in Austria. In addition there is no deposit requirement in Austria. Furthermore, lightweight and metal packaging waste in Germany has to be collected separately nationwide. This is the case in most areas of Austria, too. However, in some regions only fractions that are recyclable with high-quality are collected selectively. The remaining lightweight packaging is systematically collected together with residual waste going to energy recovery; corresponding costs are refunded by the Austrian system. These differences e. g. lead to diverse qualities of the waste collected. In Germany, about 35 wt. -% of <b>non-packaging</b> material {{can be found in the}} separate collection. In Austria, the percentage of impurities appeared to be substantially lower (20 wt. -%). Also the licensing level of lightweight and metal packaging from households is higher for Austria (Austria: 76 wt. %, Germany: 56 to 70 wt. -%). Looking at the ecological efficiency of the Austrian system, higher rates of reused material lead to higher greenhouse gas savings per collected amount of lightweight and metal packaging – even if the German deposit system is included. Comparing the results per capita, the savings by the dual system in Germany are still lower. Involving the deposit packaging amount, the savings per capita get higher for the packaging disposal in Germany. The economical comparison shows minor system costs per licensed amount in Austria. Reasons are lower specific costs for sorting and collection due to a higher licensing level and the minor percentage of impurities in the separate collection. The costs of the deposit system in Germany are not included, but would certainly imply further cost advantages for the Austrian system. Overall the minor system complexity and the higher efficiency of the collection system lead to ecologic and economic benefits for the Austrian dual system for disposal of lightweight and metal packaging waste...|$|E
