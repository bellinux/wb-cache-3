25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, <b>non-severable</b> contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a <b>non-severable</b> contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.|$|E
50|$|For the {{contract}} to be valid, however, the parties must in fact agree on every term each of them regards as being a <b>non-severable</b> part of the proposed contract. This requirement is subject only to the ordinary rules creating contractual liability {{despite the absence of}} consensus. As a rule, the parties to a contract of insurance do not apply their minds to each specific term; they contract {{on the basis of the}} insurer’s usual terms for the particular type of risk to be insured against.|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{the effect}} of grantback clauses in {{licensing}} contracts. While competition authorities fear that grantback clauses might decrease the licensee?s ex post incentives to innovate, a standard defence is that grantback clauses are required for the patent-owner to agree to license its technology in the first place. We examine the validity of this ?but for? defence and the equilibrium effect of grantback clauses on the innovation incentives of the licensee for both <b>non-severable</b> and severable innovations. Under the 2004 EU Technology Transfer Guidelines, and the guidelines for some other jurisdictions, grantback clauses that apply to ?non - severable? (read ?infringing?) innovations {{are considered to be}} less controversial than clauses that apply to ?severable? innovations. We show, to the contrary, that grantback clauses do not increase the patent- holder?s incentives to license when <b>non-severable</b> innovations are at stake but they do when severable innovations are concerned ? suggesting that the ?but for? defence might be valid for severable innovations but not for <b>non-severable</b> ones. Moreover we show that, for severable innovations, grantback clauses can increase the range of parameters for which follow-on innovation by the licensee occurs...|$|E

40|$|The Master's thesis {{provides}} {{readers with}} a basic analysis of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010. The mentioned regulation confers a benefit of the so called block exemption on broad spectrum of vertical agreements including in this context also certain agreements among competing undertakings. Since agreements enjoying {{the benefit of the}} block exemption are presumed to meet criteria stipulated in Article 101 (3) TFEU, the block exemption eliminates legal uncertainty which undertakings whose agreements distort competition within the meaning of Article 101 (1) TFEU would otherwise face. It follows that {{it is not necessary to}} examine such agreements on its merits. Thus, transaction costs are reduced. Structure of the thesis is chosen so that it reflects three main questions concerning applicability of the block exemption, namely whether (i) an agreement falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010, whether (ii) it contains black clauses (hard-core restrictions) and whether (iii) it contains (<b>non-severable)</b> grey clauses. After a brief description of wider connections and general issues in Chapter One, in Chapter Two the thesis deals with the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010 with respect to the notion of vertical agreement, the role of intellectual property rights, the treatment of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Competition and innovation, which {{comprise}} {{the driving force}} of modern economies, have long been an issue in the economics literature. This thesis mainly highlights these two factors in relation to public policy as applied to various analytical frameworks: (i) technology transfer scheme including a grant-back clause when innovation is cumulative (Chapters 1 and 2); (ii) universities that conduct both research and teaching activities (Chapter 3); and (iii) the relationship between competition and productivity (Chapter 4). Chapter 1 considers desirable technology transfer in a stream of cumulative innovation. Technology competition is likely to generate social overincentives for innovation. It is demonstrated that a grant-back clause with an appropriate distribution of profits can mitigate social overinvestment in the initial and follow-on technologies. Chapter 2 analyzes the effect of a grant-back clause on incentives to innovate in accordance with the attributes of innovation: severable (non-infringing) and <b>non-severable</b> (infringing). It is illustrated that a grant-back clause under severable innovation can be socially beneficial because it increases the original licensor’s incentive to license. In Chapter 3, a higher education industry model is examined, where universities conduct research and teaching activities to generate research output and student enrollment. The paradoxical result is that when there is strong substitutability between these two activities, a reduction in not only student enrollment but also research output can occur in response to an increase in research funds. Additionally, this theoretical analysis is motivated by the empirical challenge using the U. S. higher educational institutions data. Chapter 4 investigates the causal relationship between the effect of competition and TFP growth based on the Japanese industry-level panel data. It finds that although a positive effect of competition is observable in manufacturing industries, such an effect in non-manufacturing industries may be negative in part of the sample period...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{transfer}} {{occurs when}} {{the owner of a}} technology grants access to that technology to another party. Today, companies consider technologies—as opposed to physical assets—the most important business assets that are directly tied to their products’ competitiveness. Intellectual property (“IP”) law protects those technologies. One type of technology transfer is contract manufacturing, where foreign companies employ Chinese companies to manufacture products for the Chinese markets. Contract manufacturing is beneficial to foreign companies because it saves them shipping costs and time. To facilitate contract manufacturing in China, however, foreign companies—often the owners of the technologies—must authorize Chinese companies access to their proprietary technologies. Another type of technology transfer—foreign direct investment (“FDI”) —involves foreign companies setting up business entities in China, either as joint venture partners with Chinese companies or as wholly-owned subsidiaries. Under FDI, foreign companies maintain a lasting ownership and control over their proprietary technologies. For FDI to operate successfully, foreign companies must transfer their proprietary technologies to their business entities in China. In 2002, China implemented a provision in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) Regulations on Administration of Technology Import and Export (“ 2002 Technology Regulations”), mandating that licensees own the improvements they make to proprietary technologies to which the licensees receive authorized access (hereinafter referred to as the “prohibition on grant-back clauses”). Often, foreign licensors include grant-back clauses in their licensing agreements, providing that the foreign licensors own any improvements to the technology made by the Chinese licensees. Notably, however, the 2002 Technology Regulations prohibit such grant-back clauses imposed by foreign licensors. China’s grant-back regime is outdated and should be updated with the following proposed policy changes: China should (1) continue to prohibit grant-back clauses on severable improvements, which can be used without using the original licensed patent; (2) make grant-back clauses on <b>non-severable</b> improvements non-mandatory, and subject potential abuse of non-mandatory grant-back clauses to the rule of reason under antitrust law; (3) apply its grant-back rule to domestic and foreign companies equally and fairly; and (4) reform its grant-back regime now, rather than later. Prior to reaching these solutions, this Note first discusses how China’s prohibition on grant-back clauses affects its technology transfer, with an emphasis on empirical data. Then, this Note examines China’s current grant-back regulations and compares them with China’s regulatory regimes in other related areas, as well as grant-back regimes in the United States and the European Union...|$|E
