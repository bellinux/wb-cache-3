5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E

The use and display of the flag is governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules made under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act. It is an offence to knowingly contravene specified provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the penalty is a fine <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> S$1,000.|$|E
5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{appointments}} to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is {{partly due to}} the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E

Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery.

The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E

He then faced Western Australia for his 91st first-class match, scoring another century when he hit 117 against Western Australia. Hamence then suffered a loss of form, <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> 31 for 11innings. He scored a 53 against New South Wales, 64notout against Queensland and 58 against Victoria, however he then scored nine, one and five in his next three innings. A 48 and 78 against New South Wales and Western Australia followed, however it was becoming clear that his form was waning. Hamence played his final match against Freddie Brown's MCC team on 27 October 1950, scoring 114 in the first innings as South Australia reached 350, and then seven in his final innings before being run out by Bob Berry. His final full season saw him score 418runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate <b>not</b> <b>exceeding</b> 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E
