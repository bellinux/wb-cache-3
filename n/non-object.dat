40|$|Abstract: To clarify {{whether the}} neural {{pathways}} concerning color processing {{are the same}} for natural objects, for artifacts objects and for <b>non-objects</b> we examined brain responses measured with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (FMRI) during a covert naming task including the factors color (color vs. black&white (B&W)) and stimulus type (natural vs. artifacts vs. <b>non-objects).</b> Our results indicate that the superior parietal lobule and precuneus (BA 7) bilaterally, the right hippocampus and the right fusifom gyrus (V 4) make part of a network responsible for color processing both for natural objects and artifacts, but not for <b>non-objects.</b> When color objects (both natural and artifacts) were contrasted with color <b>non-objects</b> we observed activations in the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 35 / 36), the superior parietal lobule (BA 7) bilaterally, the left inferior middle temporal region (BA 20 / 21) and the inferior and superior frontal regions (BA 10 / 11 / 47). These additional activations suggest that colored objects recruit brain regions that are related to visual semantic information/retrieval and brain regions related to visuo-spatial processing. Overall, the results suggest that color information is an attribute that can improve object recognition (behavioral results) and activate a specific neural network related to visual semantic information that is more extensive than for B&W objects during object recognition...|$|R

40|$|Learning the {{functional}} properties of objects is a core mechanism {{in the development}} of conceptual, cognitive and linguistic knowledge in children. The cerebral processes underlying these learning mechanisms remain unclear in adults and unexplored in children. Here, we investigated the neurophysiological patterns underpinning the learning of functions for novel objects in 10 -year-old healthy children. Event-related fields (ERFs) were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a picture-definition task. Two MEG sessions were administered, separated by a behavioral verbal learning session during which children learned short definitions about the "magical" function of 50 unknown <b>non-objects.</b> Additionally, 50 familiar real objects and 50 other unknown <b>non-objects</b> for which no functions were taught were presented at both MEG sessions. Children learned at least 75 % of the 50 proposed definitions in less than one hour, illustrating children's powerful ability to rapidly map new functional meanings to novel objects. Pre- and post-learning ERFs differences were analyzed first in sensor then in source space. Results in sensor space disclosed a learning-dependent modulation of ERFs for newly learned <b>non-objects,</b> developing 500 - 800 msec after stimulus onset. Analyses in the source space windowed over this late temporal component of interest disclosed underlying activity in right parietal, bilateral orbito-frontal and right temporal regions. Altogether, our results suggest that learning-related evolution in late ERF components over those regions may support the challenging task of rapidly creating new semantic representations supporting the processing of the meaning and functions of novel objects in children. © 2013 Urbain et al.

40|$|Detecting humans, faces, {{and other}} objects is {{important}} for pose estimation, behaviour analysis, and recognition. Most of the existing detection methods exploit sliding-window technique that typically evaluates image patches at uniform grids, with constant pixel strides along horizontal and vertical directions in an image. This approach can lead to excessively redundant computation since target object instances are relatively rare events compared to <b>non-objects</b> of the background. Therefore, most of the computation is unnecessarily wasted on the background. In this paper, {{to deal with this}} problem, we propose to scan the image using adaptive instead of fixed (unchanged) strides. That is, a high response of current sliding window generates small strides for the subsequent sliding windows in both horizontal and vertical directions, which means an object instance is likely to exist around. Otherwise, a low response gives large pixel strides and results in sparse sampling on the background. As a result, the areas of potential object instances are densely sampled and the areas of <b>non-objects</b> are sparsely sampled, leading to the reduction of total computation cost without loss of detection accuracy. Experimental results on face detection demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Because such a Haar-like feature is only a weak learner or classifier (its detection quality is slightly better than random guessing) {{a large number of}} Haar-like features are necessary to describe an object with sufficient accuracy. In the Viola-Jones object detection framework, the Haar-like features are therefore organized in something called a classifier cascade to form a strong learner or classifier.|$|R
