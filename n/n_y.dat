Wilkes left the legal profession for journalism, first working for a series of short-lived newspapers in New York City, the Flash, the Whip, and the Subterranean. He wrote and edited the Sunday Flash under a pseudonym, [...] "Startle". Among other topics, the Sunday Flash rated New York's brothels and published descriptions and reviews of them. He lost a libel case and was sentenced to a term in the city jail, the Tombs. After serving a month in jail, Wilkes wrote a pamphlet entitled The Mysteries of the Tombs: A Journal of Thirty Days Imprisonment in the <b>N.</b> <b>Y.</b> City Prison, which came out in 1844 and was based on his experiences in jail. Wilkes studied law after his stint in jail, and even called himself an attorney for a short time.|$|E

Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, {{we noticed that}} some fecal viruses generated plaques > 100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y,</b> in the VP 3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB 3 and <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y</b> mutant CVB 3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose {{was used in the}} overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wild-type CVB 3 but not by <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y</b> mutant CVB 3. Furthermore, <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y</b> mutant CVB 3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB 3 did. While <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y</b> mutant CVB 3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y</b> mutant CVB 3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB 3, likely because <b>N</b> 63 <b>Y</b> mutant CVB 3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver.
