Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as {{far as to say that}} suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{realized}} he was again in a stalemate with Lee and additional assaults at Cold Harbor were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> He planned three actions to make some headway. First, in the Shenandoah Valley, Maj. Gen. David Hunter was making progress against Confederate forces, and Grant hoped that by interdicting Lee's supplies, the Confederate general {{would be forced to}} dispatch reinforcements to the Valley. Second, on June 7 Grant dispatched his cavalry under Sheridan to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad near Charlottesville. Third, he planned a stealthy operation to withdraw from Lee's front and move across the James River. He planned to cross to the south bank of the river, bypassing Richmond, and isolate the capital by seizing the railroad junction of Petersburg to the south. Lee reacted to the first two actions as Grant had hoped. He pulled Breckinridge's division from Cold Harbor and sent it toward Lynchburg to parry Hunter. By June 12 he followed this by assigning Jubal Early permanent command of the Second Corps and sending them to the Valley as well. And he sent two of his three cavalry divisions in pursuit of Sheridan, leading to the Battle of Trevilian Station.|$|E

First, in the Shenandoah Valley, Maj. Gen.

However, despite anticipating that Grant might shift across the James, Lee was taken by surprise when it occurred. On June 12 the Army of the Potomac finally disengaged to march southeast to cross the James and threaten Petersburg, a crucial rail junction south of Richmond.|$|E

Chekhov found literary expression for the [...] "Hell of Sakhalin" [...] in his long short story [...] "," [...] the last section of which is set on Sakhalin, where the murderer Yakov loads coal in the night while longing for home.

500|$|Durst unsuccessfully {{tried to}} attract {{attention}} from A representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager. Later, when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, {{he was able to}} persuade Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs [...] "Pollution", [...] "Counterfeit" [...] and [...] "Stuck". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience. The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Mr.Mr {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares from AllMusic labelled the EP [...] "a set of songs that offers something for {{every kind of}} Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach." [...] Phares further praised the EP for helping the group to be an outstanding case of Korean popular music. Writing for Billboard, Jeff Benjamin named the six songs of the EP [...] "strong" [...] and called it a more [...] "impressive effort" [...] compared to the group's 2013 album I Got a Boy. He also deemed the track list [...] "a tight bundle of songs that still see the group dipping and experimenting into new sonic territory, but possibly more focused than ever." [...] Benjamin also wrote an article for Fuse, on which he complimented the album's musical styles as [...] "short, sweet, but strong." [...] On the other hand, Kim Do-heon from online magazine IZM compared the EP to the group's 2011 album The Boys for its [...] "balance of musical competence and appeal to mass popularity", but found the songs to be inadequate. He concluded that the group needed to [...] " [...] a clear direction for the future" [...] after the [...] "mistake" [...] of I Got a Boy, and Mr.Mr was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E

2500|$|These open-air sermons, {{mostly by}} Anabaptist or Mennonite preachers, {{spread through the}} country, {{attracting}} huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566.

By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> {{and the level of}} prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open.

However the committee insisted that monetary policy should be concerned with 'the maintenance of the parity of the foreign exchanges before the avoidance of the credit cycle and the stability of the price level.'
