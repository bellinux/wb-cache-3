40|$|Wave-induced mass-transport current {{theories}} {{with both}} zero and nonzero <b>net</b> mass (or <b>volume)</b> <b>transport</b> {{of the water}} column are reviewed. A relationship based on the Longuet-Higgens theory is derived for wave-induced, nonzero mass-transport currents in intermediate water depths for a viscous fluid. The relationship is in a form useful for experimental applications; therefore, some design criteria for experimental wave-tank tests are also presented. Sample parametric cases for typical wave-tank conditions and a typical ocean swell were assessed by using the relation in conjunction with an equation developed by Unluata and Mei for the maximum wave-induced <b>volume</b> <b>transport.</b> Calculations indicate that substantial changes in the wave-induced mass-transport current profiles may exist dependent upon the assumed <b>net</b> <b>volume</b> <b>transport.</b> A maximum <b>volume</b> <b>transport,</b> corresponding to an infinite channel or idealized ocean condition, produces the largest wave-induced mass-transport currents. These calculations suggest that wave-induced mass-transport currents may have considerable effects on pollution and suspended-sediments transport as well as buoy drift, the surface and midlayer water-column currents caused by waves increasing with increasing <b>net</b> <b>volume</b> <b>transports.</b> Some of these effects are discussed...|$|R

After passing through Drake Passage, the SAF and the PF veer northward over the steep topography of the North Scotia Ridge. Interaction of the ACC with the North Scotia Ridge influences the sources of the Malvinas Current. This ridge is a major obstacle to the flow of deep water, with the majority of the deep water passing through the 3100 m deep gap in the ridge known as Shag Rocks Passage. <b>Volume</b> <b>transports</b> {{associated with the}}se fronts were measured during the North Scotia Ridge Overflow Project, which included the first extensive hydrographic survey of the ridge, carried out in April and May 2003.

For a given amount of Antarctic Bottom Water that is upwelled through neutral density surfaces in the abyssal ocean (between 2000 and 5000 m), up to 5 times this volume flux is upwelled in narrow, turbulent, sloping bottom boundary layers, while up to 4 times the <b>net</b> upward <b>volume</b> <b>transport</b> of Bottom Water flows downward across isopycnals in the near-boundary stratified ocean interior.

Since {{variability of}} KVT is mainly determined in the interior Pacific, it is rather a remote than a local factor for the local ECS KOI. On interannual time scales, KVT affects KOI {{not only in the}} <b>net</b> <b>volume</b> <b>transport</b> across the entire shelf break but also in the spatial pattern along the shelf break. When KVT increases, the intrusion decreases (increases) upstream (downstream) of the major intrusion region northeast of Taiwan, the retreating increases (decreases) upstream (downstream) of the main veering region southwest of Kyushu. These patterns are caused by cyclonic eddies induced by the seaward deflection of the Kuroshio axis from the shelf break, which ultimately results from the KVT increase. A diagnostic mechanism of inline image is proposed, where h is the bottom depth, θ is the angle between isobaths and the vertically averaged current, and M is the absolute <b>volume</b> <b>transport</b> at the shelf break. θ is large in the major intrusion/retreating regions and stable on interannual time scales while M changes with opposite signs between upstream and downstream of the major intrusion/retreating regions.

40|$|Sheet flow {{corresponds}} to the high velocity regime when small bed ripples are washed out and sand is transported in a thin layer close to the bed. Therefore, it is often assumed that sand transport in oscillatory sheet flow behaves quasi-steady: time-dependent transport rates {{are assumed to be}} instantaneously related to the near-bed orbital velocity. However, new experimental results show that even in sheet flow, phase lags between sediment concentration and near-bed velocity can become so large that they lead to a reduction of the <b>net</b> (wave-averaged) <b>transport</b> rate. A phase lag parameter is defined, which shows that phase lags become important for fine sand, high velocities and short wave periods. A semi-unsteady model is developed that includes the effects of phase lags on the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate. New experiments were carried out in a large oscillating water tunnel with three different sands (D 50 = 0. 13, 0. 21 and 0. 32 mm) for a range of prototype, combined wave–current flow conditions. Measured <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates were compared with predictions of a quasi-steady model and the new semi-unsteady model. This comparison indicates that <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates are reduced if phase lags become important: the quasi-steady model overestimates the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates and the semi-unsteady model gives better agreement with the data. Time-dependent measurements of velocities and concentrations show that the reduced <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates can indeed be explained by phase lag effects, because for tests with smaller <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates than predicted by the quasi-steady model, considerable phase lags between velocities and concentrations were observed, even inside the sheet flow layer. Verification of the semi-unsteady model against a larger data set confirms the occurrence of phase lag effects in oscillatory sheet flow.

40|$|Many {{existing}} practical sand transport formulae for {{the coastal}} marine environment {{are restricted to}} a limited range of hydrodynamic and sand conditions. This paper presents a new practical formula for <b>net</b> sand <b>transport</b> induced by non-breaking waves and currents. The formula is especially developed for cross-shore sand transport under wave-dominated conditions {{and is based on}} the semi-unsteady, half wave-cycle concept, with bed shear stress as the main forcing parameter. Unsteady phase-lag effects between velocities and concentrations, which are especially important for rippled bed and fine sand sheet-flow conditions, are accounted for through parameterisations. Recently-recognised effects on the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate related to flow acceleration skewness and progressive surface waves are also included. To account for the latter, the formula includes the effects of boundary layer streaming and advection effects which occur under real waves, but not in oscillatory tunnel flows. The formula is developed using a database of 226 <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate measurements from large-scale oscillatory flow tunnels and a large wave flume, covering a wide range of full-scale flow conditions and uniform and graded sands with median diameter ranging from 0. 13 mm to 0. 54 mm. Good overall agreement is obtained between observed and predicted <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates with 78 % of the predictions falling within a factor 2 of the measurements. For several distinctly different conditions, the behaviour of the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> with increasing flow strength agrees well with observations, indicating that the most important transport processes in both the rippled bed and sheet flow regime are well captured by the formula. However, for some flow conditions good quantitative agreement could only be obtained by introducing separate calibration parameters.

Comparison between these data and data from earlier experiments with finer sand shows {{the effect of the}} grain size and the unsteadiness on the transport rate for relatively uniform sand. Verification of three existing sediment transport models (Bailard, 1981; Ribberink, 1994; Dibajnia & Watanabe, 1992) shows that the model of Bailard largely overpredicts the measured transport rates, especially for fine sand. The model of Ribberink shows reasonably good results for all sands, except when unsteady effects become too important. In the model of Dibajnia & Watanabe unsteady effects are included. Therefore the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates for fine sand are predicted well by this model, but the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates for coarser sand are overpredicted. The gradation of the sediment is included into the models by using a size-fraction method. Moreover, hiding and exposure corrections are included in the model of Ribberink. Based on the results of the grain-size effect in uniform sand, a sensitivity study is performed, which shows the following results: Bailard predicts larger <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates than for uniform sand due to an overprediction in transport rate for the fine fractions. The transported material is finer than the bed material. For Dibajnia & Watanabe the transported material is coarser than the bed material and the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate may either increase or decrease. For Ribberink the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate is almost the same as for uniform sand and the transported material is hardly different from the bed material.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Motor-driven {{transport}} along microtubules is {{a primary}} cellular mechanism for moving and positioning organelles. Many cargoes move bidirectionally by using both minus and plus end-directed motors. How such cargoes undergo controlled <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> is unresolved. Results: Using a combination of genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics, we have identified Halo, a novel regulator of lipid droplet transport in early Drosophila embryos. In embryos lacking Halo, <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> of lipid droplets, but not that of other cargoes, is specifically altered; <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> is minus-end directed at developmental stages when it is normally plus-end directed. This reversal is due to an altered balance of motion {{at the level of}} individual organelles; without Halo, travel distances and stall forces are reduced for plus-end and increased for minus-end motion. During development, halo mRNA is highly upregulated just as <b>net</b> plus-end <b>transport</b> is initiated (phase II), and its levels drop precipitously shortly before transport becomes minus-end directed (phase III). Exogenously provided Halo prevents the switch to <b>net</b> minus-end <b>transport</b> in phase III in wild-type embryos and induces <b>net</b> plus-end <b>transport</b> during phase II in halo mutant embryos. This mechanism of regulation is likely to be of general importance because the Drosophila genome encodes a family of related proteins with similar sequences, each transiently expressed in distinct domains.

40|$|Many coastal {{activities}} {{are concerned with}} the interaction of coastal sedimentary processes and coastal works, such as the construction of structures for shore protection and stabilization, and beach nourishment. It is important to measure sand properties, sediment moving processes and transport rates, as well as the resulted nearshore morphology to understand the sediment transport mechanism under various wave and current conditions. In this study, we are interested in understanding the sediment transport mechanism, especially the influence of wave-induced boundary layer streaming on sediment transport under combined wave and current conditions in the sheetflow regime. Recently, sediment <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate measured through the large wave flume (LWF) experiments presents a more onshore tendency, i. e., a larger onshore <b>net</b> <b>transport,</b> than the result from the small oscillatory flow tunnel (OFT) experiments. Various researchers argue that the wave-induce onshore streaming could be the reason to cause such difference. The objective of this research is to understand the physical features of this phenomenon and answer the question: Does onshore streaming really enhance the onshore sheetflow <b>net</b> sand <b>transport?</b> If so, then, how and how much does it affect the onshore transport? If not, what is the real reason behind? The second is to obtain new insights into the importance of the boundary layer onshore streaming and to understand the transport processes under wave and current conditions. To achieve the objectives and to measure the sediment <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate under sheet flow conditions, laboratory experiments were conducted under the combined asymmetric wave-current conditions to quantitatively evaluate the influence from the onshore streaming. The second order Stokes'wave theory with a velocity asymmetric index of 0. 57 was applied for wave generation with three well-sorted sands with medium sand size of D 50 = 0. 3 mm (coarse), 0. 16 mm (fine) and 0. 13 mm (very fine). For fine sand without onshore current, the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> increases with increasing velocity, and it is directed to the onshore. However, for larger velocity case, the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate decreases and the direction also changes to the offshore. As for the very fine sand, the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate decreases and is directed to the offshore even for a small velocity case. Considering the coarse sand, the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> is in the onshore direction. To understand the effect of onshore streaming, a small current Uc of 10 cm/s and 20 cm/s was generated in the onshore direction. Experiment results for small current 10 cm/s indicate the magnitude offshore <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate reduces and the direction is to the offshore for the very fine sand and fine sand with large velocity case. When increasing the small current value to 20 cm/s, the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate of fine and very fine sand increases and changes to onshore direction with small velocity case. But for large velocity case, even though the magnitude of offshore net rate reduces, the direction is still directed to offshore with fine sand case. Taking into account the <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate measured under the combined wave and current cases, the onshore <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> for coarse sand continuously increases. It is noted that the tendency of increasing of <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate is not observed in fine grains when the velocity becomes increases without the contribution of current. In case of the contribution of small onshore streaming, although the magnitude of offshore <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate of fine and very fine sand reduces, it still directs to offshore under large velocity case. It indicates that the onshore streaming, indeed, enhances offshore <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate for fine sand and very fine sand with large velocity. On the other hand, the small onshore streaming may be partly important for the case of fine sand under small velocity condition. Sediment particle velocity within the sand-laden sheetflow layer was measured by means of a PIV technique. By averaging the sediment particle velocity over one wave period, the mean flow velocity was also evaluated. From the mean velocity profile under pure wave conditions, it is found that, in case of the coarse sand, an onshore streaming is detected in the pick-up layer and leads to offshore in the upper sheet-flow layer. Nevertheless, in case of fine sand, the profiles show a negative streaming due to the strong phase-lag effect. The positive near-bed streaming is not observed. The large phase-lag can induce a negative (offshore) <b>net</b> <b>transport.</b> Thus, the phase-lag effect seems {{to play an important role}} for the sediment sheetflow transport in the OFT test. For coarse sand under combined wave and current conditions, a very small onshore current exists in the pick-up layer (z< 0 mm) and the mean flow velocity leads to onshore direction in the sheet flow layer. In the suspension layer, when the elevation is higher than 15 mm, the mean flow changes its direction from onshore to offshore. In the case of fine sand, the time-averaged velocity indicates the streaming is positive in the pick-up layer as well as in the sheet flow layer. After that, the velocity decreases for increasing the depth (z) mm. Clearly, the additional onshore current in the tunnel does contribute to more onshore sediment transport. Besides that, it is also confirmed that the phase-lag effect plays an important role in the sediment transport under the sheetflow conditions, especially for the fine sand case with large velocity case as it produces offshore <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate. Here also, the streaming profiles are very sensitive to sand size. Furthermore, the measured <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rates are compared with the results from surface wave under same flow conditions. For very fine and fine sand with onshore streaming, the sediment rate under oscillatory flow tunnel can predict about 75 % of net rates under surface wave with small velocity case. Now, the new experiments indicated the difference of sediment rate between these was about 1. 5 times for fine sand with onshore streaming. In addition, the results of coarse sand with streaming produce larger onshore net sediment rate compared to surface wave. It means the contribution of streaming is quite large enough to enhance the more onshore <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate for the coarse sand. As a result, the streaming effect is very dependent on sand size. The maximum erosion depth was estimated from the temporal change of the measured erosion depth. A linear relationship was found between the relative maximum erosion depth δem/D and the maximum Shields parameter, θm. The erosion depth under crest is larger than under trough for fine sand and coarse sand under combined wave and current conditions. The influence of wave period and velocity on erosion depth was also measured for two types of sand. And then, in order to know how much the distribution of small onshore streaming enhanced the larger net rate, the results of <b>net</b> <b>transport</b> rate with onshore streaming are compared with SANTOSS model which include surface wave effects. In this study, SANTOSS model was also considered as streaming-related model including the streaming effect by analytically to represent the surface wave phenomenon. The comparison results showed that although the results of fine and coarse sand with onshore streaming overestimated compared to the results of streaming-related model, it lies with a factor of two differences. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|R

In contrast to the West Spitsbergen Current, the <b>volume</b> and heat <b>transport</b> of East Greenland Current remained fairly constant. An integration over a subsection of the East Greenland Current showed similar values of <b>volume</b> <b>transport</b> to that obtained by measurements in the 1980 s (Foldvik et al., 1988).

40|$|Logistics hubs are {{important}} elements of freight transport generation. They play a decisive role in transport processes. Still, there is little empirical knowledge about those hubs. The authors present their concept to define logistics hubs and their <b>transport</b> <b>volume,</b> which {{is the basis for}} their empirical work. The empirical data are used to identify associations between logistics, business and transport characteristics of logistics hubs and networks with high <b>transport</b> <b>volume.</b> The analyses will also be relevant for a better consideration of logistics hubs in freight transport demand modelling. The starting point is the intention to develop a typology of logistics hubs in terms of their structure and functionalities, which are expected to correlate with the volume of freight going into the hub and starting from there. The typology is created by analysing concrete network structures regarding goods flows, locations and <b>transport</b> <b>volume</b> using existing secondary data sources and data from a previous survey conducted by the authors themselves. The statistical analysis of the data allows for deriving a data-based typology. This will make it possible to integrate logistics hubs as operating systems into freight transport modelling. Within the developed typology the specific transport network structures of the hubs and their <b>transport</b> <b>volume</b> are identified. The locations according to transportation infrastructure and transshipment volume are clearly defined and linked with the <b>transport</b> <b>volume.</b> These types of logistics hubs are assigned to typological specific values with respect to <b>transport</b> <b>volume</b> as well as logistics attributes. This study provides fundamental data of logistics hubs in Germany. This approach serves as a basis for spatially specified transport forecasts as well as transportation planning processes...|$|R
