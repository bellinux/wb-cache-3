5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by <b>nerves</b> <b>and,</b> if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
40|$|Na {{channels}} of frog skeletal muscle are studied under voltage clamp and their properties {{compared with those}} of frog myelinated nerve. A standard mathematical model is fitted to the sodium currents measured in <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> in muscle to obtain a quantitative description of the gating kinetics. At 5 degrees C the kinetics in frog <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> skeletal muscle are similar except that activation proceeds five times faster in nerve. Block of Na channels by saxitoxin is measured in <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> in muscle. The apparent dissociation constants for the inhibitory complex are about 1 nM and not significantly different in <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> muscle. Block of Na channels by external protons in muscle is found to have an apparent pKalpha of 5. 33 and a voltage dependence corresponding to action of 27 % of the membrane potential drop. Both values are like those for nerve. Shift of the peak sodium permeability-membrane potential curve with changes of external pH and Ca++ are found to be the same in <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> muscle. It is concluded that Na {{channels of}} <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> muscle are nearly the same...|$|R

5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, <b>nerves,</b> <b>and</b> bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E

The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E

5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E

5|$|Table salt {{is made up}} of {{just under}} 40% sodium by weight, so a 6g serving (1teaspoon) {{contains}} about 2,300mg of sodium. Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs (fluid balance). Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed. In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} the clinical {{anatomy of the}} levator ani <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> its topographical relationship with the pudendal nerve. METHODS: Ten female pelves were dissected <b>and</b> a pudendal <b>nerve</b> blockade was simulated. The course of the levator ani <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> pudendal <b>nerve</b> was described quantitatively. The anatomical data were verified using (immuno-) histochemically stained sections of human fetal pelves. RESULTS: The levator ani nerve approaches the pelvic-floor muscles on their visceral side. Near the ischial spine, the levator ani <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the pudendal <b>nerve</b> lie above <b>and</b> below the levator ani muscle, respectively, {{at a distance of}} approximately 6 mm from each other. The median distance between the levator ani <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the point of entry of the pudendal blockade needle into the levator ani muscle was only 5 mm. CONCLUSION: The levator ani <b>nerve</b> <b>and</b> the pudendal <b>nerve</b> are so close {{at the level of the}} ischial spine that a transvaginal "pudendal nerve blockade" would, in all probability, block both nerves simultaneously. The clinical anatomy of the levator ani nerve is such that it is prone to damage during complicated vaginal childbirth and surgical intervention...|$|R

5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in {{the lining of the}} coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Baryonyx had a {{rudimentary}} secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests {{the presence of}} a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for <b>nerves</b> <b>and</b> blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.|$|E
