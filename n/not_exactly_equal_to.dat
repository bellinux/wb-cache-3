60|$|On more {{accurate}} investigation, however, {{it will be}} found that, even in this case, there is one hypothetical element in the ratiocination. In all propositions concerning numbers, a condition is implied, without which {{none of them would}} be true; and that condition is an assumption which may be false. The condition is, that 1=1; that all the numbers are numbers of the same or of equal units. Let this be doubtful, and not one of the propositions of arithmetic will hold true. How can we know that one pound and one pound make two pounds, if one of the pounds may be troy, and the other avoirdupois? They may not make two pounds of either, or of any weight. How can we know that a forty-horse power is always equal to itself, unless we assume that all horses are of equal strength? It is certain that 1 is always equal in number to 1; and where the mere number of objects, or of the parts of an object, without supposing them to be equivalent in any other respect, is all that is material, the conclusions of arithmetic, so far as they go to that alone, are true without mixture of hypothesis. There are such cases in statistics; as, for instance, an inquiry into the amount of the population of any country. It is indifferent to that inquiry whether they are grown people or children, strong or weak, tall or short; the only thing we want to ascertain is their number. But whenever, from equality or inequality of number, equality or inequality in any other respect is to be inferred, arithmetic carried into such inquiries becomes as hypothetical a science as geometry. All units must be assumed to be equal in that other respect; and this is never accurately true, for one actual pound weight is <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> another, nor one measured mile’s length to another; a nicer balance, or {{more accurate}} measuring instruments, would always detect some difference.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of gas rotation curves within the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model. In this model the galactic haloes are astronomical Bose-Einstein Condensate drops of scalar field. These haloes are characterized by a constant-density core and are consistent with observed rotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies, a missing feature in CDM haloes resulting from DM-only simulations. We add the baryonic component to the SFDM haloes and simulate {{the evolution of}} the dark matter tracer in a set of grid-based hydrodynamic simulations aimed to analyse {{the evolution of the}} rotation curves and the gas density distribution in the case of dark matter dominated galaxies. Previous works had found that when considering an exact analytic solution for a static SF configuration, the free parameters of the model allows for good fits to the rotation curves, we confirm that in our simulations but now taking into account the evolution of the baryonic component in a static dark matter and stellar disk potential. Including live gas is a step forward from the previous work using SFDM, as for example, the rotation velocity of the gas is <b>not</b> always <b>exactly</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> the circular velocity of a test particle on a circular orbit.
