40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to determine the prevalence of self-reported hearing difficulties and tinnitus in working-aged people from the general population, and to estimate the risks from occupational exposure to noise {{and the number of}} attributable cases nationally. A questionnaire was mailed to 22 194 adults of working age selected at random from the age-sex registers of 34 British general practices (21 201 subjects) and from the central pay records of the British armed services (993 subjects). Information was collected on years of employment in a noisy job; and whether the respondent wore a hearing aid, had difficulty in hearing conversation, or had persistent tinnitus over the past year. Some 2 % of subjects reported severe hearing difficulties (wearing a hearing aid or having great difficulty in both ears on hearing conversation in a quiet room). In men, the prevalence of this outcome rose steeply with age, from below 1 % in those aged 16 - 24 years to 8 % in those aged 55 - 64. The pattern was similar in women, but with severe hearing loss was only about half as prevalent in the oldest age band. In both sexes, after adjustment for age, the risk of severe hearing difficulty and persistent tinnitus rose with years spent in a noisy job. In conclusion, significant hearing difficulties and tinnitus are quite common in men from the older working age range. Both are strongly associated with years spent in a <b>noisy</b> <b>occupation</b> - predominantly male exposure. The national burden of hearing difficulties attributable to noise at work is substantial...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{explore the}} {{interaction}} of smoking and occupational exposure to noise as risk factors for hearing difficulty in the general population. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to 21 201 adults of working age, selected at random from the age-sex registers of 34 British general practices, and to 993 members of the armed services, randomly selected from pay records. Questions were asked about smoking habits, years spent in a <b>noisy</b> <b>occupation,</b> difficulty in hearing conversation, and wearing of a hearing aid. Associations of hearing difficulty with smoking habit were examined by logistic regression and compared across strata of noise exposure, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: Around {{half of the respondents}} had ever smoked, and half of these still smoked. Among 10 418 who provided details on hearing, 348 were classed as having moderate and 311 as having severe hearing difficulty. Risk of hearing difficulty was 3 â€“ 5 -fold higher in those employed for > 5 years in noisy work compared with those never employed in a noisy job. Within strata of noise exposure (including those who had never worked in a noisy job), ex- and current smokers had a higher risk of hearing difficulty than lifetime non-smokers. The additional risks were small compared with those of long term noise exposure, and the combination of effects was more consistent with an additive than a multiplicative interaction. Conclusions: Smoking may adversely affect hearing, and workers should be encouraged to refrain from both smoking and exposure to noise. However, the extra risk to hearing incurred by smoking in high ambient noise levels is small relative to that from the noise itself, which should be the main target for preventive measures...|$|E
