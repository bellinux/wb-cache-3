5|$|Both {{countries}} faced {{difficulty in}} financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling National Autonomist Party supported the purchases, they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions. An influx of inflammatory <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from La Prensa, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines {{were attempting to}} restore the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, swayed the public to support the purchases. The Argentine President, José Figueroa Alcorta, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government replied with reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in that they believed the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for use against Argentina.|$|E

25|$|The {{battle was}} {{immediately}} politicized by the Democratic-Republican Party. Across the nation, it used the great victory to ridicule the Federalists as cowards, defeatists, and secessionists. Pamphlets, songs, <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials,</b> speeches and entire {{plays on the}} battle drove home the point, and glorified Jackson's heroic image.|$|E

About 22,000 people attended the rally, and Brownback and Perry were the only elected officials to speak.

25|$|The final {{opinion polls}} {{continued}} to be somewhat contradictory, with Newspoll showing a 50–50 tie and the Fairfax papers reporting 54–46 to the Coalition. Most Australian major daily <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> backed a return of the Howard government, with the notable exceptions of The Sydney Morning Herald, which backed neither party, and The Canberra Times, which backed Labor.|$|E
25|$|The <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> {{on the eve}} of the {{election}} held little cheer for either party. The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph had each endorsed Labor at the 2003 election. Though each newspaper expressed misgivings about Debnam's campaigning ability and called the result in Labor's favour, they were unanimous in their attack on Iemma's record.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} a water tower in Lena was the topic of <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> many years before the current {{structure}} was actually built in 1896. In the early 1870s fires struck a stable, a warehouse, a rural school and several houses in and around Lena. The 1871 Great Chicago Fire induced a sense of panic among many Illinoisians, including those {{in the village of}} Lena. In 1874 fire nearly destroyed the freight house and depot owned by the Illinois Central Railroad in Lena. The fires continued through the 1870s and 1880s and the Lena Star editorials led the crusade to build a water tower.|$|E
500|$|According to BBC Monitoring, in the European and American press {{there was}} [...] "almost {{universal}} condemnation" [...] of the two-year sentence {{imposed on the}} {{three members of the}} group. While many <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> and opinion columns were critical of the performance in the Cathedral, very few thought a two-year prison sentence was an appropriate punishment, arguing that the action should have been treated as a public order crime and punished by a fine or community service.|$|E
500|$|After McKinley's murder, <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> {{across the}} country heavily criticized the lack of {{protection}} afforded to American presidents. Though it still lacked any legislative mandate, by 1902, the Secret Service (a unit of the Treasury) was protecting President Theodore Roosevelt full-time. [...] This did not settle the debate. [...] Some in Congress recommended the United States Army be charged with protecting the President. [...] In 1906 Congress passed legislation officially designating the Secret Service as the agency in charge of presidential security.|$|E

[...] He sent a telegram {{to the national}} offices of the NAACP promising a full investigation and assuring them [...] "Mississippi does not condone such conduct." [...] Delta residents, both black and white, also distanced themselves from Till's murder, finding the circumstances abhorrent. Local <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> denounced the murderers without question. Leflore County Deputy Sheriff John Cothran stated, [...] "The white people around here feel pretty mad about the way that poor little boy was treated, and they won't stand for this." ...|$|E
500|$|As Douglas and {{the other}} {{candidates}} went through with their campaigns, Lincoln {{was the only one}} of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials.</b> There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of [...] "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|Argentina {{and other}} {{countries}} attempted to avert a full-scale naval arms race by offering to purchase {{one of the two}} dreadnoughts. Brazil refused Argentina's offer. [...] After further tensions over the River Plate (Río de la Plata, literally [...] "Silver River") area and inflammatory <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> favoring dreadnoughts, Argentina went ahead with a massive naval building plan. After a drawn-out bidding process among fifteen shipyards from the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy, Argentina ordered two [...] dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States. They also ordered twelve destroyers from three nations in Europe. With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels, Chile wanted to respond as early as February 1906, but the country's naval plans were delayed by a major earthquake in 1906 and a financial depression in 1907 brought on by a drastic fall in the nitrate market.|$|E

500|$|Feng's case {{became a}} focal point for <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> against China's one-child policy and {{abortion}} in general. Opponents of the one-child policy said the case is a potential turning point in the efforts to end the rule. [...] On June 26, Reuters said the story had sparked [...] "a firestorm domestically and around the world," [...] explaining that [...] "Feng Jianmei's abortion was portrayed in the Chinese and international press {{as an example of the}} extreme measures some officials would take to control China's population, even if it meant breaking Chinese law." [...] A story in The Wall Street Journal remarked that the case [...] "dramatize the harshness of the one-child policy." [...] The incident prompted Evan Osnos, the New Yorker writer, to create a feature piece titled [...] "Abortion and Politics in China." [...] Osnos said that [...] "the Feng case is emblematic of some of the most inflammatory issues on Chinese public life," [...] including money, government corruption, the household registration system, and of course family planning, and that [...] "the case is a dramatic demonstration of exactly why the Communist Party had reason to be afraid of the Internet." ...|$|E
500|$|Although often {{supported}} by South Korean politicians and <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials,</b> the No Gun Ri survivors' repeated {{demands for a}} reopened U.S. investigation and compensation went unheeded. Meeting with South Korean officials in 2001, the survivors asked that their government seek action at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and in U.N. human rights forums, but were rebuffed. In 2002, a spokesman for South Korea's then-governing party called for a new U.S. inquiry, but the Defense Ministry later warned the National Assembly that a reopened probe might damage U.S.-South Korean relations. [...] The disclosure in 2006 that Pentagon investigators had omitted the Muccio letter from their final report, along with other incriminating documents and testimony, prompted more calls for action. Two leaders of the National Assembly appealed to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a joint investigation, but no U.S. congressional body ever took up the No Gun Ri issue. In a 2015 book, David Straub, U.S. Embassy political chief during the No Gun Ri investigation, wrote that meeting the survivors' demands would have set an undesirable precedent for similar cases from 1950 Korea. After a delegation's visit to No Gun Ri, the annual General Assembly of the US Presbyterian Church adopted a resolution in June 2016 calling on church leadership to urge the U.S. president and Congress to issue an apology and appropriate compensation for the No Gun Ri killings.|$|E
