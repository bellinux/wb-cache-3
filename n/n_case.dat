40|$|Background: The National Avian Influenza Surveillance (NAIS) system {{detected}} human H 5 <b>N</b> 1 <b>cases</b> in Thailand from 2004 – 2006. Using NAIS data, {{we identified}} {{risk factors for}} death among H 5 <b>N</b> 1 <b>cases</b> and described differences between H 5 N 1 and human (seasonal) influenza cases. Methods and Findings: NAIS identified 11, 641 suspect H 5 <b>N</b> 1 <b>cases</b> (e. g. persons with fever and respiratory symptoms or pneumonia, and exposure to sick or dead poultry). All suspect H 5 <b>N</b> 1 <b>cases</b> were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for influenza A(H 5 N 1) and human influenza viruses. NAIS detected 25 H 5 N 1 and 2074 human influenza cases; 17 (68 %) and 22 (1 %) were fatal, respectively. We collected detailed information from medical records on all H 5 <b>N</b> 1 <b>cases,</b> all fatal human influenza cases, and a sampled subset of 230 hospitalized non-fatal human influenza cases drawn from provinces with $ 1 H 5 <b>N</b> 1 <b>case</b> or human influenza fatality.

50|$|The {{cases as}} they had been heard before the courts went as follows: an {{isolated}} case was given an award in August 1992; the next case did not arise until February 1994 — in this case the claim was dismissed; arising from the time lag before cases come to hearing, it was not until December 1995 that a landmark case, the B case with little actual impairment, was heard in the High Court and an award of £45,000 was made; it was not until June 1996 that another case, the <b>N</b> <b>case,</b> came to hearing — the claimant received £24,720, notwithstanding the fact that the presiding judge found that the individual had persevered with a claim for loss of hearing that, on relatively clear evidential grounds, was unsustainable. I have nothing to add to the court's stated reservations about the plaintiff's honesty. Without labouring the point, I trust it will be clear to all Members that this case came as a shattering blow to the State's defence as it laid down a precedent that, even where the plaintiff {{has been found to be}} untruthful in the matter of hearing loss, he may still receive substantial compensation for tinnitus. Severe tinnitus — a constant ringing in the ears — is normally present in a small minority of hearing loss cases. It cannot be measured objectively.

The conditions under which sieve bootstrap yields consistent estimators and test statistics are explored, and a selection rule for the order of the approximation of the AR dy- namics is derived. Two main results are shown. First, an invariance principle for the partial sums of the bootstrap samples of the. rst di¤erences of the estimated factors is shown to hold for large T and. nite or large n. Secondly, it is proved that bootstrap estimates and test statistics are consistent only for (n; T) ! 1, whilst the. nite <b>n</b> <b>case</b> results in inconsistent bootstrap.
