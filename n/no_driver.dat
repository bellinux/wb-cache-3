5|$|On 27 November 1880, Boycott, {{his family}} and a local {{magistrate}} were escorted from Lough Mask House {{by members of the}} 19th Hussars. A carriage had been hired for the family, but <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> could be found for it, and an army ambulance and driver had to be used. The ambulance was escorted to Claremorris railway station, where Boycott and his family boarded a train to Dublin, where Boycott was received with some hostility. The hotel he stayed in received letters saying that it would be boycotted if Boycott remained. He had intended to stay in Dublin for a week, but Boycott was advised to cut his stay short.

5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying {{there was a lack}} of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E

The car was fielded out of the MWR shop for select races for Michael Waltrip, Jeff Burton, and Brett Moffitt, with Waltrip and Moffitt running select races with MWR support out of Robinson's shop. The other primary drivers were Joe Nemechek and Mike Wallace. Identity Ventures Racing folded after one season due to ownership issues, ending the satellite team.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwan, the Road Traffic Security Rules require pedicabs to be {{registered}} by their owners with the police {{before they can be}} legally driven on public roads, or risk an administrative fine of 300 new Taiwan dollars (TWD). Their drivers must carry the police registration documents or risk a fine of 180 TWD, but <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> license is required. The administrative fines are based on Articles 69 and 71 of the Act Governing the Punishment of Violation of Road traffic Regulations. As Taiwanese road traffic is now heavily motorized, most pedicabs have been replaced by taxicabs, but they can still be found at limited places, such as Cijin District of Kaohsiung City.|$|E
25|$|With <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> for 2000 and Kodiak {{leaving the}} team, Hedrick decided to hire {{journeyman}} Rick Mast to drive. After a long search, LHM signed Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce as sponsor. The team struggled at first, but when Mast left for A.J. Foyt Racing, many questions began surrounding the organization. It was soon revealed that Big Daddy's had neglected {{to pay their}} sponsorship fees, and had instead given Hedrick 11 million shares of stock in the company. Hedrick {{tried to get a}} cash deal with New Holland as well as ordering Big Daddy's to pay their money, with neither working out. (The stocks were later proven to be worthless). During this time, Bradberry returned for a three-race deal, but the team took {{the rest of the year}} off because of the sponsorship problems. After no other sponsorship opportunities came up in 2001, Hedrick sold the team.|$|E

25|$|A bus {{rapid transit}} (BRT) system using {{dedicated}} lanes can have a theoretical capacity of 3,600 passengers per hour per direction (30 buses per direction, 120 passengers in articulated buses). BRT is an alternative to LRT, at least if very high capacity is not needed. Using buses, roads can achieve a much higher commuter capacity than is achievable with passenger cars. To have 30 buses per direction an hour, buses must have priority at traffic lights and have their own dedicated lanes. Buses can travel closer to each other than rail vehicles because of better braking capability. However, each bus vehicle requires a single driver, whereas a light rail train may have three to four cars of much larger capacity in one train {{under the control of}} one driver, or <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> at all in fully automated systems, increasing the labor costs of high-traffic BRT systems compared to LRT systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{qualifying}} session, the session was red-flagged shortly after it started: Chiyo crashed at San Francisco Bend but the stoppage was short-lived as course workers worked swiftly to get running back under way. Lynn bettered Rosenqvist's benchmark first qualifying lap and recorded the fastest time which was suppressed shortly after by Derani. A second stoppage occurred when Sun and Mason crashed at Moorish corner just as Blomqvist went quickest. <b>No</b> <b>driver</b> managed a timed lap as Giovinazzi {{went into the}} barrier at Paiol turn, causing the third (and final) red flag. When the session restarted, Rosenqvist took provisional pole before Marciello denied him the position {{with a time of}} two minutes and 11.555 seconds. Rosenqvist slipstreamed other cars but was cautious in the final two turns as he was confident of pole position. Lynn was one-tenth of a second adrift in third place. Auer moved up from his provisional grid slot to start fourth despite stalling in the pit lane.at the third restart. Félix da Costa's effort in second qualifying dropped him to fifth while Blomqvist improved to sixth. His teammate Derani took seventh. The top ten was completed by Carlin runners with Jaafar leading Tincknell and King. Behind them {{the rest of the field}} lined up as Sims, Buller, Korjus, Sainz, Ocon, Latifi, Coletti, Sekiguchi, Wolf, Giovinazzi, Nakayama, van de Laar, Byrant-Meisner, Gelael, Mason, Jones, Chiyo and Sun. Jaafar, Nakayama and Jones each received penalties after second qualifying; Nakayama and Jones were demoted to the back of the grid for changing their engines while Jaafar dropped five places for a yellow flag infringement.|$|E
500|$|Bernie Ecclestone, {{the owner}} of Formula One's {{commercial}} rights, called {{for the removal of}} chicanes from racing circuits labelling them [...] "silly and unnecessary". FIA president Max Mosley subsequently announced that safety measures would be reviewed and stated a review of the Monza track would take place. Mosley believed that <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> was responsible for causing the accident but stressed to competitors that it was their responsibility for being aware when bunched up {{at the start of a}} Grand Prix. Former driver Jacques Laffite advocated an electronic warning system for marshals and believed that a review of chicanes should have taken place.|$|E

Of the drivers' opinions, Stoddart writes: [...] "While I cannot testify that each and every driver agreed with what we were proposing, what I can say with certainty is that <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> disagreed." [...] The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present. The nine team principals who were present then resolved that, unless they and the FIA could {{come to a decision}} {{in the best interest of}} the sport, they would not participate in the race.|$|E
500|$|The {{stewards}} did {{not impose}} a penalty on Button for his collisions with Hamilton and Alonso, having judged that <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> {{was to blame}} in either incident. Hamilton agreed with the stewards that Button did not intentionally collide with him, and although {{he felt he was}} alongside Button at the time, later reflected that [...] "he probably hadn't spotted me". He went on to praise his teammate's race as [...] "an utterly fantastic performance, from a truly great driver." [...] Alonso also did not place any blame on Button, saying that it was the final incident on a day that [...] "everything went wrong".|$|E
500|$|Following {{an inquiry}} into the {{incident}} between Alonso and Gutiérrez, the stewards took no action against either driver, deeming it a [...] "racing incident" [...] with <b>no</b> <b>driver</b> particularly to blame. Fernando Alonso shared the stewards' opinion and was quick to express {{that he did not}} blame Gutiérrez. The accident was a talking point for days after the race, with former FIA president Max Mosley pointing out that Alonso's impact might have been fatal about twenty years earlier. He praised the measures taken in terms of driver security ever since the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, saying that due to these efforts, one was now able to [...] "expect the driver to walk away" [...] from a violent crash.|$|E
