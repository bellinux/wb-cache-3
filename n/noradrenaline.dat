5|$|Adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> are catecholamines, {{water-soluble}} {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating <b>noradrenaline.</b> These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline,</b> released by the medulla. Approximately 20% <b>noradrenaline</b> (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the <b>noradrenaline</b> reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released <b>noradrenaline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into <b>noradrenaline.</b> In the cytosol, <b>noradrenaline</b> is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to <b>noradrenaline,</b> a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline)</b> and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline,</b> which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as <b>noradrenaline)</b> at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system (SNS), which release <b>noradrenaline,</b> which, besides affecting postsynaptic receptors, also affects presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors, inhibiting further release of <b>noradrenaline.</b> This effect is utilized with clonidine to perform inhibitory effects on the SNS.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Holtz and Blaschko it {{was clear}} that animals {{synthesized}} <b>noradrenaline.</b> What was lacking to attribute a transmitter role to it was proof of its presence in tissues at effective concentrations and not only as a short-lived intermediate. On April 16, 1945, Ulf von Euler of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, who had already discovered or co-discovered substance P and prostaglandins, submitted to Nature {{the first of a series}} of papers that gave this proof. After many bioassays and chemical assays on organ extracts he concluded that mammalian sympathetically innervated tissues as well as, in small amounts, the brain, but not the nerve-free placenta, contained <b>noradrenaline</b> and that <b>noradrenaline</b> was the sympathin of Cannon and Rosenblueth, the ″physiological transmitter of adrenergic nerve action in mammals″. Overflow of <b>noradrenaline</b> into the venous blood of the cat’s spleen upon sympathetic nerve stimulation two years later bore out the conclusion. In amphibian hearts, on the other hand, the transmitter role of adrenaline was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Nefazodone {{operates}} {{by blocking}} post-synaptic serotonin type-2A receptors {{and to a}} lesser extent by inhibiting pre-synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline)</b> reuptake.|$|E

25|$|The {{adrenergic}} receptors (or adrenoceptors) are a {{class of}} G protein-coupled receptors that are targets of the catecholamines, especially norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline)</b> and epinephrine (adrenaline).|$|E
25|$|Reserpine almost irreversibly {{blocks the}} uptake (and storage) of {{norepinephrine}} (i.e. <b>noradrenaline)</b> and dopamine into synaptic vesicles by inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2).|$|E
25|$|Methcathinone {{has very}} strong affinities for the {{dopamine}} transporter and the norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline)</b> transporter. Its {{affinity for the}} serotonin transporter is {{less than that of}} methamphetamine.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} again neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system, which release <b>noradrenaline,</b> which, in addition, generates an inhibitory effect on presynaptic terminals of neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The catecholamines {{comprise}} the endogenous substances dopamine, <b>noradrenaline</b> (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) {{as well as}} numerous artificially synthesized compounds such as isoprenaline. Their investigation constitutes a prominent chapter {{in the history of}} physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology. Adrenaline was the first hormone extracted from its endocrine gland and obtained in pure form, before the word hormone was coined. It was also the first hormone the structure and biosynthesis of which were clarified. Apart from acetylcholine, adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> were the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and the first intercellular biochemical signals to be found in intracellular vesicles. The β-adrenoceptor was the first G protein-coupled receptor the gene of which was cloned.|$|E
25|$|The war {{prevented}} Peter Holtz and {{his group}} in Rostock from being recognized {{side by side with}} von Euler as discoverers of the second catecholamine transmitter <b>noradrenaline.</b> Their approach was different. They sought for catecholamines in human urine and found a blood pressure-increasing material Urosympathin that they identified as a mixture of dopamine, <b>noradrenaline</b> and adrenaline. “As to the origin of Urosympathin we would like to suggest the following. Dopamine in urine is the fraction that was not consumed for the synthesis of sympathin E and I. … Sympathin E and I, i.e. <b>noradrenaline</b> and adrenaline, are liberated in the region of the sympathetic nerve endings when these are excited.” The manuscript was received by Springer-Verlag in Leipzig on October 8, 1944. On October 15, the printing office in Braunschweig was destroyed by an airstrike. Publication was delayed to volume 204, 1947, of Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie. Peter Holtz later used to cite the paper as ″Holtz et al. 1944/47″ or ″Holtz, Credner and Kroneberg 1944/47″.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} {{led to the}} central nervous system. It was taken by Marthe Vogt, a refugee from Germany who at that time worked with John Henry Gaddum in the Institute of Pharmacology of the University of Edinburgh. ″The {{presence}} of <b>noradrenaline</b> and adrenaline in the brain has been demonstrated by von Euler (1946) and Holtz (1950). These substances were supposed, undoubtedly correctly, {{to occur in the}} cerebral vasomotor <= vasoconstrictor> nerves. The present work is concerned with the question whether these sympathomimetic amines, besides their role as transmitters at vasomotor endings, play a part in the function of the central nervous tissue itself. In this paper, these amines will be referred to as sympathin, since they were found invariably to occur together, with <b>noradrenaline</b> representing the major component, as is characteristic for the transmitter of the peripheral sympathetic system.″ Vogt created a detailed map of <b>noradrenaline</b> in the dog brain. Its uneven distribution, not reflecting the distribution of vasomotor nerves, and its persistence after removal of the superior cervical ganglia made it ″tempting to assign to the cerebral sympathin a transmitter role like that which we assign to the sympathin found in the sympathetic ganglia and their postganglionic fibres.″ Her assignment was confirmed, the finishing touch being the visualization of the <b>noradrenaline</b> as well as adrenaline and (see below) dopamine pathways in the central nervous system with the formaldehyde fluorescence method developed by Nils-Åke Hillarp (1916–1965) and Bengt Falck (born 1927) in Sweden and by immunochemistry techniques.|$|E
25|$|Norepinephrine reuptake {{inhibitor}}s (NRIs or NERIs) are {{a type of}} {{drug that}} acts as a reuptake inhibitor for the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline)</b> by blocking the action of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|Even before {{contributing}} to the formation pathway, Blaschko had discovered a destruction mechanism. An enzyme tyramine oxidase described in 1928 also oxidized dopamine, <b>noradrenaline</b> and adrenaline. It was later named monoamine oxidase. This seemed to clarify {{the fate of the}} catecholamines in the body, but in 1956 Blaschko suggested that, because the oxidation was slow, “other mechanisms of inactivation … will be found to play an important part. Here is a gap in our knowledge which remains to be filled.” Within a year, Axelrod narrowed the gap by showing that dopamine, <b>noradrenaline</b> and adrenaline were O-methylated by catechol-O-methyl transferase. To fill the gap completely, however, the role of membranes had to be appreciated (see below).|$|E
25|$|L-DOPA is {{produced}} from the amino acid L-tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. It {{is also the}} precursor for the monoamine or catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline),</b> and epinephrine (adrenaline). Dopamine is formed by the decarboxylation of L-DOPA by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} hypothalamic {{function is}} responsive to—and regulated by—levels {{of all three}} classical monoamine neurotransmitters, <b>noradrenaline,</b> dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.|$|E
25|$|For <b>noradrenaline</b> to be {{acted upon}} by PNMT in the cytosol, it {{must first be}} shipped out of {{granules}} of the chromaffin cells. This may occur via the catecholamine-H+ exchanger VMAT1. VMAT1 is also responsible for transporting newly synthesized adrenaline from the cytosol back into chromaffin granules in preparation for release.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{discovery}} of TAAR1, trace amines were believed to serve very limited functions. They were thought to induce <b>noradrenaline</b> release from sympathetic nerve endings and compete for catecholamine or serotonin binding sites on cognate receptors, transporters, and storage sites. Today, they are believed to play a much more dynamic role by regulating monoaminergic systems in the brain.|$|E
25|$|Hormones play a {{dominant}} {{role in the}} formation of cellulite. Estrogen may be the important hormone in the development of cellulite. However, there has been no reliable clinical evidence to support such a claim. Other hormones, including insulin, the catecholamines adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline,</b> thyroid hormones, and prolactin, are all believed to participate in the development of cellulite.|$|E
25|$|Kissing {{can also}} cause the adrenal glands to secrete {{epinephrine}} and norepinephrine (adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline)</b> into the blood, thereby causing an adrenaline rush, which has a beneficial impact on the cardiovascular system because the heart pumps faster. In an experiment by Dr. Alexander DeWees, a passionate kiss generally burns up to 2–3 calories per minute.|$|E
25|$|He had luck in {{the latter}} statement. In most {{amphibian}} organs including the heart, the concentration of adrenaline far exceeds that of <b>noradrenaline,</b> and adrenaline is indeed the main transmitter. In mammals, however, difficulties arose. In a comprehensive structure-activity study of adrenaline-like compounds, Dale and the chemist George Barger in 1910 pointed out that Elliott’s hypothesis assumed a stricter parallelism between the effects of sympathetic nerve impulses and adrenaline than actually existed. For example, sympathetic impulses shared with adrenaline contractile effects in the trigone but not relaxant effects in the fundus of the cat′s urinary bladder. In this respect, ″amino-ethanol-catechol″ – <b>noradrenaline</b> – mimicked sympathetic nerves more closely than adrenaline did. The Harvard Medical School physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon, who had popularized {{the idea of a}} sympatho-adrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed an elaborate but ″queer″ theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory). The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that <b>noradrenaline</b> might be the – or at least one – postganglionic sympathetic transmitter. However, nothing definite was brought to light till after the war. In the meantime, Dale created a terminology that since has imprinted the thinking of neuroscientists: that nerve cells should be named after their transmitter, i.e. cholinergic if the transmitter was ″a substance like acetylcholine", and adrenergic if it was ″some substance like adrenaline″.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{domestic}} species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a {{study found that}} there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. There was evidence of selection during dog domestication of genes that affect the adrenaline and <b>noradrenaline</b> biosynthesis pathway. These genes are involved in the synthesis, transport and degradation of a variety of neurotransmitters, particularly the catecholamines, which include dopamine and <b>noradrenaline.</b> Recurrent selection on this pathway and its role in emotional processing and the fight-or-flight response suggests that the behavioral changes we see in dogs compared to wolves may be due to changes in this pathway, leading to tameness and an emotional processing ability. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.|$|E
25|$|In retrospect, {{although}} Ahlquist {{was right}} in his ″one transmitter – two receptors″ postulate, he erred {{in the identification of}} the transmitter with adrenaline. There is an additional qualification. For many responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, the ATP co-stored with <b>noradrenaline</b> (see above) is a cotransmitter. It acts through purinoceptors. Lastly, Ahlquist failed to adduce the selectivity of all antagonists known at his time for the α-adrenoceptor as an additional argument.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{epinephrine}} secretion {{is observed}} in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction {{and to a}} lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to <b>noradrenaline</b> is considerably increased. Therefore, there must be some autonomy of the adrenal medulla {{from the rest of the}} sympathetic system.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} the {{neurotransmitter}} Norepinephrine (<b>Noradrenaline)</b> plays {{a large role in}} consolidation of traumatic memory. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors during arousal and stress strengthens memory consolidation. Increased release of Norepinephrine inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which plays a role in emotion control as well as extinction or suppression of memory. Additionally, the release also serves to stimulate the amygdala which {{plays a key role in}} generating fear behaviors.|$|E
25|$|L-Phenylalanine is biologically {{converted}} into L-tyrosine, {{another one of}} the DNA-encoded amino acids, and beta-phenethylamine. L-tyrosine in turn is {{converted into}} L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (<b>noradrenaline),</b> and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenethylamine is further converted into N-methylphenethylamine. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier, and, in large quantities, interferes with the production of serotonin.|$|E
