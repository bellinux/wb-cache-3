In recent years, landings from the southern New England/Mid-Atlantic area have continued to dominate the catch, reversing landing patterns observed in 1986 - 1987, when the Cape Cod Bay fishery was dominant. The shift in landings is attributed to the changes in management (gear/mesh) regulations. Total landings in 2004 were 5 mt, a record low in the time series (Table O. 1, Figure O. 1).

Minor recreational catches have also been reported from the western Gulf of Maine in recent years. Total stock size (age 2 and older haddock) for Georges Bank, determined from virtual population analysis, averaged 140 million fish (153, 000 tons) during 1935 - 60, increased to 530 million fish (427, 000 tons) in 1965 and declined precipitously to 8 million fish (22, 000 tons) in 1972. Subsequently, there was a substantial increase in stock size due to recruitment of the 1975 year-class. The 1978 year-class appears to be comparable in size to that of 1975. Instantaneous fishing mortality (F) for age 3 and older fish averaged 0. 44 during 1935 - 60, increased to a peak of 0. 79 in 1966 and subsequently declined as abundance decreased and fishing effort was diverted to other species.

40|$|Capture {{in global}} pelagic {{longline}} fisheries threatens {{the viability of}} some seabird populations. The Hawaii longline tuna fishery annually catches hundreds of seabirds, primarily Laysan (Phoebastria immutabilis) and black-footed (P. nigripes) albatrosses. Since seabird regulations were introduced in 2001, the seabird catch rate has declined 74 %. However, over the past decade, seabird catch levels significantly increased due to significant increasing trends in both effort and <b>nominal</b> seabird <b>catch</b> rates. We modelled observer data using a spatio-temporal generalized additive mixed model with zero-inflated Poisson likelihood to determine {{the significance of the}} effect of various risk factors on the seabird catch rate. The seabird catch rate significantly increased as annual mean multivariate ENSO index values increased, suggesting that decreasing ocean productivity observed in recent years in the central north Pacific {{may have contributed to the}} increasing trend in <b>nominal</b> seabird <b>catch</b> rate. A significant increasing trend in number of albatrosses attending vessels, possibly linked to declining regional ocean productivity and increasing absolute abundance of black-footed albatrosses, may also have contributed to the increasing <b>nominal</b> seabird <b>catch</b> rate. Largest opportunities for reductions are through augmented efficacy of seabird bycatch mitigation north of 23 ° N where mitigation methods are required and during setting instead of during hauling. Both side vs. stern setting, and blue-dyed vs. untreated bait significantly reduced the seabird catch rate. Of two options for meeting regulatory requirements, side setting had a significantly lower seabird catch rate than blue-dyed bait. There was significant spatio-temporal and seasonal variation in the risk of seabird capture with highest catch rates in April and May and to the northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wildlife and {{fisheries}} management {{are based upon}} economics: the law {{of supply and demand}} controls the di-rection of commercial fisheries. In the U. S. pelagic longline fishery, one example of a bycatch species that has received little research attention because of its lower economic value is the escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum). Given its im-portance as a secondary market species, the main objectives of this paper are to provide information on fishing character-istics, relative abundance, distribution, and size composition of escolar catch in the U. S. pelagic longline fishery operating in the western North Atlantic. The overarching goal is to emphasize the importance of evaluating, managing, and conserv-ing lower-valued species. Findings show that escolar <b>nominal</b> <b>catches</b> significantly vary by geographical area, month, and year. Most escolar are caught in the Gulf of Mexico and off the Florida East Coast (FEC), but mean catch rates are great-est in the FEC and Sargasso Sea. Escolar catch rates are greatest in April, November, and December. Overall, escolar catch rates are stable, which suggests that overfishing is not occurring {{in this part of the}} Atlantic...|$|R

The basic information carne from fishing log-book recorded by scientific observers between January 2001 and December 2005. The generalized additives models included five physical variables (latitude, longitude, date, lunar Índex and sea surface temperature (SST)), which affect the availability and vulnerability of swordfish, and two operational variables (length of the vessel and type of longline), which are directly associated with {{the effectiveness of the}} fishing system. The non-linear effects were established significantly (p < 0. 01) for each of the independent variables. There was a typical annual cycle in the catch rates, with high values from March to July/August, and displacement of the fishing operation northward from the 38 ° to 32 °S, in a SST range of 17 ° to 19 °C. Subsequently, catch rates decrease in a northerly direction from 32 °S in SST higher than 20 °C. This spatial-temporal pattern was determinates with a high square coherency (79 %) in the time series of <b>nominal</b> <b>catch</b> rates and latitudinal component analyzed in the Fourier spectral analysis.

Depth {{distribution}} of white hake varies {{by age and}} season; juveniles typically occupy shallower areas than adults, but individuals of all ages tend to move inshore or shoalward in summer, dispersing to deeper areas in winter (Musick 1974; Markel et al. 1982). Small white hake are difficult to distinguish from red hake, Urophycis chuss, resulting in a small degree of bias in reported <b>nominal</b> <b>catches</b> (NEFSC 2005). Larval distributions indicate the presence of two spawning groups in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank and Scotian Shelf region, one which spawns in deep water on the continental slope in late winter and early spring, and a second which spawns on the Scotian Shelf in the summer (Fahay and Able 1989; Lang et al. 1994).

Observer {{data from the}} Palau longline fishery were analysed to identify opportunities to mitigate vulnerable species bycatch, determine temporal trends in local abundance, and assess changes following a ban on shark retention and wire leaders. Catch and haulback condition data for bigeye and yellowfin tunas, blue and silky sharks and pelagic stingrays were fitted to standardized catch and survival rate models. The fishery caught silky and blue sharks, olive ridley sea turtles and other species of conservation concern. Changing from shallow sets to deep daytime sets might reduce shark and sea turtle catch rates but increase turtle haulback mortality rates, maintain economically viable tuna catch rates, but increase catch rates of pelagic stingrays, a lower conservation concern than main caught species of sharks and turtles. Focusing fishing effort {{during the middle of}} the calendar year would maximize yellowfin tuna and minimize silky shark standardized catch rates, but maximize blue shark catch rates. A large decline in shark fishing mortality rate very likely occurred following a ban on shark retention and wire leaders. This was due to large reductions in the nominal shark catch rate and shark retention, partially offset by decreases in the shark haulback survival rate and pre-catch survival rate.

Various indices show that even the stock was in high levels in 2006 and 2007 the lack of good recruitments {{in the last years}} and the progressive disappearance of the strong year classes 2001 and 2002 have caused a drastic decline of the stock. Although the fishing effort in recent years was low and from 2011 a moratorium over shrimp fishery was established, the increase of cod biomass (the most important predator of northern shrimp in 3 M) has probably been the cause of the successive bad recruitments and resulting decline of the stock. The revised <b>Nominal</b> <b>catches</b> declined from 63 970 tonnes in 2003 to 5 448 tonnes in 2009 and 1 988 in 2010. No catches have been recorded in 2011 and 2012 due to the moratorium. The female biomass from EU survey was variable though without trends at a relative high level from 1998 to 2007 but since then the estimated biomass initiated a drastic decline to lowest levels in the EU survey series in 2011 and 2012. Also after the strong 2002 year-class (i. e. age 2 in 2004), all the subsequent year classes have been weak and the recruitment prospects remain uncertain. Considering the 15 % of the maximum survey female biomass index as a limit reference point for biomass (Blim), the stock remain since 2011 in the collapse zone defined by the NAFO PA framework.

They were developed by applying the quantile regression considering the different weight of the different environmental factors and the interaction among them. Habitat environment integration index (HEII) of bigeye tuna were estimated by these models. HEII maps of bigeye tuna were also built using the GIS software Marine Explore 4. 0. The results suggest (1) From 180 m to 240 m, ijDHEII was relatively lower ( 0. 6); (2) From 240 to 300 m, ijDHEII was relatively higher (> 0. 6) in the south of the 6 ºN, otherwise, relatively lower in the north of the 6 ºN; (3) From 300 to 360 m, ijDHEII was relatively lower ( 0. 6) in dominat...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{abundance}} of wild salmon (Salmo salar) in the North Atlantic has declined markedly {{since the late}} 1980 s {{as a result of}} increased marine mortality that coincided with a marked rise in sea temperature in oceanic foraging areas. There is substantial evidence to show that temperature governs the growth, survival, and maturation of salmon during their marine migrations through either direct or indirect effects. In an earlier study (2003), long-term changes in three trophic levels (salmon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton) were shown to be correlated significantly with sea surface temperature (SST) and northern hemisphere temperature (NHT). A sequence of trophic changes ending with a stepwise decline in the total <b>nominal</b> <b>catch</b> of North Atlantic salmon (regime shift in ∼ 1986 / 1987) was superimposed on a trend to a warmer dynamic regime. Here, the earlier study is updated with catch and abundance data to 2010, confirming earlier results and detecting a new abrupt shift in ∼ 1996 / 1997. Although correlations between changes in salmon, plankton, and temperature are reinforced, the significance of the correlations is reduced because the temporal autocorrelation of time-series substantially increased due to a monotonic trend in the time-series, probably related to global warming. This effect may complicate future detection of effects of climate change on natural systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the international shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery in NAFO Division 3 M is described. Various indices show that even the stock was in high levels in 2006 and 2007 the lack of good recruitments {{in the last years}} and the progressive disappearance of the strong year classes 2001 and 2002 have caused a drastic decline of the stock. Although the effort in the last years was low due to high cost of oil and low marketing prize of shrimp, the increase of cod biomass (the most important predator of northern shrimp in 3 M) has probably been the cause of the successive bad recruitments and resulting decline of the stock. The revised <b>Nominal</b> <b>catches</b> declined from 63970 tonnes in 2003 to 12889 tonnes in 2008. The catch in 2009 was only 2958 tonnes to 10 september. Noting the lack of reports on catch this figure might increase although is very unlikely that the catches exceed the 5000 tonnes. The results from ageing which is based on biological sampling showed a great number of five year olds per hour in 2007 proving the 2002 year-class to be very strong. However in 2008 this class year was barely represented and it was residual in 2009. The female biomass from EU survey was variable though without trends at a relative high level from 1998 to 2007 but in 2008 the estimated biomass decreased to levels prior 1998. In the 2009 EU survey the 3 M biomass index was 2797 t, next to the lowest values estimated {{in the beginning of the}} EU survey series and confirming the decrease initiated in 2002. The female standardized CPUE could not be updated due to the lack and high uncertainty in the catch and effort data from 2009. Indices of recruitment from the commercial fishery (age 2 in numbers) are plotted against CPUE of 3 + two and three years later showing a significative relationship between them. The recruitment indices of both commercial fishery and EU survey show a very strong 2002 year-class followed by weak year-class since then. Considering the 15 % of the maximum survey female biomass index as a limit reference point for biomass (Blim) the stock is now below Blim entering the collapse zone defined by the NAFO PA framework. Also the recruitment prospects remain poor and therefore the fishing mortality would be set as close to zero as possible in 2010...|$|R
40|$|In Car Body Assembly Shops, Body in White (BIW), non-rigid {{sheet metal}} panels are {{assembled}} into car bodies. Depending upon the achieved degree of robustness in part and tool design, the produced items tend to deviate {{more or less}} from their <b>nominal</b> specifications. <b>Catching</b> eventual non-robust solutions {{early on in the}} development phases is important to minimize time-consuming, expensive testing and trimming activities late in the development- and industrialization phases. To meet these demands, there is today an increased use of virtual forming and assembly tools within the automotive industry. Significant amounts of research have been performed in the area of forming and assembly simulations, but there is still a need to find efficient working methods. This study has focused upon how forming simulation results can be used in virtual assembly analysis. The predicted springback shapes (offset and variation) of the stamped panels are used in the assembly simulation to study the effects of the part variation when assembled, producing a sub-assembly. The method used is described, and the simulation results are reported. The case shows the potential of using forming simulation results in virtual assembly analysis. Furthermore, the strength of using the Principal Component Analysis technique to describe the part variation in assembly simulations is shown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} effects of {{magnitude}} and phase cues on human motor adaptation. Participants were asked to excite virtual second-order systems at their resonance frequencies via a two-degree of freedom haptic interface, with visual and visual plus haptic feedback conditions. Their motor adaptations were studied through catch trials. The results indicate that, i) humans adapt to a nominal virtual system resonant frequency, ii) humans shift to higher and lower natural frequencies during catch trials regardless of feedback modality and force cues, iii) humans can detect changes in natural frequency when gain, magnitude, and phase cues are manipulated independently, and iv) humans are able to detect changes in natural frequency when the feedback (visual or visual plus haptic) is delayed such that the phase shift between the <b>nominal</b> system and <b>catch</b> trial system is zero.
