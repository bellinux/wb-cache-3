5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of <b>naming,</b> {{tropical}} cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of <b>naming</b> weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal <b>naming</b> schemes and <b>naming</b> lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins, as well as the Australian region, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Garran {{was made}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the {{establishment}} of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by the <b>naming</b> of the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, and his link with ANU is remembered by the <b>naming</b> of a chair in the university's School of Law, by the <b>naming</b> of the hall of residence Burton & Garran Hall and by the <b>naming</b> of Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with that school.|$|E

5|$|It {{was noted}} that the <b>naming</b> process would remain stalled without such rules, and that even with them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes.

5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, {{nowadays}} the Copa Libertadores {{is sponsored}} {{by a group of}} multinational corporations. However, unlike the World Cup, the competition has a single, main sponsor for <b>naming</b> rights; it is currently primarily sponsored by Bridgestone Corporation.

5000|$|Traditional middle <b>names</b> in Vietnamese are [...] "Văn" [...] {{for male}} <b>names</b> and [...] "Thị" [...] for female <b>names.</b> However, modern Vietnamese do not {{consider}} these to be attractive <b>names,</b> especially [...] "Thị".

5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultivated}} plant taxonomy {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded <b>naming</b> of human plant selections by the Romans. The <b>naming</b> and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and <b>naming</b> of cultigens has followed its own path.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most breeds, {{there is}} a set <b>naming</b> system {{that is used to}} {{identify}} individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation. First comes the prefix, the farm or breeding establishment of which the foal was born into, followed by the sire's name, and lastly the given name for the foal. Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal, and it is by the year's letter that the foal is named. Some older horses do not fall under this <b>naming</b> strategy, but it is now mandatory in <b>naming</b> registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines. Originally, horses were tattooed with identification numbers, but now microchipping is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry.|$|E
