500|$|Experiments {{conducted}} by the Franklin Institute, Boston, in the 1830s had initially {{cast doubt on the}} practice of adding water as soon as the escape of steam through the device was noted. A steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> with the water level below the top of the firebox. When water was added {{it was found that the}} pressure rose suddenly and the observation glass shattered. The report concluded that the high temperature of the metal had vaporised the added water too quickly and that an explosion was the inevitable result. It was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged: Thomas Redmond, one of the Institute's own inspectors, [...] specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into the [...] boiler explosion on the steam ship Redstone on the Ohio River on 3 April that year. A 1907 investigation in Wales came to a similar conclusion: a steam locomotive belonging to the Rhymney Railway was inadvertently sent out with its safety valves wrongly assembled. The pressure in the boiler built up to the extent that the injectors failed; the crown sheet became uncovered, was weakened by the heat of the fire and violently blew apart. The investigation, led by Colonel Druitt of the Railway Inspectorate, dismissed the theory that the enginemen had succeeded in starting the [...] injectors and that the sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that the boiler burst. He quoted the results of experiments by the Manchester Steam Users' Association, a national boiler certification and insurance body, that proved that the weight of copper present (considered with its specific heat) was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise the boiler pressure at all. Indeed, the addition of cold water had caused the pressure to fall. From then on it was accepted that the correct action in the event of the operation of the fusible plug was to add water.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} shorten the {{launching}} process and {{eliminate the need for}} time-consuming engine warm-ups, the Seirans were to be catapulted from a cold start. This necessitated heating the engine oil for each plane to approximately [...] in a separate chamber and pumping it, as well as hot water, through the engine just prior to launch while the planes were still in the hangar. In this way, the aircraft's engine would be at or near <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> immediately upon getting airborne. The idea was borrowed from the Germans who planned on using a similar launch method for the aircraft of their unfinished carrier Graf Zeppelin.|$|E
2500|$|With a <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> of [...] {{prior to}} the recall {{switching}} to a [...] thermostat, the midmounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator. This demanded that a special coolant filling procedure be followed to prevent air pockets, as with many modern cars. Simply pouring coolant into the thermostat housing (on the engine) might leave an air bubble in the radiator, while adding coolant just to the radiator might leave an air bubble in the engine's coolant passages. Proper procedure (with engine idling and the thermostat removed, filling the thermostat housing, popping the bubble out of the radiator by cracking open the radiator cap until coolant exits) must be followed {{in order to ensure}} an air-free cooling system.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike other {{air-cooled}} cars (such as the Volkswagen Beetle and the Fiat 500) the 2CV's engine had no {{thermostat valve}} in its oil system. The engine needed {{more time for}} oil to reach <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> in cold weather. All the oil passed through an oil cooler behind the fan and received the full cooling effect regardless of the ambient temperature. This removes the risk of overheating from a jammed thermostat that can afflict water- and air-cooled engines and the engine can withstand many hours of running under heavy load at high engine speeds even in hot weather. To prevent the engine running cool in cold weather (and to improve {{the output of the}} cabin heater) all 2CVs were supplied with a grille blind (canvas on early cars and a clip-on plastic item called a [...] "muff" [...] in the owner's handbook, on later ones) which blocked around half the aperture to reduce the flow of air to the engine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{use of such}} grades {{ensures that}} a device is {{suitable}} for its application, and will withstand the environmental conditions {{in which it is}} used. <b>Normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges are affected by several factors, such as the power dissipation of the device. These factors are used to define a [...] "threshold temperature" [...] of a device, i.e. its maximum <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature,</b> and a maximum operating temperature beyond which the device will no longer function. Between these two temperatures, the device will operate at a non-peak level. For instance, a resistor may have a threshold temperature of 70 °C and a maximum temperature of 155 °C, between which it exhibits a thermal derating.|$|E

Desflurane boils at 23.5 °C, which {{is very close to}} room temperature.

This means that the features of a normal plenum vaporizer are not sufficient to ensure an accurate concentration of desflurane.

25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperatures</b> of approximately , zircaloy is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction. In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|R

50|$|The rich mixing {{can lead}} to {{hesitation}} or even stalling of the engine when the throttle is closed, a situation that worsens with higher boost pressures. Occasional events of this type may be only a nuisance, but frequent events can eventually foul the spark plugs and destroy the catalytic converter, as the inefficiently combusted fuel produces soot (excess carbon) and unburned fuel in the exhaust flow can produce soot in the converter and drive the converter beyond its <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> range.|$|E
50|$|A {{cold start}} {{is an attempt}} to start a vehicle's engine when it is cold, {{relative}} to its <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature,</b> often due to normal cold weather.

50|$|On some vehicles, a {{temperature}} sensing switch will apply manifold vacuum to the vacuum advance system when {{the engine is}} hot or cold, and ported vacuum at <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature.</b> This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed carburetor adjustments for a leaner idle mixture. At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running.|$|E
50|$|All {{molten salt}} {{reactors}} have features {{that contribute to}} containment safety. These mostly {{have to do with}} the properties of the salt itself. The salts are chemically inert.

This provides a large margin above the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> of some 600 to 700 °C. This makes it possible to operate at low pressures without risk of coolant/fuel boiling.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} fully encapsulated, semi-insulating silicon (SI-Si), Czochralski-silicon-on-insulator (CZ-SOI) {{substrates}} for silicon microwave devices is presented. Experimental results show that, using gold as a compensating impurity, a Si resistivity of order 400 kΩcm {{can be achieved}} at room temperature using lightly phosphorus doped substrates. This compares favourably with the maximum of ∼ 180 kΩcm previously achieved using lightly boron doped wafers and {{is due to a}} small asymmetry of the position of the two gold energy levels introduced into the band gap. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the semi-insulating material show that a resistivity ∼ 5 kΩcm can be achieved at 100 °C.
