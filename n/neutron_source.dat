5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} a <b>neutron</b> <b>source.</b> Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central <b>neutron</b> <b>source</b> to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could {{be used to make}} a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E
5|$|The alpha {{particles}} {{emitted by}} polonium {{can be converted}} to neutrons using beryllium oxide, at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles. Thus Po-BeO mixtures or alloys are used as a <b>neutron</b> <b>source,</b> for example, in a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons and for inspections of oil wells. About 1500 sources of this type, with an individual activity of , have been used annually in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The most {{widespread}} use of 241AmBe <b>neutron</b> <b>sources</b> is a <b>neutron</b> probe – a device {{used to measure the}} quantity of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. 241Am <b>neutron</b> <b>sources</b> are also used in well logging applications, as well as in neutron radiography, tomography and other radiochemical investigations.|$|R
5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium <b>neutron</b> <b>source</b> with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger <b>neutron</b> <b>source,</b> the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} <b>neutron</b> <b>source</b> using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) <b>neutron</b> <b>source</b> for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E

5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium <b>neutron</b> <b>source.</b> Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable <b>neutron</b> <b>source</b> for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E
5|$|A soft, silvery-white {{radioactive}} metal, actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 {{in nearly all}} its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of {{physical and chemical properties}} of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a <b>neutron</b> <b>source</b> and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.|$|E

25|$|In {{practice}} a detection system using this reaction works by subjecting the mine to thermal neutrons while {{searching for the}} characteristic gamma ray emitted from the excited state in nitrogen-15; these photons will only be observed when an object containing nitrogen is being subjected to the neutron irradiation.
