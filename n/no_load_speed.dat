40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the control {{possibility}} of the multiphase cage induction motors having number of phases greater than 3. These motors have additional properties for speed control that distinguish them from the standard 3 phase motors: operation at various sequences of supplying voltages due to the inverter control and possible operation with few open-circuited phases. For each supply sequence different <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>speeds</b> at the same frequency can be obtained. This feature extends the motor application for miscellaneous drive demands including vector or scalar control. This depends mainly on the type of the stator winding for a given number of phases, since the principle of motor operation is based on co-operation of higher harmonics of magnetic field. Examples of operation are presented for a 9 -phase motor, though general approach has been discussed. This motor was fed by a voltage source inverter at field oriented control with forced currents. The mathematical model of the motor was reduced to the form incorporating all most important physical features and appropriate for the control law formulation. The operation was illustrated for various supply sequences for “healthy” motor and for the motor operating at one phase broken. The obtained results have shown that parasitic influence of harmonic fields interaction has negligible influence on motor operation with respect to the useful coupling for properly designed stator winding...|$|R

In addition to economic benefits, thin surfaces can protect pavements against deterioration caused by traffic and weather. One {{of the most important}} properties of thin surfaces is their adhesion to the substrate layer. In order to avoid bond failure and/or slippage between the thin surface and the pavement layer, a strong adhesive strength is required. Different equipment and methods, such as a Torque Bond test and the UTEP (University of Texas at El Paso) Pull-Off test, are used to determine this adhesive strength. However, these bonding tests have <b>no</b> <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> control system and are not easily to be placed in a climate room for a constant temperature test. An advanced pull test method was designed and introduced in this paper for determine the adhesive strength at the interface between a thin surface layer and the substrate layer. In a climate chamber, a displacement/force controlled test was developed, in which the load-displacement curve till failure can be measured. The possible failure paths in the thin surface, at the interface between thin surface and in the asphalt mixture layer below are discussed. A Finite Element Model (FEM) was used to simulate the boundary effect due to the different sample preparation procedures, which includes with and without cut through thin surfaces into asphalt layer. Test results indicate that this advanced pull test can be used to determine the adhesion strength at the interface between the thin surface layer and substrate layer.

40|$|The PZT {{cellular}} actuator {{developed in}} the MIT d'Arbeloff Laboratory utilizes small-strain, high-force PZT stack actuators in a mechanical flexure system to produce a larger-strain, lower-force actuator useful in robotic systems. Many functionalities for these cellular actuators are developed which can have great impact on robotic systems and actuation itself. After initial exploration into other possible circuitry, a circuit is designed to recovery unused energy for the PZT cells. The circuit design is formed around a proposed method of distributed actuation using PZT cells which imposes that different PZT cells will be activated during different periods such that the charge from some cells can be transferred to others. If the application allows actuation which can conform to this criteria, the developed circuit can be used which, without optimization, can save ~ 41 % of the energy used to drive the actuators with a theoretical upper limit on energy efficiency of 100 %. A dynamic system consisting of multiple PZT actuators driving a linear gear is analyzed and simulated which can achieve a <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>speed</b> 2. 4 m/s with minimal actuators. Then, the two-way transforming properties of PZT stack actuators are utilized to allow dual sensing and actuation. This method uses an inactive PZT cell as a sensor. With no additional sensors, a pendulum system driven by antagonistic groups of PZT cells is shown to find its own resonance with no system model. These functionalities of charge recovery, distributed actuation, and dual sensing and actuation set the PZT cellular actuator as {{an important contribution to}} robotic actuation and begin to illuminate the possible impacts of the concept.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{towards the}} discipline of whole aircraft simula- tion; modelling ight dynamics and airframe systems simultaneously. The objective is to produce estimates of the dynamic power consumption char- acteristics of the primary ight control actuation system when executing manoeuvres. Three technologies are studied; the classic hydraulic actuators and the electromechanical and electro-hydrostatic types that are commonly associated with the more electric aircraft. Models are produced which represent the ight dynamics of an aircraft; these are then combined with low frequency dynamic functional models of the three actuator technologies and ight controllers. The result is a model, capable of faster than real time simulation, which produces estimates of ac- tuator power consumption as the aircraft follows prede ned trajectories. The model is used to quantify the energy consumption {{as a result of}} di erent manoeuvre rates when executing banked turns. The result from an actuation system point of view alone is that the lower the turn rate, the lower the overall energy used. The tradeo is that the turn radius becomes larger. The use of the model can be extended to assist with additional design challenges such as actuator design and speci cation. Using methods to size actuators based on stall force and <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>speed</b> properties leads to oversizing of the control system. Performing dynamic analyses is usually a combined task of laboratory based actuator test rigs stimulated by input data gathered during ight tests. The model in this work provides a method of generating data for preliminary design; therefore reducing the amount of ight testing required in a design and certi cation programme. The major results discovered using the tools developed in this thesis are that a hydraulically powered aileron uses 4. 23 % more energy to achieve a turn at a heading rate of 0. 03 rad/s compared to a 0. 005 rad/s manoeuvre in the same conditions. The electromechanical actuator (EMA) uses 1. 67 % more and the electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA) uses 1. 54 % more to achieve the same turns. It implies reduced turn rate turns would have the largest bene t for reducing energy consumption in current hydraulically powered actuation systems, compared to electrical actuators...|$|E

40|$|The {{bond between}} steel and CFRP {{composites}} {{is a critical}} issue for CFRP strengthening and/or repairing technique. The strengthened and/or repaired structures {{are likely to be}} subjected to dynamic loadings in practice. However, the bond between CFRP composites and steel structures is not well understood, particularly under dynamic tensile loadings. This thesis reports an investigation on the influence of impact loading on the bond between CFRP sheet and steel. A series of impact tensile tests were carried out to investigate the <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> effect on the tensile mechanical properties of composites of CFRP sheet and two adhesives, Araldite 420 and MBrace saturant, and steel plates. The <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> effect on the shear strength of Araldite 420 adhesive was also studied. In addition, empirical equations were proposed, which can determine the tensile properties of CFRP sheet, Araldite 420 and MBrace saturant adhesives as a function of strain rate within the range considered. The experimental results indicated that the <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> affects the tensile properties and failure modes of the CFRP sheet and both adhesives. The proposed empirical equations provide best fit to the experimental data. The yield and ultimate stresses of steel plate are less influenced by <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> compared to the shear strength of Araldite 420, which markedly increases by approximately 3 times the quasi-static shear strength. A further two sets of experiments were conducted on CFRP/steel double-strap joints with 1 and 3 CFRP layers at quasi-static loading and dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>speeds</b> of 3. 35 m/s, 4. 43 m/s and 5 m/s to study the <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> effect on the bond between CFRP sheet and steel plate. The influence of the adhesive on the dynamic behaviour of the adhesively-bonded joints was also shown. One set of samples was prepared using MBrace saturant, whereas the other used Araldite 420. Samples of both sets were of various bond lengths ranging from 10 to 100 mm. The parameters studied were the bond strength, effective bond length, failure mode and strain distribution along the bond length. The experimental results showed that the bond strength of both joints with 1 and 3 CFRP layers prepared utilising both adhesives is influenced by <b>loading</b> <b>speed,</b> although the general trends differ. Increasing the number of CFRP layers insignificantly influences the quasi-static bond strength of both Araldite 420 and MBrace saturant adhesives. Conversely, increasing the number of CFRP layers markedly affects the dynamic bond strength. <b>Loading</b> <b>speed</b> considerably affects the failure patterns of both joints prepared using both adhesives, particularly when increasing the <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> from quasi-static to 3. 35 m/s, due to the shear strength enhancement of the adhesives. The effective bond length for joints prepared using both adhesives is slightly influenced by the <b>loading</b> <b>speed</b> and their general trends at dynamic loadings differ. Identical strain distribution profiles with only slight differences in the measured strain values are found for joints with 1 CFRP layer for both adhesives, while a clear difference is observed in the strain distributions of joints with 3 CFRP layers for both adhesives. An additional set of experiments was conducted to examine the effect of direct impact tensile loading on the bond strength of the adhesion between CFRP sheet and steel using pull-off tests. Special CFRP/steel samples, prepared with 1 and 3 CFRP layers using both MBrace saturant and Araldite 420 adhesives, were tested at quasi-static and dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>speeds</b> of 3. 35, 4. 43 and 5 m/s. It was found the bond strength of adhesion for both joints with 1 and 3 CFRP layers and for both adhesives increases overall by about 100 % at the dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>speeds</b> considered. The values for samples with 3 CFRP layers are lower than those from samples with 1 CFRP layer for both adhesives. Considerable changes in the dynamic failure patterns compared to the quasi-static mode are found for joints with 1 CFRP layer and for both adhesives, whereas the failure mode for samples with 3 CFRP layers using both adhesives remain CFRP delamination through the CFRP layers. The dynamic behaviour of the bond between CFRP sheet and steel plate under dynamic loading was further studied using the finite element method. The individual components of the double-strap joints, the CFRP sheet, adhesive and steel plate, were first numerically analysed under quasi-static and dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>speeds</b> and validated against the experimental results. Both types of CFRP/double-strap joints with 1 and 3 CFRP layers using Araldite 420 were then numerically analysed at the same <b>loading</b> <b>speeds</b> as those used in the experimental program. In the numerical validation of the double-strap joints, finite element predictions of the ultimate failure load, effective bond length, failure patterns and strain distributions along the bond length were compared with the experimental results. The numerically-predicted and experimentally-obtained ultimate failure loads, effective bond lengths, failure patterns and strain distributions along the bond length of both joints correlated reasonably well. Finally, some recommendations for the application of CFRP sheets to strengthen and/or rehabilitate steel structures are provided, and possible future studies of the dynamic behaviour of CFRP-composite-reinforced metal structures are identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of transient waves in a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic half space excited by a traveling normal point load is investigated. The load is suddenly applied {{and then it}} moves rectilinearly at a constant speed along the free surface. The displacements are derived for {{the interior of the}} half space and for all <b>load</b> <b>speeds.</b> Wave-front expansions are obtained from the exact solution, in addition to results pertaining to the steady-state displacement field. The limit case of zero <b>load</b> <b>speed</b> is considered, yielding new results for Lamb’s point load problem...|$|R
