500|$|Volvopluteus gloiocephalus is edible, {{although}} it is cited as mediocre or of poor quality. It was once sold in markets in Perth, Australia. Mature fruit bodies, collected in sufficient quantity, {{can be used to}} prepare soup, or added to dishes where wild mushrooms are used, such as stews and casseroles. The mushrooms are best used fresh as they do not preserve well. Young specimens of Volvopluteus gloiocephalus have white gills so it is possible to mistake them for an Amanita and vice versa. In the United States, there have been several cases of Asian immigrants collecting and eating death caps (Amanita phalloides), under the mistaken assumption that they were Volvariella. [...] A Greek study determined the <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> of fruit bodies: protein 1.49 g/100 g fresh weight (fw), 18.36 g/100 g dry weight (dw); fat 0.54 g/100 g fw, 6.65 g/100g dw; carbohydrates 5.33 g/100g fw, 65.64 g/100 g dw.|$|E
500|$|Despite the unappealing fishy scent that {{develops}} after the mushroom is picked, Lactifluusvolemus is edible and recommended for culinary usage, though, typical of milk caps, {{it has a}} slightly granular texture that some may find unappetizing. The odor disappears during cooking. The latex only has a mild taste. The species is considered good for novice mushroom hunters to eat, and is best prepared by slow cooking {{to prevent it from}} becoming too hard; specimens that have been rehydrated after having been dried will require longer cooking times to eliminate the grainy texture. The mushroom has also been suggested for use in casseroles and thick sauces. Pan frying is not a recommended cooking technique, due to the large amounts of latex it exudes. L.volemus is one of several species of milk caps that are sold in rural markets in Yunnan Province, China, and it is among the most popular wild edible mushroom species collected for consumption and sale in Nepal. In their 2009 book on milk caps of North America, Bessette and colleagues consider the mushroom [...] "the best-known and most popular edible milk mushroom" [...] in the eastern United States. A Turkish study of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> of the fruit bodies concluded that L.volemus is a good source of protein and carbohydrates.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{school feeding}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} anticipated impacts, as mentioned above, much research and evaluation {{is being done to}} determine the results of school feeding programs in low-income countries. School feeding program results are often context-specific, but lessons from a variety of communities can help evaluate school feeding program effectiveness. Researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute have critically assessed evidence from developing countries to define preliminary results of these programs. [...] These assessments found that the timing of meals is not a critical factor in the positive effects on learning and cognition, and thus take-home rations can perform as well as in-school meals, and that in-school meals may even disrupt learning. [...] In some settings, take-home rations are more cost-effective than in-school meals, and the study argued that some country programs may be optimized by focusing resources on take-home rations. Additionally, it was found that in the study setting, school attendance improved learning more significantly than nutrition status improvements, but that school feeding programs encouraged attendance and still have a positive net result on education levels. In a study done by Patrick J. McEwan, it was shown that {{there is no evidence that}} higher-calorie meals positively impact school enrollment and attendance, first-grade enrollment age and grade repetition, and fourth-grade test scores over average-calorie school feeding meals in Chile's national program.

Egg yolks contained the highest essential fatty acid content of linoleic acid and the highest non-essential fatty acid content of oleic acid. In addition, there was high content of vitamin E in egg yolks and sex hormone progesterone in both of egg yolks and whites. The most essential and trace minerals of whole eggs were nitrogen and iron.

The <b>nutritional</b> <b>compositions,</b> including proximate composition, amino acids, fatty acids,collagen, GABA, Vitamin A, C, and E of the whole body and body wall of H. scabra,were analyzed. Results:H. scabra contained a high quantity of protein (22. 50 % in whole body and 55. 18 % in body wall) and very low lipids (1. 55 % in whole body and 1. 02 % in body wall).

Mature silks contained higher composition of ash (5. 51 %), carbohydrate (29. 74 %) and total dietary fiber (51. 25 g/ 100 g), than the immature silk, but {{the difference was not}} significant. In mineral determination, immature silk was rich source of Ca (1087. 08 μg/g), Mg (1219. 17 μg/g), Cu (5. 60 μg/g) and Zn (46. 37 μg/g) than the mature silks. In contrast, other minerals such as K (35671. 67 μg/g), Na (266. 67 μg/g), Fe (4. 50 μg/g) and Mn (35. 57 μg/g) were found higher in the mature silk.
