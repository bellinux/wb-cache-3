2500|$|The first {{gamma ray}} source to be {{discovered}} historically was the radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is now understood that a <b>nuclear</b> <b>isomeric</b> <b>transition,</b> however, can produce inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as [...] "radioactivity" [...] by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did not consider naming them as a different fundamental type. Villard's radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from previously named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's rays [...] "gamma rays" [...] by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford had differentiated in 1899. The [...] "rays" [...] emitted by radioactive elements were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or at least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property making them unlike alpha and beta rays.|$|E

40|$|We have {{measured}} the hyperfine structure and isotope shifts of the 402. 0 - and 399. 6 -nm resonance lines in 229 Th+. These transitions could provide pathways towards the excitation of the 229 Th low-energy isomeric nuclear state. An unexpected negative isotope shift relative to 232 Th+ is observed for the 399. 6 -nm line, indicating a strong Coulomb coupling of the excited {{state to the}} nucleus. We have developed an all-order approach to the isotope shift calculations that is generally applicable to heavy atoms and ions with several valence electrons.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{an idea of}} the {{experiment}} for excitation of the <b>isomeric</b> <b>transition</b> in thorium- 229 nuclei by irradiating with electron beam targets with necessary physical characteristics. The chemical composition and bandgap of ThSi 10 O 22 were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy.

This indicates that the compound possesses high electron-beam resistance. A quantitative estimation of the output function of isomeric thorium- 229 nuclei generated by interaction of nuclei with the secondary electron flow formed by irradiating the solid-state ThSi 10 O 22 -based target is given.
