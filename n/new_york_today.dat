25|$|Van Rensselaer Island was {{an island}} in the Hudson River {{opposite}} the city of Albany, <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>Today</b> it is within the city of Rensselaer in Rensselaer County, and has been connected to the mainland on the east side and parts of the island's west side has been dredged away.

The island stretched from Mill Creek north to the Livingston Avenue Bridge.|$|E
25|$|While the Hudson Tunnel Project {{would double}} the number of tracks under the Hudson River, it would not result in an {{increase}} in rail capacity due to constraints at Penn Station. Penn Station operates at capacity during peak periods, and since {{it takes a long time}} for passengers to board and alight trains, trains cannot leave and enter the station as might otherwise be possible. Even with improvements in the station, there are inadequate train storage facilities at Penn, and there is no capacity in the East River Tunnels to allow for trains to be stored during middays at Sunnyside Yard. Without these additional improvements, it is assumed that the same number of trains going between New Jersey and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>today</b> would be operating in 2030, albeit with the additional tunnel capacity.|$|E
500|$|Music {{supervisor}} Ivan Pavlovich said [...] " [...] to {{pick the}} songs that make <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>today</b> what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated {{by the time the}} game comes out." [...] The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights. They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song [...] "Walk the Night". Citing sources close to the deals, Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by going to an in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7. Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, went through the extra effort of flying to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City.|$|E
