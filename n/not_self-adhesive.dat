5000|$|Stamps of the fifth, [...] "animalistic" [...] {{issue of}} 2008 were <b>not</b> <b>self-adhesive</b> {{and went back}} to {{standard}} size. Number of denominations again increased to 15, with certain fractional denominations (15, 25, and 30 kopecks) being of dubious practical value. Maximum stamp denomination increased to 25 rubles.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to investigate, in vitro, the {{kinetics}} of release and permeation of caffeine, chosen as model drug, from bioadhesive transdermal films. These films are <b>not</b> <b>self-adhesive</b> but become adhesive when applied to wet skin. Permeation experiments were performed from films with different drug loadings using rabbit ear skin as barrier. In order to characterize the release kinetics of caffeine from the film, a polyethylene membrane, impregnated with isopropyl myristate was employed. The data obtained in the present work suggest that caffeine release from transdermal bioadhesive films was controlled either by the permeability characteristics of the skin or by the film itself, depending on drug loading. When drug loading is low (ie, caffeine is dissolved in the polymers constituting the film), the control resides in the skin. When caffeine loading exceeds its solubility in the film, the permeation profile is not linear, but shows a sort of burst effect in the early times of permeation, probably owing {{to the presence of}} solid drug and/or to a certain degree of “conserved supersaturation” in the solid phase...|$|E
50|$|Newer {{types of}} {{resuscitation}} electrodes are designed as an adhesive pad, which includes either solid or wet gel. These are peeled off their backing {{and applied to}} the patient's chest when deemed necessary, {{much the same as}} any other sticker. The electrodes are then connected to a defibrillator, much as the paddles would be. If defibrillation is required, the machine is charged, and the shock is delivered, without any need to apply any additional gel or to retrieve and place any paddles. Most adhesive electrodes are designed to be used not only for defibrillation, but also for transcutaneous pacing and synchronized electrical cardioversion. These adhesive pads are found on most automated and semi-automated units and are replacing paddles entirely in non-hospital settings. In hospital, for cases where cardiac arrest is likely to occur (but has <b>not</b> yet), <b>self-adhesive</b> pads may be placed prophylactically.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the study}} was to test whether or not the shear bond {{strengths}} of six self-adhesive resin cements to dentin and to glass-ceramic, 24 h and long-term-aged, are similar to the one of a conventional resin cement. METHODS: Human molars (N= 168, n= 12 per group) and silicabased glass-ceramic specimens (N= 168, n= 12 per group) were embedded in acrylic resin and randomly divided into 28 groups. The following resin cements were luted according to the manufacturers' instructions: Clearfil SA (CSA), G-Cem (GCM), SmartCem 2 (SMC), SpeedCEM (SPC), RelyX Unicem (RXU), RelyX Unicem 2 (RXU 2) and Panavia 21 (control group, PAN). Shear bond strength was measured initially (24 h of water storage 37 °C) and after aging (24, 000 thermal cycles, 5 / 55 °C). The failure types (adhesive, and cohesive) were evaluated after debonding. The shear bond strength values were analyzed using three-way and one-way ANOVA, followed by a post hoc Scheffé and two-sample Student's t-tests. RESULTS: RXU, RXU 2 and GCM showed similar after 24 h and aged shear bond strength to dentin as the control group. CSA, SMC and SPC exhibited significantly lower values. Before aging, none of the bond strength values to glass-ceramic differed significantly from the other. After thermocycling, GCM showed higher results to glass-ceramic than CSA, SMC, RXU 2 and the control group. Analyzing failure types after spontaneous debonding and shear bond test at dentin, solely adhesive failures were found, while at glass-ceramic only cohesive failures occurred. CONCLUSION: <b>Not</b> all <b>self-adhesive</b> resin cements can be a valid alternative to conventional resin cements in order to bond silica-based glass-ceramics to human dentin...|$|R
