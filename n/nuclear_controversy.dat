Most people still feel concerned about nuclear energy, and quite a considerable percentage of our sample expressed their readiness to protest against further expansion of the nuclear programme. Secondly, a vast majority of the sample expressed their willingness to accept a moderate expansion of the nuclear power programme, provided that a satisfactory {{solution to the problem of}} waste disposal can be achieved. Thirdly, with respect to public information programmes, our planning cell experiments proved that information containing arguments for or against nuclear power still has an impact on public attitudes. In spite of the fact that most people have developed a rather stable point of view in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>controversy,</b> and are usually not willing to change their overall attitude, the exchange of information during the planning-cell course resulted in a reshaping of some elements of participants attitudes...|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of an enduring multilateral security and peace mechanism for Northeast Asia and the furthering of regional economic cooperation {{have been identified as}} components of a final resolution of the North Korean <b>nuclear</b> <b>controversy</b> in the Six Party Talks among the United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea. Haggard and Noland argue that a central objective should be North Korea's integration into the world economy, encouraging its economic revival and the resolution of its chronic humanitarian problems, as well as embedding it in relations that could reduce the likelihood of future disruptive behavior. Reform and the international private sector's involvement in the country's economic renewal are key. Yet the North Korean tail should not wag the dog: To be fruitful and politically sustainable, the agenda must engage the interests of all six parties, not just those of North Korea. With progress stalled on more legalistic forms of regional integration, the authors suggest that the Economy and Energy Cooperation Working Group, created by the six parties in February 2007, could become the locus for wider economic cooperation and thus complement the security agenda for Northeast Asia. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the {{diplomatic}} language of UN resolutions has repeatedly been questioned for the excessive presence of vagueness. In an era of expanding international contacts between different legal systems, international institutions such as the UN are constantly faced with the need to overcome cultural divergences of their recipient countries. In order to meet these requirements, UN diplomatic texts may use vague words quite extensively. Such terms, whose meaning is very flexible, variable and strictly dependent on context and interpretation, have been defined by Mellinkoff (1963 : 21) as “weasel words”. The use of vague terms could be connected to the genre of diplomatic texts, as resolutions should be applicable to every international contingency. However, excessive vagueness could also lead to biased or even strategically-motivated interpretations of resolutions, undermining their legal impact and triggering conflicts instead of diplomatic solutions. This doctoral thesis is based on two main research aims: A first section aims at investigating on whether the use of strategic vagueness in Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq has contributed to the breakout of the second Gulf war instead of a diplomatic solution of the controversy. Using the qualitative Discourse-Historical approach (Wodak 2000) and quantitative analysis tools (Antconc and Sketch Engine), special attention is given to the historical/political consequences of vagueness used in that framework, and to the study of vague ‘weasel words’ (Mellinkoff 1963), modals, and adjectives contained in the corpus. The hypothesis of intentional vagueness is further reinforced through an analysis of the American legislation related to the outbreak of the war, to reveal how the U. S. has interpreted UN legislation and to understand the purposes and consequences of vague language contained in it. A second section of the study was originated by the desire to understand whether the same patterns would be used in resolutions relating to the Iranian 2010 nuclear crises revealing a relationship between the choice of vague linguistic features and intent to use intentional vagueness as a political strategy. The findings indicate that: - Vagueness in resolutions has triggered the Iraqi conflict instead of diplomatic solutions. - Similar patterns can also be found in resolutions relating to the Iranian 2010 nuclear crises: although being less vague than the resolutions relating to Iraq {{in order to avoid the}} same historical consequences, the legislation related to the Iranian <b>nuclear</b> <b>controversy</b> still suggests the UN intentional use of some vague linguistic patterns as a political strategy...|$|E

Hence, the observed decay timescale of the quasifission or fission process of even highly excited (EX greater than 50 MeV) transuranium and uraniumlike complexes should be rather long (of the order of attosecond) in spite of their very fast exponential decay timescale (of the order of zeptosecond) as measured by the <b>nuclear</b> techniques.

50|$|During the quasar controversies of the 1970s, {{these same}} astronomers were {{also of the}} opinion that quasars {{exhibited}} high redshifts not due to their incredible distance but rather due to unexplained intrinsic redshift mechanisms that would cause the periodicities and cast doubt on the Big Bang. Arguments over how distant quasars were took the form of debates surrounding quasar energy production mechanisms, their light curves, and whether quasars exhibited any proper motion. Astronomers who believed quasars were not at cosmological distances argued that the Eddington luminosity set limits on how distant the quasars could be since the energy output required to explain the apparent brightness of cosmologically-distant quasars was far too high to be explainable by nuclear fusion alone. This objection was made moot by the improved models of gravity-powered accretion disks which for sufficiently dense material (such as black holes) can be more efficient at energy production than <b>nuclear</b> reactions. The <b>controversy</b> was laid to rest by the 1990s when evidence became available that observed quasars were actually the ultra-luminous cores of distant active galactic nuclei and that the major components of their redshift were in fact due to the Hubble flow.|$|R

40|$|The world faces serious {{difficulties}} in obtaining {{the energy that}} will be needed in coming decades for a growing population, especially given the problem of climate change caused by fossil fuel use. This book presents a view of nuclear energy as an important carbon-free energy option. It discusses the nuclear fuel cycle, the types of reactors used today and proposed for the future, nuclear waste disposal, reactor accidents and reactor safety, nuclear weapon proliferation, {{and the cost of}} electric power. To provide background for these discussions, the book begins with chapters {{on the history of the}} development and use of nuclear energy, the health effects of ionizing radiation, and the basic physics principles of reactor operation. The text has been rewritten and substantially expanded for this edition, to reflect changes that have taken place in the eight years since the publication of the first edition and to provide greater coverage of key topics. These include the Yucca Mountain repository plans, designs for next-generation reactors, weapons proliferation and terrorism threats, the potential of alternatives to <b>nuclear</b> energy, and <b>controversies</b> about low-level radiation.

40|$|Nuclear energy {{currently}} plays {{a significant}} role in the energy economies of the US and other major industrial nations. Its future (several scenarios are described later) may involve significant growth in developing countries but controversy and debate surrounds future nuclear energy scenarios. In that ongoing debate, proponents and critics both appear to assume that nuclear technologies, practices and institutions will continue over the long term to look much as they do today. This paper discusses possible global and regional nuclear energy scenarios, and proposes changes in the global nuclear architecture that could reshape technologies, practices and institutions of nuclear energy over the coming decades. In doing so the array of choices available for exercising the nuclear energy option could be enlarged, making such a potential deployment less problematic and perhaps less controversial. How fuel discharged from power reactors is used and disposed of is a central issue of <b>nuclear</b> energy`s present <b>controversy</b> and central factor in determining its long-term potential. Many proponents of nuclear power, especially outside the US, believe that extracting all the energy available in reactor fuel [...] and, in particular, recovering the plutonium from discharged fuel for recycling through breeder reactors [...] is necessary to realize the technology`s ultimate potential as a source of virtually inexhaustible energy. Others consider the plutonium contained in discharged fuel to be a challenge to waste disposal and a potential proliferation risk.

More specifically, to demonstrate the important role nuclear energy has to play in Canada's future, a novel energy modeling tool, Canadian Energy Systems Simulator (CanESS), is employed. CanESS is a modeling platform with a huge database that assists an analyst in defining different energy scenarios by modifying the variables such as population and contributions of different energy sources to the overall production. The CanESS results clearly show that expansion of nuclear energy production is required to meet energy demand and simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To formally study strategic issues connected to the ongoing conflict over nuclear power production in Ontario, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is utilized. This flexible systems methodology is used to study the nuclear disputes that existed in Ontario at two key points in time: the fall of 2008 and spring of 2010. The results of the 2008 analysis, especially the sensitivity analyses, show that the only decision makers (DMs) involved in the conflict who hold real power are the Federal and Ontario governments, although {{at the beginning of the}} investigation the Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL) and the environmental groups had also been considered as participating DMs. The findings and information of the analysis in 2008, as well as an updated background for 2010, are used to perform another analysis in 2010. Meanwhile, their options or possible courses of action have also been changed. Again, at this stage the stable states of the game are found, and attitude analysis is carried out to obtain deeper insights about the dispute. The equilibria or potential resolutions of the 2008 analysis are found to be the transition states in the 2010 analysis. Specifically, it is discovered that if the Federal Government does have a negative attitude towards the Ontario Government, it is possible that the final outcome is a state that is among the least preferred states for both DMs. To formally study strategic issues connected to the ongoing conflict over nuclear power production in Ontario, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is utilized.
