Here, we implement for the first time biodegradable polymer with fluidic property for cancer therapy by investigating cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis/death, cycles of cancer cells as well as the anticancer drug efficacy. To achieve this, we prepared crosslinked and <b>non-crosslinked</b> copolymers of ɛ-caprolactone- co -D, L-lactide (P(CL- co -DLLA)). The tensile test showed the crosslinked P(CL- co -DLLA) substrate has the stiffness of 261 kPa while the loss modulus G’’ of the <b>non-crosslinked</b> substrate is always higher than the storage modulus G’ (G’’ / G’ = 3. 06), indicating a quasi-liquid state.

Buffered formaldehyde in pathology laboratories for tissue fixation is known to cause chemical modifications of biomolecules which affect molecular testing. A novel <b>non-crosslinking</b> tissue preservation technology, PAXgene Tissue (PAXgene), was developed to preserve the integrity of nucleic acids in a comparable way to cryopreservation and also to preserve morphological features {{comparable to those of}} formalin fixed samples. Because of the excellent preservation of biomolecules by PAXgene we investigated its pathogen inactivation ability and biosafety in comparison to formalin by in-vitro testing of bacteria, human relevant fungi and human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Guidelines for testing disinfectants served as reference for inactivation assays. Furthermore, we tested the properties of PAXgene for detection of pathogens by PCR based assays. All microorganisms tested were similarly inactivated by PAXgene and formalin except Clostridium sporogenes, which remained viable in seven out of ten assays after PAXgene treatment and in three out of ten assays after formalin fixation. The findings suggest that similar biosafety measures can be applied for PAXgene and formalin fixed samples. Detection of pathogens in PCR-based diagnostics using two CMV assays resulted in a reduction of four to ten quantification cycles of PAXgene treated samples which is a remarkable increase of sensitivity. PAXgene fixation might be superior to formalin fixation when molecular diagnostics and highly sensitive detection of pathogens is required in parallel to morphology assessment...|$|R

We compared the effects of routine formalin fixation with the <b>non-crosslinking,</b> alcohol-based Tissue Tek Xpress Molecular Fixative (TTXMF, Sakura Finetek), and cryopreservation as gold standard for molecular analyses. Formalin fixation introduced major changes into microarray gene expression data and led to marked gene-to-gene variations in delta-ct values of qRT-PCR. We found that qRT-PCR efficiency and gene-to-gene variations were mainly attributed to differences in the efficiency of cDNA synthesis as the most sensitive step. These differences could not be reliably detected by quality assessment of total RNA {{isolated from}} formalin-fixed tissues by electrophoresis or spectrophotometry. Although RNA from TTXMF fixed samples was as fragmented as RNA from formalin fixed samples, much higher cDNA yield and lower ct-values were obtained in qRT-PCR underlining the negative impact of crosslinking by formalin. In order to better estimate the impact of pre-analytical procedures such as fixation on the reliability of downstream analysis, we applied a qRT-PCR-based assay using amplicons of different length and an assay measuring the efficiency of cDNA generation. Together these two assays allowed better quality assessment of RNA extracted from fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues and should be used to supplement quality scores derived from automated electrophoresis.

Understanding of small-molecule diffusion in these systems {{is important in the}} contexts of controlled drug release; transport of nutrients (e. g., O 2 and growth factors) into the gel; and transport of cellular waste out of the gel. In this work, the diffusion coefficient of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) in <b>non-crosslinked</b> and crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels was measured using two NMR diffusion methods, CONVEX and the standard pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE). Pulsed field-gradient (PFG) NMR measurements provide the advantage of measuring the molecular selfdiffusion coefficient directly and without having to rely on the physical release of the solute, but are often difficult to perform in tissues and hydrated polymers due to a large water signal. CONVEX is a recently proposed diffusion method that alleviates this problem by means of NMR excitation-sculpting water suppression. In the measurements presented here, CONVEX results were superior to those from PGSE measurements with respect to every test applied, and enabled a reliable comparison of the diffusion coefficients of Phe in crosslinked and <b>non-crosslinked</b> hydrogels.

The collagen:PCL biocomposites having collagen:PCL (w/w) ratios of 1 : 4, 1 : 8, and 1 : 20 {{have been proven}} to be biocompatible materials to support both adult normal human epidermal Keratinocyte (NHEK) and mouse 3 T 3 fibroblast growth in cell culture, respectively, by Dai, Coombes, et al. in 2004. Films of collagen:PCL biocomposites were prepared using <b>non-crosslinking</b> method by impregnation of lyophilized collagen mats with PCL/dichloromethane solutions followed by solvent evaporation. To mimic the dermal/epidermal structure of skin, the 1 : 20 collagen:PCL biocomposites were selected for a feasibility study of a designed co-culture technique that would subsequently be used for preparing fibroblast/biocomposite/keratinocyte skin models. A 55. 3 % increase in cell number was measured in the designed co-culture system when fibroblasts were seeded {{on both sides of}} a biocomposite film compared with cell culture on one surface of the biocomposite in the feasibility study. The co-culture of human keratinocytes and 3 T 3 fibroblasts {{on each side of the}} membrane was therefore studied using the same co-culture system by growing keratinocytes on the top surface of membrane for 3 days and 3 T 3 fibroblasts underneath the membrane for 6 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunohistochemistry assay revealed good cell attachment and proliferation of both human keratinocytes and 3 T 3 fibroblasts with these two types of cells isolated well on each side of the membrane. Using a modified co-culture technique, a co-cultured skin model presenting a confluent epidermal sheet on one side of the biocomposite film and fibroblasts populated on the other side of the film was developed successfully in co-culture system for 28 days under investigations by SEM and immunohistochemistry assay. Thus, the design of a co-culture system based on 1 : 20 (w/w) collagen:PCL biocomposite membranes for preparation of a bi-layered skin model with differentiated epidermal sheet was proven in principle.

40|$|Filamin {{is a high}} {{molecular}} weight (2 x 250, 000) actin crosslinking protein found {{in a wide variety}} of cells and tissues. The most striking feature of filamin is its ability to crosslink F-actin filaments and cause ATP-independent gelation and contraction of F-actin solutions. The gelation of actin filaments by filamin involves binding to actin and crosslinking of the filaments by filamin self-association. In order to understand the role of filamin-actin interactions in the regulation of cytoskeletal assembly, two approaches were used. First, the structural relationship between self-association and actin-binding was examined using proteolytic fragments of filamin. Treatment of filamin with papain generated two major fragments, 90 Kd and 180 Kd. Upon incubation of the papain digest with F-actin and centrifugation at 100, 000 x g, only the 180 Kd fragment co-sedimented with F-actin. The binding of the 180 Kd fragment, P 180, was similar to native filamin in its sensitivity to ionic strength. Analytical gel filtration studies indicated that, unlike native filamin, P 180 was monomeric and did not self-associate. Thermolysin treatment of P 180 produced a 170 Kd fragment, PT 170, which no longer bound and co-sedimented with F-actin. These results suggested that filamin contained a discrete actin-binding domain. In order to locate the actin-binding domain, affinity purified antibodies to the papain and thermolysin sensitive regions of filamin were used in conjunction with filamin fragments generated by digestion with S. aureus V 8 protease and elastase. The results indicated that the papain and thermolysin cleavage sites were close together, and, most likely, within 10 Kd of one another. Taken together, these data suggest that filamin contains a discrete, internal actin-binding domain. The second approach was to use the <b>non-crosslinking</b> fragment P 180 to develop a quantitative assay of filamin-actin binding. The binding of (2 ̆ 714) C-carboxyalkylated P 180 was examined using the co-sedimentation assay. (2 ̆ 714) C-P 180 binding to actin was equivalent to that of unlabelled P 180 and exhibited comparable sensitivity of binding to changes in ionic strength. Within 5 min. of incubation the process had reached equilibrium. The specificity of binding was shown by the lack of binding of (2 ̆ 714) C-PT 170. The binding of (2 ̆ 714) C-P 180 was found to be a reversible and saturable process, with a K(,d) of 2 x 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 7) M.... (Author 2 ̆ 7 s abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

40|$|The Maillard {{reaction}} {{represents a}} complex series of processes, initiated on reaction of a carbonyl moeity with an amine. Amongst the {{vast array of}} products (advanced glycation end products, AGEs) are protein crosslinks, which can foml on reaction of a-dicarbonyls with lysine and arginine residues, to form molecular bridges between proteins. It is thought that these crosslinks affect the native function of the protein, due to a structural change in the protein, {{and they have been}} implicated in the progression of some age-related diseases. Little is known about the precise amino acid requirements for protein crosslinking. Thus, this thesis sought to determine which amino acids were critical for crosslinking to occur. A lysine containing (arginine-free) protein and an arginine-containing (lysine-free) protein were reacted with three a-dicarbonyl compounds, methyl glyoxal, glyoxal and diacetyl. It was demonstrated, {{for the first time in}} vitro, that an arginine residue is not essential for protein crosslinking to occur. Only an N-terminus or a lysine residue is required for crosslinking with the three a-dicarbonyls tested. A model protein, RNase A, which contains both lysine and arginine, was also incubated with the three dicarbonyls. Parallel measurements on crosslinking and activity were performed in order to test the assumption that crosslinking affects the function of the protein. To establish whether the loss funetion was a direct result of the crosslinking process, or a co-incident event, two previously reported crosslinking inhibitors, aminoguanidine and 3, 5 - dimethylpyrazole-l-carboxamidine, were included. The results demonstrated that although crosslinldng of RNase A could be inhibited by these compounds in the presence of adicarbonyl, the activity of RNase A was not necessarily preserved. Inhibition of crosslinking may not preserve the funetion of the protein, as evidenced by the RNase A incubated with methylglyoxal and 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole-l-carboxamidine. This loss in activity but inhibition of crosslinking may be explained by the presence of <b>non-crosslinking</b> AGEs that have formed on the protein, rendering it inactive. These results are significant when considering any approach to intervention of the Maillard reaction. Also examined was a recently-discovered enzyme, amadoriase I, which has been shown to reverse the early stages of the Maillard reaction under some experimental conditions. A time resolved assay was developed that allowed for accurate determination of ldnetic parameters and purification of amadoriasc I. By this method, amadoriase I was shown to have a Km of 11 μM for fructosyl propylamine, a known substrate, and a kcatlKm of 3. 25 x 10 5 both of which differ from previous literature reports. This assay was also used to successfully measure the activity of two mutants, H 357 N and S 370 A, which were created in order to determine which amino acid residues within amadoriase I are critical for catalysis. Both mutants were catalytically inactive, demonstrating their importance in amadoriase I. Finally, a second assay was developed in order to determine whether amadoriase I could act on a mildly glycated protein. Amadoriase I is reported not to turnover glycated protein, the physiologically relevant substrate. However, past experiments have involved conditions that favour formation of a heavily glycated protein, which may be inaccessible to amadoriase I. The novel assay method involved direct assessment of activity of the protein substrate, before and after treatment with amadoriase I. The results confirmed previous studies that amadoriase I could not use glycated protein as a substrate, even in the case of a mildly glycated protein. The assay method was also employed to search for a potential amadoriasc enzyme from a Pseudomonad which had been isolated from raw mille. The crude extract, however, did not show any deglycating activity as assessed by this assay and the time-resolved assay. The studies undertaken in this thesis will inform design of therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting or undoing the damaging effects of Maillard chemistry in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Challenges for wood-thermoplastic {{composites}} to {{be utilized}} in structural applications are to lower product weight {{and to improve}} the long-term load performance. Silane crosslinking of the composites {{is one way to}} reduce the creep during long-term loading and to im-prove the mechanical properties. In this study, silane crosslinked wood-polyethylene composites were pro-duced by reactive extrusion and subsequently manufac-tured into rectangular profiles. The silane crosslinked composites were stored in a sauna at 90 °C to increase the degree of crosslinking. The toughness of the silane crosslinked composites was significantly higher than for the <b>non-crosslinked</b> composites. Improved adhesion be-tween the wood and polyethylene phases is most likely the reason for the improved toughness of the crosslinked composites. There was no significant differ-ence in flexural modulus between the crosslinked and <b>non-crosslinked</b> composites. In addition, impact testing showed that the impact strength of the crosslinked com-posites was considerable higher (at least double) than the <b>non-crosslinked.</b> The effect of temperature on the impact strength of the composites indicated slightly higher impact strength at 30 °C than at 0 ° and at 25 °C, and then an incrase in impact strength at 60 °C. Crosslinking also reduced the creep response during short-term loading. Moreover, scanning electron mi-croscopy on the fracture surface of the crosslinked composites revealed good adhesion between the poly-ethylene and wood phases. POLYM. COMPOS., 27 : 184 – 194...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} polyelectrolyte gene delivery vectors that display good extracellular stability and are activated intracellularly to permit transgene expression. The strategy comprises covalent crosslinking of primary amines in poly-L-lysine/DNA complexes with a crosslinking agent that can later be cleaved by reduction. Crosslinked complexes maintained {{the same size}} and surface charge but showed increased stability against polyelectrolyte exchange with poly-L-aspartic acid. Surface modification with polyethyleneglycol improved solubility and masked their positive surface charge. Crosslinked complexes showed 10 -fold increased plasma circulation following intravenous administration to Balb/c mice. In the absence of chloroquine, the levels of transgene expression in B 16 F 10 murine melanoma cells were similar for crosslinked and <b>non-crosslinked</b> complexes, however, chloroquine selectively potentiated transgene expression by the <b>non-crosslinked</b> complexes. Cellular uptake of the complexes was the same, irrespective of crosslinking. Following microinjection into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes, or the cytoplasm or nucleus of Rat- 1 fibroblasts, crosslinked complexes mediated the same transgene expression as <b>non-crosslinked</b> complexes, indicating crosslinked complexes are rapidly reduced and activated intracellularly. We therefore hypothesize that the lower in vitro transfection activity of crosslinked complexes in the presence of chloroquine is due to reduced transfer from endosome to cytoplasm, mainly due to increased stability against destabilization by chloroquine. The extended systemic circulation together with triggered intracellular activation makes these complexes a promising system for targeted gene delivery in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{explore the}} {{potential}} of shell crosslinked micelle (SCM) as a drug carrier, the drug release behavior of poly(ε-caprolactone) -b-poly(acrylic acid) (PCL-b-PAA) SCMs was investigated. PCL-b-PAA was synthesized by ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone and atom transfer radical polymerization of tert-butyl acrylate, fol-lowed by selective hydrolysis of tert-butyl ester groups to acrylic acid groups. The resulting amphiphilic polymer was used to prepare SCMs by crosslinking of PAA corona via amidation chemistry. The drug release behavior of the SCMs was studied, using pyrene as a model drug, and was {{compared with that of}} <b>non-crosslinked</b> micelles, espe-cially below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). When the shell layers were crosslinked, the drug release behavior of the SCMs was successfully modulated at a controlled rate compared with that of the <b>non-crosslinked</b> micelles, which showed a burst release of drug within a short time...|$|E
