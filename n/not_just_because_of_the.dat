500|$|In The Globe and Mail, Canadian author Paul William Roberts {{praised the}} book, calling it [...] "... the most {{important}} use of printed word and post-consumer recycled fibres I have seen since Jérôme Deshusses's Délivrez Prométhée, 25 years ago." [...] Roberts explains, [...] " [...] has such a firm grasp of his goal that scarcely a word is extraneous... You feel you've read volumes, though, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> density of Wright's thoughts, but due to the crushing weight of the burden they carry. In prose that is balefully evocative and irreducibly precise..." [...] On the other hand, in the National Post review, Peter Foster gave a negative review, chiding Wright for [...] "not having the slightest clue about how economies work, or how, by their fundamental nature, markets are both moral and sustainable." [...] Foster ended his review by insulting Wright's intellect, [...] "What really needs some psychological excavation is Ronald Wright's mind, which carries a set of inflated, emotionally based moralistic assumptions derived from the structure of his primitive ignorance about markets and economics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andersen {{was awarded}} a gold disc for over one million sales of [...] "Lili Marleen" [...] It is {{thought that she was}} awarded her copy after the end of World War II. A copy of this {{particular}} gold disc owned by the [...] "His Masters Voice" [...] record company was discarded during the renovation of their flagship store on Oxford Street, London, during the 1960s where, hitherto, it had been on display. However, the disc was recovered and is now in a private collection. Nazi officials did not approve of the song and Joseph Goebbels prohibited it from being played on the radio. Andersen was not allowed to perform in public for nine months, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song but because of her friendship with Rolf Liebermann and other Jewish artists she had met in Zurich. In desperation, she reportedly attempted suicide.|$|E

2500|$|In stage three, {{birth rates}} fall due to various {{fertility}} {{factors such as}} access to contraception, increases in wages, urbanization, a reduction in subsistence agriculture, {{an increase in the}} status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes. [...] Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe. While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, {{it should be noted that}} contraceptives were not generally available nor widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then. It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> availability of contraceptives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{liquidity}} premium theory is {{an offshoot of}} the pure expectations theory. [...] The {{liquidity premium}} theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. [...] The market expectations hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory: ...|$|E
