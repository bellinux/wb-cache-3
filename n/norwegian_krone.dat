30|$|We {{apply the}} KwTP to the Norwegian fire {{insurance}} claims {{data for the}} years 1988 and 1990. Several authors have analyzed these data. See for example, Mdziniso and Cooray (2017) and related references in the paper. The 1988 Norwegian fire claims data consist of 827 fire insurance losses in thousand <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones,</b> ranging from 500 to 465, 365 thousand <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones.</b> The 1990 <b>Norwegian</b> fire data consist of 628 fire insurance losses in thousand <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones,</b> ranging from 500 to 78, 537 thousand <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones.</b> Data for both years are highly positively skewed. Using these data, Mdziniso and Cooray (2017) compared the performances of the Pareto (P), the 3 -paramater generalized Pareto (GP), the odd-Pareto (OP) and its extension (OP ∗), the 3 -parameter Burr, the exponentiated Pareto (EP), the exponentiated odd Pareto (EOP) and the odd generalized Pareto (OGP) distributions.|$|R

5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krone.</b> However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E
5|$|By 1996 Widerøe had {{undertaken}} {{a series}} of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission, including a reorganization of the aircraft operation division, the quality insurance division and the company's reporting systems. Another concern was that pilots did not follow the company's routines, resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which did not follow policy or did too many errors during observations. Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired. The company would further invest 40 million <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krone</b> (NOK) to improve safety.|$|E

50|$|On June 15th, 2017, {{it became}} {{possible}} {{to apply for}} a personalised license plate in Norway. The person registering the plate must complete an online application and pay a fee of 9000 <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones</b> (about US$1058). If the license plate is considered appropriate and the application is approved by an employee, the applicant will have to pay the fee within a certain time limit.

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of etoricoxib (90 [*]mg) relative to celecoxib (200 / 400 [*]mg), and the nonselective NSAIDs naproxen (1000 [*]mg) and diclofenac (150 [*]mg) {{in the initial}} treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Norway. Methods. A previously developed Markov state-transition model was used to estimate costs and benefits associated with initiating treatment with the different competing NSAIDs. Efficacy, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety, and resource use data {{were obtained from the}} literature. Data from different studies were synthesized and translated into direct costs and quality adjusted life years by means of a Bayesian comprehensive decision modeling approach. Results. Over a 30 -year time horizon, etoricoxib is associated with about 0. 4 more quality adjusted life years than the other interventions. At 1 year, naproxen is the most cost-saving strategy. However, etoricoxib is cost and quality adjusted life year saving relative to celecoxib, as well as diclofenac and naproxen after 5 years of follow-up. For a willingness-to-pay ceiling ratio of 200, 000 <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones</b> per quality adjusted life year, there is a > 95 % probability that etoricoxib is the most-cost-effective treatment when a time horizon of 5 or more years is considered.

5|$|On 27 September 1894, a {{committee}} {{was established to}} plan a branch from the Jæren Line to Ålgård. The following year, the committee recommended that a line be built branching from Orstad in Klepp, which would cost 348,000 <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krone</b> (NOK). Gjesdal Municipality offered NOK60,000 of the capital, {{on the condition that}} NSB would build and operate it. The state, on the other hand, wanted the line to be private. Private railways were often largely or entirely owned by municipalities, counties and the state, but would operate independent of NSB and the municipalities would carry the risk for operating deficits.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Package 3 is a {{political}} agreement between all the major projects on what to spend public funding for transport in Oslo and Akershus on. The agreement was made in 2007, and consists of 53 billion <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krone</b> (NOK), which will be shared between investments in road infrastructure, public transport infrastructure, and operating subsidies for Ruter. Financing comes from the state, the counties and from toll roads. The agreement states the major investments which are planned during a 20-year period.

5|$|Plans for a {{link between}} Bømlo and Stord were first {{launched}} as a pontoon bridge in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, the plans evolved into a triangular project. There was controversy surrounding the project, in particular from environmentalists. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1996, and construction started the following year. The bridges and link between Stord and Bømlo opened on 28 December 2000, while the tunnel opened on 30 April 2001. The link cost 1.8 billion <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krone</b> (NOK) after substantial cost overruns and will remain a toll road until 30 April 2013.|$|E

50|$|Nordstjernen {{was mainly}} {{used for the}} Hurtigruten coastal service and for cruises to the Svalbard archipelago. She was {{extensively}} refitted in 1980. From 2010 to 2012 she operated continuously on the Hurtigruten coastal service. In March 2012, she was withdrawn from the coastal service, {{and was replaced by}} MS Finnmarken, which came back in Hurtigruten service after it was in Australia. Hurtigruten was using her for Svalbard cruises in the summer of 2012. In November 2012, the ship was bought by Vestland Rederi AS. In connection with the sale, she was protected as a national heritage by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage (Riksantikvaren). Nordstjernens new home port is Bergen, as it was with her original owner Bergen Steamship Company (Det Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, BDS). From the end of 2012 to July 2013, she underwent an extensive restoration in Gdańsk, Poland, which was subsidized with 2.5 million <b>Norwegian</b> <b>krones</b> by Riksantikvaren. After coming back to Norway and taking part in the Fjordsteam festival in Bergen in the first days of August 2013, the new owner intends to market her as a hotel ship and for charter cruises. Finally she left Gdańsk on 9 November 2013. On her way back to Norway, she ran aground in the Karmsund strait on 11 November 2013. There was damage to the ship which was repaired at a dockyard in Ølensvåg, {{and at the end of}} January 2014, Nordstjernen left the dockyard. In 2015 and 2016, Hurtigruten will charter the ship they formerly owned and operate it again for Svalbard cruises in summer.|$|R
