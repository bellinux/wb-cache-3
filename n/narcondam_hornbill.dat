2500|$|From 1963 to 1977, he made eight {{trips to}} the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, {{accompanied}} by various people on different trips—colleagues from BNHS, researchers, assistants from the Zoological Survey of India, his son Akbar, etc. The aim of the expeditions to the archipelago of around 225 islands was to gather specimens of unknown subspecies, or of subspecies that were till then taxonomically documented as merely [...] "Andamans" [...] or [...] "Nicobars" [...] or [...] "Andamans and Nicobars". Several specimens were obtained during these trips and added to the collection of BNHS: The Otus alius (Nicobar scops owl), the Nicobar pigeon, the <b>Narcondam</b> <b>hornbill,</b> other birds, fruit bats, flying foxes, frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, etc. His observations {{were published in the}} Journal of the BNHS, which brought to light the nature of fauna in the islands.|$|E

50|$|Some human {{presence}} on the island has been noted recently and Since 2009 the <b>Narcondam</b> <b>hornbill</b> has had a Conservation status of endangered.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Narcondam</b> <b>hornbill</b> is an {{endangered}} hornbill that is endemic {{to the island}} of Narcondam. This bird {{is said to have}} evolved separately from the wreathed hornbill found in North-East India.|$|E
50|$|Previously, this {{hornbill}} {{was placed}} in the genus Aceros. It has often been lumped with the plain-pouched hornbill (R. subruficollis), and sometimes considered to include the <b>Narcondam</b> <b>hornbill</b> (R. narcondami) and the wreathed hornbill (R. undulatus) as subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Narcondam</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Rhyticeros narcondami) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the Bucerotidae family. It is endemic to the Indian island of Narcondam in the Andamans. Males and females have a distinct plumage. The Narcondom hornbill has the smallest home range {{out of all the}} species of Asian hornbills.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} by Allan Octavian Hume in 1873. The <b>Narcondam</b> <b>Hornbill</b> {{is placed in the}} genus Rhyticeros which is found only in Asia. Molecular evidence suggests that hornbills originated in Africa. Closely related species include species like wreathed hornbill (Rhyticeros undulatus) and Blyth's hornbill (Rhyticeros plicatus).|$|E
50|$|The bird is a {{resident}} of fairly open mixed forest that stretches {{over most of the}} island from sea level to about 700m. However most <b>Narcondam</b> <b>Hornbill</b> nests are found below 200m. For nesting and roosting, the bird prefers mature undisturbed forest with large trees. The favored nesting trees are Sideroxylon and Sterculia species.|$|E
50|$|Narcondam Island Wildlife Sanctuary is {{notified}} as {{a protected}} reserve {{by the government}} of India. It is also listed on the UNESCO's tentative Lists of World Heritage Sites. The island was notified as a sanctuary to protect and monitor the globally Threatened and highly endemic <b>Narcondam</b> <b>Hornbill</b> Aceros narcondami, which is restricted to this tiny island.|$|E
50|$|Ravi Sankaran studied several {{endangered}} {{birds of}} the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. His {{work on the}} <b>Narcondam</b> <b>hornbill,</b> Nicobar megapode and the edible-nest swiftlets aided the development of conservation management of these species. Ravi was also involved in a project Strengthening community conservation efforts in Nagaland: a programme to impart technical support on biodiversity conservation and livelihood options to communities, a collaborative programme between the Nagaland Empowerment of People through Economic Development, Kohima (NEPED), and SACON, in collaboration with other organisations such as Kalpavriksh, Pune; Ecosystems India, Guwahati; Aranayak, Assam; ATREE, Bangalore; andNature Conservation Foundation, Mysore.funded by Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Mumbai.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Narcondam</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> {{is a small}} hornbill at 66 cm long. The sexes {{differ in}} plumage. The male has a rufous head and neck, black body and upper parts glossed with green. Females are all black. There is a bluish white throat patch and the tail is white in both sexes. Both sexes have a bill with a few folds on the upper side towards {{the base of the}} upper mandible. The skin around the eye is bluish. The iris of the male is orange red while the female has an olive brown with a pale yellow ring. The bill is waxy and the furrows of the casque are brownish. The bill is pinkish towards the base. The legs are black and the sole is yellow.|$|E

50|$|Narcondam {{is a tiny}} {{volcanic}} island, {{not connected}} to land mass, terrestrial mammalian fauna is absent. However, Nicobar Flying Fox Pteropus faunulus and Narcondam Small Flying Fox Pteropus hypomelanus {{are the most common}} mammals on this island. Among reptiles, Andaman Dwarf Gecko Cnemaspis kandiana, widely distributed in Andaman and Malay Archipelago, is also found on Narcondam Island. The Andaman Day Gecko Phelsuma andamanense, is also restricted in distribution to the Andaman group (Daniel 2002). The Common Amphibious Sea Snake Laticauda laticaudata, confined to the Bay of Bengal and Nicobar Island, is seen here, while the Andaman Water Monitor Varanus salvator andamanensis is the only large predator on the island and is a threat to the <b>Narcondam</b> <b>Hornbill,</b> especially its young ones.As Narcondam Island is remote and difficult to reach, there have been only eight visits by ornithologists to date: Osmaston (1905), Baker (1927), Abdulali (1971,1974), Hussain (1984), Vijayan and Sankaran, (2000) and Yahya and Zarri (2000, 2002a).|$|E
50|$|Several of {{his early}} {{publications}} were based on studies of the bird collection at the BNHS. These include the extension {{in the range of}} Dinopium shorii in the Eastern Ghats, the validity of Otus bakkamoena stewarti, an extension of the range of Asian palm swift Cypsiurus parvus infumatus (north of the Brahmaputra river) In the course of his travels he noted several range extensions including the brown-winged kingfisher from Chilka, Cetti's warbler from Bharatpur, purple cochoa from Mussoorie (western most limit). His finding of the broad-tailed grassbird from Point Calimere opens up the possibility of the species in Sri Lanka, from where an old questionable specimen record exists. In 1972 he visited Narcondam Island to study the <b>Narcondam</b> <b>hornbill,</b> capturing two adult hornbills and their chicks. The two hornbill chicks were taken to Bombay, the male died on the ship journey while the female escaped in Madras, never to be found. The chicks lived for about 6 years, the female showed aggression to the male sibling and an injury to the male resulted in death. Based on his observations he suggested that the species was closer to Rhyticeros plicatus than to Rhyticeros undulatus. In the summer of 1977 he and Salim Ali, went to Bhutan to look for the yellow-rumped honeyguide. He noted the opportunistic behaviour of the honeyguides, making use of the attacks of Vespa mandarinia on the hives of Apis dorsata laboriosa. He also saw a honeyguide in the Valley of Flowers which he suggested should belong to the little-known subspecies radcliffi described by Allan Octavian Hume. He described a new subspecies of the bay owl Phodilus badius (P. b. ripleyi) in 1977. In 1983 he surveyed the black-necked crane in Ladakh. He published several observations made during ringing camps, particularly at Point Calimere. In 1992 he wrote about the distribution and status of the white-winged tit in Kutch.|$|E
