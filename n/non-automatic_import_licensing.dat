50|$|Industrial goods today {{account for}} {{over a third of}} Argentine exports. Motor {{vehicles}} and auto parts are the leading industrial export, and over 12% of the total merchandise exports. Chemicals, steel, aluminum, machinery, and plastics account for most of the remaining industrial exports. Trade in manufactures has historically been in deficit for Argentina, however, and despite the nation's overall trade surplus, its manufacturing trade deficit exceeded US$30 billion in 2011. Accordingly, the system of <b>non-automatic</b> <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> was extended in 2011, and regulations were enacted for the auto sector establishing a model by which a company's future imports would be determined by their exports (though not necessarily in the same rubric).|$|E
50|$|Imports began {{recovering}} {{sharply in}} 2003, {{as both the}} purchasing power of the peso and domestic demand increased, and, despite this, from 2003 to 2011 the nation's merchandise trade balance recorded a cumulative US$115 billion in surpluses. These surpluses were bolstered as much by growing exports as by a marked recovery in terms of trade for Argentina, which by 2010 had improved 40% over the level prevailing in the 1990s. The nation's perennial trade deficit in manufactures widened during this expansion, however, and exceeded US$30 billion in 2011. Accordingly, the system of <b>non-automatic</b> <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> was extended in 2011, and regulations were enacted for the auto sector establishing a model by which a company's future imports would be determined by their exports (though not necessarily in the same rubric). Domestic production grew to supply {{the majority of the}} Argentine market in a number of important rubrics historically dominated by imports amid these changes, including diverse manufactures such as information technology, major appliances, footwear, and farm machinery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is two-fold; to examine {{developments}} in trade and investment policy regimes in Malaysia following the on-set of the financial crisis, using the Trade Policy Review Malaysia 2001 of the WTO as a reference point; and to evaluate the Review in terms of the objectives of the WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism as set out in the Marrakesh Agreement. It is found that, by and large Malaysia has managed to come out of the crisis without compromising on its long-standing commitment to maintaining a relatively open trade and investment policy regime by the regional standards. However, there are some disturbing post-crisis developments, which deserve scrutiny in a future Review. These include increase in the degree of dispersion of tariff rates because of high tariff peaks relating to a few product lines, increased reliance on <b>non-automatic</b> <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> to regulate imports of a significant number of products which directly compete with domestic production by public sector enterprises, and unexplained delays in meeting commitments under the General Agreement o...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) and specifically <b>non-automatic</b> <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> schemes {{has been a}} source of intense debate to date, despite prohibitive provisions enshrined in multilateral trade agreements. The main aim of this case study research was to assess the consistency of the implementation of the Namibian Horticultural Market Share Promotion Scheme (MSPS) under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The second segment of this study looked at identifying problems associated with the implementation of the scheme, and proposed policy recommendations that are responsive to competitive challenges facing industries in the 21 st century. The study used a triangulation research methodology and a rating scale was used to conduct the assessment with respect to all the applicable provisions covered in the WTO Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures. A reliability test was conducted using the SPSS statistical software in order to measure the credibility of the data (scores). In this regard, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was very instrumental in measuring the degree of data consistency. Moreover, the relative frequency distribution was used to analyse the quantitative data, while an Interrelationship Diagram was used to analyse qualitative data...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{discussions on}} U. S. trade {{policies}} suggest that import quotas should be auctioned {{to ensure the}} U. S. Treasury acquires the quota rent. However, studies estimating the potential benefits have ignored important details of import quota regimes and have assumed perfect competition and no exporter retaliation. We explore these three issues with an application to the U. S. cheese import quota regime. We show that when features of the U.
