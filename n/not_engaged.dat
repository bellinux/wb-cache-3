5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate {{generated by the}} suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E
5|$|Judge Cavanaugh granted summary {{judgment}} to the defendants on {{the freedom of}} speech claim based on their earlier motions, holding that Heffernan had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in protected speech so his rights could not have been violated. In 2012, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Cavanaugh's ruling and remanded the case to him with instructions that he was to allow Heffernan to present his freedom of association claim and consider the facts from the jury trial when reconsidering the summary-judgment motions.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Jutland, Active again {{became a}} {{destroyer}} leader and escorted {{the main body}} of the Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August 1916. By the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the Dover Patrol and was present during two battles with German destroyers, but was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in either. She was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1918 and was based in Gibraltar for the rest of the war. The sister ships were both sold for scrap in 1920–21.|$|E
5|$|When the {{division}} was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training {{took the form}} of increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14–16June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, investable funds became {{increasingly}} concentrated {{in a single}} institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to rent-seeking. Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets {{was a result of}} crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E

5|$|By July 27 all the Mun'gyong divide was in North Korean {{possession}} and their units were {{moving into the}} valley of the upper Naktong in the vicinity of Hamch'ang. Prisoners taken at the time and others captured later said that the NK 1st Division suffered 5,000 casualties in the struggle for control of the divide, including the division commander who was wounded and replaced. The NK 13th Division, following the 1st, suffered about 500 casualties below Mun'gyong, but otherwise it was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> during this period. The NK 15th Division, one of North Korea's weaker divisions which consisted mostly of inexperienced youth, moved on Sangju. It was part of a concentrated attack by North Korean troops aiming to push the UN forces south before they had time to organize an effective defensive line.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1916, Active {{was assigned to the}} Grand Fleet and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland later in the year. Shortly afterwards, she was briefly assigned as the flotilla leader of the 4th DF and escorted {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August. By the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the Dover Patrol and was present during two battles with German destroyers, but was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in either. Active was based in Ireland by {{the beginning}} of 1918, but was soon transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and based in Gibraltar for the rest of the war. The ship was reduced to reserve in 1919 and was sold for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|Following the Italian {{declaration}} of war against the Central Powers on 23 May 1915, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets. Sankt Georg {{took part in the}} operation; escorted by a pair of torpedo boats, she shelled the city of Rimini. She damaged a railroad bridge and was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> by Italian forces. Thereafter, the Austro-Hungarians returned to their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought. For most of the war, Sankt Georg was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though she was too slow to operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations.|$|E

5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when <b>not</b> <b>engaged,</b> so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used is unique to the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Utah beach landings, however, were {{relatively}} uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha. The filmmakers chose {{to begin the}} narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the strategic inaccuracy of an impossible mission that {{could easily have been}} pursued from the other beach area. In addition, one of the most notable of the operational flaws is the depiction of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, 100 miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division, part of Mission Boston.|$|E
5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E

5|$|U.S.-Soviet {{relations}} took a {{turn for}} the worse with the Soviet’s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, evidently for use as a bargaining chip in response to the August 30, 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent Gennadiy Zakharov. Since Daniloff was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in espionage, Matlock advised taking a hard line with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E
5|$|Achilles was {{refitting}} in May 1916 and did {{not participate}} in the Battle of Jutland although both of her surviving sisters did. Warrior was heavily damaged by German capital ships during the battle, losing 71 crewmen killed and 36 wounded. She took on a lot of water and foundered the following morning after her crew was evacuated. The 2nd Cruiser Squadron was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> during the battle {{and did not}} fire a shot. Achilles was assigned blockade duties in the North Sea after the battle and sank the German raider Leopard in early 1917. Both of the surviving ships were briefly transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in late 1917 for convoy escort duties before returning home in early 1918. Achilles began a lengthy refit in February 1918 while Cochrane was based in Murmansk in mid-1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She became stranded in the Mersey on 14 November 1918 and broke in two. The wreck was broken up in place by June 1919. Achilles, the last surviving sister, became a training ship in late 1918 and was sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, she was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. On 28 August 1914 she was present, but played no significant role, in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, Several months later, the Germans bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 16 December and the 1st LCS was escorting Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers in response when it encountered a German light cruiser and a half-flotilla of torpedo boats. Falmouth was not in range to engage before the squadron turned away to follow the battlecruisers. On 28 December, the ship was transferred to the 3rd LCS and became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier, the squadron commander. During the Battle of Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915, the squadron escorted the Grand Fleet, but was <b>not</b> <b>engaged.</b> After the battle was over, the squadron escorted the battlecruisers on their way back to Cromarty, Scotland.|$|E

On the right all the now rallied elements of D'Érlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the allied line. Of these, Pégot's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket {{was shot in the}} face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.|$|E
