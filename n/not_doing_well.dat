25|$|Jeb Stuart also {{happened}} to be at Culpeper Court House that day, attending a court-martial. He decided to ride out to witness the battle, taking with him his artillery chief, Maj. John Pelham. They arrived to find that Lee's men were <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well,</b> outnumbered two to one and facing a well-positioned artillery battery. It {{was the first time}} in the war that a Confederate cavalry regiment (the 2nd Virginia) had fled in the face of a Union charge.|$|E
25|$|Marshall {{made his}} Test début in the Second Test at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He {{immediately}} developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar {{due to his}} aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5–13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{positive}} {{news about the}} Old Post Office Pavilion, it was <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well.</b> GSA imposed conditions on the 1983 renovation that left the retail pavilion looking like an office building rather than a shopping mall. There was also too little retail space, the retail space was poorly configured due to the architectural design of the building, and GSA refused to allow any storefronts on the exterior that would signal that there was retail or restaurants inside. The pavilion's revenues were generated in about equal parts from tourists, local office workers, and local residents. Although most retailers were making money, revenues fluctuated wildly on a seasonal basis. Restaurants {{had a difficult time}} earning money, and turnover among them was high.|$|E
25|$|As Don Imus {{had already}} been the morning show host at WNBC, WFAN left the show in place when they took over the frequency. WFAN's {{original}} morning show on 1050 was hosted by Greg Gumbel. The show was a straightforward sports show, but was <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> in the ratings. At {{the time of the}} switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea of bringing on board a host that appealed to a broader audience would get more people to try the station out. WFAN also benefitted from the inertia from Imus's fans who were used to tuning into 660kHz on weekday mornings to listen. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance; for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character Billy Sol Hargus from Shea Stadium moments after taking over the 660 frequency. Imus slightly altered his show for his new employer, adding sports updates and replays of last night's big plays. Discussions of sports stories that crossed over to general interest were also featured on the program, although Imus also kept many of his regular comedy bits that were not sports-related.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Quake's mindset {{when the}} episode picks up, actress Chloe Bennet said, [...] "She's <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well.</b> She's {{had a rough}} couple of years. She's taking some time and I think it's kind of her way of {{protecting}} the people that she cares about. Everyone she's gotten close to, something bad has happened to them. It's her weird, selfish way of protecting them". This, the character's assertion in the episode to Ghost Rider that she [...] "deserves to die". Concerning the character Fitz keeping the android Aida a secret from his girlfriend Simmons, actor Iain De Caestecker said, [...] "They're trying to maintain a healthy relationship while being secret undercover spies that have secret assignments ... it's with the best intentions, keeping stuff from her, I suppose. It's going to get interesting. Lying is a strong word. I'm just keeping stuff from" [...] her.|$|E

500|$|Around 1990, the {{brothers}} {{decided to create}} a game that would appeal to adults. Among their goals were believable characters, a non-linear story, and for the player as protagonist to make ethical choices. The Millers pitched the game to Activision under the title The Gray Summons; Robyn recalled that Activision told them to stick to children's games. At {{the time of the}} rejection, Robyn recalled they were <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> financially—"we were eating rice and beans and government cheese and that [...] our diet." [...] Facing the end of their game-producing career, Sunsoft approached the Millers to create an adult-oriented game. Like with The Gray Summons, the Millers wanted their game to have a non-linear story with believable characters and an ethical choice. They also wanted to produce a game with far more impressive graphics than their previous efforts—at one point they considered making the game entirely hand-drawn. Finally, they knew their story would be a mystery.|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{dramatic}} changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing. At the start of 1949, {{all but one of the}} major magazines in the field were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, almost all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. [...] Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market, several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years; Tops in Science Fiction was one of the last of these. [...] The publisher, Love Romances Inc., also published Planet Stories, and Malcolm Reiss, Planets editorial director, decided to try to take advantage of the backfile of stories and artwork from Planets 14 years of publication. [...] He may have been inspired by the example of Fantastic Story Magazine, which was published by Standard Magazines as a vehicle to reprint their extensive backfile of science fiction. [...] If so, he was evidently not aware that by 1953 Fantastic Story was <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> financially.|$|E
500|$|By 1980, the duo's {{respective}} solo {{efforts were}} <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well.</b> To help alleviate New York's economic decline, concert promoter Ron Delsener {{came up with}} the idea to throw a free concert in Central Park. Delsener contacted Simon with the idea of a Simon & Garfunkel reunion, and once Garfunkel agreed, plans were made. The Concert in Central Park, performed September 19, 1981, attracted more than 500,000 people, at that time the largest-ever concert attendance. Warner Bros. Records released a live album of the show that went double platinum in the US. A 90-minute recording of the concert was sold to Home Box Office (HBO) for over $1 million. The concert created a renewed interest in the duo's work. They had several [...] "heart-to-heart talks," [...] attempting to put past issues behind them. The duo planned a world tour, kicking off in May 1982, but their relationship grew contentious: for the majority of the tour, they did not speak to one another. Warner Bros. pushed for them to extend the tour and release an all-new Simon & Garfunkel studio album.|$|E

500|$|In July 2012, it was {{reported}} that Andrew Stanton was developing a sequel to Finding Nemo, to be titled Finding Dory, with Victoria Strouse writing the script, and the film scheduled to be released in 2016. The same day the news of a potential sequel broke, Stanton called into question the accuracy of the reports. The message said, [...] "Didn't you all learn from Chicken Little? Everyone calm down. Don't believe everything you read. Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling". According to the report by The Hollywood Reporter published in August 2012, Ellen DeGeneres was in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory. In September 2012, Stanton confirmed, saying, [...] "What was immediately on the list was writing a second Carter movie. [...] When that went away, everything slid up. [...] I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to Carter <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well,</b> but only in its timing, but not in its conceit". In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.|$|E

He noted, however, that the backgrounds looked decent considering the poor design of the CD-i's hardware.

2500|$|While {{full-time}} work hinders schooling, {{empirical evidence}} is varied {{on the relationship}} between part-time work and school. [...] Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance. [...] On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home. [...] In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children, often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood.|$|E
2500|$|The restyled Packard {{line for}} 1955 showed Teague's keen eye for detail {{and his ability}} to produce {{significant}} changes based on limited budgets. However, the company was <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> following the purchase of struggling Studebaker Corporation in 1954. The last Teague design for Packard was the Executive, introduced mid-1956 and derived from the Clipper Custom, launched just as sales of the luxury Packard line collapsed. Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor, plus a new Packard and Clipper lineup for 1957 that would have followed the general lines of the Predictor. The design was stillborn when the Detroit Packard operations were shut down completely in mid-1956. Lacking funds for all-new models, the Studebaker-Packard Corporation had to make use of existing and economical Studebaker designs. Working with little time and money, the stopgap 1957 Studebaker-based Packard models became known as [...] "Packardbakers." [...] The 1957 Packard Clipper, popularly derided as [...] "a Studebaker wearing Packard makeup", was designed largely by Teague, and was intended as a temporary stopgap to keep the brand going until the company's fortunes improved and a [...] "real" [...] Packard model could again be made.|$|E

2500|$|By 1880 the Staten Island Railway {{was barely}} operational, {{and as a}} result New York State sued, through Attorney General Hamilton Ward, to have the company {{dissolved}} in May of the same year. The suit said that the Company had become [...] "insolvent in September 1872, to have then surrendered its rights to others, and have failed to exercise those rights." [...] The legal proceedings proceeded for a while after an injunction was obtained, which restrained the creditors of the railway company from proceeding against it until after the determination of the suit of the people. While the railroad was <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well,</b> it become the centerpiece for a plan to develop the island by a Canadian, Erastus Wiman. In 1867, Wiman arrived in New York to oversee the main office of Dun, Barlow, and Company in New York. Wiman {{became one of the most}} prominent residents of Staten Island after locating his residence in a mansion on the island. He was dubbed the [...] "Duke of Staten Island," [...] and was interested in developing Staten Island, and recognized that in order to so successfully he would need to build a coordinated transportation hub with connections to New York City and New Jersey. In order to develop the island as he sought fit he incorporated The Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company on March 25, 1880. It was officially incorporated on April 14, 1880.|$|E
2500|$|... 2003 was {{the year}} of the Samsung Cup. It was his first big title in three years. Cho was known for <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>well</b> in {{international}} tournaments, so when he progressed to the quarter-finals of the 8th Samsung Cup, many were surprised. The only time before the Samsung Cup in which he won an international cup was back in 1991 when he won the Fujitsu Cup because his opponent, Qian Yuping, fell ill. The quarter-final was a historical game for Cho, as {{it was the first time}} he beat Cho Hunhyun since 1981. The final four were left now. Other than Cho, the other players who were Hu Yaoyu, Xie He, and Park Young-Hoon. All were under the age of 21, while Cho was 47 at the time. In the semi-final, in which pairings were selected by lot, he played Hu Yaoyu. He was lucky, winning by only half a point. Park had beaten Xie He, so Cho and Park met in the final. Park won the first game by 4 and a half points, but Cho came back and took the next two games. The last game was clearly worse for Cho until Park slipped up on move 180 and Cho was able to cut off a lot of stones. This led to Park resigning. Cho won his first international title in 12 years, and only his second of all time.|$|E
