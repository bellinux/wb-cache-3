Also in 1965 Air Spain began operating from the airport and a smaller terminal, which today is terminal B was planned to be built. Passenger numbers had increased rapidly, reaching 2 million in 1965. A second runway was also to be built. It was to be built parallel to the existing one, and work began on it in 1970. Two years later, terminal B went into service, and the second runway opened in 1974.|$|E

25|$|The {{ministry}} {{proposed in}} 1972 that six airports {{be built in}} northern Troms and Finnmark. The first five airports opened on 1 August 1974, but construction of Honningsvåg Airport was delayed. The reason was the difficult terrain and wind conditions and more time was needed to find a suitable site. In addition to Valan, sites at Kåfjord and Skarsvågfjellet was considered, {{in addition to the}} use of helicopters. Valan was chosen despite the poor conditions, which force approach to take place in a semi-circle. Construction cost 17.4 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK15.8 million was covered by the state and the remainder by Nordkapp Municipality and Finnmark County Municipality. The airport opened on 30 June 1977; it was initially operated by the municipality with the state operating the air <b>navigation</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data grids are {{becoming}} increasingly important for sharing distributed data and information in collaborative environments. This paper presents a CORBA-based Distributed Resource Navigation system consisting of Resource Agents and <b>Navigation</b> <b>Service.</b> The former one is a middleware that provides applications with a uniform set of operations to access heterogeneous distributed storage resources including file systems and database systems, and archival storage systems. The latter one is a metadata <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> which is utilized by DRN to improve data publishing and lookup efficiency. Experiments show that CORBA-based DRN can provide the essential data virtualization <b>services,</b> and that <b>Navigation</b> <b>service</b> and Resource agent have a good performance with concurrent accesses...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1990s, the FAA started {{pressuring}} {{the military to}} turn off SA permanently. This would save the FAA millions of dollars every year in maintenance of their own radio navigation systems. The amount of error added was [...] "set to zero" [...] at midnight on May 1, 2000 following an announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton, allowing users access to the error-free L1 signal. Per the directive, the induced error of SA was changed to add no error to the public signals (C/A code). Clinton's executive order required SA to be set to zero by 2006; it happened in 2000 once the U.S. military developed a new system that provides the ability to deny GPS (and other <b>navigation</b> <b>services)</b> to hostile forces in a specific area of crisis without affecting {{the rest of the}} world or its own military systems.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} impact on {{outcomes}} of a stroke <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> for stroke survivors and their families, over a six month period, in comparison to usual care. BACKGROUND: Stroke is a serious health concern and affects both stroke survivors and their caregivers. Caregivers often report feeling inadequately prepared for the caregiving role, lacking information and support, and sometimes experiencing difficulty in communication with health professionals. A stroke <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> may potentially help stroke survivors and their families through the stroke continuum. Evaluating this service could provide a rationale for implementing the intervention in the New Zealand healthcare system. DESIGN: A controlled mixed-methods intervention study was implemented using a comparison group to evaluate a stroke <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> from acute rehabilitation services and into the community. METHODS: Convenience sampling recruited six stroke families. Data were collected at baseline, three and six months post-stroke <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> implementation. Quantitative data were collected using the Modified Caregiver Strain Index, Health Service Use and Short Form- 36 questionnaires. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. FINDINGS: An over-arching theme of ‘Easing the Journey’ was identified with three themes: 1) Walking alongside, 2) Informing and pursuing avenues and 3) Connecting pathways and bridging gaps. Overall {{no statistically significant differences}} were found between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Families using the stroke <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> felt more supported, informed and found their interaction with health professionals improved with the intervention in comparison to usual care...|$|R
