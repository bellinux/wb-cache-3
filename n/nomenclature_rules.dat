500|$|The {{taxonomy}} and {{naming of}} both M. cerebralis, and of myxozoans in general, have complicated histories. [...] It was originally thought to infect fish brains (hence the specific epithet cerebralis) and nervous systems, though it soon {{was found to}} primarily infect cartilage and skeletal tissue. [...] Attempts to change the name to Myxobolus chondrophagus, which would more accurately describe the organism, failed because of <b>nomenclature</b> <b>rules.</b> [...] Later, the organisms previously called Triactinomyxon dubium and T. gyrosalmo (class Actinosporea) were found to be, in fact, triactinomyxon stages of M. cerebralis, {{the life cycle of}} which was expanded to include the triactinomyxon stage. [...] Similarly, other actinosporeans were folded into the life cycles of various myxosporeans.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{identified}} and {{named by the}} French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829 after receiving a specimen that was listed as having been collected in the [...] "Southern seas". This holotype specimen was apparently taken near the coastline of Tasmania, Australia. Four junior synonyms were subsequently placed on the species, with Castelnau applying both S. insularis and S. terra-reginae, Thiollière applying S. diadoi and Whitley S. ciliata diadoi to the species. All of these names are invalid under the ICZN <b>nomenclature</b> <b>rules,</b> which states that the first correct naming is the one to be used. Many of these synonyms were applied due to confusion over S. ciliata and the nearly identical, closely related species S. analis. The species was also misidentified as S. gracilis, a synonym of S. maculata, the trumpeter whiting; and also S. bassensis, the southern school whiting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch in 1787 {{under the name of}} Zeus ciliaris, described from the type specimen collected from Surat, India. Following this description, a number of naturalists reclassified the species as the taxonomic literature of fishes grew in volume. Lacepède was the first to do so, giving it the name Gallus virescens, which although he intended to be a new genus, had been assigned to a group of birds previously. [...] Rafinesque examined Gallus virescens in 1815, subsequently creating a new genus for the species; Alectis, and thus making Gallus virescens the type species, despite it being a junior synonym. A number of biologists also renamed the species completely, with Alectis crinitus and Carangoides ajax applied to the species. All names except Alectis ciliaris are now considered defunct under the ICZN <b>nomenclature</b> <b>rules.</b> Interestingly enough, the original genus name of Zeus has now also been applied to an ascomycete fungi.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the famed French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1833 based on specimens collected off Waigio, Indonesia; {{one of which was}} designated to be the holotype. He named the species Caranx melampygus, placing the species in the jack genus Caranx which had been established by Bernard Lacépède three decades previously. The name's specific epithet is derived from the Latin translation of [...] "black spotted". This is still currently considered the correct placement, however later authors placed in other now defunct genera (Carangus and Carangichthys) which has since been deemed incorrect, and the original classification stands. The species was independently redescribed and named seven times after Cuvier's initial description, with all of these names assigned between 1836 and 1895. The names C. bixanthopterus and C. stellatus were often used in the literature, and were variably classed as synonyms of C. melampygus or valid individual species after their naming. This confusion culminated in Yojiro Wakiya concluding in 1924 they should be treated as separate species. The taxonomy of the species was finally revised by Frederick Berry in 1965, who resolved these two names as being synonymous with C. melampygus, and placed several other names in synonymy with C. melampygus. Under ICZN <b>nomenclature</b> <b>rules,</b> these later names are deemed junior synonyms of C. melampygus and rendered invalid. The species has not been included in any detailed phylogenetic studies of the Carangidae.|$|E

5000|$|This {{species is}} part of the order Hymenoptera, which {{consists}} of bees, wasps, ants, and sawflies. O. bicornis is the current scientific name for this bee, although it was formerly known as O. rufa. In 1758, Linnaeus described the male of this species under the name Apis rufa and described the female as a separate species Apis bicornis. In 1802 Kirby recognised that A. bicornis and A. rufa were the same species and he named this species Apis bicornis. Subsequently, the opinion was accepted that A. rufa was the correct specific name, because it appeared directly before bicornis in the systema naturae. The use of the name rufa does not comply with the International Code of Zoological <b>Nomenclature's</b> <b>rules</b> which mean that this form of [...] "line priority" [...] does not apply and that the decision of the first revising author, Kirby, must be followed. Thus the correct scientific name for the species is Osmia bicornis, although O.rufa is still widely used. This bee {{is a member of the}} family Megachilidae, which mostly consists of solitary bees, and is among 11 species of Osmia identified in Britain. The three subspecies of O. bicornis include O. b. bicornis, O. b. cornigera, and O. b. fractinoris.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} a conserved name is the dinosaur genus name Pachycephalosaurus, which was {{formally}} described in 1943.

By the usual rules, the genus Tylosteus has precedence and would normally be the correct name. But the International Commission on Zoological <b>Nomenclature</b> (ICZN) <b>ruled</b> that the name Pachycephalosaurus was to be given precedence and treated as the valid name, because it was in more common use and better known to scientists.|$|R
5000|$|Before the 1950s, {{there was}} some {{controversy}} over which group of organism should have the genus name Apus.

50|$|The {{origins of}} Magnolia × wieseneri are obscure, {{but it is}} thought to have been a result of {{deliberate}} cross-breeding between the parent species some time in the 19th century or earlier in Japan, where it is known as Gyo Kusui or Ukesaki Oyama-renage. It entered European horticulture at the 1889 Paris Exposition, where it was on display at the Japanese Court stand. From here, it was collected for Kew Gardens, and named Magnolia × watsonii by Joseph Hooker in 1891. However, Élie-Abel Carrière had named a specimen six months earlier in 1890 after a Mr Wiesener, who had purchased a plant from a Japanese horticulturist at the Trocadéro {{at the same time as}} the Exposition, and hence the French botanist's name was preserved under International Code of Botanical <b>Nomenclature</b> naming <b>rules.</b>|$|R
