5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E
5|$|One of Sikorski's {{political}} goals {{was the creation}} of a Central and Eastern European federation, starting with the Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation. He saw such an organization as <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> smaller states were to stand up to traditional German and Russian imperialism. That concept, although ultimately futile, gained some traction around that time, as Sikorski and Edvard Beneš from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year. On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to generał broni. In March 1941 he visited the United States; he would visit USA again in March and December 1942.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E

5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered Petrović to use Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski {{to capture}} Fiume, across the Rječina river from Sušak, but {{the order was}} soon {{rescinded}} due to the deteriorating situation in the flanking 4th Army. In the afternoon of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> {{the situation on the}} immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the {{chief of staff of the}} headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back.

5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be <b>necessary.</b> <b>If</b> a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

5|$|On 5 April the Allies sent {{notes to}} both Norway and Sweden warning {{that they would}} take any action <b>necessary</b> <b>if</b> the Germans were allowed to use the neutral countries' {{territory}} to their advantage. Koht responded with a speech {{in which he said}} that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanesthe British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans. The next day the Allies decided to launch a mining operation on the Norwegian coast, and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway. Shortly before the mining was carried out, Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated, and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force. The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality, and, following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader Vidkun Quisling to Hitler in December 1939, began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway. Following the Altmark Incident, Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway. In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940, the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments, while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost. Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war. The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior.|$|E
