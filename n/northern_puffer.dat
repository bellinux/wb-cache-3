50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>puffer</b> inhabits bays, {{estuaries}} {{and protected}} coastal waters at depths of 10 - 183 m {{in the northwest}} Atlantic. It ranges from Florida (USA) to Newfoundland (Canada).|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>puffer</b> feeds {{primarily}} on shellfish, and occasionally on finfish. Using its beak-like mouth it can extract shellfish from their shells and sometimes break the shells {{to obtain a}} meal.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the life cycle of the <b>northern</b> <b>puffer.</b> They spawn from May through August in shallow, nearshore waters. The female lays {{adhesive}} eggs that attach to the sandy or muddy bottom, and the male guards the eggs until they hatch.|$|E
50|$|Not all puffers are {{necessarily}} poisonous; {{the flesh of}} the <b>northern</b> <b>puffer</b> is not toxic (a level of poison can be found in its viscera) and it is considered a delicacy in North America. Takifugu oblongus, for example, is a fugu puffer that is not poisonous, and toxin level varies wildly even in fish that are. A puffer's neurotoxin is not necessarily as toxic to other animals as it is to humans, and puffers are eaten routinely by some species of fish, such as lizardfish and tiger sharks. Also, Japanese fish farmers have grown nonpoisonous puffers by controlling their diets.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} puffers inhabit {{the waters of}} the IRL. In {{addition}} to S. testudineus, three other Florida puffer species belong to the genus Sphoeroides are found in the IRL. These include: the <b>northern</b> <b>puffer,</b> S. maculatus; the southern puffer, S. nephelus; and the bandtail puffer, S. spengleri. The <b>northern</b> <b>puffer</b> is olive-gray with many black spots and 6-7 vertical gray areas on the side (Robins & Ray 1986). It has a black bar between the eyes and prickles on the skin of the tail. S. maculatus grows to a maximum length of 36 cm, slightly larger than the checkered puffer. The southern puffer is similar to S. maculatus, but lacks the black spots on the sides and dorsal surface. Instead, pale tan rings or semicircles cover this area, and larger dark spots are variable on the sides. Dark slashes are sometimes present on {{the lower half of the}} cheek, and prickles are found on the posterior ventral surface near or at the anus. The bandtail puffer is usually dark brown above, with pale sides and white underneath. A row of large brownish black spots extends from the chin to the caudal-fin base on the lower sides, separate from the dark dorsal color. Many tan, fleshy tabs are present near the rear of the body. At only 18 cm, the reported maximum size for S. spengleri is much less than that of the checkered puffer.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of pufferfish species are toxic {{and some are}} among the most poisonous vertebrates in the world. In certain species, the internal organs, such as liver, and sometimes their skin, contain tetrodotoxin and are highly toxic to most animals when eaten; nevertheless, the meat of some species is considered a delicacy in Japan (as 河豚, pronounced as fugu), Korea (as 복 bok or 복어 bogeo), and China (as 河豚 hétún) when prepared by specially trained chefs who know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity. Other pufferfish species with nontoxic flesh, such as the <b>northern</b> <b>puffer,</b> Sphoeroides maculatus, of Chesapeake Bay, are considered a delicacy elsewhere.|$|E

It has tiny jet-black pepper spots (about 1 mm in diameter) scattered over most of pigmented surface, particularly evident on cheeks. Lower sides of the body have a row of black, elongate, bar-like markings. A small dorsal fin is set far back near the tail. Sphoeroides maculatus, like others in the puffer family, [...] "puffs up" [...] into a ball in self-defense by inhaling air or water into a special chamber near its stomach.

50|$|Fisheries {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} in the 1970s by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to determine the fishery composition and life stages of estuarine fish using this specific bay. Sixty-six species were caught during these studies and, as in the Barnegat system, the catches were dominated by forage species, with bay anchovy and Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) being very abundant. The top ranked fish by their relative abundance were: bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), sea herring (Clupea harengus), white perch (Morone americana), <b>northern</b> <b>puffer</b> (Sphoeroides maculatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), and striped anchovy (Anchoa hepsetus). Commercial fisheries activities include the harvest of northern quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), white perch, winter flounder, and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). The bay is an important spawning and nursery area for blue crab. The area between Graveling Point and the Wading River tributaries supports large eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) beds, {{many of which are}} considered extremely productive seed beds.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and <b>northern</b> <b>puffer.</b> There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|E

Other investigators have also noticed decreased blood/plasma calcium content of fish treated either with aldrin (Bano 1982; Singh et al. 1996), malachite green (Srivastava et al. 1995), cadmium (Larsson et al. 1981; Muramoto 1981; Giles 1984; Kuroshima 1987; Pratap et al. 1989, Rai and Srivastav Ajai 2003), propoxur (Singh et al. 1997), formothion (Singh et al. 1997), chlorpyrifos (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 a), deltamethrin (Srivastav Ajai et al. 1997 b), methyl-parathion (Mishra et al. 2004), cypermethrin (Mishra et al. 2005) or botanical pesticide (Prasad et al. 2011). Contrary to it, an elevation of plasma calcium concentrations has also been reported by other workers from the fish exposed to various toxicants (Sastry and Sharma 1978; Bansal et al. 1979; Sharma et al. 1982).
