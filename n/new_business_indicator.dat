Measures for the presence and size of public academic institutions have more of {{an effect on the}} formation of innovative <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> than <b>indicators</b> that reflect the quality of these institutions. We find relatively weak evidence for interregional spillovers of these effects.

The index of economic activity draws information from a range categories of data covering output, income, employment, external demand and credit. A statistical method is used to extract a single factor from this panel of variables which is common to each of the series and explains most of the variation across all the data. The index captures the steep decline in economic activity {{at the height of the}} financial crisis and the recovery which has taken place since 2010. The weak external environment and subdued domestic demand since the beginning of 2013 is reflected in a decline in the index over recent months.

Comparing the “ease of doing business” rank with the BEEPS based index it turns out that Romania is poorly ranked in both data sets. In a similar vein, the Baltic States are among the most business-friendly CEE economies in both sources. However, Lithuania forms a notable exception because it is highly ranked in the doing <b>business</b> <b>indicators</b> but among the group of more business-unfriendly economies when looking at the BEEPS data.

40|$|Business cycles {{studies are}} in great {{importance}} {{because of their}} considerable impact {{on all of the}} economical sectors regarding in the national as well in the global aspect. Since the business cycles are fluctuations of the aggregated economical activity of the nations, it is impossible to be analyzed just by particular economical indexes or indicators. Set of indicators of the economical activity, which can present the economical situation in the real time on the reliable way, need to be developed. The true stage of the actual business cycle could be shown by such a set of indicators and its behaviour can be used to predict the next business cycle’s stages in a short-term {{as well as in the}} long-term period. The potentialities of using <b>business</b> <b>indicators</b> based on <b>business</b> surveys information to determine and predict business cycle’s stages in retail trade in Bulgaria during the last years in a reliable way are analyzed in the paper.

Official <b>business</b> <b>indicator</b> <b>Business</b> Climate and main macro economic index Index of Sales Income in retail trade are involved in the analyses.

40|$|Croatian {{business}} surveys (BS) {{are conducted}} in the manufacturing industry, retail trade and construction sector. In all of these sectors, manager´s assessments of liquidity are measured. The aim of the paper was {{to form a new}} composite liquidity <b>indicator</b> by including <b>business</b> survey liquidity measures from all three covered economic sectors in the Croatian economy mentioned above. In calculating the leading indicator, a factor analysis approach was used. However, this kind of indicator does not exist in a Croatia or in any other European economy. Furthermore, the issue of Croatian companies´ illiquidity is highly neglected in the literature. The empirical analysis consists of two parts. In the first part the new liquidity indicator was formed using factor analysis. One factor (representing the new liquidity indicator; LI) was extracted out of the three liquidity variables in three economic sectors. This factor represents the new liquidity indicator. In the second part, econometric models were applied in order to investigate the forecasting properties of the <b>new</b> <b>business</b> survey liquidity <b>indicator,</b> when predicting the direction of changes in Croatian industrial production. The quarterly data used in the research covered the period from January 2000 to April 2013. Based on econometric analysis, it can be concluded that the LI is a leading indicator of Croatia’s industrial production with better forecasting properties then the standard liquidity indicators (formed in a manufacturing industry) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Several intra- and inter-domain {{quality of}} service (QoS) {{provisioning}} mechanisms for IP networks have been researched and developed using Differentiated Services (DiffServ) technology. However, the incremental efforts needed to manage DiffServ networks from a business-oriented viewpoint have received relatively little attention.

We provide a rich model of SLA and <b>business</b> <b>indicators</b> as well as reasonable mapping functions that define, with key degrees of importance, the impact of <b>business</b> <b>indicators</b> over service management policies. <b>Business</b> and service <b>indicators</b> are used to control static and dynamic admission of services.

40|$|The <b>business</b> survey <b>indicator</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} statistics that the Bank publishes every month. Its reputation is due to the reliability it has demonstrated over several decades in reflecting the pattern of economic activity in the country and in the euro area every month. The indicator is compiled on the basis of the responses to the monthly business survey that the Bank has arranged with enterprises in Belgium since 1954. Almost twenty years after the last methodological revision of the indicator in 1990, the Bank decided that it was now desirable to review its method of calculation again. This article presents the key characteristics of the <b>business</b> survey <b>indicator,</b> its practical applications and the new method of calculation applied since April 2009. This methodological revision gradually became necessary owing to the extension of the survey in 1994 to business-related services, the results of which were not included in the general <b>business</b> survey <b>indicator</b> until this methodological change. The old <b>business</b> survey <b>indicator</b> had also exhibited some undesirable short-term fluctuations. The methodological changes have been kept to a minimum and only concern the calculation of the synthetic curves, with an amended selection of questions that are included in the synthetic curves for each industry and by incorporating the business-related services curve into the overall synthetic <b>business</b> <b>indicator.</b> These changes aim to strengthen the correlation between the indicator and GDP growth, to reduce the undesirable short-term volatility and to maintain its early response. business cycle, <b>business</b> survey, leading <b>indicator,</b> correlation, GDP...|$|R

The dynamics of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation is evaluated comparing the influence of regional determinants in two time periods - 2001 - 2002 and 2011 - 2012. The Czech Republic is the area of interest. Empirical results indicate the coexistence of persistent and changing influences of regional determinants on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. The quality of the entrepreneurial environment, industrial diversity and population change have a persistent and positive impact on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. There is also a positive connection between agglomeration economies and <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. The increasing influence of agglomeration economies is indicated. The presence of foreigners is not a statistically significant determinant of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation in the 2001 - 2002 models. Nevertheless, the importance of this determinant is increasing. It is suggested that unemployment vulnerability has a negative impact on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation but has increasing importance on entrepreneurship in disadvantaged regions.
