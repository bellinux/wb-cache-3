40|$|Abstract. The {{reconstruction}} of the vertical electrondensity pro®le is a fundamental problem in ionospheric tomography. Lack of near-horizontal ray paths limits the information available on the vertical pro®le, so that the resultant image of electron density is biased in a horizontal sense. The vertical pro®le is of great importance as it a€ects {{the authenticity of the}} entire tomographic image. A new method is described whereby the vertical pro®le is selected using relative total-electroncontent measurements. The new reconstruction process has been developed from modelling studies. A range of background ionospheres, representing many possible peak heights, scale heights and electron densities are formed from a Chapman pro®le on the bottomside with a range of topside pro®les. The iterative reconstruction process is performed on all of these background ionospheres and a <b>numerical</b> <b>selection</b> criterion employed to select the ®nal image. The resulting tomographic images show excellent agreement in electron density when compared with independent veri®cation provided by the EISCAT radar. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperimentally Assisted Molecular Modelling (EAMM) is an {{original}} approach for predicting {{the structure of}} organic micro-crystals and deducing their habit {{in the presence of}} various solvents and additives. It is applied here in the case of n-octylamino-nitrobenzoxadiazole (nOA-NBD), a fluorescent compound. This general approach is first of all described and validated by its blind application to three known and closely-related crystals. Then, the whole process is applied to predict the molecular crystal generated by n-octylamino-NBD, including the molecule conformation, its structure (cell parameters, molecular packing, X-ray powder diagrams) and its theoretical plus actual habits {{in the presence of a}} solvent (p-xylene) and two additives (acetic acid and n-dodecane). The conformation of the predicted molecule is validated by comparison with two similar molecules embedded in observable crystals. Then, the choice between two proposed structures (with the same energy and two equiprobable packings) is based on the comparison between experimental and re-computed X-ray powder diffraction diagrams, and also on the interpretation of an actual TEM image in the light of the proposed cell parameters. This choice is confirmed by the comparison between the vapour-grown face development (proposed by the BFDH or the attachment energy models) and the actual face development in a pure solvent. Finally, the actual habit deduced from comparing the crystal attachment energy with the adsorption energy of solvent or additive molecules is validated by SEM images of NBD micro-crystals in presence of the solvent alone or in presence of both additives. In conclusion, the EAMM approach appears to be a decisive tool for quickly simulating structural and habit properties of the molecular crystals, accessible or not by experimentation. Thus, a <b>numerical</b> <b>selection</b> of molecules becomes possible in view of deriving organic materials with predetermined properties, such as the fluorescence properties of the compound considered in the present study...|$|E

40|$|The article {{objective}} is to review the basic design parameters of space capsule (SC) to select a rational shape at {{the early stages of}} design. The choice is based on the design parameters such as a volume filling factor (volumetric efficiency of shape), aerodynamic coefficients, margin of stability, and centering characteristics. The aerodynamic coefficients are calculated by a numerical method based on approximate Newton's theory. A proposed engineering technique uses this theory to calculate aerodynamic characteristics of the capsule shapes. The gist of the technique is in using a developed programme to generate capsule shapes and provide numerical calculation of aerodynamic characteristics. The accuracy of the calculation, performed according to proposed technique, tends to the results obtained by analytical integral dependencies according to the Newtonian technique. When considering the stability of the capsule shapes the paper gives a diagram of the aerodynamic forces acting on the SC in the descent phase, and using the aerodynamically-shaped SC "Soyuz" as an example analyses a dangerous moment of flow at adverse angles of attack. After determining a design center-of-mass position to meet the stability requirements it is necessary at the early stage, before starting the SC layout work, to evaluate the complexity of bringing the center-of-mass to the specified point. In this regard have been considered such design parameters of the shape as a volume-centering and surface-centering coefficients. Next, using the above engineering technique are calculated aerodynamic characteristics of capsule shapes similar to the well-known SC "Soyuz", "Zarya 2 " and the command module "Apollo". All calculated design parameters are summarized in the table. Currently, among the works cited in foreign publications concerning the contours of winged configuration of the type "Space Shuttle" some papers are close to the proposed technique. Application of the proposed engineering technique allows a multi-fold increasing rate of the capsule shape analysis at an early designing stage. Reviewed design parameters can be further considered as the optimality criteria when choosing the SC shape, and the engineering technique can be further extended to a full-fledged programme on the <b>numerical</b> <b>selection</b> of the optimal aerodynamic solutions with continuously transferred results for engineering development of the SC. </p...|$|E
