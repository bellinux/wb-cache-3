40|$|In view {{of recent}} mass {{stranding}} of Ziiphids in the Bahamas (March, 2000) and the rrecovery of three Ziphiids between the 14 th and 25 th March {{on the west}} coast of Ireland I have provided a brief review of Ziphiidae in Ireland for the ECS Workshop on Beaked whales. Data on strandings were obtained from O'Riordan (1972) and Berrow and Rogan (1997), trends in sightings from Evans (1991) and recent strandings from the Irish Naturalists ' Journal and the IWDG database. There are confirmed records of five species of Ziphiid, the <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>whale</b> Hyperoodon ampullatus and four members of the genus Ziphius. <b>Northern</b> <b>Bottlenosed</b> <b>Whale</b> Hyperoodon ampullatus (Forster) There have been 26 stranded bottlenosed whales reported occurring all around the Irish coast. Ten of these (38 %) occurred between Counties Louth and Dublin on the east coast and it is the only Ziphiid regularly reported from the Irish Sea. Stendall (1926) reported a Bottlenose Whale in Belfast Lough with a smashed jaw possibly due to a ship's propeller and two strandings (one in 1998 and one in 1999) were live strandings. In addition the carcass found on Wexford in 1985 was reported as fresh. The live stranding on Bere Island in 1998 was {{one of a group of}} three, the other two were refloated...|$|E

5000|$|Not much {{information}} is available about group composition of beaked whales. Only three species have been studied in any detail: <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales,</b> Blainville's beaked whales, and Baird's beaked <b>whales.</b> Female <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> appear to form a loose network of social partners with no obvious long-term associations. In contrast to females, some male <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> have been repeatedly recorded together over several years, and possibly form long-term associations. Studies of Blainville's beaked whales have revealed groups usually consist {{of a number of}} females, calves, and/or juvenile animals.

5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the <b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The <b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> is mainly killed when it accidentally swims {{too close to the}} beach and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, at {{total of}} 53 {{cetaceans}} were killed: 48 pilot <b>whales</b> and 5 <b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> which stranded by themselves {{and after that}} were butchered for food.|$|R
50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the life {{histories}} of beaked whales. The oldest one ever recorded was 84 years for a male Baird's beaked whale, and the oldest recorded female Baird's beaked whale is 54 years. For all other beaked whale species studied, the highest recorded age is between 27 and 39 years. Sexual maturity is reached between seven and 15 years of age in Baird's beaked <b>whales</b> and <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales.</b> Gestation varies greatly between species, lasting 17 months for Baird's beaked whales and 12 months for the <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale.</b> No data are available on their reproductive rates.|$|R

5|$|The {{stranding}} of the <b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík.

This combined evidence leads us to hypothesize that these whales may make greater use of deep portions of the water column than any other mammal so far studied. Many of the recorded dives of the tagged animals were to, or close to, the sea £oor, consistent with benthic or bathypelagic foraging. A lack of correlation between dive times and surface intervals suggests that the dives were predominately aerobic...|$|R

40|$|Wimmer and Hal Whitehead Abstract: A small, {{apparently}} isolated, {{and endangered}} population of ~ 130 <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> (Hyperoodon ampullatus Forster, 1770) is {{found on the}} Scotian Slope south of Nova Scotia, Canada. Virtually all previous informa-tion on these animals {{had come from the}} Gully, a large submarine canyon where the <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> can be reliably found. A ship survey along the 1000 m depth contour in 2001 showed <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> only in the Gully, Shortland canyon (50 km east of the Gully), and Haldimand canyon (100 km east of the Gully). Studies in 2002 reconfirmed the presence of the whales in these other canyons, although densities were about 50 % lower than in the Gully. Photo-identifications showed that individuals moved between the Gully and Shortland and Haldimand canyons over periods from days to years, with mean stays in any canyon of about 22 days. However, the population was not fully mixed: at least some individuals had preferences for particular canyons. The sex ratios were similar in all can-yons, but males had higher rates of movement between canyons. These results are consistent with the expectations of optimal foraging theory, when the primary resource for females, deep-water squid of the genus Gonatus Gray, 1849, is more temporally stable than the primary resource for males, which is assumed to be receptive females. Haldimand and Shortland canyons are clearly important habitat for this species, and should receive appropriate protection.

50|$|Beaked {{whales are}} one of the least known groups of mammals because of their deep-sea habitat, mysterious habits, and {{apparent}} low abundance. Only three to four of the 22 species are reasonably well-known. Baird's and Cuvier's beaked whales were subject to commercial exploitation, off the coast of Japan, while the <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> was extensively hunted {{in the northern part of}} the North Atlantic late in the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
40|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> are {{characterized}} as extremely uncommon or rare in {{waters of the}} U. S. Atlantic Exclusive Economic Zone. The two sightings of three individuals constituted less than 0. 1 % of the 11, 156 cetacean sightings in the 1978 - 82 CeTAP surveys. Both sightings were in the spring, along the 2, 000 m isobath (CeTAP 1982). <b>Northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> are distributed in the North Atlantic from Nova Scotia to about 70 E in the Davis Strait, along {{the east coast of}} Greenland to 77 E and from England to the west coast of Spitzbergen.

40|$|Although <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> {{were the}} most heavily hunted beaked whale, we have little {{information}} about this species in its remote habitat of the North Atlantic Ocean. Underwater anthropogenic noise and disruption of their natural habitat may be major threats, given the sensitivity of other beaked whales to such noise disturbance. We attached dataloggers to 13 <b>northern</b> <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> and compared their natural sounds and movements to those of one individual exposed to escalating levels of 1 – 2 [*]kHz upsweep naval sonar signals. At a received sound pressure level (SPL) of 98 [*]dB re 1 [*]μPa, the whale turned to approach the sound source, but at a received SPL of 107 [*]dB re 1 [*]μPa, the whale began moving in an unusually straight course and then made a near 180 ° {{turn away from the}} source, and performed the longest and deepest dive (94 [*]min, 2339 [*]m) recorded for this species. Animal movement parameters differed significantly from baseline for more than 7 [*]h until the tag fell off 33 – 36 [*]km away. No clicks were emitted during the response period, indicating cessation of normal echolocation-based foraging. A sharp decline in both acoustic and visual detections of conspecifics after exposure suggests other whales in the area responded similarly. Though more data are needed, our results indicate high sensitivity of this species to acoustic disturbance, with consequent risk from marine industrialization and naval activity.
