50|$|A {{requester}} may {{request to}} restrict the claims with respect to one or more, but not all, Contracting States. The limitation would then result in claims being different in different Contracting States. This may however only be done in some special cases, one of them being {{in order to avoid}} conflict with national prior rights (a <b>national</b> <b>prior</b> <b>right</b> is a national patent filed before the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent subject to the limitation procedure but published after the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent).|$|E
5000|$|... "Limitation {{proceedings}} {{would enable}} patentees to narrow down the protection conferred by a patent post-grant {{by means of}} a simple, quick and inexpensive administrative procedure. For example, {{it may be necessary to}} limit a granted patent if, because of prior art which was not known during the examination proceedings or <b>prior</b> <b>national</b> <b>rights</b> not taken into account in these proceedings, the extent of the protection conferred is too great. Using the limitation procedure, patent proprietors may themselves reduce the extent of the protection claimed in a manner which is binding, and thus generally preclude disputes over the validity of a patent. Postgrant limitation is also in the public interest, because it limits the protection claimed by the patentee with effect for the general public. This creates legal certainty and facilitates access by competitors to the freely available prior art." ...|$|R

50|$|The UK Intellectual Property Office radically {{altered the}} way UK {{national}} trade mark applications were examined in October 2007. Previously, UK {{national trade mark}} applications underwent a full examination both on absolute (distinctiveness) and relative (<b>prior</b> <b>rights)</b> grounds. In October 2007, the search which formed {{a part of the}} examination of applications on <b>prior</b> <b>rights</b> grounds became an advisory search in a similar fashion to the Community Trade Mark system, bringing into force Section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1994. No longer will the UKIPO unilaterally be able to prevent the grant of a UK national trade mark application on the basis of an earlier pending application or prior registration for a conflicting mark. Instead, {{it will be up to}} the proprietor of that right to oppose the application when it advertised for opposition purposes, although the UKIPO will still advise owners of conflicting application where citations including their marks have been sent to the applicant to assist them in making an opposition.|$|R
