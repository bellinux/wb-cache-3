25|$|Some {{marine organisms}} bear {{more than one}} lens; for {{instance}} the copepod Pontella has three. The outer has a parabolic surface, countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed. Another copepod, Copilia, has two lenses in each eye, arranged like those in a telescope. Such arrangements are rare and poorly understood, but represent an alternative construction. Multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders, which have a refractive cornea (discussed next): these have a <b>negative</b> <b>lens,</b> enlarging the observed image by up to 50% over the receptor cells, thus increasing their optical resolution.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. Myopia can {{be induced}} in {{chickens}} {{by having them}} wear either <b>negative</b> <b>lenses</b> (lens-compensation myopia [LCM]) or diffusers (form-deprivation myopia [FDM]), whereas posi-tive lenses cause lens-compensation hyperopia (LCH). These three conditions were compared with respect to (i) their early time course and (ii) the effect of two manipulations of the lighting. METHODS. Longitudinal changes in ocular dimensions and re-fractive error were measured in chicks maintained under three different conditions: (i) wearing either 215 D lenses or dif-fusers in a normal light/dark cycle; (ii) wearing either 115 D lenses, 215 D lenses, or diffusers with brief periods of strobo-scopic lights {{at the beginning and}} end of the dark period; (iii) wearing either 16 D lenses, 26 D lenses, or diffusers with the nights interrupted by brief periods of white light. In addition, scleral and choroidal proteoglycan synthesis was measured in eyes that wore positive <b>lenses,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>lenses,</b> or diffusers for 3 hours followed by different periods of darkness. RESULTS. (i) The time course of the changes in axial length over the first 72 hours was significantly faster in LCM than in FDM. Indeed, the diffusers did not begin to significantly affect the total length of the globe for 3 days, although the vitreous chamber had deepened after 9 hours, because the choroid thinned extremely rapidly (within 1 hour) with either diffusers or <b>negative</b> <b>lenses.</b> (ii) Scleral proteoglycan synthesis was higher in eyes with <b>negative</b> <b>lenses</b> than in those with diffusers at 11 hours, but the reverse was true at 27 hours. (iii) Brief periods of stroboscopic light attenuated FDM more than LCM. (iv) In contrast, interruption of the nights by brief periods of light attenuated LCM more than FDM. (v) Neither lighting manipulation affected LCH. (vi) Choroidal proteoglycan syn-thesis decreased similarly with 3 hours of wearing either dif-fusers or <b>negative</b> <b>lenses.</b> CONCLUSIONS. Although both <b>negative</b> <b>lenses</b> and diffusers cause similar increases in the rate of ocular elongation, the responses differ in time course and in the effect of manipulations of the daily lighting.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether gait alterations due to monocular spherical lens blur were a safety strategy or driven by lens magnification. METHODS: Adaptive gait and visual function were measured in 10 older adults (mean age, 74. 9 ± 4. 8 years) with the participants' optimal refractive correction and when monocularly blurred with ± 1. 00 DS and ± 2. 00 DS lens over the dominant eye. Adaptive gait measurements {{for the lead}} and trail foot included foot position before the raised surface, toe clearance of the raised surface edge, and foot position on the raised surface. Vision measurements included binocular visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereoacuity. RESULTS: Equal levels of monocular positive and <b>negative</b> spherical <b>lens</b> blur led to very different stepping strategies when negotiating a raised surface. Positive blur lenses led to an increased vertical toe clearance and reduced distance of the lead foot position on the raised surface. <b>Negative</b> <b>lenses</b> led to the opposite of these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that step negotiation strategies were driven by the magnification effect provided by the spherical lenses. Steps appeared closer and larger with magnification from positive lenses and further away and smaller with minification from <b>negative</b> <b>lenses</b> and gait was adjusted accordingly. These results suggest that previously reported adaptive gait changes to monocular spherical lens blur were not safety strategies as previously suggested but driven by lens magnification. The significance of these findings in terms of prescribing large refractive changes in frail older patients is discussed...|$|R

METHODS. mRNAs enriched in retina–retinal pigment epithelium–choroid tissues from 3 -, 7 -, and 14 -day form-deprived chick eyes were isolated by differential display technique with cDNA library screening. Neuroendocrine-specific protein A and C were cloned in control and form-deprived eyes. mRNA and protein levels, with respective regional localizations, were examined by Northern blot, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses, respectively. RESULTS. The isolated clone included an insert with a sequence homologous to both chick neuroendocrine-specific proteins A and C. The increases in mRNA and protein levels were confirmed by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Immunohistochemical localization of neuroendocrine-specific proteins A and C was detected in the layer of photoreceptor inner segments, presumably in the cone cells.

40|$|AbstractIt was {{recently}} demonstrated that chromaticity could affect eye growth and refractive development in guinea pigs but it remained unclear whether correction with spectacle lenses could balance these effects and how retinal responses change with different spectral compositions of light. Three illumination conditions were tested: blue, {{red and white}} light. Animals were raised without or with monocular spectacle lenses from three to seven weeks of age. Luminance electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded to explore retinal responses with the different spectral compositions. In our special colony of pigmented guinea pigs, characterized by residual hyperopia, spontaneous myopia and poor emmetropization, red light induced early thinning of the choroid and relative myopia, compared to white light. Effects of red light could not be suppressed if positive spectacle lenses were worn. ERGs showed that red light failed to elicit robust retinal responses. Blue light inhibited axial eye growth, even when animals were reared with <b>negative</b> <b>lenses.</b> Intensity-matched blue and white light elicited similar a-waves but different b-waves, suggesting that the wavelength of light affects visual control of eye growth through different processing in the inner retina. We hypothesize that blue light might stimulate preferentially the ON pathway to inhibit myopia induced by <b>negative</b> <b>lenses,</b> at least in guinea pigs...|$|R

Unlike contact lenses, glasses do not only correct, but also induce optic distortions. In the {{scientific}} literature, it has often been assumed that people who wear corrective glasses instantaneously account for these distortions when they put their glasses on. We tested this assumption and found that, when people switched between their contact lenses and their glasses, they made the errors that one would predict based on the optics. This shows that people are not immediately adapted to their own glasses when they put them on...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Young chicks {{can adjust}} their eye growth to {{compensate}} for both imposed hyperopia and myopia (using negative and positive spectacle lenses); the rate of eye elongation increases in the former and slows in the latter case. This emmetropizing behavior implies that the eye can distinguish the sign and magnitude of defocus, although {{the identity of the}} cue(s) involved is unknown. As the spectacle lenses used in these studies generally introduce significant retinal image size differences that are in opposite directions for <b>negative</b> and positive <b>lenses</b> (minification vs. magnification), we asked whether retinal image size might provide the required sign information. METHODS: This question was addressed by manipulating retinal image size while keeping lens power constant. We also investigated the effect of eliminating other potential cues, accommodation and chromatic aberration, under these conditions. Three <b>negative</b> "size" <b>lenses</b> of approximately - 11 D optical power were used, with 2 of the lenses producing magnification rather than minification as typical of <b>negative</b> <b>lenses</b> (i. e. + 1. 9 % and + 6. 9 % compared to - 2. 9 %). The lenses were fitted monocularly to 7 -day-old chicks, which were subsequently measured at 9 and 11 days of age (refractive error and axial dimensions). The same lens-wearing schedule was applied to two other groups of chicks that had monocular ciliary nerve section surgery to prevent accommodation 2 days posthatching; one of these groups was reared under monochromatic yellow light instead of white light. RESULTS: Near-perfect refractive compensation was seen {{by the end of the}} treatment period with all three lenses, for all three treatment groups, and there was also little difference in the rate of compensation among the various groups. In all cases, the typical responses of axial (mainly vitreous chamber) elongation and myopia were observed. CONCLUSIONS: That manipulations to retinal image size, which either decrease or reverse the usual effects of <b>negative</b> <b>lenses,</b> did not disrupt compensation to the imposed hyperopic defocus, even in the absence of accommodation and chromatic aberration cues, argues against imposed retinal image size changes being the directional cue to defocus in experimental emmetropization...|$|R
