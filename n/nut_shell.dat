40|$|Nuts are the {{important}} economic forest tree species of China. De-shell {{is the key}} operation of nut deep processing. There are some problems in the current nut cracking devices such as the low decorticating rate, the high nuts losses rate and nutmeat integrity problems, etc [...] The foundation of force analysis is to establish contact model for nut and mechanical. The nut surface is rough and irregular, so the contact area cannot be modeled as regular shape. How to set up contact constraint model is the key problem to accomplish non-loss shelling. In order to study the shell-breaking mechanism and structural design of the <b>nut</b> <b>shelling</b> manipulation, a multi-fingered metamorphic manipulator is presented. An overview of the <b>nut</b> <b>shelling</b> technology and the contact manipulator modeling are proposed. The origin and application of metamorphic mechanisms are introduced.

40|$|Natural cola <b>nut</b> <b>shells</b> and its active carbons {{were used}} to remove indigo carmine dye from aqueous {{solution}} using batch adsorption test. The effect of pH, contact time (t), adsorbent dose (m) and initial concentrations (Co) were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin and Dubin-Kaganer-Raduskushkevich classical isotherm models. This equilibrium data best fits with all the four isotherm models for cola <b>nut</b> <b>shells.</b> Langmuir and Freundlich equations correlated well with data obtained using activated carbon based H 3 PO 4 while Freundlich and Tempkin best agreed with activated carbon based KOH. The kinetics of indigo carmine dye was discussed by pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and Intra-particle diffusion models. The pseudo-second order kinetic model equation fitted best to the data from all the three adsorbents. Elovich fitted best with data obtained using activated carbon based H 3 PO 4 while intra-particle diffusion model for activated carbon based KOH. D-K-R shows that adsorption process was chemisorption for all the three adsorbents. Natural cola <b>nut</b> <b>shells</b> and activated carbon based KOH show higher adsorption capacities with indigo carmine compared to activated carbon based H 3 PO 4. The results indicated that these shells and it active carbon {{can be used as}} an effective and low-cost adsorbent to remove indigo carmine from aqueous solution...|$|R
