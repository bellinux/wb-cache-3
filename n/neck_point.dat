25|$|Several people {{notable for}} their esteemed place in American history have called Darien home: Charles Lindbergh the late aviator, and his wife, author Anne Morrow Lindbergh lived on Tokeneke Trail. Steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie vacationed for several summers at {{what became the}} Convent of the Sacred Heart (divided into many private estates in the 1970s) at Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point.</b> Christopher Shays, the former Republican congressman {{representing}} Connecticut's Fourth District, was born in Darien (and now lives in Bridgeport). Jimmy Lee, former Vice Chairman of J.P. Morgan, lived in Darien until his unexpected death in 2015.|$|E

30|$|After the {{rearrangement}} of Cu atoms on the {{two sides}} of Ni tip, the thinnest <b>point</b> of Cu <b>neck</b> happens in the middle of Cu neck, not at the interface as shown in Fig. 5 a. From the stage of <b>necking</b> <b>point</b> formation to the breakage of neck, sawtooth-shaped load is mainly attributed to the shear processes on (111) plane. Displacement vectors of Cu atoms along (111) plane in Fig. 7 b reveal the process of shear behavior near the <b>necking</b> <b>point</b> (corresponding to T–U stage). When the accumulated energy at the <b>necking</b> <b>point</b> reaches to critical value, the homogeneous shear suddenly occurs along (111) slip plane. Shear process is accompanied by the sudden breakage of atomic bonds {{on the two}} sides of <b>necking</b> <b>point</b> (corresponding to load-jump in the load–depth curve) and the decrease of cross-sectional area. Shear slip processes in the <b>necking</b> <b>point</b> also evidently elongate the neck till the neck fracture completely.|$|R
50|$|The Nautiloidea, {{in which}} Homaloceras is included, is a {{subclass}} of once diverse and numerous shelled cephalopods {{characterized by a}} retrochoantic siphuncle in which the septal <b>necks</b> <b>point</b> back toward the apex.|$|R

2500|$|On its east side, Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point</b> Road {{stretches}} south beginning {{near the}} Ring's End Landing bridge and terminating at the southerly most tip of land. This area is somewhat inland {{and away from}} the eastern shoreline and at a relatively high elevation above the water. The west coast of Long Neck runs along Goodwives River and includes Pear Tree Point. A public beach, Pear Tree Point Park and a private boat club, the Darien Boat Club are on Pear Tree Point in Noroton Harbor. Pear Tree Point Road, begins at the Ring's End Landing bridge, runs south along the western side of the Point adjacent to [...] "The Gut" [...] and to outer Noroton Harbor. This charming route hugs the shoreline at an elevation close enough to the tides such that storm conditions can bring the water level over the road. Approximately half-way south along the peninsula, Pear Tree Point Road turns abruptly to the east, ninety degrees, heading uphill and connecting to Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point</b> Road, distinguishing Long Neck from Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The name Noroton {{originates}} {{from the}} Native American [...] "Norporiton" [...] {{assigned to the}} river along Darien's border with Stamford. This section of Darien is defined by two peninsulas that claw their way into Long Island Sound, their curved appendages protecting enough coves and inlets to make the area a haven for beachgoers and sailors. The shorter of the peninsulas, Noroton Neck, is divided into shore communities like Noroton Bay and Pratt Island. Long Neck, which extends farther into Long Island Sound includes Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point</b> which provides westerly views of Manhattan. Though the general geographic reference to this land feature is Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point,</b> therein are two different neighborhoods, each with their own main road and distinct features.|$|E

All attempts to refloat the vessel were unsuccessful, but all the crew were saved, and Culloden's masts were taken aboard [...] The area is today known as Culloden Point.|$|E

50|$|The {{subclass}} nautiloidea, in {{the broad}} original sense, is distinguished by two main characteristics—simple concave septa, concave in the forward direction, that produce generally simple sutures, and a siphuncle in which the septal <b>necks</b> <b>point</b> to the rear (i.e. is retrosiphonate, throughout the ontogeny of the animal).|$|R
2500|$|Following the war, {{the train}} {{connection}} allowed Darien {{to become a}} popular resort for prosperous New Yorkers who built summer homes in Tokeneke, Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point,</b> and Noroton (this pattern was repeated elsewhere along the Connecticut shore and inland). [...] A few daily commuters to New York City then were forerunners of the many who have settled here and changed Darien into a residential suburb of metropolitan New York.|$|E
2500|$|Connecticut’s Gold Coast, Long <b>Neck</b> <b>Point</b> is {{consistently}} ranked {{one of the}} best places to live in America. Historically, it has also been called Collender’s Point and “La Belle” Point. In 1902, Anson Phelps Stokes of the Stokes family built a Gilded Age brick Georgian manor on the end, dubbed [...] "Brick House" [...] which was later occupied by Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie’s manor was later run as the Convent of the Sacred Heart before it was split in half and sold as two private residences. The property on the tip was divided in two and neither home can rise above 20 feet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shell of}} Yinoceras is involute, small to {{intermediate}} in size, subglobular or thickly discoidal {{with a very}} small umbilicus, convex flanks, and rounded venter.
