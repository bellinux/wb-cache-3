He {{became a member of}} the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912, as a representative of the Parliament. In 1913, a referendum to fix the closing time of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP. Even after the governing Liberal Union agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the <b>next</b> <b>state</b> election, Denny attacked them, claiming that they had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re-elected. Denny was returned unopposed at the March 1915 state election.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, after {{a three-year}} trial of {{daylight}} saving in Queensland, Australia, {{a referendum on}} daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote– with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating {{the implementation of a}} dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland {{while the rest of the}} state maintains standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the <b>next</b> <b>state</b> election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement. The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Since Mr. Wellington {{agreed with}} the {{principles}} of the DS4SEQ proposal, specifically the dual-time-zone system, he drafted the DST for southeastern Queensland Referendum Bill of 2010 and he submitted this bill to Queensland Parliament on 14 April 2010.

25|$|Several state {{transition}} table types are used. The most common representation is shown below: the combination of current state (e.g. B) and input (e.g. Y) shows the <b>next</b> <b>state</b> (e.g. C). The complete action's information is not directly described in the table and can only be added using footnotes. A FSM definition including the full actions information is possible using state tables (see also virtual finite-state machine).|$|E
25|$|Benson also asserted, as {{an example}} of a state’s {{violation}} of its own Constitution, laws, or procedural rules, the claim that the Tennessee State Constitution prohibited the legislature from acting on any proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution submitted by Congress until after the <b>next</b> <b>state</b> legislative elections.

25|$|The {{changes of}} state of the system are called transitions. The probabilities {{associated}} with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process {{is characterized by a}} state space, a transition matrix describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a <b>next</b> <b>state,</b> and the process does not terminate.|$|E
25|$|East of Cazenovia, US20 resumes its southward drift as it {{climbs into}} the high ground again and expands to four lanes, passing the small village of Morrisville in the process. It descends from there to its <b>next</b> <b>state</b> highway, NY46, where it reverts to two lanes for a brief concurrency, after which NY46 leaves for {{isolated}} Hamilton. The southern trend reverses itself after this junction, with first NY26 and later NY12B joining US20 to create another three-route overlap. This persists for three very straight miles until both leave to the north {{in the town of}} Madison. After another , the highway crosses into Oneida County.|$|E
25|$|Initially, no {{prominent}} Democratic {{candidate was}} prepared to run against a sitting president of the Democratic Party. Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the New Hampshire primary, hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the <b>next</b> <b>state</b> to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.|$|E

25|$|Garland {{was elected}} to the United States Senate for a term {{beginning}} in 1867, but was not allowed to take the seat as Arkansas had not yet been readmitted to the Union. He continued practicing law and observing the political scene from a distance. In 1872, with the Republican Party split into three factions, Arkansas Democrats sought Garland to help elect Democrats into the state legislature and had been considered for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. During the conflict known as the Brooks-Baxter War, he sided with Governor Elisha Baxter and was a primary strategist for him. He was an advisor and constitutional scholar at the <b>next</b> <b>state</b> constitutional convention and, with strong support from the Democratic Party, was elected Governor of Arkansas.|$|E

In 1960, he was also elected into the municipal council of Ludwigshafen where he served as leader of the CDU party until 1969. When the {{chairman of the}} CDU parliamentary group in the Landtag, Wilhelm Boden, died in late 1961, Kohl moved up into a deputy position.

In March 1966, Kohl was elected as chairman of the party in Rhineland-Palatinate, while Altmeier once again ran for minister-president in the state elections in 1967, agreeing to hand the post over to Kohl after two years, halfway into the legislative period.|$|E
