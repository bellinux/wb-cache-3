The Board was a governmental body charged with administering a scheme of prizes intended to encourage innovators {{to solve the problem of}} finding longitude at sea, which was vital for accurate navigation. Lax published a set of tables for use with the Nautical Almanac for finding latitude and longitude; these were published by the Board of Longitude in 1821, and whilst they were not considered to be of much practical use for seamen, they were described by The Nautical Magazine as a [...] "very meritorious attempt to solve the problems of <b>nautical</b> <b>astronomy</b> by one uniform system." [...] In 1821, the Board awarded Lax £1050 for his tables, which were intended to replace Nevil Maskelyne's Requisite Tables. However, the extraordinarily accurate chronometers of John Harrison were generally available from the 1820s onwards, rendering the lunar distance method, which Lax had used to create the tables, immaterial. Meanwhile, Edward Sabine criticised errors in Lax's work.|$|E

At first he had imagined headmasters clutching at the chance of him, and presently he found himself clutching eagerly at them. He began to put a certain urgency into his applications for vacant posts, an urgency that helped him not at all. The applications grew longer and longer until they ran to four sheets of note-paper--a pennyworth in fact. [...] "I can assure you," [...] he would write, [...] "that you will find me a loyal and devoted assistant." [...] Much in that strain. Dunkerley pointed out that Bonover's testimonial ignored the question of moral character and discipline in a marked manner, and Bonover refused to alter it. He was willing to do what he could to help Lewisham, in spite of the way he had been treated, but unfortunately his conscience....|$|E
