5000|$|FINE-C: Fuel, ignition, <b>neutral,</b> <b>engine</b> cut-off switch, choke and clutch. A {{standardized}} {{series of}} controls to engage when starting a motorcycle. Older motorcycles {{might not have}} an engine cut-off, and newer ones might not have a choke, and some types have no clutch, but remembering all 6 items, and skipping {{those that do not}} apply, is safe and effective.|$|E
50|$|Mister Transmission {{performs}} multi-check inspections. These inspections include: {{checking the}} transmission fluid, a road test, a lift inspection checking: <b>neutral</b> switch, <b>engine</b> rpm, throttle linkage, modulators, transmission mounts, u-joints, fluid retention, and electronic controls, while also doing a pan inspection which checks {{the inside of}} the transmission.|$|R
5000|$|On the 22nd of March 2007, Picsearch {{implemented}} a new environmental policy making them the first carbon <b>neutral</b> search <b>engine</b> in the world. The Picsearch initiative {{was followed by}} promises from Yahoo in April and Google in June to go carbon neutral {{by the end of}} 2007.|$|R
5000|$|The default {{state of}} the clutch is engaged - that is the {{connection}} between engine and gearbox is always [...] "on" [...] unless the driver presses the pedal and disengages it. If the engine is running with the clutch engaged and the transmission in <b>neutral,</b> the <b>engine</b> spins the input shaft of the transmission but power is not transmitted to the wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Google’s [...] "Universal Search" [...] {{system has}} been {{identified}} as one of the least <b>neutral</b> search <b>engine</b> practices, and following the implementation of Universal Search websites, such as MapQuest, the company experienced a massive decline in web traffic. This decline has been attributed to Google linking to its own services rather than the services offered at external websites. Despite these claims, Google actually displays Google content on the first page, while rival search engines do not considerably less often than Microsoft's Bing which displays Microsoft content when rivals do not. Bing displays Microsoft content in first place more than twice as often as Google shows Google content in first place. This indicates that as far as there is any 'bias', Google is less biased than its principal competitor.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{throttle}} {{is in the}} idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors will not {{be connected to the}} main generator and the generator's field windings will not be excited (energized) — the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in [...] "neutral". Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into <b>neutral</b> while the <b>engine</b> is running.|$|R
50|$|Electrodeless plasma {{thrusters}} {{have two}} unique features: {{the removal of}} the anode and cathode electrodes and the ability to throttle the engine. The removal of the electrodes eliminates erosion, which limits lifetime on other ion <b>engines.</b> <b>Neutral</b> gas is first ionized by electromagnetic waves and then transferred to another chamber where it is accelerated by an oscillating electric and magnetic field, also known as the ponderomotive force. This separation of the ionization and acceleration stages allows throttling of propellant flow, which then changes the thrust magnitude and specific impulse values.|$|R
25|$|Shenandoah was {{powered by}} , eight-cylinder Packard {{gasoline}} engines. Six engines were originally installed, but in 1924 one engine (aft {{of the control}} car) was removed. The first frame of Shenandoah was erected by 24 June 1922; on 20 August 1923, the completed airship was floated free of the ground. Helium cost $55 per thousand cubic feet at the time, and was considered too expensive to simply vent to the atmosphere {{to compensate for the}} weight of fuel consumed by the gasoline <b>engines.</b> <b>Neutral</b> buoyancy was preserved by installing condensers to capture the water vapor in the engine exhaust.|$|R
50|$|In November 2006, Sitekit CMS version 7 was released, {{this version}} focused on <b>neutral</b> natural Search <b>Engine</b> Optimisation (SEO), usability, and website {{accessibility}} compliance. In 2009 Sitekit CMS v9 was launched which introduced a ribbon style editing interface and more advanced editing features, {{designed to give}} editors a more familiar editing environment and make the software more application like. In 2010 Sitekit Solutions Ltd reported a record year of growth. In the same year Sitekit CMS 9.0 passed Microsoft’s applications testing whilst renewing a Gold-status Partnership with Microsoft, ensuring that Sitekit CMS works on the latest Microsoft platform and providing access to more hosting options. The latest version Sitekit CMS 10, was released in March 2014.|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 : A {{reduction}} in engine capacity from [...] to further slow cars, longer cockpit openings to reduce chance of drivers head hitting {{it in the}} event of an accident, survival cell side impact tests introduced, obligatory automatic <b>neutral</b> selection when <b>engine</b> stops, increase in length chassis must extend beyond driver's feet from 15 to 30 cm, frontal impact test speed increased from 11 m/s to 12 m/s, kerbs made smoother, pit wall debris shield installed, 3 inch safety straps mandatory, super licence criteria and fuel restrictions made more stringent (i.e. special racing fuels - previously an exotic mixture of benzenes and toluenes, are banned; only those with similar characteristics to everyday unleaded petrol are permitted).|$|R
50|$|Conversely, {{in order}} to shift down, engine RPM must be {{increased}} while the gearbox is in neutral and the clutch is engaged. This requires the driver to slow the vehicle sufficiently, shift into neutral, apply throttle to bring the RPM up to a suitable speed, and finally shift into gear. This operation can {{be very difficult to}} master, as it requires the driver to gauge the speed of the vehicle and throttle to the intended gear accurately; vehicle weight and road gradient are important factors as they influence the vehicle's acceleration or deceleration during the shift. Double clutching is when the clutch pedal is depressed while shifting to <b>neutral</b> to match <b>engine</b> speed to the intended gear and vehicle speed, and again depressed for shifting into gear.|$|R
5000|$|All 986 and 987 Boxsters use the M96, a water-cooled, {{horizontally}} opposed ("flat"), six-cylinder engine. It was Porsche's first water-cooled non-front engine. In the Boxster, it {{is placed}} mid-engine, {{while in the}} 911, rear-engine. The flat, mid-engine layout provides a low center of gravity, near-perfect weight distribution, and <b>neutral</b> handling. The <b>engines</b> {{had a number of}} failures, resulting in cracked or slipped cylinder liners, which were resolved by a minor redesign and better control of the casting process in late 1999. A failure for these early engines was a spate of porous engine blocks, as the manufacturer had difficulty in the casting process. In addition to causing problems with coolant and oil systems mingling fluids, it also resulted in Porsche's decision to repair faulty engines by boring out the cast sleeves on the cylinders where defects were noted in production and inserting new sleeves rather than scrapping the engine block. Normally, the cylinder walls are cast {{at the same time as}} the rest of the engine, this being the reason for adopting the casting technology.|$|R
50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in <b>neutral</b> and the <b>engine</b> allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|R
