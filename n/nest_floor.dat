5000|$|The {{breeding}} season {{begins in the}} winter months shortly after the monsoons. In northern India, the {{breeding season}} begins in mid-August while in southern India the nest initiation begins around October and continues till February and or even until April. A lot of variation is noticed in the onset of breeding across sites with the season at Kokrebellur and Edurupattu around January or February but at Telineelapuram, Kundakulam and Tirunelveli the breeding begins around October or November. The typical clutch varies from one to five eggs with early breeders having larger clutches. The incubation period is about a month while the fledging period is nearly two months. There is occasional predation of chicks by migrant Aquila eagles and Pallas's fish eagle. During the mid-day heat, adults will stand at the nest with wings outstretched to shade the chicks. To feed chicks, adults regurgitate fish that they have caught and these are typically smaller than 20 cm long. Young chicks, when threatened, disgorge food and feign death by crumpling to the <b>nest</b> <b>floor.</b> [...] The daily requirement for chicks has been estimated to be 500-600 grams made up of about 9 fish fed in two sessions. Nest survival (measured as daily nest survival) is higher for nests initiated early in the monsoon season, lower with decreasing temperature, and higher at larger colonies.The bare red skin on the head is developed when reaching breeding maturity and involves the loss of feathers and the deposition of lipids under the skin. Birds in captivity {{have been known to}} live for as long as 28 years. Birds raised as chicks have been known to be tame and docile, even responding to their names when called.|$|E
50|$|The call is a {{distinctive}} Kluee-wip-wip {{with the first}} note being high and rising. They call {{a lot in the}} late mornings from their perches where they {{spend a lot of time}} and they rise on thermals in the mornings. In southern Taiwan, males have a larger home range than females. Males on average had a home range of 16.7 km2 while females used about 7 km2. When alarmed, they erect the crest and the head appears large and framed by the ruff. They will sometimes follow snakes on the ground. They roost in the interiors of trees with dense foliage. A radio-telemetric study of the species in Taiwan found that the birds spend 98% of the day perched and usually finding food in the morning hours. They appear to use a sit and wait foraging strategy.The breeding season begins in late winter when they start courting and establishing territories. The eggs are laid in early summer. Old nests are often refurbished and reused in India but a study in Penang found them to build fresh nests each year. A study in India found that most nests were built along riverine trees. The nest is a large platform built high on a tree. Both birds in a pair build the nest but the female alone incubates. The male guards when the female forages. In central India, the Terminalia tomentosa is often used while Terminalia bellirica and Dalbergia latifolia was often used in southern India. In Penang, the nest trees were typically large and isolated from other trees with lot of room for the birds to fly in and out. The nests are lined with green leaves collected from nearby and are placed facing down on the <b>nest</b> <b>floor.</b> The usual clutch is one egg but two are sometimes laid and only a single chick is successfully raised in a season. When eggs are lost, a replacement is laid two to seven weeks later. The eggs hatch after about 41 days and the young fledge after about two months. Nests are defended by the parents.|$|E

40|$|Adult {{bugs and}} fleas tended to {{aggregate}} in nests {{that would later}} contain bird eggs, and they per-sisted in high numbers after eggs were present. The tendency is less clear in the bug data, probably because bugs were more often hiding in inacces-sible parts of nests before eggs and nest material offered seclusion on <b>nest</b> <b>floors.</b> Aggregations of either insect are apparently indications of bird oc-cupancy. After the clutch is laid, 1 of the adult birds probably remains in the nest throughout the day, except during outside disturbances, and perhaps this constant presence of a host caused the abrupt appearance of bug eggs and flea larvae. It is un-certain whether the birds stimulated the insects in some direct way or simply provided opportunity for more blood meals at a fairly definite time prior to laying eggs. The only conspicuous exception to the approximately coincidental appearance of bird eggs and insect progeny was in nest # 15 where both bug eggs and flea larvae appeared prematurely. Since nest material of this nest also appeared prematurely, then disappeared, the birds were presumably about to lay eggs, but abandoned the nest to other birds. Larvae disappeared — probably having died — between inspection periods from nest # 15, {{as well as from}} the 4 minor exceptions where 1 st instar flea larvae occurred in nests never having bird eggs. This indicates fleas can oviposit (though rarely) in nests which have not been permanently occupied, but unless birds are in the nests most of the time (when bird eggs are present) the larvae will not survive. Since a small amount of nest material remained in nest # 15 when flea larvae disappeared, it is likely that death resulted from lack of sufficient adult excreta which probably con-tributes to the larval diet, or from low night tem-peratures and low humidity in the absence of birds. The use of the artificial swallow nests in the ex-amination of their inhabitants appears to be an effective method for the study of the behavior of both the birds and their ectoparasites and of the nature of the relationships between them, under nearly natural conditions. Certainly more work on this subject is needed. Acknowledgments: We are especially grateful to Bernard C. Nelson for the identification of the flea and review of th...|$|R

40|$|Two {{remedial}} {{treatments to}} reduce {{the high incidence of}} broken eggs in the furnished cages of our experimental layer farm were investigated: lining the <b>nest</b> <b>floor</b> with artificial turf (to increase nest acceptance) and lowering perch height ({{to reduce the}} chance of egg breakage of outside-nest eggs). A 2 x 2 factorial design was used with low (7 cm) or high (24 cm) perches, and with nest floors lined with artificial turf or plastic mesh. Eight cages, each housing 8 hens initially (aged 40 to 56 wk), were used per treatment. Egg location and percentage of broken eggs were recorded. Hen position (cage floor, nest, or perch) was recorded by direct scan-sampling observations. In addition, 8 cages (4 high + 4 low) each containing 8 hens (aged 54 to 56 wk) were videorecorded to determine perch use and behavior during the light period. Data were mainly analyzed using logistic regression and mixed models with cage as the experimental unit. <b>Nest</b> <b>floor</b> material did not influence the percentage of eggs broken or laid outside the nest. The proportion of outside-nest eggs (2. 6 vs. 10. 6 %, P = 0. 004), and consequently also of total eggs (2 vs. 4. 6 %, P = 0. 016) broken, was lower for low than high cages. Perch use increased during the observation period, more so for the high cages during the light period and the low cages during the dark period. Perch bout duration (P < 0. 001), the likelihood of ending a perching bout voluntarily (P = 0. 013), and time spent sitting during perching (P = 0. 007) were lower in low vs. high cages.

40|$|Altricial nestlings in {{structured}} families show {{a diverse}} array of behavioural mechanisms to compete for food, ranging from signalling scrambles to aggressive interference. Rates of filial infanticide are moderately high in white storks. It has been hypothesized that this unusual behaviour is an adaptive parental response {{to the absence of}} efficient mechanisms of brood reduction (aggression or direct physical interference) by nestlings. To test this latter assumption, we analyzed video recordings of 41 complete feeding episodes at 32 broods {{during the first half of}} the nestling period, when nestlings complete 90 % of growth and chick mortality and size asymmetries are highest. Parents delivered food to all nestlings simultaneously by regurgitating on the <b>nest</b> <b>floor.</b> No direct (bill to bill) feeding was recorded. Senior nestlings were never observed to limit their junior nestlings from eating food, either by aggression or physical interference. Experimental feeding tests revealed that heavier nestlings handled prey items more efficiently and ate food at a higher speed. The high degree of tolerance shown by senior nestlings is unusual among birds with similar ecological and phylogenetic affinities, such as herons. Tolerance by seniors cannot be easily explained by absence of parental favouritism or proximate factors known to affect the occurrence of sibling aggression in other species (rate of food transfer, brood size, hatching asynchrony or length of nestling period).

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of alternative housing systems for laying hens in the EU, recent research has focussed on the bacterial contamination of table eggs, e. g. eggshell and egg content contamination. Contamination of eggshells with aerobic bacteria is generally higher for nest eggs from non-cage systems compared to nest eggs from furnished cages or eggs from conventional cages. Studies indicate limited or no systematic differences in eggshell contamination with aerobic bacteria between eggs laid in the nest boxes of furnished cages and eggs laid in conventional cages. The major differences found in experimental studies between cage- and non-cage systems are less pronounced under commercial conditions. The effect of housing system on eggshell contamination with specific groups of bacteria is variable. Limited information {{is available on the}} influence of housing system on egg content contamination. Recent research does not indicate large differences in egg content contamination between eggs from cage- and non-cage systems (ignoring outside <b>nest</b> and <b>floor</b> eggs). The microflora of the eggshell is dominated by Gram-positive bacteria, whereas Gram-negative bacteria are best equipped to overcome the antimicrobial defences of the egg content. Much of the research on eggshell and egg content contamination focuses on Salmonella, since infection with Salmonella enteriddis, resulting from the consumption of contaminated eggs or egg products, is still a major health problem. Observed Salmonella prevalence on the eggshell and in the egg content vary, depending on the fact whether investigations were based on randomly sampled table eggs or on eggs from naturally infected hens. The limited information available on other pathogens shows that they are exclusively isolated from the eggshell and not from the internal contents...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to design a new {{mechanical}} nesting system based on scientific works on the behavior of laying hens, and to compare its performance with that of a hand-operated Dutch nest.

Anchieta Island has the highest density of mammals of the entire Atlantic forest, especially nest predators such as marmosets and coatis, introduced more than 20 years ago. This indiscriminate introduction of mammals may have affected directly the bird community, nowadays represented by 100 species comprised mainly by water-crossing birds, being 73 forest-dwelling species. A small component of these remnant bird species nests in tree holes and on the forest floor, null model analysis suggest that birds within these two nest types are under-represented on Anchieta Island.

Experiments using artificial nests showed a predation of 73 % of <b>nests</b> on the <b>floor</b> while only 26 % on the mainland. Camera traps recorded predation by coatis, agoutis, and opossums.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Jordan with the purpose to {{investigate}} the bacterial micro flora of egg shells from cage systems and from deep litter floor systems. Another aim was to get a general impression of the hygiene, at farm level, of egg production in Jordan and the factors affecting it. Eggs from two cage systems and three floor systems were analyzed, regarding bacterial contamination of the egg shells. Egg samples were taken from the storage room, the egg cradle in the cage system and from the <b>nest</b> and <b>floor</b> in the floor system. To get a general impression of the hygiene at the farms, swab tests and air tests were performed. Swab tests were performed with a sterile cotton swab at the same units as the eggs were sampled and air tests were performed by opening petri dishes where the hens were staying. One hundred eggs from the storage room at three of the farms were also candled to examine the frequency of cracked eggs. Because the eggs were already collected from the nest/cradle, this implied that eggs with visible cracks {{were not included in the}} cracked eggs frequency. The egg samples were rinsed in a homogenizer bag containing sterile buffered peptone water. From this solution microbial testing was performed, including spreading on agar plates in order to receive quantitative results concerning the presence of Salmonella, coliforms/ E. coli and Campylobacter. The data were analyzed statistically. To get an overview of the factors affecting bacterial contamination at the different farms, questions including housing system and use of antibiotics were asked. The use of antibiotics was not regulated and antibiotics was given in water or feed at most of the farms. The cage system was significantly cleaner than the floor system regarding bacterial total count, Salmonella and E. coli on egg shells. The result regarding cracks is not reliable due to the removal if visible cracks. Regarding the hygienic aspect of egg production in Jordan much can be improved. Antibiotics and disinfectants were used without prescriptions and Salmonella and Campylobacter were found at all farms, either at the egg shell or at the egg cradle/nest. The temerarious use of antibiotics can also result in development of resistant bacteria which is a risk for the public health...|$|R
40|$|During their {{approximately}} annual nest relocations, Florida harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex badius) excavate {{large and}} architecturally-distinct subterranean nests. Aspects {{of this process}} were studied by planting a harvester ant colony {{in the field in}} a soil column composed of layers of 12 different colors of sand. Quantifying the colors of excavated sand dumped on the surface by the ants revealed the progress of nest deepening to 2 m and enlargement to 8 L in volume. Most of the excavation was completed within about 2 weeks, but the nest was doubled in volume after a winter lull. After 7 months, we excavated the nest and mapped its structure, revealing colored sand deposited in non-host colored layers, especially in the upper 30 to 40 cm of the nest. In all, about 2. 5 % of the excavated sediment was deposited below ground, a fact of importance to sediment dating by optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL). Upward transport of excavated sand is carried out in stages, probably by different groups of ants, through deposition, re-transport, incorporation into the <b>nest</b> walls and <b>floors</b> and remobilization from these. This results in considerable mixing of sand from different depths, as indicated in the multiple sand colors even within single sand pellets brought to the surface. Just as sand is transported upward by stages, incoming seeds are transported downward to seed chambers. Foragers collect seeds and deposit them only in the topmost nest chambers from which a separate group of workers rapidly transports them downward in increments detectable as a "wave" of seeds that eventually ends in the seed chambers, 20 to 80 cm below the surface. The upward and downward transport is an example of task-partitioning in a series-parallel organization of work carried out by a highly redundant work force in which each worker usually completes only part of a multi-step process...|$|R

In Sri Lanka, it is known as loha wannichcha.Malabar trogons feed exclusively on insects and fruits have not been noted in their diet unlike in the New World trogons. Seeds have however been reported in the diet of Sri Lankan specimens. In the forests of Sri Lanka, they are often found in mixed-species foraging flocks where they may sometimes be subject to kleptoparasitism by drongos. A study in Kerala found that they foraged mainly at 5 to 10 m with females tending to forage lower within the canopy. When foraging on bark, they propped themselves using their tail like woodpeckers, especially on decaying tree stumps. They sometimes descend to the ground and search for insects under leaf litter. They will sometimes fly and try to flush prey and then hover to pick up prey. They may also hang upside down to reach prey on vertical tree surfaces. Prey are often mashed or struck on a branch between the mandibles before feeding on them or prior to feeding young. The contact call is a series of about five low intensity que while these were of higher intensity in territorial fights. The alarm call is a churrrr and a similar call is also delivered prior to roosting. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly. In the Nilgiri hills they are altitudinal migrants and are found in the higher reaches only during summer.The nest is made in rotting trees or stumps that are easy to carve and pulverize using their bills. The male and female take turns to excavate the nest using their bills. It may take about a month to excavate the <b>nest.</b> The <b>floor</b> is made out of the wood powder and no extra lining is added. Two eggs were seen to be the normal clutch in a study in Kerala although older works suggest that the typical clutch is of three eggs. The eggs are laid with a gap of two days and incubated by both males and females with the females usually incubating at night. The incubation period is about 19 days. The hatchlings are fed mainly caterpillars for the initial period and later provided bugs, flies and orthopterans. The parents do not remove the excreta of the nestlings from the nest. The adults continue to feed the fledged juveniles for nearly 5 to 6 months. They are socially monogamous with pair bonds lasting more than a season.Sri Lankan birds have been seen to plunge into water from an overhanging branch to bathe.|$|R

With a joyful hum she flies back to it all day long with her pellets of mud, and spreads them out with her mouth into pointed arches, one laid on the other, making one side of the arch out of each pellet, and singing low but cheerily over her work. [...] As she works downward, she parts off the tube of the <b>nest</b> with horizontal <b>floors</b> of a finer and harder mud, and inside each storey places some five spiders, and among them the precious egg, or eggs, which is to feed on them when hatched. If we open the uppermost chamber, we shall find every vestige of the spiders gone, and the cavity filled (and, strange to say, exactly filled) by a brown- coated wasp-pupa, enveloped in a fine silken shroud. In the chamber below, perhaps, we shall find the grub full-grown, and finishing his last spicier; and so on, down six or eight storeys, till the lowest holds nothing but spiders, packed close, but not yet sealed up. [...] These spiders, be it remembered, are not dead. By some strange craft, the wasp knows exactly where to pierce them with her sting, so as to stupefy, but not to kill, just as the sand-wasps of our banks at home stupefy the large weevils which they store in their burrows as food for their grubs.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} new method of heating of pig houses and more specifically the swine nurseries with the use of Solar Heating Systems. In the proposed method a Test Shell with Solar Mass Wall, is used to service the heating needs of nursing sows while for the nurslings was created a special flooring (pad) with embodied heated pipes, throw a system of solar collectors and heating storage tank. The structural elements of this system are a solar mass wall, a specially designed heated flooring (shelter), a solar absorber, a solar collector, a heating storage tank and a heating supply tank. These elements are combined together using appropriate fluid circuits and digital controllers. The system provides a suitable environment for the nursling’ shelter {{as well as to the}} nursing sow through the solar mass wall. The system is composed of two main circuits. The first one includes the solar units and the storage (heating) tank (Circuit A) and the second one contains the supply (after-heating) tank and the pad (Circuit B). The first days are the most critical in a piglet’s life. Up to 80 % of piglet losses occur in the first 3 days of life and the majority of deaths are attributed to crushing. To reduce piglet losses by crushing by the sow the nest area must be warm. However, because of economic and hygienic disadvantages, straw is becoming less and the modern practice is to use either electric or gas infrared heaters, or underground heaters with solid plates. In the first 10 days of life, the young piglets require temperatures of at least 32 - 36 OC in the nest. Infrared heaters with IR-emitter have the highest temperature on the surface directly under the centre of the radiator, and outwards from the centre the temperature drops. An underground heater (warm water heat source) has a homogeneous surface temperature, therefore every piglet of the litter gets the same temperature in the <b>nest</b> area. The <b>flooring</b> in farrowing pens must satisfy a wide variety of criteria. The floor must be durable and easily to clean. The aim of this investigation was to test a new heating system for young piglets and to compare it with the conventional electric heating lamps and the warm water bed. This system incorporates all the benefits of the floor heating systems. In addition the controlled distribution of the solar energy, not only reduces the consumption of the electric energy to the 20 - 25 % of the consumption of the conventional system with infrared lamps, but also provides the specific thermal environment for the weaned piglets as well as to the nursing sown. Using a control system, the fluid temperature is kept close to the desired optimal temperature, in contrast with the conventional halogen and incandescent infrared lamps where the heating is regulated by the distance between the lamp and the piglets. Furthermore, the optimal temperature is regulated to decrease one degree centigrade per day and this means that the electric consumption is decreased as well. ...|$|R
60|$|Well! and so {{another time}} the baby {{fell under the}} grate. The {{seventeen}} young princes and princesses were used to it; for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs; but the baby {{was not used to}} it yet, and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye. The way the poor little darling came to tumble was, that {{he was out of the}} Princess Alicia's lap just as she was sitting, in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her, in front of the kitchen-fire, beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner; and the way she came to be doing that was, that the king's cook had run away that morning with her own true love, who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier. Then the seventeen young princes and princesses, who cried at everything that happened, cried and roared. But the Princess Alicia (who couldn't help crying a little herself) quietly called to them to be still, on account of not throwing back the queen up-stairs, who was fast getting well, and said, 'Hold your tongues, you wicked little monkeys, every one of you, while I examine baby!' Then she examined baby, and found that he hadn't broken anything; and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye, and smoothed his poor dear face, and he presently fell asleep in her arms. Then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses, 'I am afraid to let him down yet, lest he should wake and feel pain; be good, and you shall all be cooks.' They jumped for joy when they heard that, and began making themselves cooks' caps out of old newspapers. So to one she gave the salt-box, and to one she gave the barley, and to one she gave the herbs, and to one she gave the turnips, and to one she gave the carrots, and to one she gave the onions, and to one she gave the spice-box, till they were all cooks, and all running about at work, she sitting in the middle, smothered in the great coarse apron, nursing baby. By and by the broth was done; and the baby woke up, smiling, like an angel, and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold, while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a far-off corner to look at the Princess Alicia turning out the saucepanful of broth, for fear (as they were always getting into trouble) they should get splashed and scalded. When the broth came tumbling out, steaming beautifully, and smelling like a nosegay good to eat, they clapped their hands. That made the baby clap his hands; and that, and his looking as if he had a comic toothache, made all the princes and princesses laugh. So the Princess Alicia said, 'Laugh and be good; and after dinner we will make him a <b>nest</b> on the <b>floor</b> in a corner, and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks.' That delighted the young princes and princesses, and they ate up all the broth, and washed up all the plates and dishes, and cleared away, and pushed the table into a corner; and then they in their cooks' caps, and the Princess Alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier, danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby, who forgot his swelled face and his black eye, and crowed with joy.|$|R
