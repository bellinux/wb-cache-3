5000|$|Early filing or rasping (the {{distinction}} is emic, not etic) has prehistoric roots and grew naturally {{out of the}} blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as hand axes) and abrading using <b>natural</b> <b>abrasives,</b> such as well-suited types of stone (for example, sandstone). Relatedly, lapping is also quite ancient, with wood and beach sand offering a natural pair of lap and lapping compound. The Disston authors state, [...] "To abrade, or file, ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,—also stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water." ...|$|E

In our work some selected rock types have been tested for the use in the ceramic industry, filler industry, as an abrasive material, quartz and quartzites {{for the production of}} ferrosilicium, decorative stones and slater shales. As the most suitable for a practicable use we found the leucocratic granites with the high content of feldspars for the ceramic production, tourmaline stones as a filling into plastic material and for concrete shield, against the low-energy neutron radia-tion and the <b>natural</b> <b>abrasives...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Grinding {{wheels are}} made of <b>natural</b> or {{synthetic}} <b>abrasive</b> minerals bonded together in a matrix to form a wheel. For manufacturers, grinding wheels provide {{an efficient way to}} shape and finish metals and other materials. Grinding wheels are the only way to create parts with precision dimensions and high-quality surface finishes. At this time, grinding wheels are used in almost every industry. Manufacturing of a grinding wheel consist of mixing abrasive grains, binders and bonding materials. Three important components, abrasive grains with binders and bonding materials, make up any grinding wheel. The, additives are mixed to create a wheel with the properties necessary to shape a particular material in the manner desired. Abrasive grains include the central part of any grinding wheel, and the toughness and friability of th...|$|R
40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} methods of removing material from machine parts by the cutting action of the countless hard and sharp abrasive particles of a revolving grinding wheel. It works by forcing the abrasive grains into the surface of the workpiece so that each grain cuts away a small bit of material in the form of chips. Abrasive grinding wheel is an expendable wheel that carries an abrasive compound on its periphery. They are made of small, sharp and very hard <b>natural</b> or synthetic <b>abrasive</b> minerals, bonded together in a matrix to form a wheel. The paper presents a review of some of the characteristics as well as theoretical considerations of operations of abrasive grinding wheel. The relationships among the various grinding parameters; the radial force f, the force on individual grit of grinding wheel F, velocity of grinding wheelg Vg, velocity of work piecew Vw, the wheel diameterg Dg, and the diameter of the work piece Dw were established for given grinding operations. </p...|$|R
40|$|By {{using the}} rDNA {{of a plant}} wilt {{pathogen}} (Verticillium dahliae) as the target sequence, a direct method for the extraction of DNA from soil samples {{which can be used}} for PCR-mediated diagnostics without a need for further DNA purification has been developed. The soil organisms are disrupted by grinding in liquid nitrogen with the <b>natural</b> <b>abrasives</b> in soil, and losses due to degradation and adsorption are largely eliminated by the addition of skim milk powder. The DNA from disrupted cells is extracted with sodium dodecyl sulfate-phenol and collected by ethanol precipitation. After suitable dilution, this DNA extract can be assayed directly by PCR amplification technologies. The method is rapid, cost efficient, and when combined with suitable internal controls {{can be applied to the}} detection and quantification of specific soil organisms or pathogens on a large-scale basis...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the insecticidal activity of Thymus capitatus essential oils and two <b>natural</b> <b>abrasives</b> to control Myzus persicae. The in vitro application of thyme essential oils showed a significant toxic effect by fumigation {{as well as by}} spraying. The LC 50 for both application methods recorded after 24 h were about 20. 01 and 13. 26 µl/l air, respectively. In addition, in vivo experiment based on bioinsecticide formulation (LC 50 thyme essential oils + kaolin or diatomaceous earth) were carried out. The mortality rates registered after 24 h were 74. 19 and 97. 84 % for the combination with kaolin and diatomaceous earth, respectively. Meanwhile, emulsions with 1 μl of these oils have been tested on the target aphid. This treatment has lead after 24 h to a mortality rate of 55. 55 %. The mechanical effect of both abrasive powders has been highlighted through dehydration, shrinkage and deformation of the aphid cuticle. Interestingly, the combination of diatomaceous earth with the T. capitatus essential oils was significantly the most effective to control aphid populations...|$|E
