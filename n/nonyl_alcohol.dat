The acid and its complex were characterised by elemental analysis and spectroscopy. The thermal behaviour of Cd(DNDTP) 2 was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. Removal of Cd(II) from aqueous media by HDDTP solution was also studied. The optimum conditions for removal of Cd(II) were investigated for effects of solvent, pH, contact time, concentration, and inorganic anions. Cd(II) was quantitatively removed from aqueous solutions at the pH range of 0. 5 <pH< 6, under the conditions that the stoichiometric ratio of HDDTP/Cd(II) ≥ 2 / 1. It can be stated that contact of the Cd(II) with HDDTP was sufficient for quantitative removing of cadmium from acidic aqueous solutions...|$|E
40|$|A {{solid-phase}} micro-extraction (SPME) {{procedure for}} analysis of the flavour components of two varieties of Citrus madurensis Lour. (Syn. Citrus microcarpa Bunge), the Philippine calamansi and the Taiwan calamondin, is presented. Fifty-eight components were identified, and grouped into eight classes: 8 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 3 oxygenated monoterpenes, 18 sesquiterpenes, 2 aliphatic hydrocarbons, 10 esters, 11 aldehydes, 3 alcohols and 3 ketones. On the whole, Philippine calamansi juice has statistically higher percentage of ketones, monoterpene hydrocarbons, and sesquiterpenes than calamondin from Taiwan. Principal component analysis (PCA) {{was used as a}} descriptive tool to identify aroma species that contributed strongly to overall flavour constituent's variation. Five principal components were extracted from the data matrix represent a cumulative 84. 1 % of the total variation of aroma concentration. Among the five PCA axes, the distribution of the Philippine calamansi samples was separated nicely from the distribution of the Taiwan calamondin samples along the third and fourth axes graphically. The third axis is the axis of beta-pinene and beta-cubebene. While <b>nonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and linalyl alcohol correlate greatly to the fourth axis. The key components occurring in the Taiwan calamondin and Philippine calamansi were compared and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background Essential oil {{components}} (EOCs) are molecules with interesting {{application in}} pest control, {{these have been}} evaluated against different insect pest from more than 100 years, but their practical use is rather limited. Thus, the enhancement of their bioavailability and manageability due to their dispersion in water can open new perspective for the preparation of formulations for the control of insect pest. In this work, we studied the encapsulation of different monoterpenes in a poloxamer shell in order to prepare aqueous formulations {{that can be used}} for the development of platforms used in pest control. Methods Micellar systems containing a 5 wt% of poloxamer 407 and 1. 25 wt% of the different monoterpenes were prepared. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiments were carried out to characterize the dispersion of the EOCs in water. The pediculicidal activity of these micellar systems was tested on head lice using an ex vivo immersion test. Results The poloxamers allowed the dispersion of EOCs in water due to their encapsulation inside the hydrophobic core of the copolymer micelles. From this study, we concluded that it is possible to make stable micellar systems containing water (> 90 wt%), 1. 25 wt% of different monoterpenes and a highly safe polymer (5 wt% Poloxamer 407). These formulations were effective against head lice with mortality ranging from 30 to 60 %, being the most effective emulsions those containing linalool, 1, 8 -cineole, α-terpineol, thymol, eugenol, geraniol and <b>nonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> which lead to mortalities above 50 %. Discussion Since these systems showed good pediculicidal activity and high physicochemical stability, they could be a new route for the green fabrication of biocompatible and biosustainable insecticide formulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of saponin hemolysis by benzene, indol, and <b>nonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} temperature, and it has been found that these accelerators have negative temperature coefficients. This points to their being concentrated at the cell surface, and to the surface being the seat of their accelerating action. It is shown that the accelerating power of indol (used as a typical accelerator) is constant so long as the lysin in the system is capable of producing lysis per se, but that the acceleration falls off when only sublytic concentrations are present. The relations are expressed in a series of equations, and explained in terms of the reactions among the accelerator, the lysin, and the membrane component, which breaks down in spots, rather than uniformly, when lysis occurs. The argument involves a consideration of the idea that a monolayer of lysin at the cell surface is necessary for hemolysis, of Abramson's hypothesis of "key spots" on the surface, of the rate of escape of hemoglobin from the hemolyzing cell, and of the results of electrophoretic and impedance measurements. The existing theory of the kinetics is extended by introducing the idea of a variation in resistance from point to point in the cell membrane; in this form it describes the situation so far as is at present known, and shows that the results of the various methods of investigation are consistent with each other. The only idea discussed which seems to have little foundation is that lysis is determined by the formation of a monolayer of lysin at the cell surface; when this occurs, it must do so only as a special case. Finally, a semi-quantitative description of the frequency distribution of the resistances in the membrane is derived from existing data. The variation in resistance which it is necessary to assume is quite small, as might be expected {{in the case of a}} membrane with a regular ultra-structure...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Düşük köpürme özelliğine sahip, soğuk suda iyi çözünebilen ve bu özellikleri nedeniyle düşük konsantrasyonlarda bile etkili olan noniyonik yüzey aktif maddeler çok geniş bir kullanım alanına sahiptirler. Noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerden nonil fenol etoksilatlar kısa süre öncesine kadar yüzey aktif madde pazarının % 80 ‘ini oluşturan türler olarak bu pazarda ciddi bir paya sahiptiler. Sucul ortamda yarattıkları olumsuz etkiler anlaşılana kadar nonil fenol etoksilatlar kağıt, tekstil, deri, gıda, boya gibi bir çok endüstriyi kapsayan geniş bir yelpazede yaygın olarak kullanılmaktaydılar. Ancak 1990 ‘lı yılların başlarında endokrin bozucu ve toksik etkilerinin fark edilmesinin ardından nonil fenol etoksilatların yerine kullanılabilecek başka bir noniyonik yüzey aktif madde arayışına girilmiştir. Gelinen bu aşamada birinci alternatif olarak toksik etkileri bilinmeyen, yüksek biyolojik bozunurluğa sahip ve yüzey aktif madde olarak uygulamada nonil fenol etoksilatları ikame edebilecek nonil alkol etoksilatlar görülmektedir. Bahsedilen özellikleri nedeniyle nonil alkol etoksilatların üretimleri ve kullanımları gün geçtikçe artmakta ve yaygınlaşmaktadır. Her ne kadar bilinen herhangi toksik, kanserojenik veya mutajenik etkiye sahip olmasalar da, giderek artan miktarda üretilen ve kullanılan alkol etoksilatların arıtılabilirliklerinin araştırılması ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Literatürde alkol etoksilatların biyolojik olarak arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili gün geçtikçe artan sayıda araştırma yer almasına karşın söz konusu yüzey aktif maddelerin fiziko-kimyasal, elektrokimyasal ve fotokimyasal arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili sınırlı ve yetersiz sayıda araştırma mevcuttur. Bu çalışmanın amacı alkol etoksilatlara örnek teşkil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eter (Brij 30) ‘in 20 mg/L konsantrasyonundaki sulu çözeltilerinin koagülasyon, elektrokoagülsyon ve TiO 2 /UV-A fotokatalitik oksidasyon prosesleri esas alınarak fizikokimyasal ve kimyasal yöntemler ile arıtılabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve maksimum Brij 30 ve organik madde (TOK) giderimini sağlayacak en uygun proses reaksiyon koşullarının belirlenmesidir. Yukarıda belirtilen amaç doğrultusunda yürütülen deneysel çalışmadan elde edilen sonuçlar koagülasyon-flokülasyon ve çelik elektrotların kullanıldığı elektrokoagülasyon proseslerinin gerek Brij 30 gerekse organik madde gideriminde istenilen verimi sağlamadığını göstermiştir. İki farklı TiO 2 katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon deneylerinde Aeroxide PF 2 heterojen katalizörü ile yine istenilen düzeyde giderme verimleri elde edilememiştir. Buna karşılık Degussa P 25 TiO 2 heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon denemelerinde uygun reaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde gerek Brij 30 ‘un tamamı giderilmiş, gerekse % 90 civarında organik madde minerilizasyonu gerçekleştirilmiştir. Elde edilen bu sonuçlardan hareketle Degussa P 25 TiO 2 xvi heterojen katalizörü kullanılarak UV-A ışınımı altında alkol etoksilatları temsil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eterin sulu çözeltilerden uygun reareaksiyon koşulları seçildiğinde etkin şekilde arıtılabildiği sonucuna varılmıştır. Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have low}} foaming properties, are highly soluble {{in cold water}} and are effective even in very low concentrations in water. Because of these advanteges, nonionic surfactants are widely used surface active substances especially in the industries such as leather, food, pulp and paper, cosmetics etc. Nonylphenol ethoxylates which used to dominate the surfactant market with a consumption rate of 80 %, {{have been the most}} preferred nonionic surface active compound. Nonylphenol ethoxylates are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use nonylphenol ethoxylates for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In early 90 ‘s the toxic and endocrine distrupting effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the aquatic environment have been revealed. Nonylphenol, a breakdown product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, has been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen. Concerns have focused on the potential for nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates to cause feminisation in wildlife, such as fish exposed to nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates contaminated effluents, as well as being a potential factor in the increasing incidence of reproductive organ disorders and decreasing sperm counts in men. Whereas nonylphenol ethoxylates is reasonably readily degradable, its breakdown product nonylphenol is more persistent. It has been determined that these compouns exhibit the estrogenetic activity by mimicing the hormones mentioned. Especially in the aquatic environment, fishes are the most affected organisms. It is known that nonylphenol ethoxylates are also very slowly biodegredable and have bioaccumulating property. After realizing the adverse effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the environment, espacially in aquatic environment, several countries have been taken act by regulations restricting production and consumption of nonylphenol ethoxylates. It was necessary to replace nonylphenol ethoxylates with another nonionic surface active agent. At this point alcohol ethoxylates seem to be the most appropriate alternative due to it‘s high biodegredability, low toxicity, high water solubility and surface active effectiveness. Alcohol ethoxylates are the second largest group of surfactants in terms of manufacture (after linear alkylbenzenesulphonates) and the main group of non-ionic surfactants. The main area of alcohol ethoxylate application is in the manufacture of washing powders, liquids etc. Alchol ethoxylates are classifed as easily biodegradable surfactants, in contrast to previously used oxyethylated alkylphenols or oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers. xviii However, the massive stream of alcohol ethoxylates directed into sewage systems and then to sewage treatment, is required strict control in order to prevent pollution of the aquatic environment. A very important chain in this control is the examination of the biodegradability of surfactants prior to their uses in washing powder formulations. After replacing nonylphenol ethoxylates, production and consumption of alcohol ethoxylates have rapidly increased. This progression brought on the requirement of knowlege on the treatability, biodegradability and toxicity properties of alcohol ethoxylates. There are several research on the biodegradability of <b>nonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> ethoxylates, however there are very little information about the chemical treatablity of these compounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the treatability of alcohol ethoxylates in aqueous solutions by coagulation, electrocoagulation and TiO 2 /UV-A photocatalitic oxidation processes and to determine the optimum process conditions for the most effective treatment process. As a model <b>nonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> ethoxylate compound poly(oxyethylene) (4) loryl ether, Brij 30 was selected to be used in the experiments. This study consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter, the purpose and scope of the study was described briefly. In the second chapter, classification of surfactants, properties of surfactants, a brief explanation about toxicity of nonylphenol ethoxyltes, properties of alcohol ethoxylates and treatability of alcohol ethoxylates were defined. In the third chapter, fundamentals of coagulation and electrocoagulation were defined. Basic chemicals‘ reactions which occur during these processes were explained. In the fourth chapter, photochemical oxidation process was described, the fundamentals and basic reactions were explained. The factors which effecting photocatalitic activity were also explained in the end of the chapter. In the fifth chapter, the materials and methods were introduced which were used during the experimental part of the thesis. Since three different processed were used, three different treatment methods were explained. These processes were: classical coagulation-floculation process, electrocoagulation process and TiO 2 catalized photocatalitic oxidation process. For every process the same analytical analysis were applied to the sampes in order to follow the treatment efficiency such as colourimetric surfactant determination and TOC analysis. In the sixth chapter all of the experimental results were evaluated and discussed. In the last chapter of the study the results were briefly evaluated and the most important results were stressed by the explanation of importance. In this experimental study, three different chemical treatment alternatives were evaluated and it was determined that only one of them was suitable to treat model pollutant, Brij 30 compound from its aqueos solution. The first alternative was classical coagulation-flocculation process derived in different coagulant (FeCl 3) concentrations varing between 100 and 1000 mg/L, in pH 6. 5 and 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentration. In this process the least Brij 30 removal was observed with 25 % Brij 30 removal in 100 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage and the highest Brij 30 removal efficiency was achieved with 39 % in 750 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage. These results showed that coagulation-floculation process was not practical for removing Brij 30 from its aqueous solution. xix The second process was electrocoagulation process using stainless steel electrodes and NaCl as electrolyte. Electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6), various NaCl concentrations (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg NaCl/L) and two different current densities (9, 3 and 18, 6 mA/cm 2). When experimental results were evaluated; in 500 mg/L NaCl concentration, current density of 18, 6 mA/cm 2 after 180 minutes 70 % of Brij 30 removal was achieved. In the coagulation-flocultion experiments there was no significant removal result neighter in Brij 30 nor in TOC. The last but the most effective process was photocalalytic oxidation using TiO 2 as catalyst under UV-A radiation. In this experiments firstly two different TiO 2 types (Degussa P 25 and Aeroxide P 2) were compared and it was proved that Degussa P 25 was significantly more effective than Aeroxide P 2 in removing Brij 30 and TOC. The experiments were conducted in 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentrations, in two different pH (original pH ~ 6 and pH= 3) to determine the effect of initial pH, in two different TiO 2 concentrations (1 and 1. 5 g/L) to determine the effect of TiO 2 dosages and for the selected test periods (5, 10, 15, 60, 240, 480 minutes). The aim of experiments were to determine the optimum process terms. In these experiments that in the original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6) and 1 g/L Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage after 15 minutes more than 96 % Brij 30 removal was obtained. Under these experimental conditions only after 240 minutes 64 % TOC removal was achieved. After increasing the Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage to 1. 5 g/L, after 480 minutes of photocatalitic oxidation TOC removal increased to 86 %. In general after decreasing the pH to 3 resulted in decreases the Brij 30 removal efficiencies. The experimental results showed that coagulation-floculation and electrocoagulation processes were not suitable effective treatment methods in removing Brij 30 from aqueous solutions. Additionally very limited organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of TOC could be obtained by appliying these processes. The most effective process was photocatalitic oxidation under UV-A radiation from the three different processes. By using photocatalitic oxidation it is possible to remove practically all of the model pollutant and most of the TOC from the water under mentioned conditions. Even in short reaction periods (15 minutes) high rates of Brij 30 removals are achieved but longer experiment periods (240 - 480 minutes) are needed in order to reach significant TOC removals.
