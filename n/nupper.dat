6000|$|As the omnibus {{went away}} Dr. <b>Nupper</b> joined Mr. Runciman under the archway. [...] "I'm blessed if I can {{understand}} that man," [...] said Runciman. [...] "What is it he's after?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly he ought," [...] said Dr. <b>Nupper.</b> [...] "If he didn't feel {{satisfied}} with what his lordship offered him, why couldn't he ask his lordship to refer the matter {{to a couple of}} farmers who understood it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} loudly triumphant man in Dillsborough was Mr. Mainwaring, the parson, {{when he heard}} of the discomfiture of Senator Gotobed. He could hardly {{restrain}} his joy, and confided first to Dr. <b>Nupper</b> and then to Mr. Runciman his opinion, {{that of all the}} blackguards that had ever put their foot in Dillsborough, that vile Yankee was the worst. Mr. Gotobed was no more a Yankee than was the parson himself;--but of any distinction among the citizens of the United States, Mr. Mainwaring knew very little.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so, Mr. Morton;--and if {{she does}} go to Cheltenham perhaps Lady Ushant had better know." [...] To this Reginald agreed, or half agreed. It {{did not seem to}} him to be of much {{consequence}} what might be done at Cheltenham. He felt certain that the lover was not there. And yet who was there at Dillsborough? He had seen those young Botseys about. Could it possibly be one of them? And during the Christmas vacation the rector's scamp of a son had been home from Oxford,--to whom Mary Masters had barely spoken. Was it young Mainwaring? Or could it be possible that she had turned an eye of favour on Dr. <b>Nupper's</b> elegantly-dressed assistant. There was nothing too monstrous for him to suggest to himself as soon as the attorney had left him.|$|R
6000|$|At 9 {{o'clock on}} the 13th of Meijh I left Sanf Rachisco {{and after a}} tedious journey of nearly fifty minutes arrived at Bolosson, the eastern {{terminus}} of the magnetic tube, on {{the summit of the}} Ultimate Hills. According to Tucker this was anciently a station on the Central Peaceful Railway, and was called [...] "German," [...] in honor of an illustrious dancing master. Prof. <b>Nupper,</b> however, says it was the ancient Nevraska, the capital of Kikago, and geographers generally have accepted that view.|$|E
6000|$|... "'E ain't {{too old to}} take it yet," [...] said Harry. Fred Botsey {{declared}} that he didn't believe in men hunting unless they began young. Whereupon Dr. <b>Nupper</b> {{declared that}} he had never ridden over a fence till he was forty-five, and that he was ready now to ride Fred across country for a new hat. Larry suggested that a man might be a good friend to sport though he didn't ride much himself;--and Runciman again asserted that hunting wasn't everything. Upon the whole Reginald was the favourite. But the occasion was so special that a little supper was ordered, and I fear the attorney did not get home till after twelve.|$|E
6000|$|The {{company at}} the rector's house {{consisted}} of the Senator, the two Mortons, Mr. Surtees the curate, and old Doctor <b>Nupper.</b> Mrs. Mainwaring was not well enough to appear, and the rector therefore was able to indulge himself in {{what he called a}} bachelor party. As a rule he disliked clergymen, but at the last had been driven to invite his curate because he thought six a better number than five for joviality. He began by asking questions as to the Trefoils which were not very fortunate. Of course he had heard that Morton was to marry Arabella Trefoil, and though he made no direct allusion to the fact, as Reginald had done, he spoke in that bland eulogistic tone which clearly showed his purpose. [...] "They went with you to Lord Rufford's, I was told." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope you'll {{have a good}} hunt, Larry." [...] Then {{she retired}} back to the bridge and again looked to her lover to know whether he would approve. There were so few there, and Larry had been so far apart from the others, that she was sure no one had heard the few words which had passed between them; nor could anyone have {{observed}} what she had done, unless it were old <b>Nupper,</b> or Mr. Runciman, or Tony Tuppett. But yet she thought that it perhaps was bold, {{and that he would}} be angry. But he came up to her, and placing himself between her and Kate, whispered into her ear, [...] "Bravely done, my girl. After a little I will try to be as brave, but I could never do it as well." [...] Larry in the meantime had moved his mare away, and before the Master had arrived, was walking slowly up his own road to Chowton Farm.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Mary almost {{understood}} it, but was {{not quite}} sure of her friend's meaning. She was, however, quite sure that if such were the wish of Lady Ushant's heart, Lady Ushant was wishing in vain. She had twice walked back to Dillsborough with Reginald Morton, {{and he had been}} more sedate, more middle-aged, less like a lover than ever. She knew now that she might safely walk with him, being sure that he was no more likely to talk of love than would have been old Dr. <b>Nupper</b> had she accepted the offer which he had made her of a cast in his gig. And now that Reginald would probably become Squire of Bragton it was more impossible than ever. As Squire of Bragton he would seek some highly born bride, quite out of her way, whom she could never know. And then she would see neither him--nor Bragton any more. Would it not have been better that she should have married Larry Twentyman {{and put an end to}} so many troubles beside her own? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the matter}} of wine," [...] said the Senator, [...] "I don't think that I have {{happened}} to come across anything so good {{in this country as}} our old Madeiras. But then, sir, we have been fortunate in our climate. The English atmosphere is not one in which wine seems to reach its full perfection." [...] The rector heaved a deep sigh as he looked up to the ceiling with his hands in his trowsers-pockets. He knew, or thought that he knew, that no one could ever get a glass of good wine in the United States. He knew, or thought that he knew, that the best wine in the world was brought to England. He knew, or thought he knew, that in no other country was wine so well understood, so diligently sought for, and so truly enjoyed as in England. And he imagined that it was less understood and less sought for and less enjoyed in the States than in any other country. He did not as yet know the Senator well enough to fight with him at his own table, and could only groan and moan and look up at the ceiling. Doctor <b>Nupper</b> endeavoured to take away the sting by smacking his lips, and Reginald Morton, who did not in truth care a straw what he drank, was moved to pity and declared the claret to be very fine. [...] "I have nothing to say against it," [...] said the Senator, who was not in the least abashed.|$|E
6000|$|From Impington Park {{they went}} in a {{straight}} line to Littleton Gorse skirting certain small woods which the fox disdained to enter. Here the pace was very good, and the country was all grass. It was the very cream of the U. R. U.; and could the Senator have read the feelings of the dozen leading men in the run, he would have owned that they were for the time satisfied with their amusement. Could he have read Kate Masters' feelings {{he would have had to}} own that she was in an earthly Paradise. When the pony paused at the big brook, brought his four legs steadily down on the brink as though he were going to bathe, then with a bend of his back leaped to the other side, dropping his hind legs in and instantly recovering them, and when she saw that Larry had waited just a moment for her, watching to see what might be her fate, she was in heaven. [...] "Wasn't it a big one, Larry?" [...] she asked in her triumph. [...] "He did go in behind!" [...] "Those cats of things always do it somehow," [...] Larry replied darting forward again and keeping the Major well in his eye. The brook had stopped one or two, and tidings came up that Ned Botsey had broken his horse's back. The knowledge of the brook had sent some round by the road,--steady riding men such as Mr. Runciman and Doctor <b>Nupper.</b> Captain Glomax had got into it and came up afterwards wet through, with temper by no means improved. But the glory of the day had been the way in which Lord Rufford's young bay mare, who had never seen a brook before, had flown over it with the Major on her back, taking it, as Larry afterwards described, [...] "just in her stride, without condescending to look at it. I was just behind the Major, and saw her do it." [...] Larry understood that a man should never talk of his own place in a run, but he didn't quite understand that neither should he talk of having been close to another man who was supposed to have had the best of it. Lord Rufford, who didn't talk much of these things, quite understood that he had received full value for his billet and mount in the improved character of his mare.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's that nasty, beastly, drunken club," [...] said Mrs. Masters to her unfortunate {{husband on}} the Wednesday morning. It may perhaps {{be remembered that}} the {{poisoned}} fox {{was found on the}} Saturday, and it may be imagined that Mr. Goarly had risen in importance since that day. On the Saturday Bean with a couple of men employed by Lord Rufford, had searched the wood, and found four or five red herrings poisoned with strychnine. There had been no doubt about the magnitude of the offence. On the Monday a detective policeman, dressed of course in rustic disguise but not the less known to every one in the place, was wandering about between Dillsborough and Dillsborough Wood and making futile inquiries as to the purchase of strychnine,--and also as to the purchase of red herrings. But every one knew, and such leading people as Runciman and Dr. <b>Nupper</b> were not slow to declare, that Dillsborough was the only place in England in which one might be sure that those articles had not been purchased. And on the Tuesday it began to be understood that Goarly had applied to Bearside, the other attorney, in reference to his claim against Lord Rufford's pheasants. He had contemptuously refused the 7s. 6d. an acre offered him, and put his demand at 40s. As to the poisoned fox and the herrings and the strychnine Goarly declared that he didn't care if there were twenty detectives in the place. He stated it to be his opinion that Larry Twentyman had put down the poison. It was all very well, Goarly said, for Larry to be fond of gentlemen and to ride to hounds, and make pretences;--but Larry liked his turkeys as well as anybody else, and Larry had put down the poison. In this matter Goarly overreached himself. No one in Dillsborough could be brought to believe that. Even Harry Stubbings was ready to swear that he should suspect himself as soon. But nothing was clearer than this,--that Goarly {{was going to make a}} stand against the hunt and especially against Lord Rufford. He had gone to Bearside and Bearside had taken up the matter in a serious way. Then it became known very quickly that Bearside had already received money, and it was surmised that Goarly had some one at his back. Lord Rufford had lately ejected from a house of his on the other side of the county a discontented litigious retired grocer from Rufford, who had made some money and had set himself up in a pretty little residence with a few acres of land. The man had made himself objectionable and had been dispossessed. The man's name was Scrobby; and hence had come these sorrows. This was the story that had already made itself known in Dillsborough on the Tuesday evening. But up to that time not a tittle of evidence had come to light as to the purchase of the red herrings or the strychnine. All that was known was the fact that had not Tony Tuppett stopped the hounds before they reached the wood, there must have been a terrible mortality. [...] "It's that nasty, beastly, drunken club," [...] said Mrs. Masters to her husband. Of course it was at this time known to the lady that her husband had thrown away Goarly's business and that it had been transferred to Bearside. It was also surmised by her, as it was by the town in general, that Goarly's business would come to considerable dimensions;--just the sort of case as would have been sure to bring popularity if carried through, as Nickem, the senior clerk, would have carried it. And as soon as Scrobby's name was heard by Mrs. Masters, there was no end to the money in the lady's imagination to which this very case might not have amounted.|$|E
