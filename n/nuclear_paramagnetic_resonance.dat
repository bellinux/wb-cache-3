40|$|Pieter Zeeman {{observed}} in 1896 the splitting of optical spectral {{lines in the}} field of an electromagnet. Since then, the splitting of energy levels proportional to an external magnetic field has been called the "Zeeman effect". The "Zeeman resonance effect " causes magnetic resonances which are classified under radio frequency spectroscopy (rf spectroscopy). In these resonances, the transitions between two branches of a single energy level split in an external magnetic field are measured in the megahertz and gigahertz range. In 1944, Jevgeni Konstantinovitch Savoiski discovered electron <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance.</b> Shortly thereafter in 1945, nuclear magnetic resonance was demonstrated almost simultaneously in Boston by Edward Mills Purcell and in Stanford by Felix Bloch. Nuclear magnetic resonance was sometimes called <b>nuclear</b> induction or <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>resonance.</b> It is generally abbreviated to NMR. So as not to scare prospective patients in medicine, reference to the "nuclear " character of NMR is dropped and the magnetic resonance based imaging systems (scanner) found in hospitals are simply referred to as "magnetic resonance imaging " (MRI) ...|$|R
40|$|Micellar {{incorporation}} of hydrophobic molecular receptors is a promising strategy to obtain efficient nanodevices {{that work in}} water. In order to fully evaluate the potential of this approach, information on the localization and orientation of the receptor inside the micelle are necessary. Systematic studies undertaken on a uranyl−salophen receptor incorporated into CTABr and CTACl micelles show that <b>nuclear</b> magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> relaxation enhancement (NMR-PRE) experiments are particularly suitable to provide this type of information. The effect on the measurements of surfactant concentration, nature of the surfactant polar head, and ionic strength is also reported. Notably the normalization procedure applied to the obtained data can be considered of general application, thus enabling the comparison of information collected for different types of supramolecular micelle/receptor systems.

40|$|SummarySkeletal {{development}} and invasion by tumor cells depends on proteolysis of collagen by the pericellular metalloproteinase MT 1 -MMP. Its hemopexin-like (HPX) domain binds to collagen substrates to facilitate their digestion. Spin labeling and <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>nuclear</b> magnetic <b>resonance</b> (NMR) detection have revealed how the HPX domain docks to collagen I–derived triple helix. Mutations impairing triple-helical peptidase activity corroborate the interface. Saturation transfer difference NMR suggests rotational averaging around the longitudinal {{axis of the}} triple-helical peptide. Part of the interface emerges as unique and potentially targetable for selective inhibition. The triple helix crosses the junction of blades I and II at a 45 ° angle to the symmetry axis of the HPX domain, placing the scissile Gly∼Ile bond near the HPX domain and shifted ∼ 25  Å from MMP- 1 complexes. This {{raises the question of}} the MT 1 -MMP catalytic domain folding over the triple helix during catalysis, a possibility accommodated by the flexibility between domains suggested by atomic force microscopy images...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> of spin labels offers a {{convenient}} technique for monitoring the complement-mediated immune lysis of erythrocyte ghosts, and sensitized phospholipid liposomes. The ghosts or liposomes are loaded with a concentrated solution of a water-soluble, membrane-impermeable spin label, {{so that there is}} a strong exchange broadening of the <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> signal due to labels enclosed within the liposomes or ghosts. Complement-mediated lysis releases the labels into a dilute solution, where a relatively sharp and intense <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> signal is detected...|$|R

40|$|The CUG-BP, Elav-like family (CELF) of RNA-binding {{proteins}} control {{gene expression}} {{at a number}} of dif-ferent levels by regulating pre-mRNA splicing, deadenylation and mRNA stability. We present struc-tural insights into the binding selectivity of CELF member 1 (CELF 1) for GU-rich mRNA target se-quences of the general form 50 -UGUNxUGUNyUGU and identify a high affinity interaction (Kd 100 nM for x= 2 and y= 4) with simultaneous binding of all three RNA recognition motifs within a single 15 -nt binding element. RNA substrates spin-labelled at either the 30 or 50 terminus result in differential <b>nuclear</b> magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> relax-ation enhancement effects, which are consistent with a non-sequential 2 - 1 - 3 arrangement of the three RNA recognition motifs on UGU sites in a 50 to 30 orientation along the RNA target. We further demonstrate that CELF 1 binds to dispersed single-stranded UGU sites at the base of an RNA hairpin providing a structural rationale for recognition of CUG expansion repeats and splice site junctions in the regulation of alternative splicing...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{simulate}} electron <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectra of spin-labeled proteins that explicitly includes the protein structure {{in the vicinity of}} the attached spin label. The method is applied to a spin-labeled polyleucine alpha-helix trimer. From short (6 ns) stochastic dynamics simulations of this trimer, an effective potential energy function is calculated. Interaction with secondary and tertiary structures determine the reorientational motion of the spin label side chains. After reduction to a single particle problem, long stochastic dynamic trajectories (700 ns) of the spin label side-chain reorientation are calculated from which the Lamor frequency trajectory and subsequently the electron <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectrum is determined. The simulated spectra agree well with experimental electron <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> spectra of bacteriorhodopsin mutants with spin labels in similar secondary and tertiary environments as in the polyleucine...|$|R
