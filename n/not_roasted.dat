Because coffee belongs to the cash crops we have focus on the production. We have analysed {{the structure of the}} trade concerning the green (<b>not</b> <b>roasted)</b> coffee, roasted coffee and coffee extracts, essences or concentrates. The analyses of production show enormous differences between developed and developing countries on the supply side. Dissimilarity appeared in the price system. Our results show that developing countries (especially least developed countries) cannot fully benefit from the international trade because they are placed just on the lowest level of the production vertical line. The results prove that there must exist strong influence of the supply chains. This is connected with the export of roasted coffee and import of the green coffee.

40|$|Mature and {{immature}} roasted peanuts {{are reportedly}} {{different in the}} level of Maillard reaction adducts (MRA) and IgE binding (i. e., allergenic capacity). Heating and sugar-protein interaction are the cause for the difference. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if mature and immature raw peanuts (<b>not</b> <b>roasted)</b> are also different through treatment with a reducing sugar such as ribose, glucose or fructose at a mild temperature. Extracts from mature and immature raw peanuts were treated with individual sugars at 37 ?C and 50 ?C, respectively, for 0 - 10 days, and then assayed for MRA with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) in a time-course manner for 60 min. IgE binding was determined in an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a pooled plasma from peanut-allergic individuals. Of the sugars tested, only ribose produced a big difference or a unique curve pattern in MRA between treated mature and immature peanuts. The unique curve pattern was more pronounced at 50 ?C (day 5 - 10) than at 37 ?C. IgE binding under this condition increased, but only with the ribose-treated mature raw peanut. It was concluded that mature and immature raw peanuts were different in MRA and IgE binding when treated with ribose only, and that under such a condition, mature and immature raw peanuts could be identified...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{based on the premise that}} if CARICOM’s {{agricultural}} sector in general, and more specifically the export sub-sector, is to thrive in the rapidly changing trade environment there has to be a continuous systematic assessment of market opportunities and competitiveness status. Such an assessment however, requires a clear understanding of the multifaceted concept of competitiveness and its major determinants. This paper seeks to contribute to the regional discussion of competitiveness, through the exploration of the theoretical and empirical dimensions of the concept within the context of CARICOM’s export of specialty crops to the United States. The paper uses a methodology heavily based on the Module to Analyze the Growth of International Commerce (MAGIC) software program developed by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). This programming module uses a variation of the classical and modified shift share or constant market share (CMS) analyses. Findings suggest that CARICOM, over the period 1991 - 2004, has generally not been competitive in the US import market for fresh (non-processed) specialty crops. Only three crops (pepper, papaya, and coffee (<b>not</b> <b>roasted)</b> exhibited increased competitiveness. However, these crops held very low market shares and exhibited the highly transient nature of competitiveness. The challenge for the Region is how to effectively move these very low market shares to higher levels within the context of transient behavior and a fierce rivalry for the US import market..

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the risks {{following}} from the heat processing of food with focus on grilling and hygienic knowledge of boarders. It is split into the theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical part describes and clarifies at first the heat processing of food generally {{as well as the}} changes taking place there, based on professional books and internet sources. Afterwards, the attention is devoted to operational and personal hygiene. Finally the thesis presents kinds of grills and analyzes chemical and microbial risks. In the practical part, the research was carried out by the quantitative method of questionnaires (CAWI), sent and handed over to a certain sample of inhabitants of the South-Bohemian Region. The questionnaires were anonymous and they included addressing the respondent and introduction for him/her, stating the reasons of the research and information to questionnaire treatment and processing. The questionnaire elaboration within this thesis was focused on the degree of the knowledge of public concerning microbial risks following from insufficiently treated food and chemical (first of all carcinogenic) substances coming into being during the heat processing of food, observing hygienic principles and comparing procedures while grilling in households and restaurants. The questionnaire for the lay public (households) consisted of 31 questions in total. The questionnaire for the professional public (employees of restaurant facilities) consisted of 41 questions. Both of these questionnaires contained open, half-open and closed questions. The practical part involved also the secondary analysis of the data to occurrence of illnesses caused by food based on monthly reports acquired from the department of epidemiology of the Regional Hygienic Station of the South-Bohemian Region, which was statistically evaluated by me. The main target of this thesis was to find out the level of knowledge of the professional and lay public about the risks following from grilling, to accentuate them and to compare the grilling procedure in the restaurant facilities and in households. Two hypotheses were set for the purpose of the research. Hypotheses, H 1 : ?The knowledge of risks of boarders following from home grilling depends on education? and H 2 : ?Risks of health problems following from grilling due to failure to observe the personal hygiene occur in more households?, were processed statistically by means of Pearson's chi-squared-test. All the acquired data were processed by Microsoft Office Excel in the form of charts and diagrams. During the thesis, the set targets were achieved and based on the statistic findings, both hypotheses were confirmed. It follows from the results that the questioned sample of the public from the South-Bohemian Region is not sufficiently informed of the risks following from grilling and how to eliminate these risks or prevent them. It was proved that the personal hygiene is observed more strictly in the restaurants than by the family members living in one household and therefore there is a higher risk of occurrence of health problems from grilling in households. Moreover the employees of restaurant facilities shall not only respect the personal hygiene, but also the operational hygiene and shall proceed according to the critical control points system (HACCP). But these rules are not respected in some cases, the reason of a complaint in 30 % (3 of 10) restaurant facilities was that the grilled meal was <b>not</b> <b>roasted</b> enough. The thesis may serve as information material for the wide public, for boarders as well as operators and employees of various restaurant facilities. Its target is to point out the possible health risks following from the consumption of grilled food and also to describe how to decrease these risks on the lowest possible level, or to prevent them completely...|$|E
