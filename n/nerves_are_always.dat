40|$|AbstractPeripheral {{nerve and}} {{vascular}} patterns are congruent {{in the adult}} vertebrate, but this has been disputed in vertebrate embryos. The most detailed of these studies have used the avian forelimb as a model system, yet neurovascular anatomical relationships and critical vascular remodeling events remain inadequately characterized in this model. To address this, {{we have used a}} combination of intravascular marker injection, multilabel fluorescent stereomicroscopy, and confocal microscopy to analyze the spatiotemporal relationships between peripheral nerves and blood vessels in the forelimb of 818 quail embryos from E 2 (HH 13) to E 15 (HH 41). We find that the neurovascular anatomical relationships established during development are highly stereotypic and congruent. Blood vessels typically arise before their corresponding nerves, but there are several critical exceptions to this rule. The vascular pattern is extensively remodeled from the earliest stage examined (E 2; HH 13), whereas the peripheral nerves, the first of which enter the forelimb at E 3. 5 –E 4 (HH 21 –HH 24), have a progressively unfolding pattern that, once formed, remains essentially unchanged. The adult neurovascular pattern is not established until E 8 (HH 34). Peripheral <b>nerves</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> found to track close and parallel to the vasculature. As they track distally, peripheral nerves always lie {{on the side of the}} vasculature away from the center of the forelimb. Neurovascular patterns have a hierarchy of congruence that is highest in the dorsoventral plane, followed by the anteroposterior, and lastly the proximodistal planes...|$|E

50|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} from the {{anterior}} rami of nerves L1 to L4 and some fibers from T12. With only five roots and two divisions, {{it is less}} complex than the brachial plexus and {{gives rise to a}} number of nerves including the femoral nerve and accessory obturator nerve. The pectineus muscle is considered a composite muscle as the innervation is by the femoral nerve (L2 and L3) and occasionally (20% of the population) a branch of the obturator nerve called the accessory obturator <b>nerve.</b> When it <b>is</b> present, the accessory obturator nerve innervates a portion of the pectineus muscle, entering the muscle on its dorsomedial aspect. The greater nerve to the muscle <b>is</b> the femoral <b>nerve.</b> Unlike the obturator accessory nerve, the femoral <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> present and provides the sole innervation for the pectineus muscle in over 90% of cases.

40|$|The {{marginal}} mandibular <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> studied {{post mortem}} in 50 human subjects. The <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> {{found to be}} presented by one branch (32 %), two branches (40 %) and three branches (28 %). The relationship of the nerve to the lower border of the mandible was variable: it was either totally above the lower border of the mandible (28 %), below the mandible (44 %) or in 28 % of cases lying above and below it. The branch which lay below the lower border of the mandible crossed it opposite the masseter muscle or opposite the facial artery or else anterior to the facial artery. The branches which lay above the lower border of the mandible <b>were</b> <b>always</b> deep into the superficial layer of the parotid fascia, while below the mandible all the branches ran intrafascially. The termination of the <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> deep to {{the muscles of the}} lower lip.

40|$|Limb {{lengthening}} is used {{to correct}} leg length discrepancy and to increase stature. The reported frequency of peripheral nerve complications varies from 5 % to 30 %, but is probably underestimated. Damage may be direct or be caused by overstretching of the nerves. We have used electrophysiological tests to evaluate five patients during bilateral tibial lengthening by the Ilizarov method. Results after 24 to 107 days oflengthening showed electromyographic evidence of partial muscle denervation in all 10 limbs, with reduced motor conduction velocities in two tibial nerves and three common peroneal nerves. The sensory conduction velocity in the sural <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> unchanged.

40|$|Background: The {{anatomical}} {{orientation of}} {{structures in the}} axilla has not been well studied, although {{it is essential for}} a neat and safe dissection. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relations between neurovascular structures in the axilla as they were encountered during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer. Methods: This was a prospective study of 29 consecutive ALNDs accompanying either mastectomy or wide local excision. The dissections were conducted in a stepwise manner and the orientation of the structures was determined as the dissections advanced from superficial to deeper planes. Results: The medial pectoral pedicle was the most superficial neurovascular structure encountered during the dissections and was curled around the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle in most cases. The intercostobrachial nerve lay 1 – 2  cm behind and below, and the axillary vein was located 2 – 3  cm behind and above the pedicle. The long thoracic <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> constantly found 2 – 3  cm behind the intercostobrachial nerve. The thoracodorsal <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> accompanied by a posterior tributary of the axillary vein. Conclusion: Relations between neurovascular structures in the axilla are predictable.

2500|$|The {{condition}} currently {{known as}} CRPS was originally described during the American Civil War by Silas Weir Mitchell, who is sometimes also credited with inventing the name [...] "causalgia." [...] However, this term was actually coined by Mitchell's friend Robley Dunglison from the Greek words for heat and for pain. Contrary {{to what is}} commonly accepted, it emerges that these causalgias were certainly major by {{the importance of the}} vasomotor and sudomotor symptoms but stemmed from minor neurological lesions. Mitchell even thought that the cause of CRPS came from the cohabitation of the altered and unaltered cutaneous fibres on the same nerve distribution territory. In the 1940s, the term reflex sympathetic dystrophy came into use to describe this condition, based on the theory that sympathetic hyperactivity was involved in the pathophysiology. In 1959, Noordenbos observed in causalgia patients that [...] "the damage of the <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> partial." [...] Misuse of the terms, as well as doubts about the underlying pathophysiology, led to calls for better nomenclature. In 1993, a special consensus workshop held in Orlando, Florida, provided the umbrella term [...] "complex regional pain syndrome", with causalgia and RSD as subtypes.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{contradictory}} {{information about}} the course and distribution of the nerves supplying the breast, surgical techniques using an inferior pedicle have been recommended over those using a superior pedicle for preserving the nipple-areolar sensation after surgery. This anatomical {{study was designed to}} quantify the nerve branches preserved in inferior and superior pedicles after reduction mammaplasty performed on cadavers. Reduction mammaplasty was done on four fresh cadavers (within 48 h of death) using a superior pedicle on the right and an inferior pedicle on the left in a standard way. The pedicle was cut at its base and then fixed in formalin. The base was divided in biopsy specimens and embedded in paraffin. The <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> quantified and located in each pedicle with haematoxylin-eosin stain and light-microscopic evaluation. Histological evaluation of the pedicles showed the presence of a variable number of nerves (between one and seven) within two superior pedicles and three inferior pedicles. The <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> located in fibrous tissue and accompanied by vessels in most cases. The <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> found superficially and were most likely to be located in {{the central part of the}} pedicle. Our results showed that including the nerves within the pedicle is technically uncertain regardless of the mammaplasty technique used. The final recovery of sensation in the breast after mammaplasty seems to result from the regeneration of severed cutaneous nerve branches or the remaining cutaneous innervation rather than the preserved adjacent cutaneous branches. © 2001 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.

60|$|A {{start from}} a sudden noise, when the {{stimulus}} is conveyed through the auditory <b>nerves,</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> accompanied in grown-up persons by the winking of the eyelids.[13] I observed, however, that though my infants started at sudden sounds, when under a fortnight old, {{they certainly did}} not always wink their eyes, and I believe never did so. The start of an older infant apparently represents a vague catching hold of something to prevent falling. I shook a pasteboard box close before the eyes {{of one of my}} infants, when 114 days old, and it did not in the least wink; but when I put a few comfits into the box, holding it in the same position as before, and rattled them, the child blinked its eyes violently every time, and started a little. It was obviously impossible that a carefully-guarded infant could have learnt by experience that a rattling sound near its eyes indicated danger to them. But such experience will have been slowly gained at a later age during a long series of generations; and from what we know of inheritance, there is nothing improbable in the transmission of a habit to the offspring at an earlier age than that at which it was first acquired by the parents.|$|R
40|$|Abstract】Objective: Although most {{of nerve}} in-juries {{associated}} with Monteggia fracture-dislocation in children are neurapraxias and will recover spontaneously after conservative treatment, surgical {{exploration of the}} in-volved <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> required in the cases with the en-trapment of posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). However, the necessity and time frame for surgical intervention for specific patterns of nerve dysfunction remains controversial. The aim of the report is to observe and understand the pathology of PIN injury associated with Monteggia frac-ture-dislocation in children, and to propose the possible indication for the exploration of nerve. Methods: Eight cases, six boys and two girls, with Monteggia fracture-dislocation complicated by PIN injury, managed operatively at the authors’ Hospital from 2007 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients under-went the attempted closed reduction before they received exploration of PIN, with open reduction and internal fixation or successful closed reduction. Results: The PIN {{was found to be}} trapped acutely posterior to the radiocapitellar joint in 4 out of 5 Type III Bado’s Monteggia fractures. In the remaining cases, since there were longer time intervals from injury to operation, chronic compressive changes and epineural fibrosis of ra-dial <b>nerve</b> <b>were</b> visualized. After a microsurgical neurolysis performed, the complete recovery in the <b>nerve</b> function <b>was</b> obtained in all the cases during the follow-up. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that every case of type III Monteggia fracture-dislocation with decreased or absent function of muscles innervated by PIN and an irreducible radial head in children should be viewed as an indication for immediate surgical exploration of the involved nerve to exclude a potential PIN entrapment.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the sequence of}} maturation of sensory nerve terminals that can be identified on primate facial guard hairs. At birth, the sensory innervation of both guard and vellus hairs is mature in that lanceolate, Ruffini, and free nerve ending (FNE) terminals can be identified and resemble those of the adult. Presumptive lanceolate terminals can be identified {{at the beginning of}} the third trimester of gestation, and other axons present are either Ruffini or FNEs, but definite identification is not possible. In the latter half of the second trimester only axons arranged circumferentially are present, resembling FNE or Ruffini terminals. Some of these axons directly abut the hair follicle and might eventually become lanceolate endings. The earliest nerve terminals associated with hairs cytologically resemble FNE or Ruffini terminals. At the onset of hair differentiation in the early part of the second trimester, <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> associated with developing epithelial hair placodes. Branching Schwann cells in the axons radiating toward the epidermis in these youngest embryos studied were best identified by electron microscopy. The early development of afferent nerve fibers in hairy skin provides an anatomical substrate for the known reflexogenic activity of primate embryos. Adequate cytologic criteria are thus available for the identification of sensory terminals in growing, differentiating, and presumably regenerating axons in primate hairy skin...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Phrenic <b>nerve</b> {{transfer}} has <b>been</b> {{used for}} treating lesions of the brachial plexus since 1970. Although, today, surgeons are more experienced with the technique, {{there are still}} widespread concerns about its effects on pulmonary function. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of this procedure. METHODS: Fourteen patients with complete palsy of the upper limb were submitted to phrenic nerve transfer as part of a strategy for surgical reconstruction of their plexuses. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and 2 patients were followed for less than 2 years. Of the remaining 10 patients, 9 (90 %) were male. The lesions affected both sides equally. The mean age of the patients was 24. 8 years (range, 14 - 43 years), and the mean interval from injury to surgery was 6 months (range, 3 - 9 months). The phrenic <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> transferred to the musculocutaneous nerve, and a nerve graft (mean length, 8 cm; range, 4. 5 - 12 cm) was necessary in all cases. RESULTS: There was no major complication related to the surgery. Seven patients (70 %) recovered functional level biceps strength (Medical Research Council grade >= 3). All of the patients exhibited a transient decrease in pulmonary function tests, but without clinical respiratory problems.

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study {{was performed to}} examine whether chronic occupational exposure to pentachlorophenol (PCP) or its compounds causes measurable alterations in the conduction velocity in peripheral nerves as an "adverse effect. " In total, the results of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) determinations in 1980 and 1984 in 10 subjects (7 men, 3 women) who had been exposed {{for an average of}} 16 years (range 4 - 24) were available. The concentrations of PCP in the air at the workplace varied between 0. 3 and 180 micrograms/m 3 and were thus below the maximum allowed concentration (MAK value) of 500 micrograms/m 3. The biological monitoring carried out showed the following results: PCP in the serum: 38 - 1270 micrograms/l; PCP in the urine: 8 - 1224 micrograms/l. Compared with the upper normal limits (PCP in the serum 150 micrograms/l, PCP in the urine 60 micrograms/l), distinct internal exposure to PCP has resulted in some of the employees. Determinations of the NCV of motor and sensory nerve fibres (ulnar, median, peroneal, and sural <b>nerve)</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> in the normal range. A significant difference in the NCV for the period 1980 - 4 could not be detected. In addition, the correlation analyses did not show any hints of "dose-effect relations.

40|$|Purpose: Lower limb {{anesthesia}} (LLA) {{requires the}} combination of, at least, three-in-one and sciatic nerve (SCN) blocks. Anterior approaches {{are easier to}} perform with minimal discomfort in supine patients, specially for traumatology. Feasibility of a single needle entry combined approach is reported. Clinical features: The combined landmark was applied in 119 ASA I and II patients (32 - 68 yr) scheduled for surgery below the knee. Needle (nerve stimulation applied through a single 150 -mm long b-bevelled insulated needle) was inserted at the midpoint between the two classical approaches. Thirty and 15 mL of 0. 5 % ropivacaine were injected close to the femoral and the SCN, respectively. During the following 45 min, the extent of sensory block and knee and ankle motor block were assessed. Landmarks were determined within 1. 7 min (0. 7 - 2. 2 min). The entire procedure was performed within 4. 2 min (2. 9 - 7. 1 min) from {{the determination of the}} landmark to the SCN infiltration. The three-in-one technique was successful in 89. 9 % while SCN was successful in 94. 9 %. Femoral and tibial <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> blocked. Blockade of the posterior cutaneous femoral <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> observed in 78 % of patients. The extent {{and the quality of the}} sensory block always allowed surgery.

40|$|Background: Plantar heel pain {{may result}} from several {{conditions}} such as tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) and plantar fasciitis. The dorsiflexion-eversion test is used to diagnose TTS, whereas the windlass test is used for plantar fasciitis. Given the similarity between both tests, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate whether these tests are able to selectively load the structures which they aim to examine. Methods: Both tests were evaluated in six cadavers by measuring strain in the plantar fascia, tibial nerve, lateral plantar nerve (LPN), and medial plantar nerve (MPN) using miniature displacement transducers. Longitudinal excursion of the <b>nerves</b> <b>was</b> measured with a digital caliper. Results: With the dorsiflexion-eversion test, dorsiflexion and eversion of the ankle in combination with extension of the metatarsophalangeal (NITP) joints significantly increased strain in the tibial nerve (+ 1. 1 %), LPN (+ 2. 2 %), and MPN (+ 3. 3 %) but also in the plantar fascia (+ 1. 2 %) (all: p = 0. 016). Both components (dorsiflexion-eversion and MTP extension) resulted in significant increases. With the windlass test, extension of all MTP joints significantly increased strain in the plantar fascia (+ 0. 4 %, p = 0. 016), but also in the tibial nerve (+ 0. 4 %, p = 0. 016), LPN (+ 0. 8 %, p = 0. 032) and MPN (+ 2. 0 %, p = 0. 016). Excursion of the <b>nerves</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in the distal direction but only reached significance for the tibial nerve (6. 9 mm, p = 0. 016) and LPN (2. 2 mm, p = 0. 032) during the dorsiflexion-eversion test. Conclusions: Both tests mechanically challenge various structures that have been associated with plantar heel pain.

40|$|Background Context: Innervation of {{anatomical}} structures {{is fundamental}} to their capacity to generate nociceptive impulses. Cervical spine meniscoids are hypothesized to be contributors to neck pain; however, their innervation is not comprehensively understood. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the presence and morphology of nerve fibers within cervical spine meniscoids and adjacent joint capsules. Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study. Patient Sample: The sample consists of cervical hemispines of 12 embalmed cadavers (mean [standard deviation] age 82. 9 [6. 5] years, six female, six left). Either the right or the left half of the cervical spine (hemispine) of each cadaver {{was included in the}} sample. So six left sides and six right sides of the cadaver cervical spines made up the 12 hemispines that formed the sample. Methods: Cervical spine meniscoids and adjacent joint capsules were excised from lateral atlantoaxial and cervical zygapophyseal (C 2 -C 3 to C 6 -C 7) joints (n= 67), then paraffin embedded. Meniscoids were sectioned sagittally (5 ¿µm), slide mounted, and immunohistochemistry was performed using primary antibodies to neurofilament heavy (NF-H) and pan-neurofilament (Pan-NF) to identify nerve tissue. The study was supported by institutional graduate student funding. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. Results: Seventy-seven meniscoids (23 lateral atlantoaxial, 54 cervical zygapophyseal) were extracted and processed (154 sections in total). Sixty-four individual <b>nerve</b> fiber bundles <b>were</b> identified (26 NF-H positive, 38 Pan-NF positive) from 14 meniscoids. Nerves immunoreactive to both NF-H and Pan-NF were identified in 13 of 77 meniscoids (10 of 14 lateral atlantoaxial joint) from 11 joints (eight cadavers). <b>Nerves</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> located in joint capsules except three exclusively Pan-NF immunoreactive nerve fiber bundles from two adipose meniscoids. Conclusions: The low nerve prevalence in elderly cervical spine meniscoids, with nerves only found in two adipose type meniscoids, suggests these structures may play a minimal role in cervical nociception generation in this demographic. The joint capsules, which were more frequently innervated, appear to be more likely generators of nociception in the elderly.

40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{determine}} the extent and direct significance of cervical nerve injury after carotid endarterectomy. Material and methods: fifty-two patients (61 operations) were followed by means of patient history and neurological examination between 3 and 55 months following carotid endarterectomy. Results: sixteen operated sites showed normal sensitivity. Patients assessed 3 – 6 months after surgery showed on average a neurological loss of 3. 4 points (scale from 0 – 4). Patients assessed after 7 – 12 months had on average a deficit of 2. 1 points. After 13 – 24 months the score was at 1. 4 and after the second postoperative year the score yielded only 0. 4 points. Conclusion: loss of cervical <b>nerve</b> sensation <b>is</b> <b>always</b> present after carotid endarterectomy but tends to improve with time. However, the timing and extent of this improvement is unpredictable. Patients are usually not disturbed by these changes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The suprascapular <b>nerve</b> (SSN) block <b>is</b> {{frequently}} {{performed for}} different shoulder pain conditions and for perioperative and postoperative pain control after shoulder surgery. Blind and image-guided techniques have been described, {{all of which}} target the nerve within the supraspinous fossa or at the suprascapular notch. This classic target point <b>is</b> not <b>always</b> ideal when ultrasound (US) is used because it is located deep under the muscles, and hence the <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> not <b>always</b> visible. Blocking the nerve in the supraclavicular region, where it passes underneath the omohyoid muscle, could be an attractive alternative. METHODS: In the first step, 60 volunteers were scanned with US, both in the supraclavicular and the classic target area. The visibility of the SSN in both regions was compared. In the second step, 20 needles were placed into or immediately next to the SSN in the supraclavicular region of 10 cadavers. The accuracy of needle placement was determined by injection of dye and following dissection. RESULTS: In the supraclavicular region of volunteers, the <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> identified in 81 % of examinations (95 % confidence interval [CI], 74 %- 88 %) and located at a median depth of 8 mm (interquartile range, 6 - 9 mm). Near the suprascapular notch (supraspinous fossa), the <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> unambiguously identified in 36 % of examinations (95 % CI, 28 %- 44 %) (P < 0. 001) and located at a median depth of 35 mm (interquartile range, 31 - 38 mm; P < 0. 001). In the cadaver investigation, the rate of correct needle placement of the supraclavicular approach was 95 % (95 % CI, 86 %- 100 %). CONCLUSIONS: Visualization of the SSN with US is better in the supraclavicular region {{as compared with the}} supraspinous fossa. The anatomic dissections confirmed that our novel supraclavicular SSN block technique is accurate...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{autosomal}} dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs), {{it is unclear}} whether the associated peripheral <b>nerve</b> involvement <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a typical length-dependent axonopathy rather than primary neuronopathy due to neuronal degeneration in the spinal anterior horns and/or dorsal root ganglia. OBJECTIVE: To study {{the nature and extent of}} peripheral nerve involvement in patients with ADCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Standardized clinical and electrophysiologic studies of 27 genotyped patients with ADCA were conducted prospectively, with special emphasis on the distinction between primary neuronopathy and dying-back axonopathy. RESULTS: Electrophysiologic evidence of involvement of the peripheral nervous system was present in 70 % of patients. Findings were compatible with dying-back axonopathy in 30 %, while in 40 % of patients, neuronopathy was diagnosed. Patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1 and SCA 2 mostly displayed features of neuronopathy, while patients with SCA 3 and SCA 7 displayed both neuronopathy and axonopathy. In SCA 6, no significant peripheral <b>nerve</b> involvement <b>was</b> demonstrated. We did not observe an influence of age, disease duration, or ataxia severity on the presence or type of peripheral nerve involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral nerve involvement in ADCA manifests not only as distal axonal neuropathy, but also as primary neuronopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies in this group of patients should be conducted in such a way that primary neuronopathy is detected...|$|R
40|$|Context: Hansen′s {{disease is}} a chronic illness; besides {{involving}} skin and peripheral nerves, it affects multiple organs. <b>Nerve</b> involvement <b>is</b> <b>always</b> present in leprosy, {{and it may be}} present much before the patient manifests clinically. Aims: To assess nerve conduction parameters in thickened and contralateral non-thickened nerves in early tuberculoid leprosy Materials and Methods: Fifty new untreated male patients with tuberculoid and borderline tuberculoid leprosy in the age group of 15 - 50 years with thickened peripheral nerves on one side were included in the study. Nerve conduction studies consisting of sensory and motor velocity (NCV), distal latencies, and amplitude were carried out on thickened ulnar, common peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves and contralateral normal nerves. Statistical Analysis Used: Mean values along with coefficient of variation were obtained for various parameters. These were compared with normal values of the control population. P value was used to verify statistical significance. Results: <b>Nerve</b> conduction parameters <b>were</b> deranged in most of the thickened <b>nerves.</b> Sensory parameters <b>were</b> affected early in the disease process. Conclusion: Additional parameters are required to assess nerve damage in early cases, where it is more in slow conducting fibers (average velocity fibers). Change in conduction velocity may not be marked; this calls for the measurement of fast fibers separately because potentials recorded are mainly from myelinated fibers...|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{restoring}} impaired neural function by means of surgical reconstruction, sensory <b>nerves</b> have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{in the role of}} the neglected child when compared with motor nerves. Especially in the head and neck area, with its either sensory, motor or mixed cranial nerves, an impaired sensory function can cause severe medical conditions. When performing surgery in the head and neck area, sustaining neural function must not only be highest priority for motor but also for sensory nerves. In cases with obvious neural damage to sensory nerves, an immediate neural repair, if necessary with neural interposition grafts, is desirable...|$|R
