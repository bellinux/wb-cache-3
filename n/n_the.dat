5|$|After Sharif's {{return to}} Pakistan from exile in 2007, Abbasi joined him {{and ran for}} {{a seat in the}} National Assembly in the 18 February 2008 general {{election}} as a candidate of the PML (N), and was successfully re-elected for the fifth time with 99,987 votes from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi). The election resulted in a hung parliament where PPP had secured the most seats in the National Assembly and PML (<b>N)</b> <b>the</b> second most. After the formation of a coalition government between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, Abbasi was inducted into the federal cabinet of Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was appointed as the Minister for Commerce. However, he resigned from the ministerial office after PML (N) left the PPP-led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary.|$|E

5|$|Forming at 31° <b>N,</b> <b>the</b> storm formed {{farther north}} {{than any other}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone at the time, though, in 2000, Tropical Storm Wene formed farther to the north. The cyclone marked the first known occurrence of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric low developing into a tropical cyclone, though Tropical Storm Fausto in 2002 redeveloped in a similar occurrence to the hurricane. The cyclone attained hurricane status at 40° N, a record for a Pacific hurricane. Only Tropical Storm Dot in 1970, Hurricane John in 1994, Tropical Depression Guillermo in 1997, and Tropical Storm Wene in 2000 were tropical cyclones north of the latitude, of which only John was a hurricane; none maintained tropical cyclone status further north than the cyclone.|$|E
