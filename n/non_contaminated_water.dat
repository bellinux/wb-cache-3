In this study, three types of waste water were used i. e. soap <b>contaminated</b> <b>water,</b> detergent <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> and tap water respectively. The results of the study showed that soap <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> (0, 5 gram/liter) and tap water were preferential sites for Aedes aegypti to lay their eggs, while detergent <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> was not. The number of mosquito eggs found in soap <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> was not significantly different with those found in tap water but both of them were significantly higher than those found in detergent <b>contaminated</b> <b>water.</b> </div...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Trends of {{experimental}} mercury bioaccumulation {{by the sea}} anemone Actinia equina were investigated. Sea anemones specimens were collected in two sampling stations on the Iberian coast presenting different mercury profiles. Sampling stations had been chosen by its geographic differences and also by its level of exposition (displayed beach/sheltered and diversity types of pollutants). The experimental procedure take special attention {{with regards to the}} mechanisms of processes driving measured sediment-organisms fluxes. Local Hg concentration on sediments (fine, 63 < 1000 µm), were also analyzed for laboratorial and field comparisons. In the experimental assay aquariums with the collected sea anemones were exposed to a mercury <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> 0. 016 µg·L– 1 sampled in a chlor-alkali industry effluent, in order to discuss trends in Hg contamination. The results showed that even within similar specimens a considerable variability on patterns of Hg accumulation is observed. The experiments showed the potential of sea anemone Actinia equina as Hg contamination and bioaccumulation indicator and the importance of the exposure period required for the equilibration in the case of high mercury contamination exposition in comparison with <b>non</b> <b>contaminated</b> areas...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{long term}} Hg {{contamination}} and addition of Hg 2 + on soil CH 4 oxidation were investigated in laboratory incubation experiments. <b>Non</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils had CH 4 oxidation rate constants (k) between 5. 2 and 24. 5 x 10 - 3 h- 1, whereas Hg contaminated soils had rates ranging from 2. 4 to 8. 0 x 10 - 3 h- 1. Specific oxidation rates (qK=k/Cbio), normalized {{with respect to}} soil microbial biomass C (Cbio), allowed complete separation {{between the two groups}} and ranged between 32. 6 and 56. 2 x 10 - 6 h- 1 μg- 1 Cbio in <b>non</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils and between 6. 5 and 14. 3 x 10 - 6 h- 1 μg- 1 Cbio in long-term Hg contaminated soils. To test short-term toxicity effects and eventual adaptation of methane oxidizers, Hg 2 + was added at two levels, 50 and 100 μg g- 1, to two soils, one <b>non</b> <b>contaminated</b> and the other contaminated for centuries by Hg, having about the same Cbio. Methane oxidation capacity and Cbio of the soil exposed for centuries to high levels of Hg, were not affected by Hg 2 + additions. In the <b>non</b> <b>contaminated</b> soil Cbio was not affected, but methane oxidation rate decreased from 21. 4 to 9. 8 x 10 - 3 h- 1. Our results show that Hg contamination, either long-term or short term, may negatively impair the CH 4 oxidizing capacity of aerobic arable soils...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring an {{informal}} study in 1973 {{it was noted}} that approximately one third of patients with congenital heart disease lived in a small area in the Tucson Valley. In 1981 groundwater for a nearly identical area was found to be contaminated with trichloroethylene {{and to a lesser extent}} with dichioroethyiene and chromium. Contamination probably began during the 1950 s. Affected wells were closed after discovery of contamination. This seqience of events allowed investigation of the prevalence of congenital heart disease in children whose parents were exposed to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area as compared with children whose parents were never exposed to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area. The <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area contained 8. 8 % of the Tucson Valley population and 4. 5 % of the labor force. Using their case registry, the authors interviewed parents of 707 children with congenital heart disease who, between 1969 and 1987, 1) conceived their child in the Tucson Valley, and 2) spent the month before the first trimester and the first trimester of the case pregnancy in the Tucson Valley. Two random dialing surveys showed that only 10. 5 % of the Tucson Valley population had ever had work or residence contact, or both, with the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area, whereas 35 % of parents of children with congenital heart disease had had such contact (p < 0. 005). The prevalence of congenital cardiac disease (excluding syndromes, children with atrial tachycardia or premature infants with patent ductus arteriosis) in the Tucson Valley was 0. 7 % of live births and with syndromes was calculated to be 0. 82 %. The odds ratio for congenital heart disease for children of parents with <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area contact the period of active contamination was three times that for those without contact (p < 0. 005) and decreased to near unity for new arrivals in the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area after well closure. The proportion of infants with congenital heart disease as compared with the number of live births was significantly higher for resident mothers in the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area than for mothers with no exposure. No other environmental agent could be identified that was localized to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area, but one could have been missed. The data show a significant association but not a cause and effect relation between parental exposure to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area and an increased proportion of congenital heart disease among live births as compared with the proportion of congenital heart disease among live births for parents without <b>contaminated</b> <b>water</b> area contact...|$|R
