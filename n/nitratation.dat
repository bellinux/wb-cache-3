40|$|Energy-positive sewage {{treatment}} can, in principle, {{be obtained by}} maximizing energy recovery from concentrated organics and by minimizing energy consumption for concentration and residual nitrogen removal in the main stream. To test the feasibility of the latter, sewage-like nitrogen influent concentrations were treated with oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) in a lab-scale rotating biological contactor at 25 degrees C. At influent ammonium concentrations of 66 and 29 mg N L(- 1) and a volumetric loading rate of 840 mg N L(- 1) day(- 1) yielding hydraulic residence times (HRT) of 2. 0 and 1. 0 h, respectively, relatively high nitrogen removal rates of 444 and 383 mg N L(- 1) day(- 1) were obtained, respectively. At low nitrogen levels, adapted nitritation and anammox communities were established. The decrease in nitrogen removal was due to decreased anammox and increased <b>nitratation,</b> with Nitrospira representing 6 % of the biofilm. The latter likely occurred given the absence of dissolved oxygen (DO) control, since decreasing the DO concentration from 1. 4 to 1. 2 mg O(2) L(- 1) decreased <b>nitratation</b> by 35 % and increased anammox by 32 %. Provided a sufficient suppression of <b>nitratation,</b> this study showed the feasibility of OLAND to treat low nitrogen levels at low HRT, a prerequisite to energy-positive {{sewage treatment}}...|$|E
40|$|Nitrification via nitrite was {{studied in}} two aerobic {{reactors}} treating wastewater from an aminoplastic resin producing factory at HRT varying between 1. 37 - 1. 89 and 2. 45 - 3. 63 days. Both reactors were fed with concentrations of 366, 450, 1099 and 1899 mg N-NH 4 +/L. In {{general in the}} reactor operated at a lower HRT, the nitritation percentage decreased from 87. 2 to 21. 6 %, while the <b>nitratation</b> percentage remained always lower than 2. 5 % (except in the last period) when the ammonium concentration was increased. This behaviour {{could be due to}} the inhibition of the ammonium and nitrite oxidation produced by high free ammonia concentrations up to 179. 3 mg N-NH 3 /L. In the reactor operated at a higher HRT, the nitritation percentage decreased and the <b>nitratation</b> percentage increased from 88. 6 to 39. 6 % and from 0. 65 to 35. 7 %, respectively, due to an increase of the dissolved oxygen concentration from 0. 76 to 1. 02 mg O 2 /L. However, when ammonium was fed at a concentration of 1898. 7 mg N-NH 4 +/L, the nitritation increased and the <b>nitratation</b> decreased, probably {{as a result of the}} accumulation of free ammonia up to 2. 04 mg N-NH 3 /L, meaning that nitrite oxidizers were inhibited. Nitrite build-up was observed after each modification of ammonium concentration in the feed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of TiO 2 nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NPs) (10 - 50 mg/L) on aerobic granulation of algal-bacterial symbiosis system was investigated by using two identical sequencing batch reactors (SBRs). Although little adverse effect was observed on their nitritation efficiency (98 - 100 % in both reactors), algal-bacterial granules {{in the control}} SBR (Rc) gradually lost stability mainly brought about by algae growth. TiO 2 -NPs addition to RT was found to enhance the granulation process achieving stable and compact algal-bacterial granules with remarkably improved <b>nitratation</b> thus little nitrite accumulation in RT when influent TiO 2 -NPs= 30 mg/L. Despite almost similar organics and phosphorus removals obtained in both reactors, the stably high <b>nitratation</b> efficiency in addition to much stable granular structure in RT suggests that TiO 2 -NPs addition might be a promising remedy for the long-term operation of algal-bacterial granular system, most probably attributable to the stimulated excretion of extracellular polymeric substances and less filamentous TM 7...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] Ammonia {{biofiltration}} performance under shock loads episodes was {{studied in}} a reactor packed with coconut fiber as carrier material. Periodical gas and leachate samplings were analyzed {{and used to}} characterize the biofilter performance in terms of removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC). Nitrogen fractions in the leachate were quantified to identify the experimental rates of nitritation and <b>nitratation</b> [...] In a primary experiment a sudden increment of ammonia load was applied for 1 day by changing the ammonia inlet load from 5. 2 to 29. 1 g N. m- 3. h- 1. Even though stable operation was obtained (RE of 99. 9 %), a notable accumulation of nitrite was verified in the leachate. Experimental rates showed that nitritation increased at the same the same ratio that ammonia load was varied. However the <b>nitratation</b> seemed to be largely affected by high ammonia and nitrite concentration. In a subsequent experiment varying the inlet ammonia load, the system was rapidly recovered by increasing the watering rate. Since ammonia was partially removed by physicochemical process as observed in previous experiments, a final experimental was conducted to improve the nitritation capacity.

40|$|Nitrification is an {{integral}} part of biological nitrogen removal processes and usually the limiting step in wastewater treatment systems. Since nitrification is often considered not feasible at temperatures higher than 40  °C, warm industrial effluents (with operating temperatures higher than 40  °C) need to be cooled down prior to biological treatment, which increases the energy and operating costs of the plants for cooling purposes. This study describes the occurrence of thermophilic biological nitrogen removal activity (nitritation, <b>nitratation,</b> and denitrification) at a temperature as high as 50  °C in an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant treating wastewater from an oil refinery. Using a modified two-step nitrification-two-step denitrification mathematical model extended with the incorporation of double Arrhenius equations, the nitrification (nitrititation and <b>nitratation)</b> and denitrification activities were described including the cease in biomass activity at 55  °C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed that Nitrosomonas halotolerant and obligatehalophilic and Nitrosomonas oligotropha (known ammonia-oxidizing organisms) and Nitrospira sublineage II (nitrite-oxidizing organism (NOB)) were observed using the FISH probes applied in this study. In particular, this is the first time that Nitrospira sublineage II, a moderatedly thermophilic NOB, is observed in an engineered full-scale (industrial) wastewater treatment system at temperatures as high as 50  °C. These observations suggest that thermophilic biological nitrogen removal can be attained in wastewater treatment systems, which may further contribute to the optimization of the biological nitrogen removal processes in wastewater treatment systems that treat warm wastewater streams...|$|E

Long-term evaluation of a SBR fed with tannery wastewater (SBRtww) was carried out to study the periods of satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance in the nitrification and denitrification properties. Another SBR fed with synthetic nitrogen medium simulating tannery wastewater (SBRsww) was used to assess separately the end points of nitritation and <b>nitratation</b> by online monitoring of pH and DO. Flex point in the DO and pH profiles of the SBRsww cycle corresponding to the end point of nitritation was well observed, whereas the end point of <b>nitratation</b> was vaguely detected. The end point of nitritation suggested that the aeration phase can be reduced considerably and denitrification via nitrite can be facilitated to minimize oxygen requirements and reduce operational costs. During the long-term operation of SBRtww, stable and unstable phases of nitrification were observed. A maximum nitrification rate of 14. 1 mg/L h was obtained during the stable phase of the reactor. Inhibiting substances in tannery wastewater was found to be the possible reason for the instability in nitrification. Denitrification property, however, was not much affected as that of nitrification. The maximum denitrification rate observed was 10. 7 mg/L h. Nitrogen removal in an aerobic SBR through simultaneous nitrification [...] denitrification could be a good option for tannery wastewater. SBR is a viable option for tannery wastewater compared to the conventional aerobic systems provided pollution control measures are conducted at the source level through the use of eco-friendly chemicals and cleaner processing methods to avoid nitrification inhibiting compounds in the effluent...|$|E
40|$|The oxygen-limited {{autotrophic}} nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) {{process is}} a one-stage process to remove ammonium from wastewaters with a low C/N ratio, combining partial nitritation and anammox. In OLAND, oxygen {{plays a crucial role}} in balancing the microbial functions, not only to provide sufficient oxygen for nitritation, but also to suppress <b>nitratation</b> and allow for sufficient anammox. A rotating biological contactor (RBC) is a simple and robust OLAND technology, yet it is not straightforward to control the oxygen load to the biofilm and the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels experienced by the biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to the atmosphere. Oxygen loads and bulk levels DO can be generically influenced by the rotation speed and the immersion levels of the discs, but the exact influences on the OLAND performance are not known. These aspects were studied in a stably performing OLAND 50 -L RBC, which was fed with synthetic influent at a loading rate of 535 mg N/L. d and a hydraulic residence time of 46 h. At the references conditions with a disc rotation speed of 1. 8 rpm and 50 % immersion, a bulk DO of 0. 2 - 0. 9 mg O 2 /L and a stable nitrogen removal rate of 500 mg N/L. d were obtained, with no nitrite accumulation and low <b>nitratation.</b> These conditions indicate that the functions of the microbial community were ideally balanced. Currently, data are gathered from the effect of an increase of the immersion level to 75 %, which will be followed by a disc rotation increase to 3. 6 rpm, a decrease to 50 % immersion and a decrease to 1. 8 rpm. The direct effect of each of these actions is examined over a week. The results will lead to easy methods to control and restore the desired microbial OLAND balance and hence optimize nitrogen removal efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of biofilm {{thickness}} on the nitrifying activity in moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) in a controlled environment. In-depth understanding of biofilm properties in MBBRs and their effect on the overall treatment efficiency compose the key to optimizing process stability and efficiency. However, evaluating biofilm properties in continuously operated MBBRs can be extremely challenging. This study uses a carrier design which enables comparison of four different biofilm thicknesses, in otherwise equally operated lab-scale MBBRs. The results show that, within the studied range (200 - 500 µm) and specific operation conditions, biofilm thickness alone had no {{significant effect on the}} overall ammonium removal. The nitrate production, however, decreased with a decreasing biofilm thickness, and the ratio between nitrite and ammonia oxidizing activity decreased both with increasing load and decreasing oxygen concentration for all thicknesses. The suggestion that <b>nitratation</b> is disfavored in thin biofilms is an interesting contribution to current research being performed on NOB inhibition for deammonification applications. By indicating that different groups of bacteria respond differently to biofilm thickness, this study accentuates the importance of further evaluation of these complex systems...|$|E

Conventional biological nitrogen removal is based on nitrification, i. e., the conversion of ammonium to nitrite by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (nitritation) and nitrite to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (<b>nitratation).</b> Biofilm reactors, in which the bacteria grow in a microbial layer attached to a carrier, are typically applied to prevent the slow-growing nitrifying bacteria from being washed out of the reactor. In this doctoral research, the influence of microbial competition and coexistence, besides operational conditions, on biological nitrogen removal in biofilm reactors was studied through mathematical modelling and simulation. Microbial diversity and competition were incorporated in dynamic biofilm models considering spatial gradients perpendicular to the carrier.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of antibiotics in water resources has been disturbing {{news for the}} stakeholders {{who are responsible for}} public health and the drinking water supply. In many cases, biological wastewater treatment plants are the final opportunity in the water cycle to trap these substances. The sensitivity of activated sludge bacteria to erythromycin, a macrolide widely used in human medicine was investigated in batch toxicity tests using a concentration range of 1 – 300 mg L− 1. Erythromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, has been found to significantly inhibit ammonification, nitritation and <b>nitratation</b> at concentrations higher than 20 mg L− 1. The degree of inhibition increased with greater concentrations of the antibiotic. Exposure to erythromycin also clearly affected heterotrophs, particularly filamentous bacteria, causing floc disintegration and breakage of filaments. Cell lysis was observed with the concomitant release of organic nitrogen (intracellular proteins) and soluble COD. Although erythromycin exhibits properties of a surfactant, this characteristic alone cannot explain the damage to heterotrophs: the effects from erythromycin were greater than those of Tween 80, a commonly used surfactant. Floc disruption can lead to the release of isolated bacteria, and possibly antibiotic resistance genes, into the environment...|$|E

This paper focuses both on nitrification and on inhibition by ammonia of {{the bacteria}} responsible for this process in activated sludge (nitrifying bacteria). Nitrification (autotrophic nitrite oxidation to nitrate) is the limiting step in wastewater treatment plants during nitrogen biological treatment (ammonia {{is known as the}} major inhibitor). To assess the effects of environmental conditions on nitrification, respirometric measurements of a nitrifying bacteria-enriched activated sludge were carried out using a chemostat providing a stable nitrite-oxidizing population. The influence of pH, temperature, and the free ammonia concentration [NH 3 -N] was studied. The maximum activity of the nitrifying bacteria was found at pH 7. 8 and at 29 oC, with the 90 % range of maximum activity lying between pH values of 7. 5 and 8. 1. Activation and deactivation energies for nitrification were estimated by Arrhenius analysis to be 12. 2 and - 41. 5 kcal/mol, respectively. A Q 10 value (multiplicative factor of oxygen consumption rate for each 10 oC increase) of 2. 8 was determined. Saturation or half-velocity coefficient (Ks) and maximum specific rate of nitrite oxidation (QSmax) were calculated by respirometric measurements, and are 3. 04 mg NO 2 [...] N/l and 61 mg NO 2 [...] N/g VSS. h, respectively. In the study of effect of free ammonia, respirometric measurements were performed at ammonia concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 70 mg NH 3 -N/l. For a concentration of 11. 4 mg NH 3 -N/l, a nitrification inhibition degree of 60 % was reached. Contrary to the work of Anthonisen et al. (1976), which showed total inhibition of nitrifying bacteria at a concentration of 1 mg NH 3 -N/l, our results indicate a residual respiration, even at a concentration of 70 mg NH 3 -N/l. This displacement of total inhibition could be due to the predominance of nitrifying bacteria in the activated sludge used. In {{the second phase of the}} present research, our results were validated for another mixed bacterial population that was not enriched in nitrifying bacteria. Different concentrations of NH 3 were imposed in flask cultures of nitrifying activated sludge, to assess the inhibition thresholds for ammonia. Between 0 and 10 mg NH 3 -N/l, the degrees of inhibition were inferior to those obtained by respirometric measurements for cultures enriched with nitrifying bacteria, except at 10 mg NH 3 -N/l, where about 58 % inhibition was achieved. The effect of the total biomass concentration of nitrifying activated sludge was also studied. An ammonia concentration of 3 mg NH 3 -N/l was used in flask cultures with different biomass concentrations (0. 1 to 2 g VSS/l). This variable was not significant as similar specific nitrite oxidation rates were measured in all cultures. Inhibitory effects of ammonia on nitrifying bacteria activity seem to be complex and strongly dependent on other environmental factors which modify the dynamics of biomass growth...|$|E

To test the feasibility of mainstream OLAND, the effect of a gradual temperature decrease from 29 to 15 A degrees C and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) /N increase from 0 to 2 was tested in an OLAND rotating biological contactor operating at 55 - 60 mg NH 4 (+) -N L- 1 and a hydraulic retention time of 1 h. Moreover, the effect of the operational conditions and feeding strategies on the reactor cycle balances, including NO and N 2 O emissions were studied in detail. This study showed {{for the first time that}} total nitrogen removal rates of 0. 5 g N L- 1 day(- 1) can be maintained when decreasing the temperature from 29 to 15 A degrees C and when low nitrogen concentration and moderate COD levels are treated.

40|$|The Lake Lugano North Basin {{has been}} {{meromictic}} for several decades, with anoxic waters below 100 m depth. Two consecutive cold winters in 2005 and 2006 induced exceptional deep mixing, {{leading to a}} transient oxygenation of the whole water column. With the ventilation of deep waters and the oxidation of large quantities of reduced solutes, the lake's total redox-balance turned positive, and the overall hypolimnetic oxygen demand of the lake strongly decreased. The disappearance of 150 t dissolved phosphorous (P) during the first ventilation in March 2005 is attributed to the scavenging of water-column-borne P by newly formed metal oxyhydroxides and the temporary transfer to the sediments. The fixed nitrogen (N) inventory was reduced by ~ 30 % (~ 1000 t). The water-column turnover induced the <b>nitratation</b> of the previously NO 3 [...] free deep hypolimnion by oxidation of large amounts of legacy NH 4 + and by mixing with NO 3 [...] rich subsurface water masses. Sediments with a strong denitrifying potential, but NO 3 [...] starved for decades, were brought in contact with NO 3 [...] replete waters, invigorating benthic denitrification and rapid fixed N loss from the lake {{in spite of the}} overall more oxygenated conditions. Similarly, a large microbial aerobic CH 4 oxidation (MOx) potential in the hypolimnion was capitalized with the ventilation of the deep basin. Almost all CH 4, which had been built up over more than 40 years (~ 2800 t), was removed from the water column within 30 days. However, boosted MOx could only partly explain the disappearance of the CH 4. The dominant fraction (75 %) of the CH 4 evaded to the atmosphere, through storage flux upon exposure of anoxic CH 4 -rich water to the atmosphere. As of today, the North Basin seems far from homeostasis regarding its fixed N and CH 4 budgets, and the deep basin's CH 4 pool is recharging at a net production rate of ~ 66 t y- 1.

While most of available works studied fixed bed or contact reactors with a separated separation step, this study assesses {{a new type of}} tertiary treatment based on a fluidized bed containing a high mass of activated carbon, continuously renewed. For {{the first time in the}} literature, micro-grain activated carbon (μGAC) was studied. The aims were (1) to determine the performances of fluidized bed operating with μCAG on both emerging micropollutants and conventional wastewater quality parameters, and (2) to compare its efficiency and applicability to wastewater to former results obtained with PAC. Thus, conventional wastewater quality parameters (n = 11), pharmaceuticals and hormones (PPHs; n = 62) and other emerging pollutants (n = 57) have been monitored in μGAC configuration during 13 campaigns. A significant correlation has been established between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), PPHs and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV- 254) removals. This confirms that UV- 254 could be used as a tertiary treatment performance indicator to monitor the process. This parameter allowed identifying that the removals of UV- 254 and DOC reach a plateau from a μGAC retention time (SRT) of 90 – 100 days. The μGAC configuration substantially improves the overall quality of the WWTP discharges by reducing biological (38 – 45 %) and chemical oxygen demands (21 – 48 %), DOC (13 – 44 %) and UV- 254 (22 – 48 %). In addition, total suspended solids (TSS) are retained by the μGAC bed and a biological activity (<b>nitratation)</b> leads to a total elimination of NO 2 −. For micropollutants, PPHs have a good affinity for μGAC and high (> 60 %) or very high (> 80 %) removals are observed for most of the quantified compounds (n = 22 / 32), i. e. atenolol (92 – 97 %), carbamazepine (80 – 94 %), ciprofloxacin (75 – 95 %), diclofenac (71 – 97 %), oxazepam (74 – 91 %) or sulfamethoxazole (56 – 83 %). In addition, alkylphenols, artificial sweeteners, benzotriazole, bisphenol A, personal care products (triclocarban and parabens) and pesticides have removals lying in the 50 −> 90 % range. Overall, the fluidized bed of μGAC allows obtaining performances comparable to PAC at the same activated carbon dose. Indeed, the average removal of the 13 PPHs found at a high occurrence (> 75 %) in WWTP discharges is similar at 20 g/m 3 of μGAC (78 – 89 %) and PAC (85 – 93 %). In addition, this recycled μGAC operation leads to several operational advantages (no FeCl 3, reactivable, higher SRT, higher treated flow) and has a stronger impact on the overall wastewater quality compared to PAC...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs), like activated sludge systems, are energy demanding requiring a large electrical energy supply (e. g. 25 kWh PE- 1 year- 1) which, especially during peak-load periods, may account for an important quote of the grid installed power of the surrounding area. Only across the EU, there are 16000 WWTPs that consume around 10000 GWh year- 1 of electricity. Furthermore, the volume of wastewater treated in WWTPs in the EU is increasing with a rate of around 7 % each year. Besides the related financial costs, this energy consumption creates an additional environmental burden. Considering that energy in Europe is mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels, it has been calculated that energy consumption from WWTPs creates emissions of more than 27 Mtonnes year- 1 of CO 2 in the EU. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions on a global level and cost issues on a microeconomic level have become major driving forces towards a more efficient usage of energy in {{wastewater treatment}}. In conventional wastewater treatment about 50 % of the energy input is consumed in the aeration systems in order to remove organic matter (Chemical Oxygen Demand, COD) while about 25 % is consumed in the nitrogen removal process (nitrification/denitrification) (Siegrist et al., 2008). Autotrophic nitrogen removal by anammox bacteria is to date the most efficient and environmentally friendly process {{for the treatment of}} ammonium in wastewaters and its application can save up to 60 % of the energy input needed for nitrification. Application of anammox to municipal sewage treatment appears as a prerequisite to allow treatment scenarios for {{wastewater treatment plants}} with a net energy production (Kartal et al., 2010 a). In a treatment scheme where nitrogen is removed via an autotrophic metabolic pathway such as partial nitritation/anammox (PN/anammox),the COD load, which is conventionally oxidized to C 02 partly with oxygen and partly with nitrate (N 03 -) in the denitrification process, can be used to generate energy in the form of methane-rich biogas via the anaerobic digestion process. Whilst the application of anammox related technologies in the side-stream is at present state of the art, the feasibility of this energy-efficient process in main-stream conditions is still under investigation. Lower and variable operating temperatures and ammonium concentrations, together with a demand for high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency, represent the main challenges to overcome for this appealing new frontier of the waste water treatment field. The research described in this thesis aimed at investigating the physiology and kinetic properties of anammox bacteria and their interaction with other microbial communities under municipal wastewater conditions with the ultimate scope of elucidating the boundary conditions for the application of the anammox-based process (PN/anammox) in the treatment of municipal sewage. This fundamental knowledge allow to design and successfully implement at lab- and pilot-scale the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal process for the treatment of municipal sewage. This thesis comprises therefore both fundamental and applied research which main results and achievements are briefly illustrated in this summary. Although anammox related technologies are currently widely applied for nitrogen removal from sewage sludge digester rejection water, many aspects of the anammox process like the kinetic characteristics and the reaction stoichiometry are still under investigation. Parameter values reported in literature are often influenced by mass transfer limitation or by the presence of inactive cells and a significant side population. In Chapter 2 a membrane bioreactor (MBR) based method for growing a highly enriched anammox microbial community is described. The almost pure free­cell suspension of highly active anammox bacteria was used for detailed kinetic and stoichiometric analysis of the anammox process. The yield of biomass production on ammonium uptake was calculated to be 0. 071 C-mol N-mol- 1, value that was then experimentally confirmed in Chapter 3. The elemental biomass composition was measured as CH 1. 740 o. 31 No. 20 So. 01 Po. 01 (22. 1 g C-mol- 1). From the yield and the elemental biomass composition the macro-chemical reaction equation was identified and validated by long-term reactor operations. The anammox culture described in Chapter 2 exhibited an unreported high biomass specific maximum growth rate of 0. 21 d- 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 3. 3 days at 30 °C. Using an experimental methodology based on imposing dynamic process conditions combined with process modeling and parameter estimation, the intrinsic nitrite half saturation constant was identified to be as low as 35 µg-N L- 1. This was confirmed to be a stable value in the tested pH range of 6. 8 - 7. 5. Using the same system, in Chapter 3 the stoichiometric and kinetic properties of a suspended anammox enrichment culture were investigated at decreasing solid retention times. This procedure enabled the maximum growth rate (µmax) of the anammox enrichment culture to increase to 0. 334 d- 1, which is four times higher than previously reported in literature and almost 60 % higher than observed in Chapter 2. Even though researchers have speculated about the possibility of higher rates before, these speculations were always based on indirect measurements of the kinetic properties. Herewith Chapter 3 reports the first direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in growth rate of an anammox enrichment culture. Since the biomass yield of the enrichment culture established is largely comparable to previous studies, it can be concluded that the increased growth rate results from an equivalent increase in biomass specific electron transfer capacity. Detailed molecular analysis did not reveal either a shift in dominant anammox strain nor major mutations in the dominant strain, suggesting that the actual reasons for the increase in electron transfer capacity is due to small changes in the metabolic machinery. The dominant strain throughout this experiment was closely related to Candidatus Brocadia Sp. 40 (99 % similarity). In this study anammox bacteria were cultivated applying a novel selection strategy based on the maximization of the electron transfer capacity demonstrating that maximum growth rate is not an intrinsic process property but that it can be increased significantly when the adequate cultivation conditions are imposed. The anammox enrichment became faster through training showing kinetics comparable with other chemolithoautotrophs and it is thereby concluded that anammox can no longer be regarded as intrinsically slow growing microorganism. Nitrite {{is one of the main}} substrates of the anammox metabolism, but it is also an inhibitor. Its negative effect on anammox activity has been reported widely during the past decade. Although the adverse effect is clear, conflicting reports exist on the level at which it occurs and its reversible/irreversible nature. In order to elucidate this important aspect, an in-depth study on nitrite inhibition was performed in which the influence of environmental factors was evaluated (Chapter 4). Anammox activity was measured in anammox granules by continuously monitored standardized manometric batch tests extending the interpretation by evaluation of lag times, maximum conversion rates during the tests and substrates/product conversion ratios. The granules, dominated by anammox organisms belonging to the Brocadia type, where sampled from a single-stage anammox full-scale reactor. The observed 50 % activity inhibition for nitrite (IC 50) was 0. 4 g-N L- 1. It was shown that biomass relatively quickly (and totally) recovers from high nitrite concentrations. The recovery after exposure indicates that the adverse effect of nitrite is reversible and thus inhibitory rather than toxic in nature. The effect of the presence of ammonium and oxygen during nitrite exposure has also been evaluated. Similarities between exposures at three different pH values suggest that nitrite rather than nitrous acid is the actual inhibiting compound. Overall the results reported in Chapter 4 further underline that the anammox process can be a stable process not prone to temporarily adverse effects of oxygen and nitrite in the reactors. From our experience and previous observations we speculate that cultivation conditions and status of aggregation influence the inhibitory effect of nitrite and that in several cases where high nitrite is reported as a cause of activity loss, it might well be that activity loss has resulted in the accumulation of high nitrite concentrations rather than causing them. The temperature effect on anammox activity is a crucial aspect that needs to be clarified for the successful implementation of anammox related processes at mainstream conditions. Lower operating temperatures in fact, together with lower ammonium concentrations and the demand for high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency, represent the main challenges to overcome for this appealing new frontier of the waste water treatment field. In Chapter 5 is reported the short-term effect of temperature on the maximum biomass specific activity of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria as evaluated by means of batch tests. The experiments were performed on anammox biomass sampled from two full-scale reactors and two lab-scale reactors, all characterized by different reactor configurations and operating conditions. The results indicate that in the temperature range of 10 - 30 °C the temperature dependency for the anammox conversion cannot be accurately modeled by one single Arrhenius coefficient (i. e. ?) as typically applied for other biological processes. The temperature effect is increasing at lower temperatures, complicating the implementation of a stable mainstream process in winter conditions. Nevertheless, we observed adaptation of anammox bacteria after long term cultivation at 20 and 10 °C indicating that also the history of the sludge impacts the temperature effect. Anammox sludge cultivated in an aerated partial nitritation/anammox process and/or in biofilm seemed to be less influenced by a decrease in temperature then anammox sludge grown under non aerated conditions and/or in suspension. The results reported in Chapter 5 indicate that the temperature effect is stronger for anammox than for ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB), suggesting that, in order to maintain overall a good nitrogen removal along daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, process control to balance the activity of both microbial groups needs to be adaptive to changes in relative rates of the two processes. Implications for modeling and process design are finally discussed. In Chapter 6 the application of the single-stage PN/anammox process at conditions relevant for sewage treatment was investigated in a lab-scale gas-lift sequencing batch reactor with granular sludge operated for more than 500 days. The reactor was operated at temperatures between 20 and 10 °C and fed with synthetic autotrophic medium with ammonium (60 and 160 mg-N L- 1 as only nitrogen compound at an HRT of 0. 23 - 0. 3 d. In the presence of ammonium dissolved oxygen was shown to be an effective control parameter, even at higher level than previously assumed (up to 2. 5 mg-O 2 L- 1, for the suppression of the undesired <b>nitratation</b> process catalyzed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). This control strategy guaranteed the effective suppression of the <b>nitratation</b> process both at 20 and 15 °C, allowing nitrogen removal rates of 0. 44 and 0. 40 g-NTot L- 1 d- 1. Unlike previously reported, these high removal rates were obtained together with optimal nitrogen removal efficiencies of 86 and 73 %, respectively, fulfilling a decisive prerequisite for the implementation of the PN/anammox process in the main-stream of WWTPs. Anammox bacteria were shown to grow in the system, with estimated growth rate of 0. 017 d- 1 at 15 °C. Operating conditions influencing N 20 emissions were also investigated and resulted in the observation of a positive correlation with the nitrite concentration in the bulk whilst no clear correlation could be noticed between N 20 emissions and DO concentration or temperature. Unfortunately prolonged operation at 10 °C caused a slow but unrestrainable decrease in anammox activity and process efficiency. Nevertheless, since in general these temperatures (winter conditions) do not extend over long time in moderate climates this is not seen as a limitation for the applications of anammox-based technologies in the mainstream of wastewater treatment plants. Chapter 6 represents therefore a proof of concept for the application of the autotrophic nitrogen removal in a single reactor with granular sludge at mainstream conditions. The next logical step in this challenging exploration of anammox bacteria capabilities was to investigate their behavior in the real mainstream of a sewage treatment plant. In Chapter 7 we report the evaluation of the anammox process in a granular sludge fluidized bed lab-scale reactor continuously fed with the actual effluent of the A-stage of the WWTP of Dokhaven, Rotterdam (The Netherlands). In order to exclude the influence of oxygen and the competition for nitrite on anammox growth, the reactor was anoxic and nitrite was dosed continuously to support anammox activity only. The effect of influent COD and related heterotrophic growth by denitrification was instead included in the evaluation. The exclusion of oxygen was also intended in order to better evaluate the effect, if any, of potential toxic compounds in wastewater (e. g. from the influent or the addition of polyelectrolyte and technical grade iron salts in the A-stage). The system was operated for more than ten months at temperatures between 20 and 10 °C. Volumetric N-removal rates obtained were comparable or higher than those of conventional N-removal systems, with values higher than 0. 4 g-N L- 1 d- 1 when operated at 10 °C. The biomass specific N-removal rate at 10 °C was on average 50 ± 7 mg-N g-vss- 1 d- 1 during last month of operations, almost two times higher than previously reported activities at this temperature. FISH analysis revealed that the dominant anammox species was Candidatus Brocadia Fulgida throughout the experimentation. Evidence for growth of anammox bacteria at main-stream conditions (i. e. anammox biomass increase and nitrate production in absence of oxygen) was demonstrated for the entire temperature range tested (10 - 20 °C). Capability of granulation in the mainstream matrix under operative conditions was also proved since new granules were shown to be actively formed and efficiently retained in the proposed system. COD was also consumed during the process, but heterotrophs could not outcompete anammox bacteria. In Chapter 7 the capability of anammox bacteria to thrive under municipal wastewater conditions (low temperature, low ammonium concentration and presence of COD) was demonstrated for the first time, opening new perspective for the implementation of a more efficient (municipal) wastewater treatment chain. For the application of the autotrophic nitrogen removal process, the first step of partial nitritation performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) has to be also accomplished in order to produce the nitrite used in the anammox process. During partial nitritation the <b>nitratation</b> process performed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) has to be suppressed. Even though in Chapter 7 it was demonstrated that anammox itself does not represent a problem, the managing of AOB and NOB activities in order to meet effluent standards might prove more complex for the direct application of the partial nitritation-anammox process on municipal wastewater. With the aim of evaluating the coupling of the anammox and partial nitritation processes at municipal wastewater conditions and the simultaneous suppression of the <b>nitratation</b> process, a pilot-scale experimentation was performed. In Chapter 8 we report the evaluation of the process in a plug-flow granular sludge based pilot-scale reactor (4 m 3) continuously fed with the actual effluent of the A-stage of the WWTP of Dokhaven, Rotterdam. The one-stage partial nitritation-anammox system was operated for more than ten months at 19 ± 1 °C. Observed average N-removal and ammonium conversion rates were comparable or higher than those of conventional N-removal systems, with 182 ± 46 and 315 ± 33 mg-N L- 1 d- 1 respectively. Furthermore, considering the higher biomass concentration obtainable in granular systems and the possibility for further anammox enrichment in the biomass, kinetics much higher than conventional systems appear to be feasible. BOD was also oxidized in the system with average removal efficiency of 90 %. The system was shown to efficiently retain granules enriched in anammox bacteria with a small fraction of nitrifiers and heterotrophs located in the outer rim. At the same time, suspended flocs enriched in heterotrophs, and a small fraction of nitrifiers, were preferentially washed-out, allowing the system to withstand occasional COD and solids shock loads. The results reported in Chapter 8 show that the proposed reactor configuration with granular sludge has the potential to be successfully applied for the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal from the mainstream of WWTPs. In summary, the research described in this thesis showed for the first time the feasibility of an innovative technology for the removal of nitrogen from wastewater and posed a solid background to open de facto a new era in which the treatment of wastewater will move from the actual energy depleting to an energy generating process.
