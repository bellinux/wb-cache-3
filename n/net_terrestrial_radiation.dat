40|$|The Gulf of Finland {{is located}} in the {{seasonal}} sea ice zone (SSIZ), were sea ice forms in the wintertime and melts in late spring. This seasonality entitles this sea as a key area regarding the impact of climatic changes. When the basin of interest is located at the climatological edge of the SSIZ, there is also high inter-annual variability in the ice conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of the sea ice on the physics of the coastal waters in the Gulf of Finland. Three sites were chosen, two located at each side of Hanko Peninsula, northwest entrance of the Gulf, and one at the estuaries of River Kymijoki, northeast side of the Gulf. Long-term hydrographic and sea ice data were examined in order to study the inter-annual variability and trends of the hydrographic characteristics, heat content, freezing and break-up days and ice thickness during the last century in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Finland. The influence of the seasonal sea ice on the physics of the water body hydrography, circulation, atmosphere-ocean interaction was evaluated. The results showed significant decrease of the ice season length by almost 30 days in the last century. The maximum annual sea ice thickness decreased by 8 cm in the last 40 years. In the last 85 years, surface water temperature increased by 1 ˚C and surface salinity increased by 0. 5 PSU. The water body stratification in the coastal zone was strongly affected by the limited wind mixing in the wintertime. The circulation under ice became weaker by almost 1 cm s- 1. The ice cover was a good control measure of the net surface heat exchange. Solar radiation had a strong seasonal cycle with monthly maximum at 160 W m- 2 and minimum below 10 W m- 2. Terrestrial radiation was mostly between 40 and 60 W m- 2. Latent heat exchange was much more important than sensible heat exchange, similar to the <b>net</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> values in summer and autumn...|$|E
40|$|Deforestation in the Amazon {{region will}} {{initially}} impact the energy balance at the land surface through changes in land cover and surface hydrology. However, continuation of this human activity will {{eventually lead to}} atmospheric feedbacks, including changes in cloudiness which may {{play an important role}} in the final equilibrium of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> at the surface. In this study, the different components of surface radiation over an undisturbed forest in the Amazon region are computed using data from the Amazon region micrometerological experiment (ARME). Several measures of cloudiness are defined: two estimated from the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> measurements, and one from the solar radiation measurements. The sensitivity of the surface fluxes of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> to natural variability in cloudiness is investigated to infer the potential role of the cloudiness feedback in the surface energy balance. The results of this analysis indicate that a 1 % decrease in cloudiness would increase net solar radiation by ca. 1. 6 W/m 2. However, the overall magnitude of this feedback, due to total deforestation of the Amazon forest, is likely to be of the same order as the magnitude of the decrease in net solar radiation due to the observed increase in surface albedo following deforestation. Hence, the total change in net solar radiation is likely to have a negligible magnitude. In contrast to this conclusion, we find that <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> is likely to be more strongly affected; reduced cloudiness will decrease <b>net</b> <b>terrestrial</b> radiation; a 1 % decrease in cloudiness induces a reduction i...|$|R

40|$|A new {{parameterization}} {{of solar}} and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> {{was developed and}} tested. The solar radiation parameterization is based on that of Lacis and Hansen (1974), but with zenith-angle-dependent surface albedoes, and revised treatments of cloudiness. The <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> parameterization {{is based on the}} work of Chou (1984) for water vapor, Chou and Peng (1983) for carbon dioxide, and Rogers (1968) for ozone, with a new parameterization of the effects of clouds. Results obtained were compared with the new parameterizations to those obtained with the earlier parameterization described by Schlessinger (1976). Several dramatic improvements came to light. For the most part these are related to the fact that the new <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> paramerization includes the effects of the water vapor continuum, while the earlier parameterization does not. In the moist tropical planetary boundary layer (PBL) continuum emission leads to much stronger cooling of the PBL over the oceans. Over land, however, the cooling of the PBL is significantly reduced. The latter, somewhat paradoxical result is due to the strong diurnal cycle of the continental PBL. At night the shallow continental PBL is overlain by a moist layer created by mixing during the previous afternoon. The moist upper layer acts as a radiative blanket, reducing the time-averaged radiative cooling of the continental PBL...|$|R

40|$|Saharan Dust Experiment (SHADE) {{are used}} to {{quantify}} {{the effect of a}} strong dust outbreak on radiance and brightness temperatures. The dust gives a distinct spectral signature in upwelling and downwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> when high spectral resolution data for a dusty day is compared to data from a clear day. A radiative transfer model is used together with a size distribution retrieved from Sun photometers and atmospheric profiles from dropsondes to simulate the radiance data and provide a constraint on the refractive indices of Saharan dust in the terrestrial part of the spectrum. The degree of agreement between observed and simulated brightness temperatures is dominated by the choice of refractive index, the mass loading, and the altitude of the dust layer. The uncertainties in size distribution appear to have less of an effect so long as large particles (radius greater than 1 mm) are included. In the terrestrial spectrum the dust produced a relative warming rate of up to 0. 5 K/day below the dust and a relative cooling of up to 0. 5 K/day within the dust layer itself. The effect on irradiance due to this dust outbreak was a decrease in upwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> {{at the top of the}} atmosphere of 6. 5 Wm 2 and an increase in downwelling <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> at the surface of 11. 5 Wm 2.
