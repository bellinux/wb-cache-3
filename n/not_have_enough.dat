Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, {{but this was not}} a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{stress is}} known to be a common {{occupational}} health issue in the veterinary profession, few studies have investigated its broad domains or the internal validity of the survey instrument used for assessment. Methods: We analysed data from over 500 veterinarians in Queensland, Australia, who were surveyed during 2006 - 07. Results: The most common causes of stress were reported to be long hours worked per day, <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> holidays per year, <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> rest breaks per day, the attitude of customers, lack of recognition from the public and <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> time per patient. Age, gender and practice type were statistically associated with various aspects of work-related stress. Strong correlations were found between having too many patients per day and <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> time per patient; between <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> holidays and long working hours; and also between not enough rest breaks per day and long working hours. Factor analysis revealed four dimensions of stress comprising a mixture of career, professional and practice-related items. The internal validity of our stress questionnaire was shown to be high during statistical analysis. Conclusion: Overall, this study suggests that workplace stress is fairly common among Australian veterinarians and represents an issue that occupies several distinct areas within their professional life...|$|R

Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E

Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Following its release, Most Wanted {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> material {{to warrant a}} compilation. However, the Dead Executives-produced tracks received favorable comments; critics wrote that they stood out {{from the rest of}} the album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Duff's second number one album there. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand.|$|E

At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E

As they found lyrics that interested them, they had reproductions mailed to their homes from the Archives to work on the material at their leisure. The duo finished recording several songs throughout the year but did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> material to complete the album. The recordings were also made without a budget or record contract for release.|$|E

5|$|The band {{decided to}} release a live album after their {{producer}} Tony Visconti did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> {{time to work on}} a full studio session. The group listened through various archive recordings from earlier tours and compiled the album from the best versions. Various studio overdubs were made to the live recordings during early 1978 in Paris; exactly how much of the album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release. The album reached No.2 in the UK album charts, ultimately selling over half a million copies. It has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of the greatest live albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|The libertines {{continued}} organizing opposition, insulting {{the appointed}} ministers, and challenging {{the authority of}} the Consistory. The council straddled both sides of the conflict, alternately admonishing and upholding Calvin. When Perrin was elected first syndic in February 1552, Calvin's authority appeared to be at its lowest point. After some losses before the council, Calvin believed he was defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked the council to allow him to resign. Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> power to banish him.|$|E
