5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

2500|$|Annette Turngren – The October 20, 1938 the Hennepin County Review {{newspaper}} announced Annette Turngren, {{a writer}} of seven books, {{had just returned from}} Sweden where she gathered material for a new novel. [...] Her Flaxen Braids novel was, and still is, widely read. [...] It is a story of what established her as a teller of experiences growing up in Sweden and as immigrants here in Minnesota. [...] Her mother wrote poems and “sketches” which were published in Swedish magazines.

2500|$|This {{painting}} {{is representative of}} Shinn's work depicting theater scenes, his favorite subject, and an intricate set design, another of Shinn's hobbies. The artist portrays {{of a group of}} dancers, clad in mostly white, onstage with a detailed backdrop of picturesque hills and a garden. The brushstrokes are broad and wide, giving the painting has a vivid sense of immediacy; the figures within the painting almost seem to be moving. The painting has a faintly dream-like quality, making it seem more impressionist than realist in style. [...] Stagestruck from youth, Shinn <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> depicting the theater as a place of energy, skill, and satisfying illusion.|$|E

[...] No detail of the presentation of the artworks was too small for his consideration. He said of the museum in 1942 [...] "Anyone who wants to study nineteenth-century painting will sooner or later find it necessary to go to the Linz gallery, because only there will it be possible to find complete collections." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{after his}} eighteenth {{birthday}} in July, Grace confirmed his potential {{once and for}} all when he scored 224 not out for All-England against Surrey at The Oval. This was his maiden first-class century and Bernard Darwin described it as [...] "characteristic of him that he made a thorough job of it" [...] because [...] "he was <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> making runs and went on piling them up with a cheerful ruthlessness". All-England won the match by an innings and 296 runs, in the process effectively killing off the idea of a county team taking on the rest of England. The idea was revived, however, in 1877 when the county in question was Grace's Gloucestershire.|$|E

2500|$|People tend {{to believe}} as {{dictated}} by their own emotions, projections, and transferences. ... Our judgment should really be guided by what the protagonists <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> asserting themselves: {{that there was no}} sex. In the final analysis the question is whether we believe their testimony or not. I choose to believe them, and not out of prudery, but because in those days people saw premarital sexual relations, especially as applies to Spielrein, differently than we do today; moreover, because unconsummated sexual desire was even more poignant and more romantic than consummated sex. However, the sexual myth dies hard, providing sensational material for a number of theatrical productions and a plethora of articles in the popular press and professional journals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plains and}} fertile lands of Mesopotamia {{were not only}} ideal for warfare: they {{actually}} attracted war. Raiders from all nations coveted the lands of the Assyrians - Scythians to the north, Syrians, Arameans and Cimmerians to the West, Elamites to the East and Babylonians to the south. In fact, the latter <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> rebelling against Assyrian rule. As a result, {{in order to prevent}} chariots and cavalry from completely overwhelming these settlements, walls were constructed though often from mud or clay since stone was neither cheap, nor readily available. In order to destroy the opponents, these cities had to be taken as well and so the Assyrians soon mastered siege warfare; Esarhaddon claims to have taken Memphis, the capital of Egypt in less than a day, demonstrating the ferocity and skill of Assyrian siege tactics at this point in time: ...|$|E
2500|$|Elisha was {{a student}} of Greek; as the Talmud expresses it, [...] "Acher's tongue was <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> singing Greek songs" [...] (Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah i. 9). The Talmud {{suggests}} that his study of Greek philosophy {{was one of the}} factors that led him to apostasy (Hagigah 15b). Wilhelm Bacher, in his analysis of Talmudic legends, wrote that the similes attributed to Elisha (including the ones cited above) show that {{he was a man of}} the world, acquainted with wine, horses, and architecture. He evidently had a reputation as an authority in questions of religious practice, since Mo'ed Katan 20a records one of his halakhic decisions — the only one in his name, although others may be recorded under the names of his students or different rabbis. The Babylonian Talmud asserts that Elisha, while a teacher in the beth midrash (torah academy), kept forbidden books hidden in his clothes (Hagigah 15b).|$|E

2500|$|....... often {{stopped in}} Leipzig and brought {{there with him}} the {{aforementioned}} Goldberg, {{in order to have}} him given musical instruction by Bach. [...] The count was often ill and had sleepless nights. [...] At such times, Goldberg, who lived in his house, had {{to spend the night in}} an antechamber, so as to play for him during his insomnia. ... Once the count mentioned in Bach's presence that he would like to have some clavier pieces for Goldberg, which should be of such a smooth and somewhat lively character that he might be a little cheered up by them in his sleepless nights. [...] Bach thought himself best able to fulfill this wish by means of Variations, the writing of which he had until then considered an ungrateful task on account of the repeatedly similar harmonic foundation. [...] But since at this time all his works were already models of art, such also these variations became under his hand. [...] Yet he produced only a single work of this kind. [...] Thereafter the count always called them his variations. [...] He <b>never</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> them, and for a long time sleepless nights meant: [...] 'Dear Goldberg, do play me one of my variations.' [...] Bach was perhaps never so rewarded for one of his works as for this. [...] The count presented him with a golden goblet filled with 100 louis-d'or. [...] Nevertheless, even had the gift been a thousand times larger, their artistic value would not yet have been paid for."
