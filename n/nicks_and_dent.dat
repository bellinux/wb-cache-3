50|$|Welded bellows can be {{fabricated}} from {{a variety}} of exotic metals and alloys, whereas formed bellows are limited to alloys with good elongation - brass being a prime example. Welded bellows are not fabricated from brass because of its fundamentally poor weldability. Other advantages to welded bellows include compactness (higher performance in a smaller package), ability to be compressed to solid height with no damage, resistance to <b>nicks</b> <b>and</b> <b>dents,</b> <b>and</b> dramatically greater flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{cutting edge}} of a scythe blade is {{traditionally}} maintained by occasional peening followed by frequent honing. Peening reforms the malleable edge, by hammering, to: create the desired profile, to temper the metal and to remove minor <b>nicks</b> <b>and</b> <b>dents.</b> For mowing fine grass the bevel angle may be peened extremely fine, while for coarser work a larger angle is created to give a more robust edge. Peening requires some skill and is done using a peening hammer and special anvils or by using a peening jig. Historically, a peening station was {{set up on the}} edge of the field during harvest but now more likely back in the workshop.|$|R
50|$|After {{viewing the}} replicas and taking {{note of the}} wear and tear the Red Special had {{suffered}} during nearly 30 years of constant touring, May had Fryer restore the original Red Special in 1998 using as much original and time-period specific material as possible. Damaged veneer {{on the back of the}} guitar was removed and new pieces scarfed in. The binding was removed <b>and</b> various <b>nicks</b> <b>and</b> <b>dents</b> in the top were repaired. Fryer re-finished the neck and body in the original Rustin's Plastic Coating used in the creation over the existing finish, and fingerboard wear was repaired and dot-markers replaced. The original electrics were also re-wired and overhauled, and cosmetic work was done, such as filling in holes and worn areas on access panels, pick-up covers (worn by May's use of a sixpence as opposed to a standard pick) and the front scratchplate.|$|R
50|$|All machine tapers are {{sensitive}} to chips, <b>nicks</b> (<b>dents),</b> <b>and</b> dirt. They will not locate accurately, and the self-holding variety will not hold reliably, if such problems interfere with the seating of the male into the female with firm contact over the whole conical surface. Machinists are trained on keeping tapers clean and handling them in ways that prevent them from being nicked by other tools. CNC tool-changing cycles usually include a compressed-air blast while one toolholder is being swapped with the next. The air blast tends to blow away chips that might otherwise end up interfering between the toolholder and spindle.|$|R
