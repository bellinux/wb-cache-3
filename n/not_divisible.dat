25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Sophie Germain {{developed}} several novel approaches to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all exponents. First, she defined {{a set of}} auxiliary primes θ constructed from the prime exponent p by the equation , where h is any integer <b>not</b> <b>divisible</b> by three. She showed that, if no integers raised to the pth power were adjacent modulo θ (the non-consecutivity condition), then θ must divide the product xyz. Her goal was to use mathematical induction to prove that, for any given p, infinitely many auxiliary primes θ satisfied the non-consecutivity condition and thus divided xyz; since the product xyz can have at most {{a finite number of}} prime factors, such a proof would have established Fermat's Last Theorem. Although she developed many techniques for establishing the non-consecutivity condition, she did not succeed in her strategic goal. She also worked to set lower limits on the size of solutions to Fermat's equation for a given exponent p, a modified version of which was published by Adrien-Marie Legendre. As a byproduct of this latter work, she proved Sophie Germain's theorem, which verified the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (namely, the case in which p does not divide xyz) for every odd prime exponent less than 100. Germain tried unsuccessfully to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all even exponents, specifically for , which was proved by Guy Terjanian in 1977. + y2p = z2p |journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences.
