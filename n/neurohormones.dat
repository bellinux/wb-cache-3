5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of <b>neurohormones.</b> During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
25|$|Corpora cardiaca are {{a pair of}} neuroglandular {{bodies that}} are found behind the brain and on either sides of the aorta.

25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is responsible}} for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain <b>neurohormones,</b> called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{secretion}} {{of stress}} hormones, glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines (CAs), {{as a result}} of disease, may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of <b>neurohormones.</b> Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine, affect lymphocyte traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells.|$|E

25|$|Neuropharmacology is {{the study}} of how drugs affect {{cellular}} function in the nervous system, and the neural mechanisms through which they influence behavior. There are two main branches of neuropharmacology: behavioral and molecular. Behavioral neuropharmacology focuses on the study of how drugs affect human behavior (neuropsychopharmacology), including the study of how drug dependence and addiction affect the human brain. Molecular neuropharmacology involves the study of neurons and their neurochemical interactions, with the overall goal of developing drugs that have beneficial effects on neurological function. Both of these fields are closely connected, since both are concerned with the interactions of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, <b>neurohormones,</b> neuromodulators, enzymes, second messengers, co-transporters, ion channels, and receptor proteins in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Studying these interactions, researchers are developing drugs to treat many different neurological disorders, including pain, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, psychological disorders, addiction, and many others.|$|E

2500|$|Orgasm (from Greek ὀργασμός orgasmos [...] "excitement, swelling"; also sexual climax) is {{the sudden}} {{discharge}} of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Experienced by males and females, orgasms {{are controlled by}} the involuntary or autonomic nervous system. They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations. The period after orgasm (known as the refractory period) is often a relaxing experience, attributed {{to the release of}} the <b>neurohormones</b> oxytocin and prolactin as well as endorphins (or [...] "endogenous morphine").|$|E
50|$|Neither male nor female montane voles release high {{quantities}} of oxytocin or vasopressin when they mate. Even when injected with these <b>neurohormones,</b> their mating {{system does not}} change. In contrast, if prairie voles are injected with the <b>neurohormones,</b> they may form a lifelong attachment, {{even if they have}} not mated. It's believed that the differing response to the <b>neurohormones</b> between the two species is due to a difference in the number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Prairie voles have a greater number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors compared to montane voles, and are therefore more sensitive to those two <b>neurohormones.</b> It's believed that it's the quantity of receptors, rather than the quantity of the hormones, that determines the mating system and bond-formation of either species.|$|E

50|$|A <b>neurohormone</b> is any hormone {{produced}} and released by neuroendocrine cells (also called neurosecretory cells) into the blood.

5000|$|A natural neuroactive {{substance}} (NAS) is {{a chemical}} synthesized by neurons {{that affects the}} actions of other neurons or muscle cells. Natural neuroactive substances include neurotransmitters, <b>neurohormones,</b> and neuromodulators. [...] Neurotransmitters work only between adjacent neurons through synapses. <b>Neurohormones</b> are released into the blood and work at a distance. Some natural neuroactive substances act as both transmitters and as hormones.|$|E
40|$|Insect antenna is a multisensory organ, each {{modality}} {{of which}} can be modulated by biogenic amines. Octopamine (OA) and its metabolic precursor tyramine (TA) affect activity of antennal olfactory receptor neurons. There is some evidence that dopamine (DA) modulates gustatory neurons. Serotonin can serve as a neurotransmitter in some afferent mechanosensory neurons and both as a neurotransmitter and <b>neurohormone</b> in efferent fibers targeted at the antennal vessel and mechanosensory organs. As a <b>neurohormone,</b> serotonin affects the generation of the transepithelial potential by sensillar accessory cells. Other possible targets of biogenic amines in insect antennae are hygro- and thermosensory neurons and epithelial cells. We suggest that the insect antenna is partially autonomous in the sense that biologically active substances entering its hemolymph may exert their effects and be cleared from this compartment without affecting other body parts...|$|R
40|$|Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the <b>neurohormone</b> {{controlling}} {{sexual maturation}} and adult reproductive function (1 – 3). In rodents, the cell bodies of GnRH neurones are diffusely distri-buted in the preoptic region; in primates, including humans, {{they are also}} present in the tuberal region of the hypothalamus. The neuroendocrine fraction of GnRH neurones sends axons to the median eminence of the hypothalamus, where they release their <b>neurohormone</b> into the pituitary portal vasculature. On reaching the anterior, pituitary GnRH elicits the secretion of the gonadotro-phins luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone that stimulate gametogenesis and gonadal steroids secretion, and thus support reproductive physiology. Because GnRH neurones are the final common pathway for the central control of reproduction, their activity is regulated by a com-plex array of excitatory and inhibitory transsynaptic inputs (4 – 9). Noticeably, both GnRH neurones and the multiple neurona...|$|R

It is nondialyzable and loses its activity in alcohol, acetone, some proteases and trichloroacetate, renaturates after adding ammonium sulfate.|$|R
50|$|Neurosecretion is the storage, {{synthesis}} {{and release}} of hormones from neurons. These <b>neurohormones,</b> produced by neurosecretory cells, are normally secreted from nerve {{cells in the}} brain that then circulate into the blood. These <b>neurohormones</b> are similar to nonneural endocrine cells and glands in that they also regulate both endocrine and nonendocrine cells. Neurosecretion cells also release their product farther than normal neurons, which only secrete short distances, into the extracellular space {{some distance from the}} target cell.|$|E
50|$|These <b>neurohormones</b> are {{peptides}} of 70 to 80 {{amino acid}} residues which are processed from larger precursors. They contain six conserved cysteines {{that are involved}} in disulfide bonds.|$|E

50|$|Heteroreceptors are receptors that {{respond to}} neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or <b>neurohormones</b> {{released}} from adjacent neurons or cells; they are opposite to autoreceptors, which are sensitive only to neurotransmitters or hormones {{released by the}} cell in whose wall they are embedded.|$|E
50|$|In turn, the {{hypothalamus}} {{controls the}} release of hormones from the anterior pituitary by secreting a class of hypothalamic <b>neurohormones</b> called releasing and release-inhibiting hormones - which are released to the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system and act on the anterior pituitary.|$|E
50|$|The median {{eminence}} (ME) {{is located}} in the inferior portion of the hypothalamus and is ventral to the third ventricle. While some publications do not list the ME as a CVO, when it {{is considered to be a}} circumventricular organ, it is classified as a secretory organ. The median eminence is rich in fenestrated capillaries, allowing for the passage of proteins and <b>neurohormones.</b> More specifically, the median eminence allows for the transport of <b>neurohormones</b> between the CSF and the peripheral blood supply. The major cell type that makes up the median eminence are specialized ependymal cells known as tanycytes. These contribute to the organ's ability to selectively allow macromolecules to pass from the central to the peripheral neuroendocrine systems.|$|E

40|$|Release of <b>neurohormone</b> from {{putative}} cephalic neurohemal organs {{was directly}} demonstrated in an insect. The prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) {{of the tobacco}} hornworm, Manduca sexta, was measured indirectly by its ability to stimulate the secretion of α-ecdysone by inactive prothoracic glands; the ecdysone was measured by radioimmunoassay. The PTTH released spontaneously from intact brain-retrocerebral complexes was localized to the retrocerebral complex by placing a waxy barrier across the nerves connecting the corpora cardiaca to the brain. Isolated corpora allata spontaneously released much more PTTH than did either isolated corpora cardiaca or isolated brains. Media containing 100 mM potassium stimulated PTTH release from both isolated corpora allata and isolated corpora cardiaca. In calcium-free media, spontaneous PTTH release was diminished and release could not be stimulated by high potassium. These results indicate that depolarization of the neurosecretory cells is correlated with calcium-dependent <b>neurohormone</b> release {{and that there are}} multiple neurohemal organs for PTTH.
