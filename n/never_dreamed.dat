Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> I would witness.|$|E

Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role [...] "everything that I intended, and much that I had <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> of". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois [...] "tipped me over into madness".|$|E
500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what he means to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E

During the retreat, many of the Japanese wounded succumbed to their injuries and were buried along the Maruyama road. One of Maruyama's men, Lieutenant Keijiro Minegishi, noted in his diary, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> of retreating over the same mountainous trail through the jungle we crossed with such enthusiasm... we haven't eaten in three days and even walking is difficult. On the up hill my body swayed around unable to walk. I must rest every two meters." ...|$|E

In a statement on her website, she said, [...] "I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric." [...] She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of David Copperfield, [...] "a two-years' imaginative task". [...] "To which," [...] she added, [...] "I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles". She ended her message by saying [...] "Deathly Hallows is my favourite, {{and that is the}} most wonderful way to finish the series".|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Michael Grade {{returned}} to the BBC, {{this time as the}} Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he had previously disliked the show and imposed an eighteen-month hiatus on it during the Sixth Doctor era, he eventually wrote an e-mail to the Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, [...] " [...] <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> I would ever write this. I must be going soft!" [...] The revival also impressed former Doctor Sylvester McCoy, who praised Eccleston and Piper as well as their characters, and the pacing of the first episode. His only criticism was about the new TARDIS interior, though he did comment that he was [...] "also a bit dismayed that more wasn't made of the show's incidental music, which seemed fairly anonymous in the background".|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{view the}} scene in which Cagney pushes a {{grapefruit}} into Mae Clarke's face {{as one of the}} most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a late addition, and who thought of the idea is a matter of debate. Producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference, director William Wellman claimed that the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face. Cagney himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman's idea, saying, [...] "I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit. I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly. It wasn't even written into the script.".|$|E

500|$|After {{playing for}} the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico, Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946. He made the All-Star roster, batted [...]360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six). Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles, {{including}} Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit [...]372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering {{a career in the}} MLB, Doby said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought that that was the way it was going to be. There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in '46." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron {{became more}} heavily {{involved}} in Parks and Recreation storylines during the second season, and Offerman largely credited Schur {{with the development of}} the character. Schur has described Offerman as a [...] "once-in-a-generation comedic performer," [...] and [...] "our cast MVP, and in many ways our cast leader." [...] He compared Ron to a [...] "19th-century rugged individualist," [...] and said of creating the character, [...] "A lot of the credit has to go to Nick Offerman. In real life, he's an incredibly interesting guy, and at the very least, it's much easier to play an interesting guy when you're an interesting guy." [...] Offerman said his own sense of humor fuels much of the character, along with those of Schur, Greg Daniels, and the writing staff; he added: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> that I could prosper with my perverse sense of humor on a network show." [...] Schur said the staff liked writing for Ron because [...] "he's a great mix of a superhero, and also a deeply flawed, and very human and vulnerable person." ...|$|E
500|$|Films {{are a major}} form of entertainment, {{although}} not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: [...] "The Lumière brothers {{were the first to}} send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public." [...] In 1908, Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. [...] "In {{the first decade of the}} [...] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms." [...] The Americans first [...] "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," [...] but [...] "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle". Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. Animation, for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences. The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 21st century made it [...] "possible to do spectacle" [...] more cheaply and [...] "on a scale <b>never</b> <b>dreamed</b> of" [...] by Cecil B. DeMille. From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the [...] "only mass entertainment" [...] but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced. Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and fantastic) but also to animate non-living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form. Creators of The Lego Movie [...] "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer." [...] The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre, recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.|$|E
