5|$|I {{talked with}} one soldier who lay {{shivering}} in a bunk {{in the hospital}} coach. He had <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> sign of injury but his face was a ghastly green shade. He wanted more blankets and a cigarette, and I gave him both. An hour later, I helped move his body to the other coach.|$|E

5|$|Prominent {{families}} {{throughout the}} world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of Henry VIII survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, and his two daughters: Mary I of England in 1527 and Elizabeth I of England in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, contracted the disease as a child but had <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> scarring.|$|E
5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> division between these sections.|$|E
5|$|The bat's upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, {{while the}} {{underside}} is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips {{that allow the}} bat to hover. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, {{although there are no}} tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|E

5|$|To the band's consternation, {{they were}} forced to cancel their {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist– a meeting he did not attend. He was sent to relax in the sun on the Spanish island of Formentera with Waters and Sam Hutt (a doctor well-established in the underground music scene), but this led to <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> improvement.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes {{into contact with the}} quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Shepton Mallet is {{approximately}} {{halfway between the}} Roman towns of Bath and Ilchester on the Fosse Way, and although there are <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> remains (apart from {{the line of the}} Roman road), there is archaeological evidence for early military and later civilian settlement lasting into the 5th century. Domed pottery kilns, with pottery still in situ, were identified {{on the site of the}} Anglo-Bavarian Brewery in the mid-19th century, suggesting military activity in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Several hoards of Roman coins ranging from the 1st to 4th centuries have been found and more than 300 fibula brooches, potsherds and other artefacts. A few isolated burials near the route of the Fosse Way were found during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E

5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{complex is}} the part of the Taman Sari complex that is {{practically}} has <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> remains, except for a former hanging bridge and remains of a pier. The description of this area is retrieved from a reconstruction made from the 1812 English army sketch of the Yogyakarta kraton. This area extends about 600 meters to the east of the Segaran lake area. This area consisted of another artificial lake on the southeast of the Magangan complex toward the northeast of Siti Hinggil Kidul complex. In the middle of this artificial lake is another artificial island called Kinupeng Island (Javanese Pulo Kinupeng). A building, known as Gading building (Javanese Gedhong Gading) {{stood in the middle of}} the island.|$|E
5|$|This {{area that}} is located south of the bathing complex, but <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> remains are left. According to a {{reconstruction}} of the site, this complex consisted of the complex of Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari and the pool complex of Garjitawati with several pavilions and a garden. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari is {{the only part of}} the complex that is still protected. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari was probably used as a meditation place for the sultan, or some said as the meeting place for the sultan and his concubines. In the middle of the building was also a sleeping room for the sultan with water flowing beneath it. There was also a kitchen, a looming room, a storage, two pools for the servants, and a garden.|$|E

5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E
5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a nave and chancel, to which a sanctuary was added in the first building phase. The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries– a period of population growth– to include an aisled nave, a western tower and a northern chapel; its windows featured stained glass. The church was abandoned in the 15th century, presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches. It was demolished, and virtually all of its masonry removed, {{some of which may}} have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas. The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century, but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village. There were <b>no</b> <b>visible</b> remains of All Saints' Church by 1723, although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas. The site of All Saints' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979. The main structure had been robbed of its materials leaving only the foundations, from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building's construction and its form. Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings, floor tiles, remnants of stained glass, and several disturbed graves.|$|E
