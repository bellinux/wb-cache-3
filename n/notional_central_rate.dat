Thereafter, the Criminal Justice Act of 1948 transferred ownership of the hospital to the Department of Health (and the newly formed NHS) and oversight to the Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency established under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. It also renamed the hospital Broadmoor Institution. The hospital remained under direct control of the Department of Health - a situation which reportedly 'combined <b>notional</b> <b>central</b> control with actual neglect' until {{the establishment of the}} Special Hospitals Service Authority in 1989, with Charles Kaye as its first chief executive.|$|R
50|$|A {{currency}} {{is said to}} be pegged within a band when the central bank specifies a <b>central</b> exchange <b>rate</b> with reference to a single currency, a cooperative arrangement, or a currency composite. It also specifies a percentage allowable deviation {{on both sides of this}} <b>central</b> <b>rate.</b> Depending on the band width, the central bank has discretion in carrying out its monetary policy. The band itself may be a crawling one, which implies that the <b>central</b> <b>rate</b> is adjusted periodically. Bands may be symmetrically maintained around a crawling central parity (with the band moving in the same direction as this parity does). Alternatively, the band may be allowed to widen gradually without any pre-announced <b>central</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R

Therefore, the banking sector supervision {{needs to be done}} together.

Population of this study are <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> of ASEAN + 3 member countries from year 2006 - 2012. Samples were taken by using purposive sampling method to obtain 9 <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> of ASEAN + 3 members that are eligible for the sample. This study uses Vector Auto Regression (VAR), which combined with the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) using the program Eviews 6. In the analysis methods Granger Causality Test, Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Variance Decomposition (VD) are used. The results showed that the Granger Causality Test found some significant relations between <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> that exist in the member countries of ASEAN + 3. The Impulse Response Function (IRF) shows the reaction of the <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> j shocks that occurred in <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> i. The average quickest response is two weeks from the shock of other countries <b>central</b> bank <b>rate.</b> While the results of the analysis Variance Decomposition (VD) shows some impact of shock on <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> i will be accepted at the <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> j.
