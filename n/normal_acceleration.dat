5|$|NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center {{acquired}} an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights {{in support of}} short programs, chase on X-15 missions and lifting body flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate and <b>normal</b> <b>acceleration.</b> In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.|$|E

40|$|Postflight {{analysis}} of the Mars Pathfinder hypersonic, continuum aerodynamic data base is presented. Measured data include accelerations along the body axis and axis normal directions. Comparisons of preflight simulation and measurements show good agreement. The prediction of two static instabilities associated with movement of the sonic line from the shoulder to the nose and back was confirmed by measured <b>normal</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Reconstruction of atmospheric density during entry has an uncertainty directly proportional to the uncertainty in the predicted axial coefficient. The sensitivity of the moment coefficient to freestream density, kinetic models and center-of-gravity location are examined to provide additional consistency checks of the simulation with flight data. The atmospheric density as derived from axial coefficient and measured axial accelerations falls within the range required for sonic line shift and static stability transition as independently determined from <b>normal</b> <b>accelerations...</b>|$|R

A significant difference is found between the frequency of loads on two nominally identical 707 aircraft and the relationship of this to differences in autopilot characteristics is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the flight}} data {{recorder}} (FDR) outer protective case was damaged, the data tape inside was intact and all the data was recoverable. Five parameters were recorded by the FDR: heading, altitude, airspeed, <b>normal</b> <b>acceleration</b> (G loads), and microphone keying. [...] The FDR did not record rudder, aileron or spoiler deflection data, which could have aided the NTSB in reconstructing the plane's final moments. The data available proved insufficient to establish why the plane suddenly went into the fatal dive. The NTSB considered the possibilities of a malfunction of the rudder power control unit servo (which might have caused the rudder to reverse) {{and the effect of}} powerful rotor winds from the nearby Rocky Mountains might have had, but there was not enough evidence to prove either hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's <b>normal</b> <b>acceleration.</b>|$|E

40|$|Calculations {{are made}} of the {{approximate}} hazard due to peak <b>normal</b> <b>accelerations</b> of an airplane flying through a simulated vertical wind field associated with a convective frontal system. The calculations {{are based on a}} hazard metric developed from a systematic application of a generic math model to 1 -cosine discrete gusts of various amplitudes and gust lengths. The math model simulates the three degree-of- freedom longitudinal rigid body motion to vertical gusts and includes (1) fuselage flexibility, (2) the lag in the downwash from the wing to the tail, (3) gradual lift effects, (4) a simplified autopilot, and (5) motion of an unrestrained passenger in the rear cabin. Airplane and passenger response contours are calculated for a matrix of gust amplitudes and gust lengths. The airplane response contours are used to develop an approximate hazard metric of peak <b>normal</b> <b>accelerations</b> as a function of gust amplitude and gust length. The hazard metric is then applied to a two-dimensional simulated vertical wind field of a convective frontal system. The variations of the hazard metric with gust length and airplane heading are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Proposed manned {{space shuttle}} {{vehicles}} {{are expected to}} land on airport runways. In an emergency situation, however, the vehicle {{may be required to}} land on water. A 1 / 10 -scale dynamic model of a winged reentry vehicle was investigated to determine the water landing characteristics. Two configurations of the proposed vehicle were studied. Configuration 1 had a 30 deg negative dihedral of the stabilizer-elevon surface whereas configuration 2 had a 30 deg positive dihedral. Results indicate that the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>accelerations</b> for configurations 1 and 2 when landing in calm water were approximately 8 g and 6 g, respectively, and the maximum longitudinal accelerations were approximately 5 g and 3 g, respectively. A small hydroflap was needed to obtain satisfactory calm-water landings with configuration 2, whereas configuration 1 gave good landings without a hydroflap. All landings made in rough water resulted in unsatisfactory motions. For landings made in three different wave sizes, both configurations dived.

A kart that obtains the stealth mode pick-up is temporarily invulnerable to attack. Lines of speed boost tokens are found on the tracks.

50|$|The report's {{conclusions}} and recommendations noted loads remained below limits, implying {{there may be}} more maneuverability available to the airframe. There were five recommendations: increase pitch rate and available Nz (<b>Normal</b> <b>Acceleration</b> g) to provide the pilot with more maneuverability options given the inherent energy deficit; consider increasing alpha onset to also help offset the energy maneuverability deficit; consider increasing the beginning of the high AoA blended region to 30 degrees or greater to make high AoA maneuvering more predictable and intuitive; consider increasing pilot yaw rate to remove the gradual sluggish yaw response; and improve HMD Boresight performance to account for dynamic maneuvers and consider improving rearward visibility by creating more space for helmet motion.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to determine the landing characteristics of a 1 / 4 -scale dynamic model of the Apollo spacecraft command module using two different active (heat shield deployed prior to landing) landing systems for impact attenuation. One landing system (configuration 1) consisted of six hydraulic struts and eight crushable honeycomb struts. The other landing system (configuration 2), consisted of four hydraulic struts and six strain straps. Tests made on water and the hard clay-gravel composite landing surfaces simulated parachute letdown (vertical) velocities of 23 ft/sec (7. 0 m/s) (full scale). Landings made on the sand landing surface simulated vertical velocities of 30 ft/sec (9. 1 m/s). Horizontal velocities of from 0 to 50 ft/sec (15 m/s) were simulated.
