40|$|It is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} for construction projects to have applications for extension of time. Many problems are encountered in practice in the application and preparation of extension of time claims. A {{study was conducted to}} identify the main problems encountered in the application and assessment of extension of time claim in selected construction projects in Malaysia. Three (3) case studies have been used 10 investigate the extension of time issues. Findings from the study revealed that local contractors usually fail to comply with the contract procedural requirements to submit timely <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> and have difficulty in demonstrating their entitlement for extension of time. The main problem faced by contract administrators is that contractors tend to "inflate" their extension of time entitlement with the intention to maximise their claims. Adherence to the agreed procedure in preparing and evaluating of delay claims and the implementation of a set of agreed standardised delay analysis may help to minimize the frequency and impact of such problems...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{delay is}} a common {{situation}} in every construction project. Delay happens in all construction projects, {{whether it is a}} simple or a complex project. When the projects are delayed, they will invite to the additional cost. Therefore, managing project delay is important. The aim of this project is to examine the management of the delayed completion on construction projects and the objectives of this study are to evaluate the degree of delay on construction projects, to identify the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> on construction projects and to investigate the respondent's actions when rectifying the delayed completion. To achieve these objectives, questionnaire surveys were distributed to thirty respondents. The result of the study shows that the more complex project, the less likely it is to complete on time, therefore, more liabilities (Extension of Time and compensation) have been imposed for complex projects. The study also reveals that the delay is only identified when the schedule is updated and reissued while by working overtime, it is said that it was the most preferred action to be taken to rectify the delay...|$|E

The series also has a more modern design and has two 15-inch LCD monitors above each door, one of which is used for displaying silent commercials, news and weather; and another which is used for displaying information on the next stop (in both Japanese and English) along with <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> on Shinkansen and other railway lines in the greater Tokyo area. The E231-500 series trains are based at Tokyo General Rolling Stock Centre near Ōsaki Station.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} attitudes in the Thai construction industry sector towards 21 {{issues related to}} “delay in the approval of submittals” that may initiate conflicts among various parties. Knowledge gained from this study {{can be applied to}} the analyses of the completeness and appropriateness of contract conditions and to improve contract drafting. The attitudes of the majority of people in the industry towards several issues related to the time frame for the approval of submittals, compensation for cost increases and profit losses, and time frames for <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> approval and claim submission were found to be inconsistent with existing conditions in standard contracts. Various issues that are not covered in the standard contract forms, such as the time frame for providing reminders and the types of time loss and direct costs that can be claimed, were also found to have high tendencies to initiate conflicts between contracting parties. Finally, we also found that the organisational affiliation of the respondents (i. e., employer or contractor) influenced their attitudes towards some, but not all, contractual issues...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

40|$|In many {{developed}} countries, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer {{cases is}} compulsory. Developing countries including India {{accounts for more}} than half of new cancer cases in the world, however <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer is not yet mandatory.

It is also a valuable source for incidence, prevalence, mortality and morbidity <b>of</b> the disease. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer will lead to improved awareness of common etiologic agents, better understanding of common preventable causes and better utilization of health resources with better monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of health programs such as cancer screening and cancer treatment programs, which ultimately might improve survival. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be done by the doctor or the hospital. Akin to the integrated disease surveillance project where more than 90 % of the districts report weekly data through E-mail/portal, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be implemented if it is incorporated into the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke scheme.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA {{strategy}} {{for addressing the}} complexity of problem identification and notification by autonomous telemetry monitoring software is discussed. The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite's science operations center (ESOC) is completing a transition to autonomous operations. Originally staffed by two people, twenty-four hours every day, the ESOC is {{nearing the end of}} a phased transition to unstaffed monitoring of the science payload health. To develop criteria for the implementation of autonomous operations we first identified and analyzed potential risk areas. These risk areas were then considered in light of a fully staffed operations model, and in several reduced staffing models. By understanding the accepted risk in the nominal, fully staffed model, we could define what criteria to use in comparing the effectiveness of reduced staff models. The state of the scientific instrument package for EUVE is evaluated by a rule-based telemetry processing software package. In the fully automated implementation, anomalous states are characterized in three tiers: critical to immediate instrument health and safety, non-critical to immediate instrument health and safety, and affecting science data only. Each state requires specific action {{on the part of the}} engineering staff, and the response time is determined by the tier. The {{strategy for}} implementing this prioritized, autonomous instrument monitoring and paging system is presented. We have experienced a variety of problems in our implementation of this strategy, many of which we have overcome. Problems addressed include: dealing with data dropouts, determining if instrument knowledge is current, reducing the number of times personnel are paged for a single problem, prohibiting redundant <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> known problems, <b>delaying</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> problems for instrument states that do not jeopardize the immediate health of the instrument, assuring a response to problems in a timely manner by engineering staff, and communicating problems and response status among responsible personnel...|$|R
