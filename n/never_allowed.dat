5|$|Before the 1994 season, Reeves named Dave Brown, who {{had been}} a #1 {{supplemental}} draft choice in 1992, the Giants starting quarterback. Though Brown led the Giants to wins in their first three games, they lost their next seven. The Giants recovered to win their last six games of the season, but missed the playoffs. During the winning streak, they <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> more than 20 points in a game.|$|E
5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. They {{only have to}} lie down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E

5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> to remarry, {{while it}} was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years, and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal approval is sought.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} that religious unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> the Church to interfere with what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Atemengue {{was made}} {{chief of the}} local court, and Atangana was again {{appointed}} paramount chief (chef supérieur). He received {{a seat on the}} Council of Notables, a body the French had introduced to act as liaisons to their subjects and advisors to the administration. Atangana set up a cabinet based on those he had observed in Spain, but he <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.|$|E

5|$|The {{large amount}} of space in rural cemeteries permits the use of {{sculpture}} {{in a way that}} the crowded churchyard has <b>never</b> <b>allowed.</b> Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works of well-known contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased. Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.|$|E

5|$|Hamels was {{selected}} the Phillies starter for Game 1 of the World Series; the Phillies won 3–2, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game 5, which was suspended due to rain after {{the top of}} the sixth inning tied at 2-2, and receiving a no-decision; when Game 5 resumed the Phillies won 4-3 to clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA. Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he did not hold opponents scoreless. Hamels was named the 2008 World Series MVP.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with DriveShaft to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> to spend time with her son.|$|E
5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E

5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he <b>never</b> <b>allowed</b> them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
