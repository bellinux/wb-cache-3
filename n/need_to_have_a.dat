5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies {{wanted to}} win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage {{until late in the}} season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E

For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} union recognition.
