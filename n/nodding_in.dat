25|$|The Royals {{returned}} to the Madesjki on 26 August with a thumping 5–1 victory over Luton Town in the League Cup 2nd Round. Noel Hunt opened the scoring after <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> brother Stephen Hunt's cross. Soon later {{it was the other}} way around, Noel Hunt sliding in a cross and Stephen Hunt slotted home. Alex Pearce, Jem Karacan and James Henry all got their first goals for the club. A consolation for Luton was scored by Ryan Charles.|$|E
500|$|They sight an erratically moving Dutch {{ship with}} a {{grinning}} red-capped seaman on deck, <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> apparent greeting as they approach. Initially {{delighted with the}} prospect of deliverance, they quickly become horrified as they are overcome with an awful stench. They soon realize that the apparently cheerful sailor is, in fact, a corpse propped up in the ship's rigging, his [...] "grin" [...] a result of his partially decomposed skull moving as a seagull feeds upon it. As the ship passes, it becomes clear that all its occupants are rotting corpses.|$|E
500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E

2500|$|Nicknamed [...] "Nodder" [...] due to {{his habit}} of <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> {{agreement}} when in conversation, Dansie was born in Nuriootpa, South Australia, the grandson of Sam Dansie, a leading country cricketer who represented a Broken Hill team against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club side.|$|E
2500|$|Peaking {{at number}} 134 on the U.S. Billboard Top LPs chart, In a Silent Way became Davis's first album since 1965's My Funny Valentine {{to reach the}} chart. While it {{performed}} better commercially than most of Davis's previous work, the album's critics were divided in their reaction upon its release. Its incorporation of electronic instrumentation and experimental structure have been sources of extreme controversy among jazz critics. According to The Rolling Stone Album Guide (1992), Davis's recording process and producer Teo Macero's studio editing of individual recordings into separate tracks for the album [...] "seemed near heretical by jazz standards". In his book Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Phil Freeman writes that rock and jazz critics {{at the time of}} the album's release were biased in their respective genres, writing [...] "Rock critics thought In a Silent Way sounded like rock, or at least thought Miles was <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> their direction, and practically wet themselves with joy. Jazz critics, especially ones who didn't listen to much rock, thought it sounded like rock too, and they reacted less favorably". Freeman continues by expressing that both reactions were [...] "rooted, at least partly, in the critic's paranoia about his place in the world", writing that rock criticism was in its early stage of existence and such critics found [...] "reassurance" [...] in viewing the album as having psychedelic rock elements, while jazz critics felt [...] "betrayed" [...] amid the genre's decreasing popularity at the time.|$|E

6000|$|The other farewells were hurried; Alan seemed voiceless, only <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> {{reply to}} Mary's vociferous {{messages}} to Harry, and huskily whispering to Ethel, [...] "Good luck to Cocksmoor!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{attendant}} stooped {{over the}} bed, to ascertain; and <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> the affirmative.|$|R
6000|$|... "We had {{business}} {{with him at}} Rotterdam," [...] quoth Socrates {{with one of his}} choicest oaths and <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the prisoner. [...] "All day we have wondered what has become of him." ...|$|E
60|$|While he {{was thus}} engaged, Mr Crummles looked, {{from time to}} time, with great {{interest}} at Smike, {{with whom he had}} appeared considerably struck from the first. He had now fallen asleep, and was <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{watching}} out all I can," [...] was the grim reply. Dave was bending over the steering-wheel, trying {{his best to}} see through the windshield. [...] "I guess I'll have to open it a little," [...] he went on, <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the glass.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{can talk}} now," [...] said the host; [...] "these slaves will not heed us. They," [...] he added, <b>nodding</b> <b>in</b> the {{direction}} of the carver and his half-dozen henchmen, [...] "are all deaf as well as mute, so we need have no fear of them." ...|$|E
60|$|Cowley, he stuns {{himself with}} it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way {{the way of}} a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut.

60|$|And now came Lu-don and {{the naked}} Obergatz, {{and the high}} priest led the German to his place behind the altar, himself {{standing}} upon the other's left.

60|$|Stirling <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> {{a manner}} which {{suggested}} {{that this was what}} he had expected.|$|R
