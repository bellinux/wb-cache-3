25|$|A {{common mistake}} of early FTP administrators was to permit a {{directory}} named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.|$|E
25|$|VFAT Long File Names (LFNs) {{are stored}} on a FAT file system using a trick—adding (possibly multiple) {{additional}} entries into the directory before the <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> entry. The additional entries are {{marked with the}} Volume Label, System, Hidden, and Read Only attributes (yielding 0x0F), which is a combination that is not expected in the MS-DOS environment, and therefore ignored by MS-DOS programs and third-party utilities. Notably, a directory containing only volume labels is considered as empty and is allowed to be deleted; such a situation appears if files created with long names are deleted from plain DOS. This method {{is very similar to}} the DELWATCH method to utilize the volume attribute to hide pending delete files for possible future undeletion since DRDOS6.0 (1991) and higher. It is also similar to a method publicly discussed to store long filenames on Ataris and under Linux in 1992.|$|E
50|$|A mini {{file manager}} is often used. It {{represents}} the <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> manager, {{but it is}} restricted in its operations.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{returns for}} {{deceased}} individuals must be <b>filed</b> by the <b>normal</b> <b>filing</b> deadline or 6 {{months after the}} date of death, whichever comes later. Example: Mary dies on January 30, 2004; her 2003 return is due on July 30, 2004 (six months later) and her 2004 return is due on April 30, 2005 (<b>normal</b> <b>filing</b> deadline). This provision is also extended to the surviving spouse.|$|R
50|$|For <b>normal</b> <b>files</b> in {{the file}} system, Unix does not impose or provide any {{internal}} file structure.This implies that {{from the point of}} view of the operating system, there is only one file type.|$|R
50|$|Suffix rules cannot {{have any}} {{prerequisites}} of their own. If they have any, {{they are treated}} as <b>normal</b> <b>files</b> with unusual names, not as suffix rules. GNU make supports suffix rules for compatibility with old makefiles but otherwise encourages usage of pattern rules.|$|R
5000|$|... 'command' is a {{file that}} {{connects to the}} command line, {{so that it can}} be read using <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> read operations.|$|E
50|$|Sparse {{files are}} {{typically}} handled transparently to the user. But {{the differences between}} a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> and sparse file become apparent in some situations.|$|E
5000|$|Boot sector : The boot sector can {{sometimes}} be recreated more easily than saving it. Still, it usually isn't a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> and the system won't boot without it.|$|E
50|$|CDMI {{supports}} {{export of}} containers as NFS or CIFS shares. Clients that mount these shares see the container hierarchy as an ordinary filesystem directory hierarchy, and {{the objects in}} the containers as <b>normal</b> <b>files.</b> Metadata outside of ordinary filesystem metadata {{may or may not}} be exposed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Normal</b> {{temporary}} <b>files</b> {{have the}} following file name extensions: ...|$|R

5000|$|EncFS's {{encrypted}} directory can {{be located}} on a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> server (via NFS, SSHFS, etc.) and can be mirrored and backed up efficiently with normal file-system tools, such as Rsync ...|$|E
5000|$|To read a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> {{from the}} floppy device number 8 the command [...] is issued on a Commodore 64. That causes the {{following}} high level communication to take place: ...|$|E
50|$|The umsdos FAT {{filesystem}} driver stores all of {{the extra}} information relating to Unix file semantics in what, to another FAT filesystem driver, appears {{to be just a}} <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> in each directory and subdirectory, named --LINUX-.---.|$|E
50|$|However, one {{track is}} {{reserved}} by DOS for directory and file allocation information (the BAM, block availability map). And since for <b>normal</b> <b>files,</b> two bytes of each physical sector {{are used by}} DOS as a pointer to the next physical track and sector of the file, only 254 out of the 256 bytes of a block are used for file contents.|$|R
50|$|A valid boot sector on the floppy disk, not in {{the format}} of a <b>normal</b> disk <b>file.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{program also}} had an anti-stealth and check sum feature {{that could be used}} to detect any changes in <b>normal</b> <b>files.</b> This {{technology}} was intended to make up for the unavailability of regular update packages. The final update of MSAV was released in June 1996 by Symantec, it added the ability to detect polymorphic viruses and the virus definitions were updated to scan for a total of 2,371 viruses.|$|R
50|$|In log-structured file systems, the write-twice penalty {{does not}} apply because the journal itself is the file system: it {{occupies}} the entire storage device and is structured {{so that it can}} be traversed as would a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{anomalous}} {{files that}} are renewal, namely, when all particles attempt a jump together, yet, with jumping times {{taken from a}} distribution that decays as a power law with an exponent, −1 − α, the MSD scales like the MSD of the corresponding <b>normal</b> <b>file,</b> {{in the power of}} α.|$|E
5000|$|The mouse daemon {{listens to}} a mouse port (by default, [...] ) and {{supplies}} mouse data to a virtual mouse driver, sysmouse(4). A user process {{that wants to}} use the mouse simply opens [...] and reads from it like a <b>normal</b> <b>file.</b> This {{makes it possible for}} the console and user processes such as the X Window System to share the mouse.|$|E
5000|$|... bit 15 is 1 if {{the color}} is valid, or 0 if {{the color is}} not valid (as with <b>normal</b> STL <b>files).</b>|$|R
50|$|HMRC has {{one year}} from the <b>normal</b> <b>filing</b> date, which is itself {{one year after the}} end of the period of account, to open an enquiry into the return. This period is {{extended}} if the return is filed late. The enquiry continues until all issues that HMRC wish to enquire about a return are dealt with. However, a company can appeal to the Commissioners of Income Tax to close an enquiry if they feel there is undue delay.|$|R
5000|$|Solaris version 9 {{and later}} allows files to have [...] "extended attributes", which are {{actually}} forks; the maximum {{size of an}} [...] "extended attribute" [...] {{is the same as}} the maximum size of a file, and they are read and written in the same fashion as files. Internally, they are actually stored and accessed like <b>normal</b> <b>files,</b> so their names cannot contain [...] "/" [...] characters and their ownership and permissions can differ from those of the parent file.|$|R
50|$|In modern computing, {{journaling}} is a capability which ensures {{consistency of}} {{data in the}} file system, despite any power outages or system crash that may occur. XFS provides journaling for file system metadata, where file system updates are first written to a serial journal before the actual disk blocks are updated. The journal is a circular buffer of disk blocks that is not read in <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> system operation.|$|E
5000|$|Strictly created ISO 9660 filenames {{can only}} contain up to 8 capital letters or digits, {{followed}} by a period and up to three more capital letters or digits. TRANS.TBL is simply a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> in each directory, containing the extended versions of file names in that directory; a system reading the filesystem can then use the extended filenames (sometimes called [...] "long filenames") instead of the ISO ones.|$|E
50|$|The tree rebuild {{process of}} ReiserFS's fsck has {{attracted}} much criticism by the *nix community: If the file system becomes so badly corrupted that its internal tree is unusable, performing a tree rebuild operation may further corrupt existing files or introduce new entries with unexpected contents, but this {{action is not}} part of normal operation or a <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> system check and has to be explicitly initiated and confirmed by the administrator.|$|E
50|$|Recently related SDX files {{have been}} introduced. They are {{metadata}} for Secure Download Manager, which downloads either <b>normal</b> EXE/MSI <b>files</b> or encrypted SDC files and automatically decrypts them.|$|R
50|$|The saved {{image data}} are {{compressed}} {{only by a}} simple RLE algorithm, but GIMP supports compressed files, using either gzip or bzip2. The compressed files can be opened as <b>normal</b> image <b>files.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other RDBMS, NoSQL has the full power of UNIX during application development and usage. Its user interface uses the UNIX shell. So, {{it is not}} necessary to learn a set of new commands to administer the database. From the view of NoSQL, the database is not more than a set of files similar to any other user file. No scripting or other type of database language is used besides the UNIX shell. This shell-nature encourages casual use of this database, which makes its use familiar, resulting in formal use. In other words, NoSQL is a set of shell routines that access <b>normal</b> <b>files</b> of the operating system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{extensible}} {{markup language}} (XML) has become a popular format for data representation in recent years. Although XML data {{can be stored in}} <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> systems, it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their [...] "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort". As an evolution of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{distributed}} applications at NCSS pioneered early implementations of teleconferencing, inter-user messaging, client/server database processing (before commercial SQL systems existed), and file sharing, both {{on a single}} machine and between machines. (An interprocess communication interface, for example, was implemented providing transparent read/write access between remote applications [...] - [...] using <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> system I/O, analogous to a UNIX pipe. This let applications on different mainframes exchange data {{without the need for}} any software modification.) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{versioning}} {{file system}} is any computer file system which allows a computer file {{to exist in}} several versions at the same time. Thus it {{is a form of}} revision control. Most common versioning file systems keep a number of old copies of the file. Some limit the number of changes per minute or per hour to avoid storing large numbers of trivial changes. Others instead take periodic snapshots whose contents can be accessed with similar semantics to <b>normal</b> <b>file</b> access.|$|E
50|$|While {{resembling}} {{the same basic}} design ideas as FAT16 and FAT32, the FATX16 and FATX32 on-disk structures are simplified but fundamentally incompatible with normal FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, {{making it impossible for}} <b>normal</b> FAT <b>file</b> system drivers to mount such volumes.|$|R
5000|$|Unix does however {{have some}} special files. These special files can be {{identified}} by the [...] command which displays the type of the file in the first alphabetic letter of the file system permissions field. A <b>normal</b> (regular) <b>file</b> is indicated by a hyphen-minus [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>Normal</b> <b>files</b> are {{progressively}} indexed. Single-block files (under 513 bytes) have no index block; {{the directory}} entry points {{directly to the}} block of file data. Files with between 2 and 256 blocks (513 bytes to 128 kB) of data have a single index block, to which the directory entry points, which contains a list of up to 256 data block addresses. Larger files have a master index block containing a list of up to 256 index block addresses. When the Apple IIgs was introduced, a new storage format was introduced for files with two forks, as was typical for IIgs system and program files; the directory entry points to an informational block that tells the computer the storage format of the two forks. These files cannot be read or written natively by ProDOS 8, though the volume itself remains compatible.|$|R
