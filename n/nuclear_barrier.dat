40|$|Diffusion {{barriers}} are effective means for constraining protein lateral exchange in cellular membranes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{they have been}} shown to sustain parental identity through asymmetric segregation of ageing factors during closed mitosis. Even though barriers have been extensively studied in the plasma membrane, their identity and organization within the nucleus remains poorly understood. Based on different lines of experimental evidence, we present a model of the composition and structural organization of a <b>nuclear</b> diffusion <b>barrier</b> during anaphase. By means of spatial stochastic simulations, we propose how specialised lipid domains, protein rings, and morphological changes of the nucleus may coordinate to restrict protein exchange between mother and daughter nuclear lobes. We explore distinct, plausible configurations of these diffusion barriers and offer testable predictions regarding their protein exclusion properties and the diffusion regimes they generate. Our model predicts that, while a specialised lipid domain and an immobile protein ring at the bud neck can compartmentalize the nucleus during early anaphase; a specialised lipid domain spanning the elongated bridge between lobes would be entirely sufficient during late anaphase.

Subsequently, the {{in vitro}} and in vivo expression characteristics of mRNA/GL 67 complexes and pDNA/GL 67 complexes, each produced at their optimal ratio, were compared in respiratory cells. Transfection of A 549 cells with mRNA/GL 67 complexes {{resulted in a}} much faster expression than after transfection with pDNA/GL 67 complexes. The percentage of GFP-positive cells after mRNA and pDNA transfection peaked after 8 and 24 h, respectively. At these time points the percentage of GFP-positive cells was two times higher after mRNA transfection than after pDNA transfection. Furthermore, the efficacy of mRNA/GL 67 complexes was independent of the cell cycle. This was in sharp contrast with pDNA/GL 67 complexes that caused only a weak expression in nondividing cells. This confirms that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>barrier</b> is a crucial obstacle for pDNA but not for mRNA.

40|$|The damping of the {{harmonic}} oscillator is {{studied in the}} framework of the Lindblad theory for open quantum systems. A generalization of the fundamental constraints on quantum mechanical diffusion coefficients which appear in the master equation for the damped quantum oscillator is presented; the Schrödinger, Heisenberg and Weyl-Wigner-Moyal representations of the Lindblad equation are given explicitly. On the basis of these representations it is shown that various master equations for the damped quantum oscillator used in the literature are particular cases of the Lindblad equation and that not all of these equations are satisfying the constraints on quantum mechanical diffusion coefficients. The master equation is transformed into Fokker-Planck equations for quasiprobability distributions and a comparative study is made for the Glauber P representation, the antinormal ordering Q representation and the Wigner W representation. The density matrix is represented via a generating function, which is obtained by solving a time-dependent linear partial differential equation derived from the master equation. The damped harmonic oscillator is applied for the description of the charge equilibration mode observed in deep inelastic reactions. For a system consisting of two harmonic oscillators the time dependence of expectation values, Wigner function and Weyl operator are obtained and discussed. In addition models for the damping of the angular momentum are studied. Using this theory to the quantum tunneling through the <b>nuclear</b> <b>barrier,</b> besides Gamow's transitions with energy conservation, additional transitions with energy loss, are found.

40|$|One of the {{functions}} of the cell nucleus is to help regulate gene expression by controlling molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope. Here we investigate, via stochastic simulation, what effects, if any, does segregation of a system into the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments have on the stochastic properties of a motif with a negative feedback. One {{of the effects of the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>barrier</b> is to delay the nuclear protein concentration, allowing it to behave in a switch-like manner. We found that this delay, defined as the time for the nuclear protein concentration to reach a certain threshold, has an extremely narrow distribution. To show this, we considered two models. In the first one, the proteins could diffuse freely from cytoplasm to nucleus (simple model); and in the second one, the proteins required assistance from a special class of proteins called importins. For each model, we generated fifty parameter sets, chosen such that the temporal profiles they effectuated were very similar, and whose average threshold time was approximately 150 minutes. The standard deviation of the threshold times computed over one hundred realizations were found to be between 1. 8 and 7. 16 minutes across both models. To see whether a genetic motif in a prokaryotic cell can achieve this degree of precision, we also simulated five variations on the coherent feedforward motif (CFFM), three of which contained a negative feedback. We found that the performance of these motifs was nowhere near as impressive as the one found in the eukaryotic cell; the best standard deviation was 6. 6 minutes. We argue that the significance of these results, the fact and necessity of spatiooral precision in the developmental stages of eukaryotes, and the absence of such a precision in prokaryotes, all suggest that the nucleus has evolved, in part, under the selective pressure to achieve highly predictable phenotypes.

It is assumed here that this kinetic energy is the same as the emitted energy. The emitting alpha kinetic energies here are calculated by the difference of the masses of the parent and daughter nuclei and the alpha particles.

40|$|Non-viral vectors are {{promising}} vehicles for gene therapy but delivery of plasmid DNA to post-mitotic cells is challenging as nuclear entry is particularly inefficient. We have developed and evaluated a hybrid mRNA/DNA {{system designed to}} bypass the <b>nuclear</b> <b>barrier</b> to transfection and facilitate cytoplasmic gene expression. This system, based on co-delivery of mRNA(A 64) encoding for T 7 RNA polymerase (T 7 RNAP) with a T 7 -driven plasmid, produced between 10 - and 2200 -fold higher gene expression in primary dorsal root ganglion neuronal (DRGN) cultures isolated from Sprague–Dawley rats compared to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) -driven plasmid, and 30 -fold greater expression than the enhanced T 7 -based autogene plasmid pR 011. Cell-free assays and in vitro transfections highlighted the versatility of this system with small quantities of T 7 RNAP mRNA required to mediate expression at levels that were significantly greater than with the T 7 -driven plasmid alone or supplemented with T 7 RNAP protein. We have also characterized a number of parameters, such as mRNA structure, intracellular stability and persistence of each nucleic acid component that represent important factors in determining the transfection efficiency of this hybrid expression system. The {{results from this study}} demonstrate that co-delivery of mRNA is a promising strategy to yield increased expression with plasmid DNA, and represents an important step towards improving the capability of non-viral vectors to mediate efficient gene transfer in cell types, such as in DRGN, where the nuclear membrane is a significant barrier to transfection. © 2006 Farrow et al.

40|$|Naked DNA is a {{non-toxic}} vector for {{therapeutic gene}} delivery. However, current methods of transfection with naked DNA reach a {{limited range of}} susceptible tissues and have a low efficiency. The transfection of clinically important post-mitotic cells is particularly challenging because in these cells DNA need to pass the <b>nuclear</b> <b>barrier.</b> Thus, new principles for the transfer of naked DNA into human cells are required {{and can be found}} among the genetic exchange mechanisms in bacteria, where gene entry into cells via pick-up and transfer of naked DNA is known as “transformation”. In a number of bacteria, dedicated molecular machinery facilitates cell entry of free DNA by the process of “natural transformation”. In transformation-competent bacterial cells, specialised protein complexes mediate the binding of free double-stranded DNA, its fragmentation, cell entry and conversion to single-stranded DNA. I propose to exploit bacterial natural transformation machinery for a two-step transfection of human cells with therapeutic naked DNA. Firstly, the bacterial transformation protein complexes are inserted into the plasma membranes or nuclear envelopes of the target human cells and, secondly, the double-stranded vector DNA is supplied for the processing by the installed DNA transfer apparatus. I hypothesize that non-toxic bacterial transformation complexes residing in their new human milieu can promote the ultra-efficient transfer of exogenous therapeutic naked DNA. As the introduction of DNA into mammalian cells by non-viral means is called “transfection”, I propose to name the bacterial transformation complexes functioning in their new eukaryotic surroundings as “transfectosomes”. The initial step of the gene delivery should exploit the modern methods of extraneous protein insertion into mammalian cells, such as cell painting, engineering of cell permeable proteins with targeted intracellular localization, physical techniques of protein transfer like electroinsertion and electroporation. Sequence-selective natural transformation systems are known and can be taken advantage of to exclude undesired (e. g. gene silencing) portions of vector DNA from entering human nucleoplasm. Improved transfectosomes can possibly be engineered for better establishment and performance in human membranes. The hypothesis can be tested by comparing the naked DNA transfer efficiency into the transfectosome-bearing and the naive human cells in ex-vivo and in-vivo gene therapy settings. Immunogenicity of the transfectosomes can be modulated by protein engineering. As the delivered fragments of single-stranded DNA are highly recombinogenic, the confirmation of the hypothesis can lead to a breakthrough in gene repair therapy of dominantly inherited familial hypercholesterolemia, polycystic kidney disease and trinucleotide repeat disorders.

40|$|For many years, the {{instability}} of RNA had raised doubts {{as to whether it}} was possible to effectively use mRNA for gene therapy. However, rapid advances in messenger RNA-based technologies in the last decade have transformed mRNA into an increasingly popular therapeutic modality, especially in the field of vaccination against cancer and viral infections. Today, mRNA is considered a safer alternative to pDNA-based therapeutics, as it does not pose the risk of genomic integration, unlike DNA. Furthermore, mRNA-based approaches offer immediate expression of a protein of interest even in non-dividing cells. In Chapter 2 of the dissertation we reviewed the general properties and advantages of RNA as a therapeutic modality. Moreover, we discussed specific attributes, limitations and benefits of unmodified, modified and self-replicating mRNA platforms. Additionally, we also provide insights into {{the instability}} of the mRNA molecule and strategies to improve the efficiency of the transfection of in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA. In Chapter 3, we compared DNA and RNAbased strategies for heterologous gene expression using cationic liposomes as delivery system. We showed that transfection of human lung adenocarcinoma cells with mRNA complexes results in a much faster expression compared to pDNA complexes. While the efficacy of mRNA complexes is independent of the cell cycle, pDNA complexes result in weak expression in nondividing cells. Thus, these data demonstrate that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>barrier</b> is a crucial obstacle for pDNA but not for mRNA. However, when mRNA and pDNA complexes encoding luciferase were administered intranasally to the lungs of mice, only the pDNA complexes gave rise to a detectable bioluminescent signal. This is likely due to the differences in the stability of the complexes as we showed that mRNA complexes are less stable in biological fluids compared to DNA complexes. However, as described in Chapter 4, the innate immune response of the cells in the mouse lung is also likely to be a major cause of the reduced expression from mRNA. Regardless, these results demonstrated the functional limitations of the traditional unmodified mRNA platform and encouraged us to develop a more stable and efficient RNA platform as we described in Chapter 5. In Chapter 4, we showed that carriermediated delivery of mRNA may activate TLR 3 signaling in respiratory cells. Carrier-mediated delivery of mRNA caused activation of the innate immune system accompanied by a massive production of immunostimulatory cytokines, such as IL- 6 or TNFα in vitro as well as in mice following intranasal instillation. Furthermore, the presented data demonstrate that the recognition of mRNA by the innate immune system is also associated with cell death, which proceeds in human respiratory cells via pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death mediated by overexpression of caspase- 1. Finally, we showed that recognition of the delivered unmodified mRNA by the innate immune system had a negative effect on mRNA translation by comparing the unmodified mRNA with innate immuneevading double modified 5 -methylcytidine (m 5 C) and pseudouridine (Ψ) mRNA. Finally, in Chapter 5, with the lessons learned in the previous two chapters in mind, we advanced the state-of-the-art modified RNA expression platform by discovering that incorporation of N 1 -methylpseudouridine (mΨ) into mRNA enables stronger and more sustained gene expression compared to pseudouridine (Ψ) -modified mRNA. The impact of this modification on the level and duration of gene expression, cellular viability, and the innate immune response was evaluated in vitro in different cell types as well as in vivo in mice. While endocytosisdependent delivery (lipofection) of unmodified mRNA caused overexpression of TLR 3 in respiratory cells, electroporation of the RNA into the same cell types resulted in a reduced innate immune response and less in vitro cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, future research is still required to address the numerous outstanding limitations of mRNA therapeutics. Possible technologies to solve these problems are discussed in Chapter 7 (Appendix A).

The second was K. P. Sinha's 1999 model[2] to use the natural electron pairing to form charge-polarized D+D- pairs in a linear defect that is attractive rather than repulsive. Ed Storms' linear array of hydrogen 'atoms' in a gap or crevice in the lattice appears to combine Schwinger's and Sinha's concepts. Portions of other models, where applicable, are mentioned. Another paper, to be presented in this conference, will provide a pictorial description of phonon activity in Sinha's linear array (and presumably Storms' also) of D or H atoms. The present paper concentrates first on a description of the many parameters and conditions necessary to solve the problem. (It will neither present nor solve the full equations.) The full Hamiltonian for the process must cover distances from the lattice spacing down to the nuclear force region. The different forces and frequencies involved in the various component interactions of the system vary greatly over this range of five orders of magnitude. The critical processes are mentioned along with their interdependencies. The importance of each model's contributions is highlighted. An appendix on mathematical modeling of the system provides more details and integration of the equations involved. This model does not address all aspects of the LENR process, but it does lead to some of the mechanisms that can explain observed data. These include: a means of overcoming the <b>nuclear</b> coulomb <b>barrier</b> by linearizing and overlapping multiple bound atomic-electron trajectories along with the hydrogen sublattice; a means of dissipating nuclear energy to the lattice gradually, but before the protons actually are bound by their mutual nuclear forces; and a means of fusing deuterons into 4 He without ever occupying the excited states that fragment into the known 'hot' fusion products of protons, neutrons, tritium, and 3 He, or energetic gamma rays.

40|$|Ran, a small GTPase, is {{required}} for the spindle formation and nuclear envelope (NE) formation. After NE breakdown (NEBD) during mitosis in metazoan cells, the Ran-GTP gradient across the NE is lost and Ran-GTP becomes concentrated around chromatin, thus affecting the stability of microtubules and promoting the assembly of spindle microtubules and segregation of chromosomes. Mitosis in which chromosomes are segregated subsequent to NEBD is called open mitosis. In contrast, many fungi undergo a process termed closed mitosis in which chromosome segregation and spindle formation occur without NEBD. Although the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe undergoes a closed mitosis, it exhibits a short period during meiosis (anaphase of the second meiosis; called anaphase II) when nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are mixed in the presence of intact NE and nuclear pore complexes (NPC). This virtual nuclear envelope breakdown (vNEBD) involves changes in the localization of RanGAP 1, an activator of Ran-GTP hydrolysis.

40|$|Molecules are {{continuously}} shuttling {{across the}} <b>nuclear</b> envelope <b>barrier</b> {{that separates the}} nucleus from the cytoplasm. Instead of being just a barrier to diffusion, the nuclear envelope is rather a complex filter that provides eukaryotes with an elaborate spatiotemporal regulation of fundamental molecular processes, such as gene expression and protein translation. Given the highly dynamic nature of nucleocytoplasmic transport, {{during the past few}} decades large efforts were devoted to the development and application of time resolved, fluorescence-based, biophysical methods to capture the details of molecular motion across the nuclear envelope. These methods are here divided into three major classes, according to the differences in the way they report on the molecular process of nucleocytoplasmic transport. In detail, the first class encompasses those methods based on the perturbation of the fluorescence signal, also known as ensemble-averaging methods, which average the behavior of many molecules (across many pores). The second class comprises those methods based on the localization of single fluorescently-labelled molecules and tracking of their position in space and time, potentially across single pores. Finally, the third class encompasses methods based on the statistical analysis of spontaneous fluorescence fluctuations out of the equilibrium or stationary state of the system. In this case, the behavior of single molecules is probed in presence of many similarly-labelled molecules, without dwelling on any of them. Here these three classes, with their respective pros and cons as well as their main applications to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling will be briefly reviewed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the cluster {{radioactivity}} of even A uranium isotopes (218236 U) with the emission of both alpha-like and non-alpha-like neon clusters (20, 22, 24, 26, 28 Ne) was studied. The decimal logarithm of half-lives (expressed in seconds) were calculated by three different approaches based on (i) the single line of Universal curve (UNIV) for alpha and cluster radioactive decay, (ii) the Universal Decay law (UDL) and (iii) by considering a fission-like {{model in which}} the interacting <b>nuclear</b> potential <b>barrier</b> was taken to be the sum of Coulomb and proximity potentials (CPPM) respectively. Based on the half-lives calculated by using the three different approaches mentioned above, significance {{of the role of}} 208 Pb nucleus (doubly magic nucleus) and nuclear shell effects in trans-lead cluster radioactivity were investigated. The calculated half-lives have also been compared with available experimental results. It was observed that cluster decay modes leading to the formation of 208 Pb daughter nucleus have the lowest half-lives. This implies that there is a shell closure at proton number (Z) = 82 and neutron number (N) = 126. Hence, it confirms the existence of nuclear shell effect and stresses the significance of role of 208 Pb daughter nucleus in the trans-lead cluster radioactivity. It can be noticed that the calculated half-lives for several cluster decay modes are well within the present experimental upper limit for measurements (T 1 / 2 < 1030 S). These results may be useful for future experiments...|$|R
40|$|We present {{calculations}} {{based on}} a realistic theoretical model of the multi-dimensional potential-energy surface of a fissioning nucleus. This surface guides the nuclear shape evolution from the ground state, over inner and outer saddle points, to the final configurations of separated fission fragments. Until recently, no calculation has properly explored a shape parameterization of sufficient dimensionality to permit the corresponding potential-energy surface to exhibit the multiple minima, valleys, saddle points and ridges that correspond to characteristic observables of the fission process. Here we calculate and analyze five-dimensional potential-energy landscapes based on grids of several million deformation points. We find that observed fission features such as different energy thresholds for symmetric and asymmetric fission and fission-fragment mass and kinetic-energy distributions are very closely related to properties of the valleys and mountain passes present in the calculated five-dimensional energy landscapes. We have also determined fission-barrier heights for 31 nuclei throughout the periodic system. KEYWORDS: <b>nuclear</b> fission, fission <b>barrier,</b> multi-mode fissio...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which herpes simplex virus (HSV) exits the nucleus remains a matter of controversy. The generally accepted route proposes that capsids exit via primary envelopment at the inner nuclear membrane and subsequent fusion of this primary particle with the outer nuclear membrane to gain capsid entry to the cytoplasm. However, recent observations indicate that HSV may induce gross morphological alterations of nuclear pores, resulting {{in the loss of}} normal pores and the appearance of dilated gaps in the nuclear membrane of up to several 100 nm. On this basis, it was proposed that a main route of capsid exit from the nucleus is directly through these altered pores. Here, we examine the biochemical composition of some of the major nuclear pore components in uninfected and HSV-infected cells. We show that total levels of major nucleoporins and their sedimentation patterns in density gradients remain largely unchanged up to 18 h after HSV infection. Some alteration in modification of one nucleoporin, Nup 358 /RanBP 2, was observed during enrichment with anti-nucleoporin antibody and probing for O glycosylation. In addition, we examine functional gating within the nucleus in live cells, using microinjection of labeled dextran beads and a recombinant virus expressing GFP-VP 16 to track the progress of infection. The <b>nuclear</b> permeability <b>barrier</b> for molecules bigger than 70 kDa remained intact throughout infection. Thus, in a functional assay in live cells, we find no evidence for gross perturbation to the gating of nuclear pores, although this might not exclude a small population of modified pores...|$|R
40|$|Barrier 16 {{formation}} {{has been}} shown to occur in the lens with age. It is important to understand the physiological changes in the lens that occur upon the formation of the barrier and their implication on the onset of cataract and presbyopia (old man’s eyes). In this study, three factors related to the formation of the barrier were investigated: diffusion rate changes in the lens nucleus, oxygen consumption and cholesterol compositional changes in the lens with age. A Franz Cell was used to measure the diffusion rate changes in the nucleus of the human lens. No significant differences in the rate of diffusion between young and old lenses could be detected with this technique. The role of protein sulphydryls as secondary oxygen consumers was also studied. It was shown that protein sulphydryls reacted readily with oxygen, suggesting that protein sulphydryls are a secondary O 2 -consumption system {{in the center of the}} lens. Mitochondria are the primary oxygen consumers in the lens. A technique for the quantification of cholesterol in lipid extracts was developed. Results obtained were comparable to published results using traditional methods. The concentration of cholesterol in the young human lens was found to be approximately 3 -fold greater than that of the bovine, ovine and porcine lenses, and ~ 5 times greater x than in the gallinaceous lens. These differences were even more pronounced when an elderly human lens was examined. The nucleus of the human lens was found to have a higher level of cholesterol content than that in the cortex and the concentration of cholesterol also exhibited a significant increase with age in both <b>nuclear</b> and <b>barrier</b> regions...|$|R
40|$|We first give an {{overview}} of the shell-correction method which was developed by V. M. Strutinsky as a practicable and efficient approximation to the general selfconsistent theory of finite fermion systems suggested by A. B. Migdal and collaborators. Then we present in more detail a semiclassical theory of shell effects, also developed by Strutinsky following original ideas of M. Gutzwiller. We emphasize, in particular, the influence of orbit bifurcations on shell structure. We first give a short overview of semiclassical trace formulae, which connect the shell oscillations of a quantum system with a sum over periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system, in what is usually called the "periodic orbit theory". We then present a case study in which the gross features of a typical double-humped <b>nuclear</b> fission <b>barrier,</b> including the effects of mass asymmetry, can be obtained in terms of the shortest periodic orbits of a cavity model with realistic deformations relevant for nuclear fission. Next we investigate shell structures in a spheroidal cavity model which is integrable and allows for far-going analytical computation. We show, in particular, how period-doubling bifurcations are closely connected to the existence of the so-called "superdeformed" energy minimum which corresponds to the fission isomer of actinide nuclei. Finally, we present a general class of radial power-law potentials which approximate well the shape of a Woods-Saxon potential in the bound region, give analytical trace formulae for it and discuss various limits (including the harmonic oscillator and the spherical box potentials).
