50|$|The {{main part}} of these groups is {{composed}} of the Southern Greek dialectological group of Arvanitika speakers, known as Arvanites. They are a population group in Greece who traditionally speak Arvanitika, a form of Tosk Albanian. They settled in Greece during the late Middle Ages and were the dominant population element of some regions {{in the south of}} Greece until the 19th century. Arvanites today self-identify as Greeks and have largely assimilated into mainstream Greek culture, they retain their dialect Arvanitika and cultural similarities with Albanians, but refuse any <b>national</b> <b>connection</b> with them and do not consider themselves an ethnic minority. Arvanitika is endangered due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities in recent decades.|$|E
50|$|Segall's initial {{paintings}} in Brazil reflect a strong <b>national</b> <b>connection</b> and passion for his newfound homeland. He portrayed the landscapes in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and portrayed the different races without tension or malintention. However, Segall remained faithful towards his Cubist nature throughout {{the majority of}} his artworks. Specifically, one of his famous artworks, entitled Banana Plantation, shows a Brazilian banana plantation, thick in density. Segall achieved balance in this painting by centering the worker's neck and head protruding {{from the bottom of the}} painting. This causes the audience to be fully focused towards the center space. This significant symmetrical balance emphasizes the human element involved in the Brazilian agricultural system. The diminished amount of slavery in Brazil during this time period, the 1920s, abolished Brazilian-Negro slaves and replaced them with an overwhelming amount of European workers coming to Brazil. This particular image portrays the engulfment of the plantations by the Europeans.|$|E
5000|$|... “As {{the medieval}} walls around Jewish life collapsed, {{the role of}} {{religion}} as the sole expression of <b>national</b> <b>connection</b> dwindled.” became “a branch of the Jewish tree but not its trunk.” This thesis, writes Goldberg, “was a significant act of historical liberation. The branch-stem concept became the groundwork for the ventures of Jewish secularism. Secularism rests on two notions: on the one hand accepting religion as an important form of expression for a certain sector of the people, and, on the other, proclaiming secularism as a branch of the same stem with equal rights and values—immersed in tradition and a natural outgrowth of the people’s past. For the first time, the concept of pluralism became acceptable within the Jewish community—not according to economic class, but according to beliefs and ideas of nationhood. Although secularism continued to rely on the lower layers of society—the workers, middle-class folks, and large parts of the modern intelligentsia—for the first time the basic idea was confirmed that every segment of the people, so long as it remains tied to the stem, has a right to shape its own national connections and its national destiny according to its perception of its history.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Diaspora {{nationalism}} (or, as Benedict Anderson terms it, [...] "long-distance nationalism") generally {{refers to}} nationalist feeling among a diaspora {{such as the}} Irish in the United States, Jews around the world after the expulsion from Jerusalem (586 BCE), the Lebanese in the Americas and Africa, or Armenians in Europe and the United States. Anderson states {{that this sort of}} nationalism acts as a [...] "phantom bedrock" [...] {{for people who want to}} experience a <b>national</b> <b>connection,</b> but who do not actually want to leave their diaspora community. The essential difference between pan-nationalism and diaspora nationalism is that members of a diaspora, by definition, are no longer resident in their national or ethnic homeland. Traditionally 'Diaspora' refers to a dispersal of a people from a (real or imagined) 'homeland' due to a cataclysmic disruption, such as war, famine, etc. New networks - new 'roots' - form along the 'routes' travelled by diasporic people, who are connected by a shared desire to return 'home'. In reality, the desire to return may be eschatological (i.e. end times orientation), or may not occur in any foreseeable future, but the longing for the lost homeland and the sense of difference from circumambient cultures in which Diasporic people live becomes an identity unto itself.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{performance}} evaluation of windowing mechanisms in world-wide web applications. Previously, such mechanisms have been studied by means of measurements only, however, given suitable tool support, we show that such evaluations can also be performed conveniently using infinite-state stochastic Petri nets. We briefly present this class of stochastic Petri nets {{as well as the}} approach for solving the underlying infinite-state Markov chain using matrix-geometric methods. We then present a model of the TCP slow-start congestion avoidance mechanism, subject to a (recently published) typical world-wide web workload. The model is parameterized using measurement data for a <b>national</b> <b>connection</b> and an overseas connection. Our study shows how the maximum congestion window size, the connection release timeout and the packet loss probability influence the expected number of bu#ered segments at the server, the connection setup rate and the connection time. Furthermore, the crucial effect of correctly modeling the bursty nature of the system workload is illustrated by investigating several arrival models...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I discuss the Nordic {{province}} of Bohuslan {{in the decade}} after it became 'Swedish' in 1658, at the stage I describe as the province's 'transitional period'. The aim {{of the study is}} to show how the traditional understanding of what happens when national borders are redrawn needs to be understood {{in the light of the}} nature of the early modern state. Records from the district court of Orust-and-Tjorn (one of five district courts in seventeenth-century Bohuslan) and petitions from the local nobility to the Swedish parliament are used in a complicated mixture of references to a variety of identities analysed here. Peter Sahlins's conclusions in his study of the French-Spanish borderland in the same period are particularly useful as a theoretical framework, especially the identity schemes that he uses to suggest that each identity originates in a counter-identity. The present study includes an attempt to use the source material to reconstruct the landscape of identities and counter-identities, and the results suggest how a collective identity was constructed in the province during the transitional period. My main conclusion is that the transition from Danish to Swedish government was one of chronology as far as the locals were concerned. Their affiliation to the Norwegian kingdom, and of course to the local community, remained unaffected by the shift of government. This conglomerate of identities could be to the locals's advantage in negotiations with the state. On the other hand, their Norwegian affiliation became problematic when the Norwegian army, the long arm of the Danish state, attacked the province; both the local communities and the representatives of the Swedish crown were directly affected. The situation exemplifies the division of a <b>national</b> <b>connection</b> - in this instance to a Norwegian identity - into an identity and a counter-identity. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the Swedish government and the local community had this particular counter-identity in common...|$|E
