5|$|In {{addition}} to those Australians who served in North Russia, {{a number of other}} Australians were involved {{on the periphery of the}} Russian Civil War, with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> of the Royal Australian Navy briefly involved in the Black Sea in late 1918, whilst a number of individual Australians serving in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission. Some Australians also served as advisers with the British Military Mission to Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia and others in South Russia supporting the White Russian General Anton Denikin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20thcentury the fishing fleet kept the harbour busy and few cargo boats used the port. It was revitalised {{as a result}} of a strike at Hull docks in 1955 when six ships were {{diverted}} and unloaded their cargoes on the fish quay. Endeavour Wharf, near the railway station, was opened in 1964 by the local council. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> using the port in 1972 was 291, increased from 64 in 1964. Timber, paper and chemicals are imported while exports include steel, furnace-bricks and doors. The port is owned and managed by Scarborough Borough Council since the Harbour Commissioners relinquished responsibility in 1905.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> before being {{assigned}} to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing Polaris in the Navy's first mission to the Arctic. This attempt was only a partial success—the Polaris crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic. That mission to rescue Adolphus Greely and {{the survivors of the}} Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado, California, in 1922. Two geographical features in Alaska—Sebree Peak and Sebree Island—are named for Admiral Sebree.|$|E

5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> from a British troop convoy {{and sending}} the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's {{intention was to}} raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, {{so that by the}} time he reached the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, it had already been captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E
5|$|Meares {{and others}} {{organized}} another expedition the following year. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> sailed to Nootka Sound, including the Argonaut under James Colnett, the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson, and the Iphigenia Nubiana and North West America. Colnett intended {{to establish a}} permanent fur-trading post at Nootka Sound. However, Spain had also decided to permanently occupy Nootka Sound and assert sovereignty on the North West Coast. The decision was mostly due to Russian activity in Alaska and Russia's threat to occupy Nootka Sound themselves. Spanish naval officer Esteban José Martínez arrived at Nootka in May 1789 and built Fort San Miguel. When the Argonaut arrived, a dispute arose between Colnett and Martínez, leading to the seizure of several British ships and the arrest of their crews. This incident led to the Nootka Crisis, an international crisis between Britain and Spain. War was averted with the first Nootka Convention of 1790.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval {{presence in the}} Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to the}} US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> allowed in the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence in the Black Sea. The ships were rotated {{from time to time in}} the Black Sea because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E

5|$|The third {{principal}} British squadron deployed {{during the}} campaign was never intended {{to take part in}} it. Admiral Duckworth had been ordered to lead the blockade of Cadiz in November 1805, following the destruction of the French and Spanish fleets at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. Finding the blockade of the survivors at Cadiz dull, Duckworth sailed south in search of Allemand's expedition, leaving just two frigates to watch the Spanish port. Allemand escaped Duckworth, but on 23 December he was informed of the depredations by Willaumez's squadron and sailed to intercept him. On 25 December he discovered Willaumez but was unable to catch him eventually abandoning the chase and retiring to St. Kitts in the West Indies to take on fresh supplies. There he was joined by several ships of the Leeward Islands squadron under Admiral Cochrane and also learned of the arrival of Leissègues at Santo Domingo. Sailing to intercept the French squadron, Duckworth successfully encountered them on 6 February 1806 and in the ensuing Battle of San Domingo, captured or destroyed all five of the ships of the line, carrying his prizes to Jamaica. Duckworth then returned to Britain, leaving Cochrane with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> to patrol the Eastern Caribbean in anticipation of the arrival of Willaumez.|$|E

25|$|The {{invasion}} of Normandy {{was the greatest}} amphibious assault yet. Over 1,000 fighting ships and some 5,000 other ships were involved.

Nonetheless, as a third of the force was concentrated on the lead ship Hércules, so the advantage was tied to its performance and luck.|$|E

25|$|Currently most Marinas on {{the lake}} don't have Automatic Identification System {{monitoring}} stations that transmit boat positions to the AIS websites for the boating community. A substantial <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> {{on the lake}} do not have AIS transponders as there currently are no mandatory requirements for AIS usage for this body of water.

25|$|Throughout its history, the harbour {{has seen}} {{numerous}} reclamation projects undertaken on both shores, {{many of which}} have caused controversy in recent years.
