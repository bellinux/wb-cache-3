40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the costs of complying with IAS and Basel II regulations on the net interest margin and operating costs of Italian banks using bank level data for the period 2001 - 2007. More specifically, the paper intends to ascertain whether: a) IAS and Basel II compliance costs have increased operating costs and have been incorporated in a larger spread; b) there is the presence of scale diseconomies related to compliance costs for Italian mutual banks. An empirical analysis demonstrates that compliance costs have indeed affected operating costs and net interest margin although mutual banks do not face a higher average cost of complying with IAS and Basel II regulation, thanks to the presence of the mutual bank network which enables them to exploit economies of scale. Moreover, empirical findings show that mergers among banks can increase the impact of regulatory costs on net interest margin. These findings remain unchanged even if they are checked for individual bank characteristics represented by labor productivity, size, credit quality, loans, <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> margin and equity. High net interest margin and operating costs tend to be associated with banks with low productivity that concentrate on traditional lending business, with high credit risk and relatively high equity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Net</b> <b>fee</b> and {{commission}} <b>income</b> {{is one of}} the {{key elements}} of a bank’s core income. In the current low-interest rate environment, this type of income is gaining importance relative to net interest income. This paper analyses the effects of bank and country specific determinants of <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> on a set of cooperative banks from European countries in the 2007 - 2014 period. In order to do that, dynamic panel data methods (system Generalized Methods of Moments) were employed. Subsequently, alternative panel data methods were run as robustness checks of the analysis. Strong positive impact of bank concentration on the share of <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> was found, which proves that cooperative banks tend to display a higher share of <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> in less competitive markets. This is probably connected with the fact that they stick with their traditional deposit-taking and loan-providing model and fees on these services are driven down by the competitors. Moreover, compared to commercial banks, cooperatives do not expand heavily into non-traditional fee bearing services under competition and their overall <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> share is therefore decreasing with the increased competitiveness of the sector...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – to {{find and}} assess {{connection}} between banking sector profitability and real economy data, using panel data, and to display analysis capabilities of dynamic panel data estimation methods. Design/methodology/approach – a panel, or longitudinal data set, consists of a sequence of observations, repeated through time {{on a set of}} statistical units. Panel data and their estimation methods are frequently used in various economic research, as it gives more information than pure cross-section or time series data. Findings – dynamic panel data estimation methods are used to study relationship between income statement items (<b>net</b> interest <b>income,</b> <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> and operating expenses) and macroeconomic variables. Model estimation shows that included macroeconomic variables are significant and there is interaction between banks profitability and real economy. Net interest income are found to be dependent on real investment and short term interest rate, <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> reacts to changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) and operating expenses are connected to real GDP and compensation per employee. Practical implications – the model is used to estimate income statement items changes after the external forecasted macroeconomic impact. The forecasts indicate that banks profitability reacts to changes in macroeconomic situation. Research type: case study...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{change of}} banking models over {{last few decades}} {{has led to an}} {{increasing}} share of <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> of banks. In this paper we deal with determinants of banking fees in the European Union with special emphasis on market concentration based on EU- 27 data from 2007 to 2012. For the estimation we use System Generalized Method of Moments, which is appropriate for dynamic panel data, allows for time invariant and lagged dependent variables and is able to deal with endogeneity. We conclude that banks facing higher competition tend to expand more aggressively into non-traditional activities and therefore they report higher <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> shares. Moreover, we found that a higher equity to assets ratio is related with higher shares of <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> since by expanding into non-traditional businesses the bank needs more capital to prevent the potential risks of the new activity. Surprisingly, a high deposits to assets ratio tends to increase the <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> share, which may be possibly attributed to relatively high switching costs and to close relationship between depositor and bank in the EU banking sector. However, macroeconomic conditions do not seem to {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> share...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} both {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of bank <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> in the European Union with a special emphasis on the Czech Republic. Since <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> represents the largest part of non-interest income earned by banks, it remains a major challenge for bank management to set and maintain an appropriate fee policy. However, solving for the optimal fee structure {{has not yet been}} accomplished either on a theoretical level, or in actual practice. In the empirical part of the paper, we analyse banking <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> in EU banking sectors based on three different indicators: the magnitude of <b>net</b> <b>fee</b> and commission <b>income</b> relative to total operating income, to total assets and to gross domestic product. Our results show that the Czech banking sector was not abnormally dependent on <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> compared to other EU countries in the period 2007 - 2012. As a result, we argue that the high profitability of Czech banks cannot be attributed to abnormal banking <b>fees</b> and commission <b>income,</b> but rather that other factors should be considered. We also concluded that the market concentration of the Czech banking sector declined since the Herfindahl index decreased in last years. The rise in competition was caused mainly by new entrants we refer to as ‘low-cost banks’ that offer a limited product portfolio and provide a large part of their services without fees and commissions. Consequently, we have determined that the business models of some low cost banks in the Czech Republic are not sustainable from a longer term perspective...|$|R

This article summarises the results of the latest survey, relating to banks’ 2009 financial year. The survey covers 18 institutions, which together account for around 90 per cent of the total assets of the Australian banking sector. For those banks participating in the survey, total domestic <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> grew by 9 per cent in 2009 to $ 12. 7 billion, with <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> from businesses growing much faster than <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> from households (Table 1 and Graph 1).

40|$|This study {{considers}} the time series relationship between bank <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> and bank <b>net</b> interest margins in Australia, applying panel vector autoregressions to a unique, hand-collected dataset. Increases in bank <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> {{are being used}} to supplement decreases in net interest margins. The increase in magnitude of <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> associated with reductions in margin income is smaller than the decrease in net interest margins, resulting in a net wealth transfer favouring users of bank services; although not all users of bank services gained and/or gained equally. The overall increase in <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> is marginally greater that the reduction in margin income. It is argued that banks have responded to falling margin revenue by increasing their range of fee-based services, especially insurance. Increases in <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> are found to pre-date declines in margin income, thus Australian banks were pro-active in the process of disintermediation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show that income-subsidization from cross-selling of <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> {{products}} is an important source of strength in business banking relationships. I show that in excess to the accumulation of soft information on the client during the course of banking relationship, the income-subsidization from <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> products is an important dimension and a source of relationship strength for the bank. I study the impact of cross-selling and relationship concentration on the loan rate using different product and <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> as well as novel deposit and payment share-of-wallet variables. I use a unique business customer dataset provided by a commercial bank operating in Finland. The sample consists of 538 client firms that have lending relationship with the bank during a one year observation period. In addition to complete credit exposure and income information, the data retrieved from the bank's internal database includes information on the <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> dimension of each client's relationship as well as bank's proprietary credit scoring. In addition, I have deposit and payment data as well as length of relationship available. Finally, I have other important client characteristics to control for the variables often employed in existing studies. Results give indication that the non-credit <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> dimension of the relationship has both statistically and economically important association with the loan price. I show that the number of non-lending product lines as well as <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> has negative impact the loan rate. In addition, the analysis of concentration using novel deposit and payment share-of-wallet variables provide further evidence that cross-selling of <b>fee</b> <b>income</b> products provides income-subsidization benefits to the bank...|$|R
