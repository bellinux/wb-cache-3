5|$|The blown-off {{outer layers}} of dying stars include heavy elements, {{which may be}} {{recycled}} during the formation of <b>new</b> <b>stars.</b> These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play {{an important part in}} shaping the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where <b>new</b> <b>stars</b> were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into the centers of galaxies, they modify the formation of spiral arms and they can affect the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of <b>new</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse <b>new</b> <b>stars</b> and planets are formed.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that <b>new</b> <b>stars</b> could appear. In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to a {{very low}} {{germination}} percentage of some sweet cherry's hybrids seeds in the breeding process, a new research using embryo rescue method was started. The goal of this work was to establish an efficient propagation protocol using the embryo culture in vitro. The sweet cherry seeds comes from eight hybrid genotypes as follows: 13. 3. M (Giant Red x Early Red), 13. 4. M (Giant Red x <b>New</b> <b>Star),</b> 13. 8. M (<b>New</b> <b>Star</b> x Kordia), 13. 9. M (<b>New</b> <b>Star</b> x Van), 13. 11. M (<b>New</b> <b>Star</b> x Burlat), 13. 12. M (<b>New</b> <b>Star</b> x Early Red), 13. 18. M (Van x <b>New</b> <b>Star),</b> 13. 19. M (Van x Early Red). The biological material was sterilised using alcohol 96 % (w/v) and Ca(OCl) 2 in different concentrations. Four culture mediums with macro and microelements were tested (based on Lee & Fossard and Murashige & Skoog) reacting differently according to the genotype. The LF medium (V 1) offers superior nutrition for biological material in terms of macro and microelements and vitamins, comparing to V 3 culture medium, constituted as MS medium. The germination period in vitro conditions indicate V 1 medium with the lowest infection rate 26. 3 %. The most vigorous plants obtained in vitro were registered on LF medium...|$|R

5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few <b>new</b> <b>stars.</b> The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E
5|$|Tycho {{and others}} had {{observed}} the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604. Since these <b>new</b> <b>stars</b> displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} <b>new</b> <b>stars</b> in {{the night}} sky (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E

5|$|Lying {{within the}} bounds of the {{constellation}} is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, {{making it one of the}} most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 <b>new</b> <b>stars</b> a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{collecting}} enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains {{the power}} to transform into a comet, and flies to {{the centre of the}} universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that his plan is to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach, but Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as <b>new</b> <b>stars.</b> Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all of the creatures he had met in the galaxies, alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.|$|E
