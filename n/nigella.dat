5|$|In 1999, she hosted her own cooking show series, <b>Nigella</b> Bites, on Channel 4, {{accompanied}} by another best-selling cookbook. <b>Nigella</b> Bites won Lawson a Guild of Food Writers Award; her 2005 ITV daytime chat show <b>Nigella</b> {{was met with}} a negative critical reaction and was cancelled after attracting low ratings. She hosted the Food Network's <b>Nigella</b> Feasts in the United States in 2006, followed by a three-part BBC Two series, Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, in the UK, {{which led to the}} commissioning of <b>Nigella</b> Express on BBC Two in 2007.

5|$|Nigel and Vanessa Lawson {{divorced}} in 1980, when <b>Nigella</b> was 20. They both remarried: her father that {{year to a}} House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008), and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death). As her father {{was at the time}} a prominent political figure, some of the things <b>Nigella</b> found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her. In the mid 1990s, he decided to lose weight for medical reasons, and subsequently wrote the best-selling The Nigel Lawson Diet Book. <b>Nigella</b> has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.|$|E

5|$|Lawson {{was next}} signed to BBC Two {{to host a}} three-part cookery show {{entitled}} <b>Nigella's</b> Christmas Kitchen, which began on 6 December 2006 and aired weekly. The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings of the week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million. The final episode {{went on to become}} the top show on BBC Two the week that it was aired. <b>Nigella's</b> Christmas Kitchen won Lawson a second World Food Media Award in 2007. Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on <b>Nigella's</b> Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.|$|R

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called <b>Nigella,</b> on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nigella</b> Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, {{television}} personality, gourmet, {{and food}} writer. She {{is the daughter}} of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998, she brought out her first cookery book, How to Eat, which sold 300,000 copies and became a best-seller. She wrote her second book in 2000, How to Be a Domestic Goddess, which won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year.|$|E

This work celebrates a bodily and personal engagement in cakes and baking and investigates what it takes to become a ‘domestic goddess’ who can create a cake that is beautiful, outrageous, gorgeous and bittersweet...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the gender}} {{issues raised by}} the representation of the woman in the kitchen on Italian food TV. In Italy, food and women have always been constructed as a whole, but today this model seems to be redundant. Controversial postfeminist readings of <b>Nigella’s</b> cooking shows and Williams’ categories of dominant, emergent and residual help investigate, in a constructivist sense, how Italian TV deals with this social change. Through qualitative, semiotic and gender analyses, the article focuses on three Italian food shows broadcast at noon. Results show that the three programmes mediate the role of the woman, drawing on the model of trattorie, traditional Italian restaurants in which the women cook and the men serve the tables. This negotiation helps balance gender relations without revolutionary outcomes. In fact, at the same time, it modernises the old model of the housewife and does not move the woman out of the kitchen...|$|R
5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or <b>nigella</b> seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E

The book outsold popular television chefs Jamie Oliver and <b>Nigella</b> Lawson when sale figures reached a total of 670,000 copies, selling 300,000 copies in just fifteen weeks. It was also selling 45,000 copies a week at one point, and had sold 250,000 copies before the peak book selling season had even begun.

5|$|Taking part in {{the third}} series of the BBC family-history {{documentary}} series, Who Do You Think You Are?, Lawson sought to uncover some of her family's ancestry. She traced her ancestors to Ashkenazi Jews who originate from eastern Europe and Germany, leaving Lawson surprised not to have Sephardi ancestry, as she had believed. She also uncovered that her maternal great-great-great grandfather, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England from Amsterdam in 1830 to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft. His daughter Hannah married Samuel Gluckstein (1821-1873), who was in business with Barnett Salmon of Salmon & Gluckstein. They had several children, including Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Salmon founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887, and Helena, who married him. One {{of the children of}} Helena and Barnett Salmon was Alfred Salmon (1868-1928), the great-grandfather of <b>Nigella</b> Lawson.|$|E

25|$|The cuisine of Odisha {{relies heavily}} on local ingredients. Flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced, unlike the spicy curries {{typically}} associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood, such as crab and shrimp, are very popular, and chicken and mutton are also consumed. Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (<b>nigella),</b> is widely used for flavouring vegetables and dals, while garam masala and turmeric are commonly used for meat-based curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer in rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets, so dessert follows most meals.|$|E
25|$|Odia cuisine {{refers to}} the cooking of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The {{flavours}} are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% {{of the population of}} Odisha is vegetarian, and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly mustard oil, but in festivals ghee is used. Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (<b>nigella)</b> is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while garam masala (curry powder) and haladi (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like Puri and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Nigella</b> Bites series, {{which was}} filmed {{in her home}} in west London, was later {{broadcast}} on American television channels E! and Style Network. Lawson said of the US release, [...] "In the UK, my viewers {{have responded to the}} fact I'm trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I'm looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US". Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States. Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from The New York Times said, [...] "Lawson's sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with <b>Nigella</b> look like a prelude to an orgy". The book of <b>Nigella</b> Bites became the second bestselling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America. The series was followed by Forever Summer with <b>Nigella</b> in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, [...] "that you cook to make you still feel as though you're on holiday".
