5000|$|The CBA {{distinguished}} {{the origin}} of a player as an array of height and playing chance limitations would be applied to imported players—the so-called yáng jiàng (洋將; literally, [...] "commanders/warriors that come through the sea") -- but not to local players (本土球員). In implementing this, however, players with [...] "Chinese consanguinity" [...] (華裔球員) -- however vague such definition was—could be regarded {{as if they were}} local upon consensus among all member clubs. Such exemptions had allowed a number of players from mainland China, Hong Kong, and the United States to play without height and number limitations. Initially, each team was allowed to register 3 non-Chinese foreign players and put up to 2 of them onto the court. No height limitations were in place in the first three seasons. Beginning from the CBA Fourth Year, however, <b>non-Chinese</b> <b>imports</b> were divided into the [...] "bigger" [...] and the [...] "smaller" [...] categories by height. Foreign players who were 201 cm (6'7") or taller were regarded as [...] "big", and only one such player would be allowed to play on the court for a team. In the meantime, no more foreign players 208 cm (6'10") or taller could be signed—although in previous seasons several seven-footers had made their appearances in the game. This was a response to some watchers' complaint that the league was dominated by foreign players, especially by those oversized imports from inside the paint. In the 1990s, native Taiwanese players who were two metres or taller were rare, and, as reflected in the statistics, local players had rarely {{turned out to be a}} leading rebounder or shot-blocker on a CBA team.|$|E
50|$|The “Registration of Overseas Supplier of Imported Scrap Materials“ is {{required}} for <b>Non-Chinese</b> companies for <b>importing</b> industrial waste and recycling parts into China. The application has to be submitted at the AQSIQ (General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China; Chinese: 中华人民共和国国家质量监督检验检疫总局). The registration is mandatory for all Non-Chinese exporters. Aim of this registration is to monitor the import of potential environmental harmful material and ensure that no material is imported into China {{that are not in}} compliance with the Chinese environment standards. If companies are not registered, parts will be detained in customs and no import process is possible. In addition to the registration of the exporting companies, the parts have to be registered with the CCIC (China Certification & Inspection Group; Chinese 中国检验认证集团), and, furthermore, these parts will be accordingly inspected.|$|R
