Based upon data from 93 hospitals and 205, 000 admissions, we used a multiple regression model to adjust the hospitals crude <b>death</b> <b>rate.</b> The adjustment process used age, origin of patient from the emergency department or nursing home, and a hospital case mix index based on DRGs (diagnostic related groups). Before adjustment, hospital <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 0. 3 to 5. 8 per 100 admissions. After adjustment, hospital death ratios ranged from 0. 36 to 1. 36 per 100 (actual <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> divided by predicted <b>death</b> <b>rate).</b> Eleven hospitals (12 per cent) were identified where the actual <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> exceeded the predicted <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> by more than two standard deviations. In nine hospitals (10 per cent), the predicted <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> exceeded the actual <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> by a similar statistical margin.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] In case centred {{epidemiological}} studies, {{traffic volume}} {{has been shown}} to be a potent risk factor for child pedestrian injuries. Nevertheless, over the past two decades child pedestrian <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> have fallen in many countries despite large increases in traffic volumes, suggesting that other factors are responsible for the long term decline in <b>death</b> <b>rates.</b> This study aimed to investigate the relationship between short term changes in traffic volume and child pedestrian <b>death</b> <b>rates.</b> DESIGN [...] The relationship between child pedestrian <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and traffic volume in the USA for the period 1970 - 88 was investigated. Trends in <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and in traffic volume were removed by the time series method of differencing. RESULTS [...] After removing the long term trends, there was a close relationship between the year to year variation in traffic volume and the year to year variation in the child pedestrian <b>death</b> <b>rate.</b> Most notably, in the two periods when traffic volume actually fell, the falls in the child pedestrian <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> were considerably larger than those seen at any other time.

DESIGN: Comparison of class {{specific}} child injury <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> for 1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983, with those for the four years 1989 - 92. SETTING: England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Children aged 0 - 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Death</b> <b>rates</b> from injury and poisoning. RESULTS: <b>Death</b> <b>rates</b> from injury and poisoning have fallen for children in all social classes. The decline for children in social classes IV and V (21 % and 2 % respectively), however, is smaller than that for children in social classes I and II (32 % and 37 %). As {{a result of the}} differential decline in injury <b>death</b> <b>rates,</b> socioeconomic mortality differentials have increased. In the four years 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 83 the injury <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> for children in social class V was 3. 5 times that of children in social class I. For the four years 1989 - 92 the injury <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> for children in social class V was 5. 0 times that of children in social class I.

40|$|Background Particulate air {{pollution}} episodes {{have been associated}} with increased daily death. However, there is little direct evidence that diminished particulate {{air pollution}} concentrations would lead to reductions in <b>death</b> <b>rates.</b> We assessed the effect of air pollution controls—ie, the ban on coal sales—on particulate air pollution and <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> in Dublin. Methods Concentrations of air pollution and directly-standardised non-trauma, respiratory, and cardiovascular <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> were compared for 72 months before and after the ban of coal sales in Dublin. The effect of the ban on age-standardised <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> was estimated with an interrupted time-series analysis, adjusting for weather, respiratory epidemics, and <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> in the rest of Ireland. Findings Average black smoke concentrations in Dublin declined by 35 · 6 g/m 3 (70 %) after the ban on coal sales. Adjusted non-trauma <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> decreased by 5 · 7 % (95 % CI 4 – 7, p< 0 · 0001), respiratory deaths by 15 · 5 % (12 – 19, p< 0 · 0001), and cardiovascular deaths by 10 · 3 % (8 – 13, p< 0 · 0001). Respiratory and cardiovascular standardised <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> fell coincident with the ban on coal sales. About 116 fewer respiratory deaths and 243 fewer cardiovascular deaths were seen per year in Dublin after the ban.
