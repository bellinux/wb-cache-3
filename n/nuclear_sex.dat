Gonadal histology and chromosome studies suggested that true hermaphroditism or mosaicism were unlikely. Xg blood grouping was informative in one patient. Accepting paternity, this suggested either that both Xs were maternal, with loss, for example, of the male determining Y chromosome, or that the paternal X chromosome did not express, probably because of a deletion, the allele for the positive Xg blood group. The patients had normal thyroid stimulating hormone reserves but subnormal responses to human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation, and may need hormonal replacement at puberty. Both had renal anomalies. We suggest that chromosome analysis is essential when cryptorchidism, hypospadias, or microgenitalia are found and that an intravenous pyelogram is desirable...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{model of}} {{evolution}} of reproductive systems, when sex {{is determined by}} both nuclear and cytoplasmic genes, is presented. Such a control of sex is known to facilitate the occurrence of female individuals in hermaphroditic populations, thus leading to gynodioecy. A two-cytotypes two-nuclear loci (two alleles at each nuclear locus) model for gynodioecy has been developed previously. Such gynodioecious systems are usually considered as stable, i. e. not leading to dioecy. In order {{to find out if}} the presence of females can select for male individuals when sex determination is nuclear-cytoplasmic, we followed the evolution of alleles responsible for female sterility. These alleles can be at the preceding loci or at a third locus. We show that male individuals can be selected. Dioecy evolves in less restrictive conditions than under <b>nuclear</b> <b>sex</b> determination. The same also holds for trioecy (coexistence of females, hermaphrodites and males). Nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphism can be maintained in these reproductive systems...|$|E
40|$|I {{investigated}} whether {{soil moisture}} affects relative fitness of females and hermaphrodites and sex ratio in a gynodioecious plant with nuclear-cytoplasmic sex inheritance. I contrast these results {{with those from}} species with strictly <b>nuclear</b> <b>sex</b> inheritance. I performed a manipulative watering experiment on seed fitness of the two sexes, and field studies measuring seed fitness and sex ratio {{as a function of}} soil moisture. In the dry site, watered hermaphrodites produced approximately twice as many seeds as unwatered hermaphrodites, with little treatment effect on female seed production. Over a natural soil moisture gradient, the ratio of female to hermaphrodite seed production was higher in dry than in wet sites. These data show that the seed fitness advantage of females is a function of soil moisture. Despite this, regression of soil moisture on the sex ratio of 23 populations was not significant. These results indicate a sex-dependent effect of soil moisture on resource allocation to seeds that does not translate into a strong effect on sex ratio. This is consistent with theory based on genomic conflict in which sex ratios are predicted to be only partly determined by fitness differences of the sexes...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Sex {{chromatin}} {{is present}} in 67 to 90 % of the ectodermal cell nuclei in the female mouse amnion. A similar body is found in 2 to 15 % of these nuclei in the male. This criterion is a reliable indicator of {{the sex of the}} foetus from the 11 th day of gestation onwards. Sex chromatin is found in many of the cell nuclei of females, but is absent from the nuclei of males. In a suitable tissue, {{the presence or absence of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>sex</b> chromatin is a reliable indicator of the genetic sex of the individual. The nuclei of mouse cells usually contain so much heterochromatin that sex chro¬ matin cannot be detected (Moore, 1966); nevertheless, sex chromatin should be present in suitable tissues, because the behaviour of the X chromosomes in the mouse is similar to that of other species. One X chromosome in each cell of the female mouse is genetically inactive (Lyon 1961), replicates its dna late in the S-phase of the cell cycle (Galton 8 c Holt, 1965), and is hetero-chromatic in the prophase stage of mitosis (Ohno 8 c Hauschka, 1960). These features are associated with the appearance of sex chromatin in other specie...|$|E

Of the two chromosomes, X and Y, more work has been done on the X chromosome because it is comparatively easier to screen large series, consequent on the discovery of sex chromatin by Barr. Screening for the Y chromosomes is rather difficult because of the tissue culture involved. Thus many works are reported on males possessing an extra X chromosome in different clinical conditions. Preponderance of such chromosomal aberration, i. e. an additional X chromosome in cases of mental retardation, compared to general population is an accepted fact today.

40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor-α (herein called ER) is a <b>nuclear</b> <b>sex</b> steroid receptor (SSR) that {{is expressed}} in approximately 75 % of breast cancers. Therapies that modulate ER action have substantially improved the survival of patients with ER-positive breast cancer, but resistance to treatment still remains a major clinical problem. Treating resistant breast cancer requires co-targeting of ER and alternate signalling pathways that contribute to resistance to improve the efficacy and benefit of currently available treatments. Emerging data have shown that other SSRs may regulate the sites at which ER binds to DNA in ways that can powerfully suppress the oncogenic activity of ER in breast cancer. This includes the progesterone receptor (PR) that was recently shown to reprogram the ER DNA binding landscape towards genes associated with a favourable outcome. Another attractive candidate is the androgen receptor (AR), which {{is expressed in}} the majority of breast cancers and inhibits growth of the normal breast and ER-positive tumours when activated by ligand. These findings have led to the initiation of breast cancer clinical trials evaluating therapies that selectively harness the ability of SSRs to ‘push’ ER towards anti-tumorigenic activity. Our review will focus on the established and emerging clinical evidence for activating PR or AR in ER-positive breast cancer to inhibit the tumour growth-promoting functions of ER.

40|$|Mammalian liver is a sex steroid-responsive tissue. The {{effects of}} these hormones presumably are {{mediated}} by hepatic estrogen receptors (ER) and androgen receptors (AR). Serum levels of sex hormones display circadian rhythms. Further, estrogens and androgens are commonly administered; administration of these agents is associated frequently with liver disease. Therefore, we investigated whether the cytosolic and <b>nuclear</b> <b>sex</b> steroid receptors also display a similar circadian rhythm, and whether variations occurred {{in the distribution of}} receptors between cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Animals were killed every 4 h from midnight till the following midnight; cytosolic and nuclear levels of both ER and AR were measured. Cytosolic ER reached a maximum level at 4 am, and a minimum at 8 pm and midnight of both days. Nuclear ER was highest at 8 am and lowest at 4 pm and 8 pm, a pattern which parallels variations in serum estradiol levels. Cytosolic AR was highest at 8 pm and lowest at midnight and 4 am. Nuclear AR was highest at 4 am and lowest at 4 pm and 8 pm. The highest level of nuclear AR does not correspond to the maximum serum testosterone level, which occurred at 4 pm. The total hepatic content of both ER and AR was not constant over the 24 -h period, but varied considerably with time of day. These studies suggest that both ER and AR show a distinct circadian rhythm in subcellular compartmentalization, and that total hepatic content of ER and AR varies significantly during a 24 -h period. © 1986...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{comparative}} analysis of passerine birds {{found that the}} frequency of extra-pair paternity was positively associated with neutral genetic diversity. It has been hypothesised that migratory species have more extra-pair paternity than resident species, so we reanalysed the same comparative data set to test whether migration distance could also explain variation in genetic diversity. In this {{comparative analysis}} of 19 local populations from 18 passerine species, spanning year-round residents to long-distant migrants, we found that migration distance {{was positively correlated with}} sequence diversity at homologous <b>nuclear</b> Z-linked (<b>sex)</b> introns, but not with autosomal intronic diversity. This pattern contrasts with that of extra-pair paternity in the previous study, where extra-pair paternity was positively associated with autosomal diversity and not Z-linked diversity. We discuss several possible explanations for the correlation between Z-linked diversity and migration distance; effects that are specific to sex-linked genetic diversity may occur if migratory behaviour implies different selective regimes in the sexes or affects population structuring. These results suggest that significant amounts of genetic diversity at sex chromosomes and autosomes are shaped by different processes, and should therefore be analysed and interpreted independently in population genetics studies.

40|$|Genetic {{mechanisms}} of sex determination are unexpectedly diverse and change rapidly during evolution. We review {{the role of}} genetic conflict as {{the driving force behind}} this diversity and turnover. Genetic conflict occurs when different components of a genetic system are subject to selection in opposite directions. Conflict may occur between genomes (including paternal-maternal and parental-zygotic conflicts) or within genomes (between cytoplasmic and <b>nuclear</b> genes or <b>sex</b> chromosomes and autosomes). The sex-determining system consists of parental sex-ratio genes, parental-effect sex determiners, and zygotic sex determiners, which are subject to different selection pressures because of differences in their modes of inheritance and expression. Genetic conflict theory is used to explain the evolution of several sex-determining mechanisms, including sex chromosome drive, cytoplasmic sex-ratio distortion, and cytoplasmic male sterility in plants. Although still limited, there is growing evidence that genetic conflict could be important in the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{described}} {{of the influence}} of the introduction of a dominant nuclear restorer gene into a cytoplasmic gynodioecious plant population. This study includes the consideration of separate effects on the relative female fertility of <b>nuclear,</b> cytoplasmic and <b>sex</b> (phenotypic) factors. Under these assumptions, the introduction of a dominant nuclear restorer gene into a cytoplasmic gynodioecious population can lead to several different situations: persistence of cytoplasmic gynodioecy, appearance of a nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy, appearance of a nuclear gynodioecy or complete restoration of male fertility. The development of stable nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy in a mathematical model is new and is possible because of the consideration of the separate relative female fertilities. The possibility of a transformation of cytoplasmic gynodioecy into a nuclear one has never been obtained before. It could constitute a route for the appearance of this latter kind of gynodioecy in plant populations. Finally, the possibilities of evolution of gynodioecy from one kind to the other, and towards dioecy, are discussed, as are some theoretical schemes that seem to correspond to observed actual situations...|$|R

Postmortem material taken from 10 subjects (five male and five female), between 20 and 39 years of age, was investigated. In addition, three age-matched subjects with abnormal levels of estrogens were studied: a castrated, estrogen-treated 50 -year-old male-to-female transsexual (T 1), a 31 -year-old man with an estrogen-producing tumor (S 2), and an ovariectomized 46 -year-old woman (S 8). A strong sex difference, with more nuclear Eralpha-ir in women, was observed rostrally in the diagonal band of Broca and caudally in the medial mamillary nucleus. Less robust sex differences were observed in other brain areas, with more intense nuclear ERalpha-ir in men, e. g., in the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic area, whereas women had more nuclear ERalpha-ir in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and ventromedial nucleus. No <b>nuclear</b> <b>sex</b> differences in ERalpha were found, e. g., in {{the central part of}} the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.

Clarifying mechanisms of sex determination in gynodioecious species can thus illuminate sexual system evolution. Genetic determination of gynodioecy, however, can be complex and is not fully characterized in any wild species. We used targeted sequence capture to genetically map a novel nuclear contributor to male sterility in a self-pollinated hermaphrodite of Fragaria vesca subsp. bracteata from the southern portion of its range. To understand its interaction with another identified locus and possibly additional loci, we performed crosses within and between two populations separated by 2000 km, phenotyped the progeny and sequenced candidate markers at both sex-determining loci. The newly mapped locus contains a high density of pentatricopeptide repeat genes, a class commonly involved in restoration of fertility caused by cytoplasmic male sterility.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the role of progesterone during Taenia crassiceps cysticercosis, and the immunological mecha-nisms involved in its effects, by relating progesterone treatment to whole parasite counts, to host humoral and cellular immune response, to {{the presence or absence of}} <b>nuclear</b> receptors to <b>sex</b> steroids in splenocytes, and to serum sex steroid levels in infected mice of both genders. Progesterone treatment increased parasite loads two-fold in females and three-fold in males compared with control mice. The expression of the Th 2 cytokine profile (IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10) was markedly increased in infected mice of both genders, while progesterone treatment returned this expression to basal levels. However, the Th 1 cytokine profile (IFN-c and TNF-a) was not affected by infection, whilst progest-erone treatment increased the expression of both cytokines two-fold compared to uninfected, infected and placebo-treated mice. Testosterone serum levels decreased in infected male mice by 95 %, and treatment with progesterone did not affect them. In females, no change in testoster-one levels was observed. Progesterone levels increased three-fold only in progesterone-treated infected mice of both sexes, while estradiol levels in female and male progesterone-treated infected mice increased two-fold compared to infected control mice.

40|$|Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is a {{dioecious}} vine whose staminate and pistillate flowers nonetheless develop non-functional reproductive {{structures of}} the opposite sex. Ubiquitin is a small, highly conserved protein found in all eucaryotes: a covalent ATP-dependent attachment of ubiquitin marks proteins for degradation. In the present paper, we used immunoblotting to investigate the presence of free ubiquitin and ubiquitin conjugates during pollen development in male (androfertile) and in female (androsterile) genotypes of kiwifruit. In the male, several high molecular mass protein conjugates were present throughout development. On the contrary, such a pattern characterized only early stages of pollen from the female genotype, where conjugates progressively disappeared, until they were detectable only in trace amounts at anthesis. The highest content of conjugates in the male genotype was observed when microspores were approaching the first mitosis, Free ubiquitin increased continuously during development of the male microgametophyte so that mature pollen contained considerable amounts of the ubiquitin monomer {{at the time of}} its release from the anther, By contrast, only low levels were detectable in the degenerating microspores in the pistillate flowers. In vitro experiments using labeled ubiquitin indicated that early-uninucleate microspores of the female genotype had a much higher conjugation rate Ban those of the male genotype at the same stage. However, after feeding alpha-lactalbumin as exogenous substrate, the rate of ubiquitin conjugation strongly increased and was quite similar in both <b>sexes.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> features of pollen development in both genotypes are also described. The nucleus progressively degenerated in the microspores of the pistillate flowers starting from the early-uninucleate stage, in parallel with the progressive decrease in ubiquitin content and activity, At anthesis, the microspores in the pistillate flowers either had no nucleus or showed only traces of chromatin, Thus, the ubiquitin system seems to play an important role in protein turnover occurring during the normal developmental pathway of the kiwifruit microgametophyte, while it was mainly involved in regressive events related to microspore degeneration in the female genotype...|$|R

CD 8 + TILs are a crucial component of cell-mediated immunity. The significance of CD 8 + TILs has not been reported respectively in organ- and non-organ-confined urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder. We explored the prognostic value of CD 8 + TILs in the two groups. The presence of CD 8 + TILs was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of whole tissue sections from 75 organ and 51 non-organ-confined disease patients with long-term follow-up, and its correlation with clinicopathological features and overall survival (OS) was determined. The CD 8 + TIL immunohistochemical staining score was 0 (< 1 %), 1 (≥ 1 %), 2 (≥ 5 %), or 3 (≥ 10 %) based on the percentage of positively stained cells out of total cells. A patient was considered CD 8 negative if the score was 0. There were no associations between CD 8 + TILs and age, <b>sex,</b> <b>nuclear</b> grade, and adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in organ- and non-organ-confined disease. The presence of CD 8 + TILs was seen more frequently in pTa- 1 than pT 2 stage (p =  0. 033) in organ-confined disease. No associations between CD 8 + TILs and pT stage, pN stage were found in non-organ-confined disease. CD 8 + TILs were associated with better OS (log-rank test, P =  0. 036) in non-organ-confined disease, but with poorer OS (log-rank test, P =  0. 040) in organ-confined disease by the Kaplan–Meier method. In multivariate analysis, CD 8 + TILs were an independent favorable prognostic factor in non-organ-confined disease, but were an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in organ-confined disease.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} factors which account {{for the fact that}} women are both more opposed and uncertain than men concerning the further development of nuclear energy. To that end, data from four national opinion surveys covering the period 1975 - 1979 are employed. Log-linear techniques are used in the analyses. Two plausible explanations for women's greater aversion to nuclear power are presented. The marginality explanation attributes the differential support of men and women for nuclear power to the differential positions which they occupy in the economic, political, and technical spheres within society. Because men hold more central positions in these areas, it is postulated that they will perceive a greater need for additional energy and continued economic growth, believe that the advantages of nuclear power toward these goals are greater, and be more confident in applications of nuclear technology. The fact that men express more favorable attitudes toward nuclear power is thus to be explained by these factors. The safety explanation attributes the sex difference to a greater concern on the part of women about the safety of using nuclear fission to generate electricity. The general thrust of this argument is that women's greater concern for safety revolves around their reproductive and nurturant roles, and the protection of future generations. Uncertainty is viewed as a special problem. An explanation for women's greater uncertainty, which attributes the difference to a sex-typed expectation concerning the formulation and expression of opinions on complex technical issues, is presented. Since children are socialized to view science and technology as primarily male fields, it is argued that the expectation to appear informed and provide opinions on technical topics like nuclear energy is less strong for women. The pattern of sex differences observed across a large number of survey items supports this view. With regard to the competing explanations for the sex difference in opposition to nuclear energy, the analyses support the safety rather than the marginality argment. Women are found to believe that nuclear power plants are less safe than men do, and to rate the problems of nuclear power as more serious. Controlling for these factors accounts for the sex difference in support for nuclear power, both in general and in respondents' local communities. Contrary to the implications of the marginality argument, women view our energy problems as more serious than men do, and there are virtually no sex differences with regard to the ratings given to various economic and other advantages of nuclear power. In line with the predictions of that argument, men are somewhat more likely to opt for producing energy over protecting the environment, and also more confident that the technical capability to rely more heavily on nuclear power currently exists. However, controlling for these factors fails to account for the sex difference. Additional topics addressed include the role of key opinion leadership groups in shaping the public opinion process concerning <b>nuclear</b> energy, and <b>sex</b> differences in reaction to the Three Mile Island accident. Women express greater confidence than men in environmentalists and Ralph Nader's organization, but no sex differences are found in confidence in scientists or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hypothetical pro or con statements from each of these groups effect striking changes in the distribution of opinions of nuclear power. The magnitude of these changes in support vs. opposition is the same for both sexes. However, attaching the "expert opinion" results in a convergence of male and female uncertainty. Finally, the comparison of pre and post-TMI attitudes indicates a perception that the accident was more serious, and a greater increase in opposition to nuclear power among women...|$|R
