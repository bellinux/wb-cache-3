40|$|A lot {{has been}} written about Nobel and Nobel Prize winners. In {{literature}} it is common to describe patterns or trends in <b>Nobel’s</b> <b>peace</b> prize rewards. One aim with my study is to examine if the same is possible to distinguish in how the authors of textbooks have written about <b>Nobel’s</b> <b>peace</b> prize. The study show that is not a complete pattern to be seen in the school textbooks I have read. What has created a difficulty in my study of school textbook is that the information /facts about peace prize winners have been fragmentary or insufficient. There is only one textbook from the 1940 ´s, that has a chapter, which is called peace prize winners. This chapter has disappeared in the examined textbooks from the 1950 ´s up to today’s textbooks. The study shows however that from the 1980 ´s up to today’s it has become more common to mention peace prize in the school textbook...|$|R

In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony Speech for the Nobelists Jane Addams and Nicholas Murray Butler, but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the <b>Nobel</b> <b>Peace</b> Prize to Carl von Ossietzky. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942.
