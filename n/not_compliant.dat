25|$|While the P55C is {{compatible}} with the common Socket 7 motherboard configuration, the voltage requirements for powering the chip differ from the standard Socket 7 specifications. Most motherboards manufactured for Socket 7 prior to the establishment of the P55C standard are <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with the dual intensity required for proper operation of this chip. Intel temporarily manufactured an upgrade kit called the OverDrive that was designed to correct this lack of planning on the motherboard makers' part.|$|E

25|$|A second Special Bulletin was {{published}} by the AAIB on 21 December 2015. It revealed that the aircraft was <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with its Permit to Fly insofar as the ejection seat cartridges installed in the aircraft had passed their expiry date. The maintenance organisation had ordered new cartridges in January 2014, but the new cartridges did not arrive until June 2015, {{a year and a}} half after ordering them, and two months before the accident. The maintainer of the aircraft stated it was acting under the privileges of its maintenance approvals. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was reported to be of the view that the maintainer did not have such privilege.|$|E
25|$|The up {{and down}} {{fluctuation}} of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the heartbeat. Pulse pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were <b>not</b> <b>compliant.</b> The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|E
25|$|The fifth (and final) {{full course}} yellow {{was shown to}} allow marshals to remove the debris from Jani's car. All of the cars elected to make pit stops during the full course yellow period. Bernhard took over Webber's driving duties in the No. 1 Porsche and {{remained}} the leader at the restart six minutes later. The No. 2 Porsche was shown a black and orange flag, requiring it to make a pit stop for repairs to its left-rear corner, and reemerged in fourth position. Second-placed LMP2 driver Bruno Senna went into gravel and grass but rejoined without any significant damage. Bernhard maintained his lead throughout {{the remainder of the}} event and took the first victory of the season for the No. 1 Porsche, and its first since the 2015 6 Hours of Shanghai. The No. 8 Audi finished in second, ahead of the team's No. 7 car in third. The No. 36 Signatech Alpine car of Menzes, Lapierre, and Richelmi secured the victory in the LMP2 category, and their third consecutive victory of the year, 16 seconds ahead of second-placed No. 43 RGR Sport car, AF Corse's No. 51 Ferrari in the LMGTE Pro class clinched its first victory of the season, the first of Calado's career and the 13th for Bruni, followed in second place by teammates, Bird and Rigon, who was 47 seconds adrift at the finish. Upon taking the lead from KCMG and holding it for the last 48 laps, Lamy, Lauda and Dalla Lana clinched Aston Martin's second victory in the LMGTE Am category, ahead of Perrodo, Collard and Agias in the No. 83 AF Corse car. KCMG's No. 78 Porsche initially finished second but was disqualified when it was discovered that the car's minimum ride height was <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with the regulations.|$|E

500|$|On the podium, Nico Rosberg was booed by {{the home}} crowd, {{mirroring}} a similar incident towards Hamilton at the previous race in Austria. Hamilton later {{told the press}} that he encouraged his fans not to act {{in such a way}} towards his teammate, saying: [...] "I honestly think us as Brits, the British fans, I think we're better than that." [...] During the interviews at the podium ceremony, conducted by former Formula One driver Mark Webber, Hamilton had expressed his delight at the fact that the weather had made the race more difficult. Rosberg spoke of [...] "an exciting race" [...] against Verstappen and highlighted his [...] "very critical problem" [...] with his gearbox, but stressed that he felt confident that the instructions he received from his team to fix it were within the rules. However, the stewards – led by former driver Nigel Mansell – did not share his view and applied a ten-second time penalty for what they felt were instructions <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with the sporting regulations, demoting Rosberg to third place. The rules on instructions from the team to the driver had been tightened before the first race of the season, specifying that [...] "the driver shall drive the car alone and unaided".|$|E
500|$|The British {{government}} submitted {{that the}} killings were [...] "absolutely necessary", within {{the meaning of}} Article 2, paragraph 2, to protect the people of Gibraltar from unlawful violence, because the soldiers who carried out the shootings genuinely believed that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were capable of detonating a car bomb, and of doing so by remote control. The families contested the government's claim, alleging that the government had conspired to kill the three; that the planning and control of the operation was flawed; that the inquest was not adequately equipped to investigate the killings; and that the applicable laws of Gibraltar were <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with Article 2 of the ECHR. The court found that the soldiers' [...] "reflex action" [...] in resorting to lethal force was excessive, but that the soldiers' actions did not—in their own right—give rise to a violation of Article 2. The court held that the soldiers' use of force based on an honestly held belief (that the suspects were armed or in possession of a remote detonator) could be justified, even if that belief was later found to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would, in the court's opinion, place too great a burden on law-enforcement personnel. It also dismissed all other allegations, except that regarding the planning and control of the operation. In that respect, the court found that the authorities' failure to arrest the suspects as they crossed the border or earlier, combined with the information that was passed to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. Thus, the court decided there had been a violation of Article 2 in the control of the operation.|$|E

Chomsky believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of [...] "open societies" [...] that are economically and politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper. He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with U.S. interests and ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power. When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.|$|E

Pandapatan's defenses were unexpectedly strong, leading to 18 American casualties during the fighting. On the second day, the Americans used ladders and moat-bridging tools to break through the Moro fortifications, and a general slaughter of the Moro defenders followed.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time as Darányi, Czechoslovak foreign {{minister}} František Chvalkovský also visited Germany to negotiate with Nazi representatives. Adolf Hitler blamed Czechoslovakia for the failure of negotiations with Hungary and requested their restoration. He gave Chvalkovský a map with the Ribbentrop line and promised to guarantee new borders based on this proposal. Back in Prague, Chvalkovský recommended accepting the Ribbentrop line. However, the Slovak autonomous government was against such a solution and hoped that {{it would be possible to}} achieve further corrections. On October 19, Tiso and Ďurčanský met with Ribbentrop in Munich and managed to persuade him to assign Košice to Czechoslovakia and to accept the prior proposal that there should remain balanced minorities both in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Czechoslovak experts prepared material that argued that the Hungarian statistics were unreliable and that Hungarian demands were <b>not</b> <b>compliant</b> with the ethnic principle but were driven by foreign policy and strategic factors. [...] They argued that the Hungarian claim for Košice was not motivated by ethnic or historical reasons, but was focused on elimination of the largest communication, economic and cultural center it the east and on the interruption of the railway to Carpatian Ruthenia and allied Romania, therefore totally isolating the eastern part of the republic which could be later annexed by Hungary. Both Tiso and Ďurčanský believed that they persuaded Hitler. Tiso sent letter to Prague to notify about positive results.|$|E
