500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E
500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> it, but I really wish we hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E

500|$|Savile Row's {{reputation}} {{is built on}} bespoke tailoring, where each suit is made to individually fit. The term [...] "bespoke", which has an etymology developing from [...] "to exclaim" [...] through [...] "discussed in advance" [...] and is generally understood to mean [...] "made to order", became associated with fine tailoring, with tailors claiming that the term has been in common use for tailoring since the 17th century. Savile Row tailors argue that [...] "bespoke", in relation to tailoring, is understood to mean a suit cut and made by hand; however, after a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2008, the term may now also be applied to machine sewed garments, provided they are made-to-measure. Suits, at Kilgour & French, cost at least £5000. The Creative Director Carlo Brandelli makes <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> the cost. Brandelli insists: [...] "That the street’s tailors have been underselling themselves for generations, certainly compared to the couture houses of Paris." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} was online for only an hour, but {{long enough to}} be viewed by some readers. Soon after, the Houston Review, a conservative newspaper published by students at the University of Houston, printed the memo's full text and an accompanying commentary that criticized the paper. The Chronicle's response was initially muted. Its first official response appeared in the [...] "corrections" [...] section later the same week stating: [...] "An internal Houston Chronicle {{document was}} mistakenly posted to the editorial/opinion area of the Web site early Thursday morning. We apologize for any confusion it may have caused." [...] Chronicle editor Jeff Cohen, who gave a statement in defense of the memorandum: [...] "I make <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> having a thorough discussion of the issue.

2500|$|He has a self-appointed moniker, [...] "Iceman", {{with several}} layers of meaning; apart from its {{association}} with famously-cold Finland, he is widely considered to have a cool temperament under pressure and also an 'icy' persona with most other drivers, team members and the media. He appears {{to be aware of}} the perception, making <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> it stating that he is [...] "not here to try to please people. I'm here to do my best" [...] and, in a post-race interview after winning the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, [...] "Last time you guys was [...] giving me shit because I didn't really smile enough [...] ". Apart from his on-track driving, off-track instances demonstrating this calm demeanour include being asleep 30 minutes before his first Formula One race and eating an ice cream during the temporarily-suspended 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix.|$|E
2500|$|Autumn Reeser portrays Taylor Townsend (season 4, {{recurring}} season 3), {{introduced in}} Season 3 as a neurotic perfectionist student. Her character's initial personality {{was referred to}} by many critics as similar to the character Tracy Flick from the film Election. Taylor begins the series as a recurring villain before eventually becoming the second female lead in the fourth season. Autumn Reeser's performance was critically acclaimed. She reflected back on the character during a 2010 interview, saying [...] "I feel like there's {{a lot of girls}} out there who could really relate to her, who hadn't seen themselves on TV in that way. I loved that about her. I loved that she made <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> who she was even though she wasn't what all the magazines said was OK. She was like, [...] "I'm still valid.

2500|$|A plot {{point in}} Children of Earth {{triggered}} protests from {{fans of the}} show, among them the [...] "Save Ianto Jones" [...] campaign, which collected more than £10,000 for the British Children in Need annual charity event. Other fans resorted to abuse and threats, causing writer James Moran to fire off an angry missive in a blog post. Showrunner Russell T Davies made <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> the decision to kill off the character, saying, [...] "I'm just delighted that the fans are so wrapped in the character to have that reaction." [...] The plot point attracted more controversy from some commentators, additionally, because it depicted {{the death of a}} main character involved in a same-sex relationship. This led several writers to analyse the death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of victimhood.|$|E

2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E

Boyne and Lottie carried on a sort of muted scrap, unrebuked by their mother, who seemed too much distracted in some tacit trouble to mind them. From time to time Breckon found her eyes dwelling upon him wonderingly, entreatingly; she dropped them, if she caught his, and colored.|$|E

60|$|Florence's {{sister was}} the elder of the two, a stout {{woman with a}} strong face and quiet eyes. It was a simple fare and service they gave to their guest; but they made <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> that. Indeed, Madeline felt their {{simplicity}} to be restful. She was sated with respect, sick of admiration, tired of adulation; and {{it was good to}} see that these Western women treated her as very likely they would have treated any other visitor. They were sweet, kind; and what Madeline had at first thought was a lack of expression or vitality she soon discovered to be the natural reserve of women who did not live superficial lives. Florence was breezy and frank, her sister quaint and not given much to speech. Madeline thought she would like to have these women near her if she were ill or in trouble. And she reproached herself for a fastidiousness, a hypercritical sense of refinement that could not help distinguishing what these women lacked.|$|E
6000|$|I {{discovered}} that she was uneasy in her mind, because the train of events that she had just described to me had prevented her from receiving those supplementary messages which Miss Halcombe had intrusted to the Countess to deliver. She was afraid the messages might have been of great importance to her mistress's interests. Her dread of Sir Percival had deterred her from going to Blackwater Park late at night to inquire about them, and Miss Halcombe's own directions to her, on no account to miss the train in the morning, had prevented her from waiting at the inn the next day. She was most anxious that the misfortune of her fainting-fit should not lead to the second misfortune of making her mistress think her neglectful, and she would humbly beg to ask me whether I would advise her to write her explanations and excuses to Miss Halcombe, requesting to receive the messages by letter, {{if it was not}} too late. I make <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> <b>for</b> this extremely prosy paragraph. I have been ordered to write it.
