25|$|When {{used with}} a load that has a torque curve that {{increases}} with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor {{is equal to the}} load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal.

2500|$|The burn {{temperature}} in modern stoves can increase {{to the point}} where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4grams per hour. This is roughly 90% less smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a <b>net</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace.

2500|$|Development of {{the power}} cycle - Developing a large helium or {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide turbine is needed for highest efficiency. These gas cycles offer numerous potential advantages for use with molten salt-fueled or molten salt-cooled reactors. These closed gas cycles face design challenges and engineering upscaling work for a commercial turbine-generator set. A standard supercritical steam turbine could be used at a small penalty in efficiency (the <b>net</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the MSBR {{was designed to be}} approximately 44%, using an old 1970s steam turbine). A molten salt to steam generator would still have to be developed. Currently, molten nitrate salt steam generators are used in concentrated solar thermal power plants such as Andasol in Spain.

2500|$|In {{electric}} power generation a combined cycle is an assembly of heat engines that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into mechanical energy, which in turn usually drives electrical generators. The principle is that after completing its cycle (in the first engine), {{the temperature of the}} working fluid engine is still high enough that a second subsequent heat engine may extract energy from the waste heat that the first engine produced. [...] By combining these multiple streams of work upon a single mechanical shaft turning an electric generator, the overall <b>net</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the system may be increased by 50–60%. [...] That is, from an overall efficiency of say 34% (in a single cycle) to possibly an overall efficiency of 51% (in a mechanical combination of two cycles) in net Carnot thermodynamic efficiency. [...] This can be done because heat engines are only able to use a portion of the energy their fuel generates (usually less than 50%). [...] In an ordinary (non combined cycle) heat engine the remaining heat (e.g., hot exhaust fumes) from combustion is generally wasted.|$|E

40|$|Thermochemical {{gasification}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising technologies for converting biomass into power, fuels and chemicals. The objectives of this study were to maximize the <b>net</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> for biomass gasification, and to estimate the cost of producing industrial gas and combined heat and power (CHP) at a feedrate of 2000 kg/h. Aspen Plusbased model for gasification was combined with a CHP generation model, and optimized using corn stover and dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) as the biomass feedstocks. The cold gas efficiencies for gas production were 57 % and 52 %, respectively, for corn stover and DDGS. The selling price of gas was estimated to be $ 11. 49 and $ 13. 08 /GJ, respectively, for corn stover and DDGS. For CHP generation, the electrical and <b>net</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were as high as 37 % and 88 %, respectively, for corn stover and 34 % and 78 %, respectively, for DDGS.

40|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} method using {{genetic algorithm}} is employed {{in order to}} optimize design and operating parameters of a high temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell based {{combined heat and power}} system. <b>Net</b> electrical <b>efficiency</b> of the plant, indicating the system's performance (to be maximized) and the total capital cost (to be minimized) are considered as optimization objectives. Current density (indicating the stack size), steam to carbon ratio, burner outlet temperature and auxiliary to process fuel ratio have been chosen as design parameters. Two different multi-objective optimization approaches have been utilized: steady state (without degradation) and long-term optimization while considering the degradation in fuel cell stack and the fuel processor. The results of the optimization procedures are Pareto frontiers which are a set of optimal points each of which is a trade-off between the considered objective functions. The performance indexes and operating conditions of three points with the maximum cumulative <b>net</b> electrical <b>efficiency,</b> minimum capital cost, and the same fuel cell area as that of the initial design are compared. It can be observed that while attempting to maximize the electrical <b>efficiency,</b> the cumulative <b>net</b> electrical <b>efficiency</b> of 29. 96 % can be achieved although it results in a total capital cost of 115711 €. On the other hand, the capital cost can be reduced down to 39, 929 € which significantly diminishes cumulative <b>net</b> electrical <b>efficiency.</b> Finally, by locating the point on the Pareto frontier in which the fuel cell area is {{the same as that of}} the initial design, a cumulative <b>net</b> electrical <b>efficiency</b> of 27. 07 % was achieved which is 1 % higher than the value obtained using the operating conditions of the initial design...|$|R

50|$|A second {{important}} consideration is the energy costs of producing energy. Bio-fuels, electricity and hydrogen, for instance, have significant energy inputs in their production.

40|$|Novating {{a single}} asset class {{to a central}} {{counterparty}} (CCP) in an over-the-counter derivatives trading network impacts both the mean and variance of total net exposures between counterparties. When {{a small number of}} dealers trade in a relatively large number of asset classes, central clearing increases the mean and variance of net exposures, which may lead to increased counterparty risk and higher margin needs. There are intermediate cases where there is a tradeoff: The introduction of a CCP leads to an increase in expected net exposures but this increase is accompanied by a reduction in variance. We extend the work of Duffie and Zhu (2011) by considering general classes of network structures and focus on scale-free and core-periphery structures, which {{have been shown to be}} accurate models of real-world financial networks. We find that a CCP is unlikely to be beneficial when the link structure of the network relies on just a few key nodes. In particular, in large scale-free networks a CCP will always worsen expected <b>netting</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In such cases, CCPs can improve <b>netting</b> <b>efficiency</b> only if agents have some degree of risk aversion that allows them to trade off the reduced variance against the higher expected netted exposures. This may explain why, in the absence of regulation, traders in a derivatives network may not develop a CCP themselves...|$|R
50|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is envisaged to be {{the main}} {{transition}} technology to comply with the CO2 reduction targets set by the European Commission. However, CCS has the drawback that the electrical efficiency of the coal-fired power plant will drop significantly. The efficiency loss caused by CCS in coal-fired power plants will range from 4 to 12% points, depending on the CCS technology chosen.To overcome this drawback, one has to increase the plant efficiency or the share of biomass co-firing.

Live steam temperatures well in excess of 700°C are necessary to compensate the efficiency loss caused by CCS and to achieve a <b>net</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 45%.NextGenPower aims to develop and demonstrate coatings and materials that can be applied in ultra-supercritical (in excess of 700˚C) conditions.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, {{the current}} design of the {{electrical}} generating system {{may result in a}} surplus of electricity from base load power stations during off-peak periods, and storage heaters may then be able to make use of this surplus to increase the <b>net</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the system as a whole.

Other technologies may incorporate demand response electronics to sense when there is a change in supply and demand. Thereby, they ensure that these loads only use off-peak electricity. Further advances in supply technology could provide for a more bespoke 'supply and demand' tariff system to make smart grid sensing technologies like dynamic demand a more viable financial prospect.|$|E
