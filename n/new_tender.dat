5|$|Around {{the same}} time that the No. 3 {{locomotive}} was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale in New Jersey, and after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad in New Jersey, and that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a <b>new</b> <b>tender</b> built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel fuel. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E

More recently routes have been operated from Godstone and in December 2005 a new depot was constructed in Croydon to cope with <b>new</b> <b>tender</b> awards.

25|$|Even {{before the}} 109 had entered {{squadron}} service, in autumn 1937 the RLM {{sent out a}} <b>new</b> <b>tender</b> asking various designers for a new fighter to fight alongside the Bf 109, as Walter Günther had done with his firm's follow-on to the unsuccessful He 112. Although the Bf 109 was an extremely competitive fighter, the Ministry was worried that future foreign designs might outclass it, and wanted to have new aircraft under development to meet these possible challenges. Kurt Tank responded {{with a number of}} designs, most based around a liquid-cooled inline engine.|$|E

The airport {{was taken over}} by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. Routes to Narvik Airport, Framnes have been subject to public service obligation since 1 April 1997, with the first contract being won by Widerøe. In the third tender, which became operational on 1 April 2003, Kato Air won the bid to operate the route from Narvik to Bodø. In March 2004 they resigned the contract from 8 March 2005. The ministry subsequently issued a <b>new</b> <b>tender,</b> but no airlines bid. The ministry was forced to renegotiate the contract with Kato Air, which resulted in the subsidy for the last thirteen months increasing from NOK8 to 18.2million. The result of Kato Air taking over the route in 2003 was that the patronage had been halved. Widerøe recaptured the Narvik contract from 1 April 2006.|$|E

500|$|Although {{a tunnel}} {{connecting}} the Port of Miami to Watson Island was first {{proposed in the}} 1980s, when the House rejected President Ronald Reagan's attempt to veto the bill to conduct a premilinary study and called it a [...] "pork-barrel" [...] project, when the port was only connected to the mainland by a two-lane drawbridge (the current six lane elevated bridge {{was built in the}} early 1990s), it was not until 2006 that the tender for the tunnel project was ready to be launched and December 2007 that the project was approved by City Commission. However, the economic crisis resulted in a cancellation of the project in December 2008 by one of the sponsors, Babcock & Brown, and the State of Florida. Despite this, in April 2009, following intense lobbying by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez, to avoid a <b>new</b> <b>tender</b> that would delay even further the start of construction, the project was reinstated. Port director Bill Johnson has also {{played a key role in}} supporting the Port of Miami infrastructure projects, as well as developing a free-trade pact with Colombia.

To better equip them for mainline working, an order for twelve <b>new</b> Type XM2 <b>tenders</b> for these engines was placed with Robert Stephenson and Company. Since their original smaller Type XC tenders were already numbered for their respective engines, these <b>new</b> <b>tenders,</b> with Robert Stephenson works numbers D1540/1 to D1540/12, were numbered in the non-revenue earning range from N1 to N12.|$|R

As built, the loco and tender were fitted with air brakes which were replaced at the RH with vacuum brakes for the loco driving wheels only; the original tender was not altered. The <b>new</b> <b>tender,</b> fitted with vacuum brakes, was tested at New Romney on 27 September 2008.

2500|$|A {{sure sign}} of the {{presence}} of mopane worms is defoliation of mopane woodland - sometimes around ninety per cent of leaves. Fenced-in browsing animals may rely on the mopane, and on other trees favoured by the caterpillars, as an important part of their diet. Some farmers therefore view the mopane worm as competition for their livestock, and attempt to eradicate the [...] "pest" [...] with insecticides and the like. However, the caterpillar season is short, and the trees sprout the <b>new,</b> <b>tender</b> foliage which browsers prefer, so this problem can be managed in other ways, for example, by working to mutual benefit with the local caterpillar harvesters who will control the worms by harvesting them.|$|E
2500|$|The slow {{construction}} rate of [...] {{of track}} in 23 months, led to strained {{relations between the}} railway company and the contractors.

In October 1861, Cape Town Railway and Dock dismissed the contractors and took over all construction work, as well as the Pickering locomotive. The engine was therefore given the number 9, in spite of having been the first locomotive in South Africa.|$|E

His little son should go with him; he would work hard; he would pay back the money he had embezzled, as much of it as he could, if it took the rest of his life to do so.

It was spacious and lofty, and the central arched or domed portion of the roof, which was of a light turquoise blue, rested on graceful columns of polished crystal. The doors were of amber-colored glass set in agate frames; but the windows, eight in number, formed the principal attraction. On the glass, hill and mountain scenery was depicted, the summits in some of them appearing beyond wide, barren plains, whitened with the noonday splendor and heat of midsummer, untempered by a cloud, the soaring peaks showing a pearly luster which seemed to remove them to an infinite distance. To look out, as it were, from the imitation shade of such an arbor, or pavilion, over those far-off, sun-lit expanses where the light appeared to dance and quiver as one gazed, was a never-failing delight.
