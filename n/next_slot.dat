50|$|In a {{backplane}} design {{such as the}} Amiga 2000, {{connecting the}} /CFGOUT of one slot directly to the /CFGIN of the next would create the problem that an unoccupied slot would break the configuration chain.

However, the results presented in Figure 6 have demonstrated that allowing for the reservation of chunks until the transmit buffer is emptied deteriorates the system performance once the system is overloaded. To address this shortcoming, a fair chunk reservation mechanism was proposed in Section 3.4, whose performance is analysed in the next section.|$|E

In this way, even if the jammer successfully estimates slot sizes, it has to transmit pulse attacks at an interval of the average slot duration to corrupt communication between nodes. This makes it especially inefficient for the jammer operating on networks with low-channel utilization, which is the common case in sensor networks. In this case, the jammer must expend several times more energy in jamming pulses to corrupt a single legitimate transmission.|$|E

Then, the MR predicts the uplink CSI of the next time slot at the second stage. During the analysis, it is assumed that the channel remains constant in one time slot, the duration of which is usually much smaller than the channel coherence time, even in high mobility systems.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a one-server queueing model with retrials in discrete-time. The number of primary jobs arriving {{in a time}} slot follows a general probability distribution and the different numbers of primary arrivals in consecutive time slots are mutually independent. Each job requires from the server a generally distributed number of slots for its service, and the service times of the different jobs are independent. Jobs arriving in a slot can start their service only {{at the beginning of}} the <b>next</b> <b>slot.</b> When upon arrival jobs find the server busy all incoming jobs are sent into orbit. When upon arrival in a slot jobs find the server idle, then one of the incoming jobs (randomly chosen) in that slot starts its service {{at the beginning of the}} <b>next</b> <b>slot,</b> whereas the other incoming jobs in that slot, if any, are sent into orbit. During each slot jobs in the orbit try to re-enter the system individually, independent of each other, with a given retrial probability. The ergodicity condition and the generating function of the joint equilibrium distribution of the number of jobs in orbit and the residual service time of the job in service are calculated. From the generating function several performance measures are deduced, like the average orbit size. Also the busy period and the number of jobs served during a busy period are discussed. To conclude, extensive numerical results are presented. ...|$|E
