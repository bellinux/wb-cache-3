40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present the}} first ever {{measurements}} of living chain molecular weight distributions (MWDs), ªo(N), in free radical polymerization (FRP), using a new technique, the “photocopy method”. Though living chains are the fundamental objects in FRP, their MWDs have eluded measurement until now, principally due to their very short lifetimes (j 1 s). In the photocopy method, the living population is converted, essentially instantaneously, to a labeled inert one by “photoinhibitor ” molecules activated by a short laser pulse. This floods the FRP with photoinhibitor radicals, which ideally (i) are extremely slow to initiate new living chains yet (ii) couple with existing living chains (and each other) at near diffusion-controlled rates and (iii) carry a fluorescent label. Thus, the living chains are “frozen ” and labeled. They are subsequently detected selectively using GPC equipped with a fluorescence detector (a second detector simultaneously detects unlabeled chains). We applied the photocopy method to low conversion methyl methacrylate FRP. Our measured MWDs are exponential as predicted by the classical Flory-Schulz theory (which ignores the chain length dependence of the termination rate constant, kt), but only for chains longer than the mean living chain length <b>Nh</b> <b>o.</b> For N < <b>Nh</b> <b>o,</b> our data are consistent with a stretched exponential as predicted by modern FRP theories accounting for N dependence of kt.

The affinity correlation as well as an X-ray crystallography study suggest that these inhibitors bind to thermolysin in an identical mode. In this work, we calculate the electrostatic binding free energies for a series of 13 phosphorus-containing inhibitors with modifications at X, Y, and R moieties using finite difference solution to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. A method has been developed to include the solvation entropy changes due to binding different ligands to a macromolecule. We demonstrate that the electrostatic energy and empirically derived solvation entropy can account for most of the binding energy differences in this series. By analyzing the binding contribution from individual residues, we show that the energy of a hydrogen bond is not confined to the donor and acceptor. In particular, the positive charges on Zn and Arg 203, which are not the acceptors, contribute significantly to the hydrogen bonds between two amides of ZGpLL and the thermolysin...|$|E

For the assumption that O/H∼ 400 PPM, Models 2 and 8 are found to yield good fits to available data on interstellar material {{inside and outside of}} the heliosphere, {{with the exception of the}} Ne abundance in the pickup ion and anomalous cosmic ray populations. For these models, the interstellar medium (ISM) at the entry point to the heliosphere has <b>n(H</b> <b>o)</b> = 0. 202 – 0. 208 cm − 3, n(He o) = 0. 0137 – 0. 0152 cm − 3, and ionizations χ(H) = 0. 29 – 0. 30, χ(He) = 0. 47 – 0. 51. These best models suggest the chemical composition of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) is ∼ 60 – 70 % subsolar if S is undepleted. Both H o and H + need to be included when evaluating abundances of ions found in warm diffuse clouds. Models 2, 8 yield an H filtration factor ∼ 0. 46. Gas-to-dust mass ratios for the ISM towards ǫ CMa are Rgd = 178 − 183 for solar abundances of Holwege...|$|E

The solvation contribution obtained by the SM 8 and SM 8 AD models are in close agreement with the STS calculations, whereas the PCM (or CPCM) and cluster-continuum methods need small cavities for predicting the correct stability value...|$|R
