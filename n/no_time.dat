The keepers had <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E

5|$|Another uneventful advance {{into the}} North Sea {{took place on}} 21–22 April. A {{bombardment}} mission followed two days later; Posen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and {{had to return to}} port prematurely. Due to the poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to intercept the raiders.|$|E
5|$|Battered, Battleship Division Nine steamed {{into the}} {{anchorage}} of the Grand Fleet {{later that day}} to the tremendous cheering of {{the men on the}} assembled British warships. Wasting <b>no</b> <b>time,</b> Admiral Rodman called upon the commander of the Grand Fleet—Admiral Sir David Beatty—to offer the services of himself, his men, and his ships to the Allied cause. With Beatty's acceptance, the American battleships, while retaining their American designation of Battleship Division Nine, officially became the Sixth Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, but there was <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike.

For the first option to be successful, the North Vietnamese had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first option, {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to respond. At the same time, the first option would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa wasted <b>no</b> <b>time</b> moving {{onto his}} next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by Hyakken Uchida, the film follows {{the life of}} a Japanese {{professor}} of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.|$|E

Following up, the Austrians clashed with Kléber's divisions at Uckerath, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the French for a loss of only 600. After his success, Charles left 35,000 men with Wartensleben, 30,000 more in Mainz and the other fortresses and moved south with 20,000 troops to help Latour. Kléber withdrew into the Düsseldorf defenses.|$|E
