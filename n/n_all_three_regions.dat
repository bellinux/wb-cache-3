40|$|Intensities of EUV {{spectral}} lines were measured {{as a function}} of radius off the solar limb by two flights of Goddard's Solar EUV Rocket Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS) for <b>three</b> quiet sun <b>regions.</b> The density scale height, line-ratio densities, line-ratio temperatures, and emission measures were determined. The line-ratio temperature determined from the ionization balances of Arnaud and Rothenflug (1985) were more self-consistent than the line-ratio temperatures obtained from the values of Arnaud and Raymond (1992). Limits on the filling factor were determined from the emission measure and the line-ratio densities for <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions.</b> The relative abundances of silicon, aluminum, and chromium to iron were determined. Results did agree with standard coronal relative elemental abundances for one observation, but did not agree for another. Aluminum was overabundant while silicon was underabundant. Heating was required above 1. 15 solar radii for <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> studied. For two regions, local nonconductive heating is needed for any filling factor, and in <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> for filling factor of 0. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{prepared}} primary {{cultures of}} mouse astrocytes from the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum {{to examine the}} possibility of regional disparity in binding of human atrial and porcine brain natriuretic peptides (hANP, pBNP) and their effect on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. 125 I-hANP and 125 I-pBNP bound in a specific and saturable manner to <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions.</b> For both peptides, Scatchard analysis suggested a single population of binding sites on astrocytes from <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions.</b> No significant differences were observed in the maximal binding capacities (Bmax) or binding dissociation constants (KD) between the two peptides in the astrocyte preparations from different regions. ANP and BNP also evoked cGMP stimulation in a similar, dose-dependent fashion in astrocytes from <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions,</b> with maximal responses to both peptides reached at a concentration above 1 microM. While BNP elicited a greater maximal cGMP accumulation than ANP, no difference could be demonstrated in the cGMP responses to either peptide between brain regions. Thus we {{have been unable to}} demonstrate regional heterogeneity in the responsiveness of astrocytes to ANP and BNP...|$|R

The reflection nebulae in <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> are sources of 100 -micron emission similar to previously observed optical reflection nebulae. <b>All</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> also contain highly obscured sources which are often associated with radio maser activity, high-velocity gas outflows, and unusual radio continuum emission. There is {{a strong correlation between}} the occurrence of these radio phenomena and the presence of dust close enough to the central objects to radiate strongly in the 3 - 20 micron spectral region. These obscured sources are likely to be the pre-main-sequence counterparts to the nearby visible main-sequence stars; the obscured objects may still be undergoing mass accretion...|$|R

40|$|The {{involvement}} of defined regions of Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA in the fidelity of decoding has been examined {{by analyzing the}} effects of rRNA mutations on misreading errors at the ribosomal A and P sites. Mutations in the 1400 - 1500 region, the 530 loop and in the 1050 / 1200 region (helix 34) all caused readthrough of stop codons and frameshifting during elongation and stimulated initiation from non-AUG codons at the initiation of protein synthesis. These results indicate the {{involvement of}} <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> of 16 S rRNA in decoding functions at both the A and P sites. The functional similarity of <b>all</b> <b>three</b> mutant classes are consistent with close physical proximity of the 1400 - 1500 region, the 530 loop and helix 34 and suggest that <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> of rRNA comprise a decoding domain in the ribosome...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{cannabinoid}} CB 1 {{but not the}} CB 2 receptor {{was demonstrated}} to couple via Gα 16 to activate phospholipase C after co-expression in COS 7 cells.

Only the triple mutant with <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>regions</b> replaced activated phospholipase C to a similar extent as the CB 1 receptor, suggesting that <b>all</b> <b>three</b> intracellular <b>regions</b> are required for interacting with Gα 16.
