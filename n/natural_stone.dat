5|$|Oliver's Battery is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} battery {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. It was built by the Parliamentarian admiral, Sir Robert Blake, after he invaded Tresco in April 1651 during the years of the interregnum. It was used to bombard the neighbouring island of St Mary's, which was still held by an opposing Royalist army, and forced its surrender several weeks later. The battery comprised a triangle of ramparts, constructed using earth and rubble, which, combined with the <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> features on the site, produced a substantial, if crude, fortification. It is now ruined, and owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> (see illustration).|$|E

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>stones,</b> each {{featuring}} different physical, mechanical, chemical, mineralogical and petrographic properties, play {{an important}} role in construction because they are often used as cladding or paving/flooring materials. The physical and mechanical properties of the materials used as for cladding and/or flooring open areas are affected by both the environment and people. In construction projects, gloss value is one of the most essential physical features of <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> that is used as a reference for cladding or flooring materials. Solar exposition, often in combination with other environmental factors, has a considerable importance in the aging of <b>natural</b> <b>stones,</b> particularly at lower latitudes. In order to determine the stone behaviour in the areas exposed to sunlight, gloss value was investigated using a thermostatic chamber. In this study, the effect of UV irradiation cycles on the surface brightness of polished <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> and the relationship between gloss values and some physical, mechanical properties and calcite grain size of <b>natural</b> carbonatic <b>stone</b> samples were elucidated. As a result, it appears that marble samples have less gloss variation if compared with limestones...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{magnetic}} properties of four gem-quality synthetic diamonds indicate that higher levels of permanent magnetism can be induced in the synthetics than could be induced {{in a number of}} gem-quality <b>natural</b> <b>stones.</b> As received, the colored and included synthetics showed much higher levels of magnetism than the <b>natural</b> <b>stones,</b> but one near-colorless synthetic had less magnetism than many of the <b>natural</b> <b>stones.</b> Most of the magnetism of the <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> is due to surface contamination, which can only be removed by rigorous acid cleaning. After cleaning, the natural diamonds were not only less magnetic than all of the synthetic stones, but they were also more resistant to demagnetization. Significant levels of metallic impurities were detected in most of the synthetics. These results on a limited number of samples suggest that natural diamonds can be distinguished from synthetics {{on the basis of their}} magnetic properties, but that in the case of near-colorless, inclusion-free stones, such tests may require sophisticated instrumentation. ...|$|R
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, <b>natural</b> <b>stone,</b> and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|The Antankarana {{split off}} from the Sakalava in the early 17th century {{following}} a succession dispute. The group settled at {{the northern end of}} the island where they established sovereignty over and integrated the existing communities. During periods of conflict with Sakalava in the 17th century and the Kingdom of Imerina in the 19th century, the community periodically sought refuge in the <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> shelters and caves of the modern Ankarana Reserve, eventually taking their name from the locale and holding it as sacred. In the early 19th century an Antankarana king signed a treaty with French envoys in Reunion that mobilized French troops to expel the Merina from Antankarana territory in exchange for French control over several small islands off Madagascar's west coast. They also aided the French in staging attacks on the Merina monarchy that resulted in the 1896 French colonization of Madagascar. The Antankarana {{are one of the few}} communities that continues to honor a single king and reaffirm his sacred ancestral role through traditional ceremonies that date back centuries.|$|E

50|$|The visible {{absorption}} spectrum of scheelite, {{as seen by}} a hand-held (direct vision) spectroscope, may also be of use: Most <b>natural</b> <b>stones</b> show a number of faint absorption lines in the yellow region of the spectrum (~585 nm) due to praseodymium and neodymium trace impurities. Conversely, synthetic scheelite is often without such a spectrum. Some synthetics may however be doped with neodymium or other rare earth elements, but the spectrum produced is unlike that of <b>natural</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|R
