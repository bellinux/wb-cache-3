40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{the use of}} <b>neutral</b> <b>losses</b> (NL) for the identification of compounds related to the metabolism of tyrosine. The mass spectra of all the studied compounds, recorded at several collision energies, are compared. The fragmentation mechanism of protonated molecules, MH(+), is explained by combining collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The {{results show that the}} first fragmentation is the elimination from MH(+) of a neutral molecule including a functional group of the linear chain. Three primary <b>neutral</b> <b>losses</b> are observed: 17 u (NH(3)), 18 u (H(2) O) and 46 u (H(2) O+CO) characterizing amino, hydroxyl and carboxylic functions on the linear chain. The presence and abundance of ions corresponding to these losses are dependent on (i) the position of the functional group on the linear chain, (ii) the initial localisation of the protonating hydrogen, and (iii) the substitution of the aromatic ring. For compounds including a functional group on the benzylic carbon atom, the investigation of the other functions requires the knowledge of secondary fragmentations. Among these secondary fragmentations we have retained the loss of NH(3) from [MH- 18 u](+) and the loss of ketene from [MH- 17 u](+). Experimentally these fragmentations are detected using losses of 35 u and 59 / 73 u. In other words, NL 35 identifies hydroxy and amino compounds and NL 46 and/or NL 59 / 73 identify carboxylic acids. The search for characteristic <b>neutral</b> <b>losses</b> is used for the analysis of compounds in a mixture and the analysis of biological fluid. We show that selective search of several <b>neutral</b> <b>losses</b> allows also the unambiguous differentiation of isomers and gives the opportunity to identify compounds in biological fluids.

Ab initio and density functional theory calculations were used to calculate relative free energies for different {{fragment ion}} structures suggested by the m/z values of the most abundant ions observed in the NCI mass spectra. The NCI mass spectra of the four nitramines are dominated by ions formed by the cleavage of nitrogen–nitrogen and carbon–nitrogen bonds in the atrazine ring.

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} {{has become}} the preeminent method in proteomics, making identification of peptides from their pattern of gas phase fragmentation of interest. Current state‐of‐the‐art peptide identification discards intensity information in peptide spectra; however, improved understanding of the gas phase chemistry allows prediction of ion intensities. Improving the prediction of ion intensities requires uncovering novel fragmentation mechanisms and incorporating them algorithmically into programs designed to computationally model spectra. One such mechanism, discussed here, involves unexpectedly avid cleavage when proline is at the second position. Modeling this mechanism indicates that the gas phase chemistry is not catalyzed by charge. No such mechanism has been previously identified. Incorporating the predicted intensities improves peptide identification; however, certain classes of reaction, such as those exhibited in phosphopeptides continue to confound identification. Reversible protein phosphorylation modulates almost all aspects of cellular function, making understanding of this post‐translational modification essential in modern proteomics. Unfortunately, the phosphoester bond is very reactive, leading to spectra that are convoluted by the <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of H 3 PO 4. By using a dataset tenfold larger than previous studies, I am able to rigorously analyze how sequence affects <b>neutral</b> <b>loss.</b> In contrast to cleavage of peptide bonds, I find that <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of H 3 PO 4 is affected significantly by distal sites, most notably the basic residues and N‐terminus. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} basic residues directly catalyze <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> and initial analysis shows enhanced <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> near bases. However, in an example of Simpson’s paradox, when we stratify the spectra by charge‐mobility, we find evidence for the converse, that nearby bases inhibit <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> regardless of mobility class. In mobile proton spectra, the N‐terminus is the strongest predictor of high <b>neutral</b> <b>loss,</b> with proximity to the N‐terminus essential for peptides to exhibit the highest levels of <b>neutral</b> <b>loss.</b> These observations suggest a model in which the phosphate is always in complex with protons immobilized at basic sites though the adoption of secondary structure, in contrast to the prevailing model, which suggests direct protonation of the phosphate. Further evidence suggests that this mechanism may be general to all <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> reactions from peptide side chains...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{mass spectrometric}} technique {{for the analysis}} of phosphopeptides on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer is to perform MS/MS followed by MS 3 of the putative <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> peak observed by MS/MS. This is usually termed data-dependent <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> MS 3 (DDN-LMS 3). The strength of this approach is the sensitivity in full scan MSn of linear ion trap technology and the characteristically strong <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> peak, which flags the MS/ MS spectrum as potentially belonging to a phosphopeptide. This approach has been much applied to phospho-proteomic analyses typically involving up-front phosphopeptide enrichment, such as TiO 2 chromatography. Indeed, a recent article from Mann and co-workers identified 6600 phosphorylation sites utilizing a hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer.

40|$|Sulfopeptides can be misassigned as phosphopeptides {{because of}} the {{isobaric}} nature of the sulfo- and the phosphomoieties. Instruments having the ability to measure mass with high accuracy may be employed to distinguish these moieties based on their mass defect (the sulfo-group is 9 mmu lighter than the phosphomoiety). However, the assignment of the exact site(s) of post-translational modification is required to probe biological function. We have reported earlier that peptides with identical sequences containing either O-sulfo- or O-phospho-modifications display different fragmentation behavior (K. F. Medzihradszky et al., Mol. Cell.

The fragmentation pathways {{leading to the}} formation of carboxylate anions [RxCO 2 −], (x = 1, 2) and the formation of the ions representing <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of fatty acid ([M–H–RxCO 2 H]−) and <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of ketene ([M–H–R′xCHCO]−) (RxR′xCH 2) are charge-driven processes that are governed by the gas-phase basicity and the steric configuration of the molecules. The preferential formation of the ions of [M–H–R 2 CO 2 H]− > [M–H–R 1 CO 2 H]− and [M–H–R′ 2 CHCO]− > [M–H–R′ 1 CHCO]− are attributed to the fact that loss of fatty acid and loss of ketene are sterically more favorable at sn- 2. While the observation of the abundance of [M–H–RxCO 2 H]− > [M–H–R′xCHCO]− is attributed to the acidity of the gas phase ion of GPA, which undergoes a more facile <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of acid than loss of ketene. The major pathway leading {{to the formation of}} RxCO 2 − ion under low energy CAD arises from further fragmentation of the [M–H–RxCO 2 H]− ions by <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of 136, resulting in an abundance of R 1 CO 2 − > R 2 CO 2 −.

40|$|The gas-phase {{dissociation}} of phosphorylated peptides was modelled using {{a combination}} of quantum mechanics and the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus theory. Potential energy surfaces and unimolecular reaction rates for several low-energy fragmentation and rearrangement pathways were estimated, and a general mechanism was proposed. The <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> of the phosphoric acid was mainly an outcome of the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism. The mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack of the phosphorylated amino acid N-terminal carbonyl oxygen on b-carbon, yielding a cyclic five-membered oxazoline product ion. Regardless of the proton mobility, the pathway was charge directed either by a mobile proton or by a positively charged side chain of some basic residue. Although the mechanistic aspects of the phosphate loss are not influenced by the proton mobility environment, it does affect ion abundances. Results suggest that under the mobile proton environment, the interplay between phosphoric acid <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> product ion and backbone cleavage fragments should occur. On the other hand, when proton mobility is limited, <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> product ion may predominate. The fragmentation dynamics of phosphoserine versus phosphothreonine containing peptides suggests that H 3 PO 4 <b>neutral</b> <b>loss</b> from phosphothreonine containing peptides is less abundant than that from their phosphoserine containing analogs. During the low-energy CID of phosphorylated peptides in the millisecond time range, typical for ion trap instruments, a phosphate group rearrangement may happen, resulting in an interchange between the phosphorylated and the hydroxylated residues.
