5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property of <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, lose some of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E

5|$|Following {{her first}} face turn, Stratus began wrestling part-time. She {{teamed up with}} Lita against then-heels, Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson at InVasion. After {{suffering}} an ankle injury in the summer, however, she was sidelined for the following three months. This interrupted <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> recent venture into wrestling, but also an on-screen romance with Jeff Hardy and budding storyline with Team Xtreme. As she rehabilitated, she kept herself visible by co-hosting Excess on TNN. After returning in autumn, Stratus appeared at Survivor Series where she won the WWF Women's Championship {{for the first time}} in a six-pack challenge. Stratus was next involved in a feud with Jazz over the Women's Championship, where she retained the championship at the Royal Rumble, but dropped the championship to Jazz two weeks later on the February 4, 2002 episode of Raw. Stratus then attempted to regain the title for several months, including competing in a triple threat match at WrestleMania X8 against Lita and Jazz in her hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but failed to win the match. While chasing after the Women's Championship, Stratus won the WWE Hardcore Championship on May 6, pinning Crash Holly after Bubba Ray Dudley hit him over the head with a trash can. She lost the title to Steven Richards soon afterward however, due to the stipulation that the belt was to be defended 24/7 as long as there was a referee present. One week later, she regained the Women's Championship in a tag team match with Bubba Ray Dudley. During this time, Stratus began wrestling solely on the Raw brand after being drafted in the WWF Brand Extension.|$|E

25|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> {{performances}} {{on the court}} which were noted, however.

The staid British also were in shock at the boldness of the French woman who also casually sipped brandy between sets.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{shown in}} her right hand {{contains}} a demand from David for her to choose between fidelity to her husband or obedience to her king, and is an anecdotal catalyst for her introspection. In representing this moment, Rembrandt extrapolated from the biblical text, which treated Bathsheba incidentally while focusing on David's sinfulness. As a result, her expression is profound enough to suggest <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> sense of resignation, but the broader narrative as well. As a conception of the nude figure suffused with complexity of thought, Bathsheba at Her Bath is nearly unique in art.|$|E

25|$|The “history” of Doro’s {{reproductive}} {{colonies in}} which he calls “seed villages,” embodies the rationales of Western modernity. Doro also poses these “seed villages” as alternatives to Western modernity, more specifically slavery and colonization. As we see, the moment Anyanwu agrees to Doro’s continuation of his colonial project, she agrees to a patriarchal system of governance that controls <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> capacity to reproduce, but also whomever Doro chooses. This control of women’s reproduction is not dissimilar from the very same patriarchal governances of reproduction in slavery and colonization. After her agreement, Doro and Anyanwu’s relationship is described in a master-slave/, colonizer/colonized dialectic. In this instance, colonization is linked to patriarchal desires, particularly those of control over reproduction.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Dunham's company gave further {{performances}} in Chicago and Cincinnati {{and then went}} back to New York, where Dunham had been invited to stage a new number for the popular, long-running musical revue Pins and Needles 1940, produced by the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. As this show continued its run at the Windsor Theater, Dunham booked her own company in the theater for a Sunday performance. This concert, billed as Tropics and Le Hot Jazz, included <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> favorite partners Archie Savage and Talley Beatty but her principal Haitian drummer, Papa Augustin. Initially scheduled for a single performance, the show was so popular that the troupe repeated it for another ten Sundays.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{by the end}} of May 1727, Elizabeth (aged 17) {{had lost}} her fiance and both of her parents; and furthermore, her half-nephew Peter II was on the throne. Her {{marriage}} prospects immediately dried up. They did not improve when, three years later, Peter II died and was succeeded by Elizabeth's first cousin, Empress Anna (ruled 1730-40), daughter of Peter the Great's elder brother Ivan V. The Chinese minister in St. Petersburg was asked by the Empress Anna who was the most beautiful woman at her court, leading him to point to Elizabeth, much to Anna's intense displeasure. There was little love lost between the cousins and no prospect of either any Russian nobleman or any foreign prince seeking Elizabeth's hand in marriage. Nor could Elizabeth marry a commoner because it would cost her <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> title and royal status, but also her property rights and her claim to the throne.|$|E

25|$|Through {{correspondence}} {{over the}} summer, Blackwell and Stone discussed {{the nature and}} faults of the marriage institution {{and the benefits of}} a true, ideal marriage. Then, eager to demonstrate how he could help Stone accomplish more, Blackwell offered to arrange a lecture tour for her in the west (then the mid-western states of Indiana, Illinois, and western Ohio and Kentucky). She accepted, and he wrote to business acquaintances to engage halls and place newspaper notice while personally printing and mailing broadsides for posting. From mid-October 1853 through the first week of January 1854, Stone lectured on women's rights in more than ten cities in five states, including Cincinnati, Louisville, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Chicago. Newspaper reports described her enthusiastic reception by the largest audiences ever assembled in some of the cities, as well as the deep influence she was having on those who heard her. During an intimate rendezvous before she returned east, Stone expressed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> deep gratitude to Blackwell for making her success possible, but also a genuine affection. Nevertheless, she remained resolute about never placing herself in the legal position occupied by a married woman.|$|E
500|$|Monteux's musical {{career was}} {{interrupted}} in 1896, {{when he was}} called up for military service. As {{a graduate of the}} Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as [...] "the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen".

[...] In an interview with Wendyl Nissen from Newstalk ZB, Moa explained, [...] "Most of the songs that I write are based on memories of my life or memories of someone who I know's life". She also mentioned that the album was influenced by many types of love; <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> own, but also {{the love of her}} family, and love illustrated on soap operas such as Shortland Street and Grey's Anatomy.|$|E
500|$|... "On Lickerish Hill" [...] is a {{retelling of}} the Rumplestiltskin tale.

As Hoyle explains, {{in order to avoid}} [...] "imprisonment, murder, dismemberment, or sexual slavery", Miranda must defeat <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>her</b> captor but also the man {{attempting}} to save her. The story satirizes the antiquarian John Aubrey and his ilk, as Aubrey's advice to Miranda and her husband turns out to be largely worthless. Written {{in the form of an}} old diary, the text includes archaic spellings; for example, Miranda's assistant is described as [...] " [...] small black thinge. Hairie. Legges like jug-handles.
