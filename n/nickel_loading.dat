The supported nickel catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and characterized by BET, XRD, TPR, TPD, H 2 pulse chemisorption, and UV-vis spectroscopy. Characterization of supported nickel (or nickel oxide) catalysts revealed existence of dispersed as well as bulk nickel (or nickel oxide) depending {{on the extent of}} <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> {{and the nature of the}} support. The acidity of γ-Al 2 O 3 supported nickel catalysts decreased with increasing the <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> on γ-Al 2 O 3. n-Heptane, n-octane, di-n-octyl ether, 1 -octanal, isomers of heptene and octene, tetradecane, and hexadecane were identified as products of HDO of 1 -octanol. The C 7 hydrocarbons were observed as primary products for catalysts with active metal sites such as γ-Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 supported nickel catalysts. However, C 8 hydrocarbons were primarily formed over acidic catalysts such as pure HZSM- 5 and HZSM- 5 supported nickel catalyst. The 1 -octanol conversion increased with increasing <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> on γ-Al 2 O 3, and temperature and decreasing pressure and WHSV. The selectivity to products was strongly influenced by temperature, <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> on γ-Al 2 O 3, pressure, and types of carrier gases (nitrogen and hydrogen). The selectivity to C 7 hydrocarbons was favoured over catalysts with increased <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> on γ-Al 2 O 3 at elevated temperature and lower pressure.

Several supported nickel oxide catalysts with <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> up to 25 wt. % were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and reduced using hydrogen. The catalysts were then characterized by BET, TPR, H 2 pulse chemisorption, TPD, XRD, and ICP-AES. Characterization studies revealed that only dispersed nickel oxide was present up to 15 wt. % <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> on γ-Al 2 O 3. The acidity of the supports depends on <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> of oxidized catalysts and increases with increasing <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> up to 15 wt. %. n-Pentadecane, n-hexadecane, n-heptadecane, n-octadecane, and l-octadecanol were identified as products of hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid with n-heptadecane being primary product. The catalytic activity and selectivity to products for hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid depends strongly on acidity of the supports. The maximum selectivity to n-heptadecane was observed with nickel supported γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. A suitable reaction mechanism of hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid was delineated based on products distribution. The conversion of stearic acid was increased with increasing reaction time, <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> on γ-Al 2 O 3, temperature, and catalyst loading. Complete conversion of stearic acid was accomplished with more than 80 % selectivity to n-heptadecane at reasonable reaction temperature of 563 K after 240 min of reaction using 15 wt. % Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst.

The present article provides a systematic examination of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of karanja oil (KO) in a semi-batch reactor over supported (γ-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, and HZSM- 5) nickel catalysts. The catalysts were associated with both dispersed and bulk nickel/nickel oxide depending {{on the extent of}} <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> and nature of the support. Virgin KO is composed of ~ 76 wt% C 18 fatty acids with ~ 15 wt% oxygen. HDO of KO resulted {{in a wide range of}} alkanes (C 10 –C 22) with n-heptadecane being the major one. Transformation of KO into alkanes proceeds through three distinct routes: HDO, catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, or their combination. Highly acidic catalysts (HZSM- 5 and Ni/HZSM- 5) promote catalytic cracking leading to formation of a large amount of lighter alkanes. The cracking reaction becomes significant over the γ-Al 2 O 3 supported nickel catalyst with ≤ 15 wt% <b>nickel</b> <b>loading</b> at elevated temperatures.

The effect {{of the amount of}} silicates on the properties and performances of catalysts with different <b>nickel</b> <b>load</b> (Ni 8 Mg 60 Al 32 and Ni 2 Mg 66 Al 32) Was studied. Catalysts were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature Programmed Reduction/Oxidation (TPR/O), H- 2 chemisorption, N- 2 adsorption/desorption at - 196 degrees C. The amount of silicates determined structural and textural properties of the catalysts forming the forsterite phase after thermal treatment. Increasing the silicate load, the specific Surface area (S-BET) and the Ni dispersion decreased, but the reducibility of Ni 2 + species was not modified.

A nickel concn. of 0. 5 gNi g- 1 RVC results in fibers with a diam. of 30 to 90 nm. Increasing the nickel concn. results in fiber diams. of 30 to 1100 nm. Complete CNF coverage is obtained for a nickel deposition time 240 min and a nickel concn. 2. 5 gNi g- 1 RVC...|$|E
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{hydrogen}} production via glycerol steam reforming over copper and <b>nickel</b> <b>loaded</b> on HZSM- 5 zeolite based catalyst. The catalysts were prepared by using different loading amount of copper (0 - 10 wt%) and nickel (0 - 10 wt%) on HZSM- 5 zeolite catalysts through wet impregnation method and {{was characterized by}} X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The performances of catalysts were evaluated in terms of glycerol conversion and hydrogen production at 500 °C using 6 : 1 of water to glycerol molar ratio (WGMR) in a tubular fixed bed reactor. All the catalysts had achieved more than 85 % of glycerol conversion except that of 5 %Cu loaded on HZSM- 5 catalyst. The addition of nickel into 5 % Cu/HZSM- 5 catalyst had increased the hydrogen yield. Similar trend was observed when copper was added into Ni/HZSM- 5 catalyst but using copper loaded on HZSM- 5 alone was unable to produce hydrogen compared to using nickel catalyst alone. It showed that copper acted as a promoter for hydrogen production. It was established that a 5 wt% of Cu with 10 wt% of Ni loaded on HZSM- 5 catalyst showed significant improvement in terms of hydrogen yield and gaseous product compositions at selected operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of faujasite from fly ash and its application for hydrocracking catalyst of heavy petroleum distillates have been performed. Faujasite was synthesized from fly ash by hydrothermal reaction in alkaline solution via combination of reflux pretreatment of fly ash with HCl and fusion with NaOH. The preparation of nickel containing catalysts by ion exchange method under similar initial concentration of nickel resulted higher amount of <b>nickel</b> <b>loaded</b> on faujasite {{than those on}} zeolite Y, however, the structural damage of faujasite was {{higher than those of}} zeolite Y. In the hydrocracking of heavy petroleum distillates over Ni-faujasite and Ni-zeolite Y catalysts, the conversion of heavy gas oil fraction was the most pronounced. The selectivity toward hydrocarbons in the range of gasoline and kerosene obtained over Ni-faujasite catalyst was lower compared to those of Ni-zeolite Y reference catalyst. © 2007 BCREC UNDIP.
