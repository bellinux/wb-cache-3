40|$|The {{extremely}} different supplies {{between the}} harvest {{season and the}} planting season are one of serious problem in the staple-food distribution system. In free-market mechanism, this extreme difference will trigger price-volatility and shortage of staple-food. This situation causes opportunity-losses for the stakeholders (producer, consumer, agent and government) in the staple-food distribution system. The government has got incurred losses because the government cannot achieve food-security for the households. The government has several price stabilization policies; {{one of them is}} market intervention policy by using <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> schemes to stabilize price and to reduce losses for the stakeholders. The objective of this research is to determine the <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> schemes required for market-intervention program.

40|$|On oligopolistic {{markets with}} dynamic {{production}} functions one can often observe attempts toward cooperative agreements to "stabilize" prices. On the other hand, it {{is a well-known}} fact that cartel agreements are difficult to control, especially when the sellers come from different countries.

In this paper we analyze the economic institution of a common <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> agency which can shift supply from present to future periods. Although the <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> agency determines the prices, individual production amounts are chosen independently by the sellers. We study {{the case of a}} price <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> agency which cannot produce, as well as the situation in which a major seller controls the <b>buffer</b> <b>stock.</b> One interesting result is that it makes quite an important difference whether the <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> agency is or is not able to produce.

40|$|Recent {{models with}} {{liquidity}} constraints and impatience emphasize that consumers use savings to buffer income fluctuations. When wealth is below an optimal target, consumers try {{to increase their}} <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> of wealth by saving more, while, if wealth is above target, they increase consumption. This important implication of the <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> model of saving has not been subject to direct empirical testing. We derive from the model an appropriate theoretical restriction and test it using data on working-age individuals drawn from the 2002 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth. One of the most appealing features of the survey is that respondents report the amount of wealth held for precautionary purposes, which we interpret as target wealth in a <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> model.

40|$|It {{is known}} that simple price {{limiters}} may have unexpected consequences in irregular commodity price fluctuations between bull and bear markets and complicated impacts {{on the size of}} <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks.</b> In particular, imposing a lower price boundary may lead to a huge <b>buffer</b> <b>stock,</b> e. g. to a ?butter mountain? or a ?milk lake? and this is a real problem for regulators since storage costs may become impossible to finance over time. The relation between price limiters and the size of <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks</b> is nontrivial and there may exist some optimal price limiters which require only weak market interventions and thus provide a rather inexpensive option to regulate commodity markets. In this paper, we use a simple commodity market model to explore the relation between price limiters and the average growth rate of the <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks.</b> It is found that these optimal price limiter levels are simply the minimum values of unstable periodic orbits of the underlying deterministic system. commodity markets; price stabilization; limiter control; butter mountains and milk lakes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{the impact}} of salient supply {{disparity}} of seasonal staple food, producer and consumer may experience losses in their transaction with wholesaler. In monopolistic market, {{it is probable that}} wholesaler manipulate the market situation to get staple food at the lowest purchasing price and sell them at the highest selling price. An indirect market intervention model is projected to mitigate producer’s revenue loss when selling price plunges and to secure consumer’s need when staple food is scarce.
