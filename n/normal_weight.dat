5|$|Studies {{that have}} focused on {{inheritance}} patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of <b>normal</b> <b>weight.</b> Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their <b>normal</b> <b>weight</b> counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E

40|$|The early {{appearance}} of cholesterol gallstones {{is very common}} in Chile. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, {{the size of the}} bile acid pool and the secretion of biliary lipids were studied in two groups of young women with <b>normal</b> <b>weights</b> and radiologically functioning gallbladders: nine with cholesterol gallstones and 14 healthy volunteers. The bile acid pool was similar in control and gallstone patients. The secretory rates of bile acids and phospholipids were comparable and significantly correlated in both groups. On the other hand, cholesterol output was higher in gallstone patients. In controls there was a significant correlation between the output of bile acids and cholesterol, but no correlation was found in the gallstone group. This study suggests that cholesterol hypersecretion into the bile is {{a major factor in the}} pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease in young Chilean women with <b>normal</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Being {{overweight}} is {{a characteristic}} {{that may influence}} a person’s heat exchange. Objectives The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of body weight on heat strain indices in hot and dry climatic conditions. Materials and Methods This study was completed with a sample of 30 participants with <b>normal</b> <b>weights,</b> as well as 25 participants who were overweight. The participants were physically inactive for a period of 120 minutes in a climatic chamber with hot and dry conditions (22 - 32 °C and with 40 % relative humidity (RH)). The physiological strain index (PSI) and heat strain score index (HSSI) questionnaires were used. Simultaneous measurements were completed during heat exposure for periods of five minutes. The resting periods acted as the initial measurements for 15 minutes. Results In both groups, oral temperature, heart rate, and thermal perceptual responses increased during heat exposure. The means and standard deviations of heart rate and oral temperature were gathered when participants were in hot and dry climatic conditions and were not physically active. The heart rates and oral temperatures were 79. 21 ± 5. 93 bpm and 36. 70 ± 0. 45 °C, respectively, for those with <b>normal</b> <b>weights.</b> For overweight individuals, the measurements for heart rate and oral temperature reached 82. 21 ± 8. 9 bpm and 37. 84 ± 0. 37 °C, respectively. Conclusions The results showed that, compared to participants with <b>normal</b> <b>weights,</b> physiological and thermal perceptual responses were higher in overweight participants. Therefore, overweight individuals should avoid hot/dry weather conditions to decrease the amount of heat strain...|$|R

25|$|The {{stresses}} in {{the dome}} {{were found to}} be substantially reduced by the use of successively less dense aggregate stones, such as small pots or pieces of pumice, in higher layers of the dome. Mark and Hutchison estimated that, if <b>normal</b> <b>weight</b> concrete had been used throughout, the stresses in the arch would have been some 80% greater. Hidden chambers engineered within the rotunda form a sophisticated structural system. This reduced the weight of the roof, as did the elimination of the apex by means of the oculus.|$|E

25|$|A {{majority}} of women with PCOS have insulin resistance and/or are obese. Their elevated insulin levels contribute to or cause the abnormalities seen in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis that lead to PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia increases GnRH pulse frequency, LH over FSH dominance, increased ovarian androgen production, decreased follicular maturation, and decreased SHBG binding. Furthermore, excessive insulin, acting through its cognate receptor {{in the presence of}} component cAMP signalling, upregulates 17α-hydroxylase activity via PI3K, 17α-hydroxylase activity being responsible for synthesising androgen precursors. The combined effects of hyperinsulinemia contribute to an increased risk of PCOS. Insulin resistance is a common finding among women with a <b>normal</b> <b>weight</b> as well as overweight women.|$|E
25|$|Bulimia nervosa, {{also known}} as simply bulimia, is an eating {{disorder}} characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating {{a large amount of}} food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts {{to get rid of the}} food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a <b>normal</b> <b>weight.</b> The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.|$|E
25|$|CD36's {{association}} {{with the ability to}} taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in taste bud cells (TBC) of obese sand rats (P. obesus) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between the obese and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in obese rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. Taste bud cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from obese mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be obese (but not in <b>normal</b> <b>weight</b> mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing to behavior changes in the obese mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats.|$|E

Both prematurity and low birth weight {{have been associated with}} an increased incidence of ophthalmic disorders. In this study we determined prevalence of visual impairment in low birth <b>weight</b> and <b>normal</b> birth <b>weight</b> school age children in Mashhad. Methods: This is a cross sectional study. The target population consisted of all children referred to educational organizations for screening before entering school in Mashhad, Iran. 2400 children enrolled in the study and were evaluated for amblyopia, refractive errors, color vision disturbance and optic nerve problems. Data were analyzed by SPSS. Findings: Prevalence of ophthalmic problems in all children was 5. 43 % and in low birth <b>weight</b> and <b>normal</b> birth <b>weight</b> 8. 29 % and 5. 74 % respectively. Incidence of ophthalmic problems was significantly (P= 0. 029) higher in low birth weight children than in <b>normal</b> birth <b>weight</b> children. The most common ophthalmic disease in both low birth <b>weight</b> and <b>normal</b> birth <b>weight</b> children was refractive errors 81. 5 % vs. 68. 8 % (P< 0. 05).
