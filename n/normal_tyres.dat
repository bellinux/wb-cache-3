40|$|To {{cope with}} winter weather conditions, {{potentially}} including snow and ice, {{it is common}} to use winter tyres, or "all-seasons" tyres assumed to be safe both in summer and winter. In some northern countries, winter tyres are mandatory. It is commonly assumed that winter tyres are noisier than <b>normal</b> <b>tyres</b> (here called summer tyres) and winter tyres equipped with studs are assumed to be extra noisy. This paper presents a study where noise and rolling resistance properties of tyres for winter conditions are compared to summer and all-season tyres. The winter tyres include types optimized for central European climate, tyres optimized for Nordic climate and tyres with studs. In total, approx. 50 car tyres have been tested. Noise properties have been measured with the CPX method and rolling resistance has been measured with a trailer method; all measurements made on two road surfaces; SMA 8 and DAC 16. Results indicate that winter tyres are not noisier than summer tyres; except for studded tyres. Despite high differences among individual tyres, rolling resistance is approximately similar among the main types; surprisingly including also studded tyres. An alarming result was that there was no correlation between measured values and values on the tyre labels. QC 20180201 </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wheel loaders {{are prone}} to lateral tilting {{accidents}} due to their complex working environment, variable structure frame and the large offset of the centroid position. The accidents may seriously threaten the driver’s safety. This paper proposes a steady-state margin (SSM) angle as a new instability threat indicator to analyse lateral stability of wheel loaders. Firstly, the structural characteristics and the rollover process of a wheel loader are presented, and the SSM angle is defined. Secondly, {{on the assumption that}} the tyres are rigid, the calculation process of the SSM angle is described in detail, then the SSM angle of the XG 953 wheel loader is computed. A virtual prototyping simulation was performed under the environment of ADAMS. The maximum relative error between the theoretical calculation and simulated result was 4. 55 %, within the permissible speed range.

50|$|For the mid-1970s, F1 {{stipulated that}} the maximum {{width of the}} front wing was 1.5 m. Considering the needed room for the driver's feet, the {{steering}} mechanism, suspension and the <b>normal</b> front <b>tyre</b> size, this meant the front tyres projected above {{and out to the}} sides of the wing. P34's basic concept was to use a tyre that would be small enough to fit entirely behind the wing. This would have two effects; one would be to lower overall drag and thus improve speed on straights, and the other was to clean up overall aerodynamics so the rear wing would receive cleaner airflow.|$|R
50|$|Formula One tyres bear only a {{superficial}} resemblance to a <b>normal</b> road <b>tyre.</b> Whereas {{the latter has}} a useful life of up to 80000 km, the tyres used in Formula One are built to last less than one race distance. The purpose of the tyre determines the compound of the rubber to be used. In , tyre changes were disallowed in Formula One, therefore the compounds were harder as the tyres had to last the full race distance of around 300 km. Tyre changes were re-instated in , following the dramatic and highly political 2005 United States Grand Prix.|$|R
50|$|The P34 was {{reasonably}} {{successful with}} the two cars taking a memorable 1-2 in the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix. The Tyrrell team also finished 3rd and 4th overall in the championship. The car was less successful in 1977 however and the idea was dropped. Reasons given were that although Goodyear had manufactured special tyres for the car, the tyre company had failed to match the development work on them compared to the <b>normal</b> sized <b>tyres</b> used by other teams. With all four front wheels steering the car, Tyrrell {{also found that the}} P34's complex four-wheel front suspension assembly added a lot of weight to the car.|$|R
50|$|Tyres {{can be no}} {{wider than}} 355 and 380 mm at the rear, front tyre width reduced from 270 mm to 245 mm for the 2010 season. Unlike the fuel, the tyres bear only a {{superficial}} resemblance to a <b>normal</b> road <b>tyre.</b> Whereas a roadcar tyre has a useful life of up to 80000 km, a Formula One tyre does not even last the whole race distance (a little over 300 km); they are usually changed {{two or three times}} per race, depending on the track. This {{is the result of a}} drive to maximise the road-holding ability, leading to the use of very soft compounds (to ensure that the tyre surface conforms to the road surface as closely as possible).|$|R
25|$|The crew, {{after finding}} the plane controllable, decided {{to fly a}} {{racetrack}} holding pattern close to Changi airport while assessing {{the status of the}} aircraft. It took 50 minutes to complete this initial assessment. The first officer and supervising check captain (SCC) then input the plane's status to the landing distance performance application (LDPA) for a landing 50 tonnes over maximum landing weight at Changi. Based on these inputs the LDPA could not calculate a landing distance. After discussion the crew elected to remove inputs related to a wet runway, in the knowledge that the runway was dry. The LDPA then returned the information that the landing was feasible with 100 metres of runway remaining. The flight then returned to Singapore Changi Airport, landing safely after the crew extended the landing gear by a gravity drop emergency extension system, at 11:45a.m. Singapore time. As a result of the aircraft landing 35 knots faster than <b>normal,</b> four <b>tyres</b> were blown.|$|R
50|$|Having {{received}} the specifications in November 1936, DAF immediately began the third project, the Pantrado 3, a somewhat larger vehicle than the Pantrado 2. Construction of a boiler plate demonstrator vehicle was {{begun in the}} spring of 1937. The construction process was inspected in May by the Dutch prime minister Hendrik Colijn who at the time was also interim minister of defence. DAF submitted the first blueprints and a scale model to the commission in July. These showed a number of deviations from the specifications: the design dispensed with the track option entirely and was a pure armoured car. The front wheels were not driven and <b>normal</b> rubber <b>tyres</b> were used. In August 1937 the commission advised that a single prototype would be ordered; Van Doorne and Van der Trappen had indicated that the demonstrator vehicle was in an advanced stage of manufacture and could quickly be completed as an official prototype.|$|R

50|$|The delays irritated the {{ministry}} of defence such that in February it asked the Ordnance Department when the type could be operational. It was promised that six vehicles would be completed in March and April each if 110 bulletproof tyres of the Veil-Picard type, which had been ordered in December from Michelin in France after export of the American Seiberling-type had been forbidden, were delivered on the due date of 1 April. In fact the tyres would never arrive; and bar a single vehicle to which bulletproof tyres had been experimentally fitted all M39s used <b>normal</b> inflatable truck <b>tyres.</b> But a far more serious deficiency would impede operational use.|$|R
40|$|Incorporating {{recycled}} tyre rubber into {{flexible pavement}} applications {{by means of}} Recycled Tyre Rubber-Modified Bitumen RTR-MBs would solve a serious waste problem, save energy and materials, and enhance pavement life and performance. On the other hand, the excessive high-temperature viscosity of rubberised binders imposes handling difficulties during the mixing and compaction process. Therefore, producing rubberised binders with acceptable high-temperature viscosity, and equally having desirable mechanical properties that are truly reflected in asphalt mixtures, was the main aim of this study. Three different types of recycled tyre rubber, with two different base bitumens, were selected to produce different combinations of rubberised binders. The three different sources of recycled tyre rubber are; (1) <b>normal</b> ambiently produced <b>tyre</b> rubber (2) cryogenically produced tyre rubber that was pre-treated with Warm Mix Additive (Sasobit®) {{in order to reduce}} the high-temperature viscosity of rubberised binders and (3) normal ambiently produced recycled tyre rubber containing 20...|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} – numerical tyre {{model has}} been developed. The whole model allows to obtain the tyre – road interactions {{which can be used}} in vehicle dynamics simulations. In this paper its capabilities in terms of normal interaction analysis are presented. The <b>tyre</b> <b>normal</b> interaction, i. e. the relationship between the normal load and the normal deflection, influences the tangential (longitudinal plus lateral) one, which determines the vehicle’s handling behaviour. The parameters used in the model depend on the structure of the tyre and they can be measured on the real tyre. The tyre has been schematized as composed by a flexible belt, by the sidewalls and by a rigid ring (rim). The flexible belt is composed by a number of lumped masses linked by extensional and bending stiffnesses and dampers. The tyre {{model has been}} developed using the finite segment method. Using this method it is possible to include in the tyre simulations various non-linear structural effects due to large displacements and rotations. The model allows to simulate both steady state and transient conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the parameterisation, {{validation}} and implementation of an FTire model of a Michelin LTX A/T 2 235 / 85 R 16 tyre. This tyre is designed for both on- and off-road use and is commonly used on all wheel drive SUVs. Quasi-static laboratory and dynamic field tests were conducted to acquire parameterisation and validation test data for the FTire model. Quasi-static parameterisation tests include acquiring vertical tyre stiffness over a flat plate and cleats, tyre footprint sizes and shapes, longitudinal, lateral and torsional tyre stiffness for various <b>tyre</b> <b>normal</b> loads, as well as vibrational tyre responses. Dynamic parameterisation tests include dynamic cleat test data. An Adams model of the tyre testing equipment is implemented to simulate the FTire model and validate it against dynamic validation test results. Finally, the model is implemented on a fully nonlinear multi-body dynamics model of a Land Rover Defender. It is found that the FTire model is able to predict the lateral tyre behaviour well on a smooth road surface. The vertical and longitudinal tyre behaviour on a smooth road surface and on a rough surface are predicted accurately. [URL] and Aeronautical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} test rig aimed to characterize a pneumatic tyre, {{together with the}} first experimental results, is presented. The objective is to determine some tyre mechanical characteristics useful to physically model its behaviour; in particular: the normal interaction characteristic, the radial stiffness, the total stiffness and the longitudinal hysteretic cycles. To this aim two different kind of tests have been executed: radial and longitudinal tests. In the radial test the load is statically applied, along the vertical direction, to the tyre {{by means of an}} hydraulic press and it is measured together with the consequent radial deformation, so allowing the estimation of the <b>tyre</b> <b>normal</b> interaction characteristic and of its radial stiffness. Different radial tests can be conducted for an assigned tyre varying the inflation pressure. The longitudinal tests are conducted applying, under an assigned constant vertical load, a variable horizontal strain to the tyre by means of a linear actuator, two profile rail guides and a system to transfer the horizontal motion to the contact patch of the tyre, opportunely placed on a moving steel plate placed on the two linear guide rails. During the tests the horizontal load and the resulting deformations are measured and acquired so allowing the estimation of tyre total stiffness and of its longitudinal hysteretic cycles. Longitudinal tests can be conducted varying the assigned vertical load, the horizontal displacement law in terms of frequency and amplitude, the tyre inflation pressure. All the different types of rim can be mounted on the test rig thanks to a universal quick flange...|$|R
