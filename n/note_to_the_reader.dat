40|$|The {{major focus}} of this {{departmental}} thesis was to complete t he first English translation of E 271 Arithmetic Theorems Proven by a New Method, a mathematical treatise published by Leonhard Euler in Latin in 1761. Most importantly, E 271 contains Euler 2 ̆ 7 s generalization of Fermat 2 ̆ 7 s Litt le Theorem and {{an exploration of the}} properties of (n). Altogether, this paper includes an Abstract, Introduction, <b>Note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Readers,</b> Translation of Arithmetic Theorems Proven by a New Method, Epilogue, and References. More specifically, the Introduction is about the historical background of the mathematics and applications leading up to E 271 and the key corresponding mathematicians. Then t he <b>Note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Readers</b> discusses <b>the</b> t ranslation process. Further, the Epilogue consists of the historical background of the mathematics and applications which arose after E 271 was published and the key corresponding mathematicians. As the author of E 271, Leonhard Euler is the mathematician most relevant to this project. However, before Euler, the mathematician Pierre Fermat also {{played a significant role in}} the development of number theory. Thus, the Introduction contains details surrounding the life and mathematics of both Fermat and Euler. Following Euler, Gauss was another major figure in the history of number thenrv, especially its notation. There are various applications, one of which is the FlSA algorithm, which utilize Euler 2 ̆ 7 s work as well. As a result, details on Gauss and the RSA algorithm, completing a fascinating path from the 18 th Century <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 21 st Century, are included in the Epilogue...|$|R

50|$|The Seekers is subtitled The Story of Mans Continuing Quest to Understand His World.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} obtaining a quality photograph of a painting by multi-image fusion methods. The problem is particularly challenging because of the uncontrolled illumination conditions and of the destructive reflection speckle present in most photographs of paintings. A fully automatic image processing chain is described that, starting from several bursts of a painting taken under different angles, permits <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> best possible result by eliminating highlights and motion blur by robust statistics, reducing noise by fusion, and compensating optical distortion in the registration process. This image fusion method is applicable to photographs of a painting taken with a hand-held camera without any particular setup. It works under bad lighting conditions and eliminates motion blur, even when the painting is protected by a glass screen creating structured reflections of the room. The careful discussion of {{each step of the}} processing chain also permits to review and discuss the efficiency of the image fusion tools recently proposed in the literature, and inserts several new ones in <b>the</b> chain. <b>Note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>readers.</b> Two online demos and their corresponding algorithmic description and code will soon be submitted to Image Processing on Lin...|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{information}} (publication): Troilus and Cressida has {{attained a}} degree of infamy amongst Shakespearean scholars due to the range of unanswered questions it raises. For example, it is unknown if the play was ever performed in Shakespeare's day. Q claims it had been acted by the King's Men at the Globe, but Q omits the reference to the King's Men and instead includes a note headed [...] "A neuer writer, to an euer reader. Newes," [...] which claims the play has never been staged. Apparently when Q was at press, the printers were informed that the play had not been performed and they therefore prepared a cancel title-page and the <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> which claims {{it is a sign}} {{of the quality of the}} play that it has never been publicly staged ("never staled with the stage, never clapper-clewed with the palms of the vulgar"). It is unknown however, which text is correct - Q or Q. E.A.J. Honigmann has suggested that the play was written early in 1601, but never acted because of fears it may have been seen as a political allegory sympathetic to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.|$|E

Taylor's prefatory <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is opaque: [...] To those who prefer quiet pictures of life to startling incidents, the attempt to illustrate the development of character to the mysteries of an elaborate plot, and the presentation {{of men and women in}} their mixed strength and weakness to the painting of wholly virtuous ideals and wholly evil examples: who are as interested in seeing moral and intellectual forces at work in a simple country community as on a more conspicuous place of human action: who believe in the truth and tenderness of man's love for man, as of man's love for woman: who recognize the trouble which confused ideals of life and the lack of high and intellect culture bring upon a great portion of our country population,-to all such, no explanation of this volume is necessary.

40|$|Abstract: According <b>to</b> stellar {{metamorphosis}} <b>the</b> {{gravitational collapse}} of any star {{towards the end}} of its life is a non-event, because of logic and of the contradicting nature of empirically observed reality. This has consequences as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nature of the real causes of supernova and the empirically observed life spans of real stars as opposed to theoretical models that mathematical physicists propose which have no basis in reality. It is understood by the author that gravity is not a fundamental force [1], gravitational accretion is a non-event [2] and the exact center of stars contain zero pressure. [3] According to Stellar Metamorphosis if the centers of stars contained the massive amounts of pressures that theoretical models and mathematical physicists propose, [4] then there is no way they can form iron cores during red dwarf metamorphosis [5] or even oceans similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth, Uranus and Neptune. [6][7][8] The pressure and heat would be too great for <b>the</b> iron/nickel plasma <b>to</b> crystallize and form a core, much less create any combination of elements into molecules throughout the interior of <b>the</b> star. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> politically entrenched dogma taught by mathematical physicists stars can not cool and shrink as they are independent entities that are undergoing fusion processes. [9] Therefore it is shown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> that <b>the</b> fusion/gravitational model for stars is contrary to stellar metamorphosis. If <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> or any institutional establishment chooses <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> fusion/gravitation model for stars then they will have an extremely difficult time explaining reality and will waste billions of dollars and decades of time trying to make it work because the universe does not operate according to math. [10] It is suggested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>to</b> base their reality on what is solid like granite and iron and not with math, which is based on airy mind fantasy. [11][12] It should also be <b>noted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> that gravitational collapse in itself {{is one of the most}} unfounded, ad hoc, unreasonable theories of the 20 th and 21 st century. [13] Without it, all theoretical models based on mathematical physics (fantasy) of stellar evolution fail, which is obvious <b>to</b> <b>the</b> author. Reference...|$|R
