40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} robust {{estimator}} of geometric quantities such as <b>normals,</b> <b>curvature</b> directions and sharp features for 3 D digital surfaces. This estimator only {{depends on the}} digitisation gridstep and is defined using a digital version of the Voronoi Covariance Measure, which exploits the robust geometric information contained in the Voronoi cells. It has been proved in [1] that the Voronoi Covariance Measure is resilient to Hausdorff noise. Our main theorem explicits {{the conditions under which}} this estimator is multigrid convergent for digital data. Moreover, we determine what are the parameters which maximise the convergence speed of this estimator, when the normal vector is sought. Numerical experiments show that the digital VCM estimator reliably estimates <b>normals,</b> <b>curvature</b> directions and sharp features of 3 D noisy digital shapes. ...|$|R
