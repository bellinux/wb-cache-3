40|$|We {{currently}} have little {{understanding of how}} birds know what nest to build and what little we do know has been gained largely from investigations of the completed structures (morphology of finished nests) or of material selection. Here {{we looked at the}} behaviours performed by male Southern Masked weaverbirds when building their nests. During the two earliest phases of construction individual males varied in the direction in which they carried and inserted grass into their developing nest, the speed at which they completed phases of nest construction and in the frequency with which they dropped grass during weaving. Behaviours performed during the initial attachment phase, when grass is being secured to a bare branch, were not repeatable within males, whereas during the subsequent "ring" phase behaviours tended to be repeatable. Some males were biased as to which side of the nest they inserted grass blades and strongly lateralized individuals completed phases of nest-building more quickly. The lack of repeatability of most <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviours</b> and the changes in those behaviours as males build more nests seems most readily explained by increasing dexterity.

Oestradiol valerate (5 mg/day) injections were given on Days 11 - 15 of the oestrous cycle to induce pseudopregnancy. A further series of injections of either oestradiol valerate (5 mg/day) or vehicle were given on days 44 - 46 of pseudopregnancy to reflect more closely the hormone profile seen in pregnancy. Nest-building was induced by a single intramuscular injection of 15 mg of PGF(2 alpha) (Lutalyse) on Day 47 of pseudopregnancy. The gilts were housed in pens (2. 8 X 1. 7 m) containing straw in experiment I or chronically confined in crates (0. 6 X 1. 7 m) that did not contain straw on days 44 - 48 of pseudopregnancy for experiment 2,. Oestrogen supplemented gilts had significantly higher concentrations of circulating 17 beta-oestradiol on day 47 of pseudopregnancy {{but there were no}} significant differences between treatments for circulating levels of prolactin, progesterone, cortisol or oxytocin, or for any behavioural measure in either experiment. These results indicate that there is no direct effect of supplementing already pseudopregnant gilts with oestradiol valerate on PGF(2 alpha) -induced nest-building. The results also show that the pre-partum environment has a pronounced effect on <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviours</b> and that non-pregnant pigs might be a useful model for pre-partum nest-building in this species.

40|$|Background: Parental {{allocation}} {{and reproductive}} success are often {{strongly influenced by}} environmental factors. In this respect, salinity is a key factor influencing species distributions and community structure in aquatic animals. Nevertheless, the effects of salinity on reproductive behaviours are not well known. Here, we used the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), a small fish inhabiting a range of different salinities, to experimentally assess the effects of changes in salinity on nesting behaviour, {{a key component of}} reproduction in sand gobies and many other taxa. Results: We found that salinity levels influenced some aspects of male nesting behaviour (i. e. nest entrance size) but not others (i. e. latency to build a nest, choice of nest site, sand on top of nest) and that small and large individuals were differently affected. In particular, the importance of body size in adjustment of nest entrance depended on the salinity level. Conclusion: The results support the prediction that geographically widespread aquatic species, such as sand gobies, are able to perform well under a range of salinity levels. The phenotype by environment interaction found between male size and behavioural responses to salinity can, in turn, help to explain the notable variation observed in <b>nest-building</b> (and other) <b>behaviours</b> closely linked to reproduction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{existing}} literature concerning environmental enrichment for suckling piglets and lactating sows and the effects on behaviour and mortality. Most research considering environmental enrichment still focuses on weaner, grower and finisher pigs. However the European Union Directive 2001 / 93 /EC states that all pigs should have access to a sufficient quantity of material to enable proper investigation and manipulation activities. Fortunately, research on environmental enrichment and alternative housing for piglets and sows is growing and results show important beneficial effects on welfare of both piglets and sows, by providing opportunities to engage in explorative <b>behaviour,</b> <b>nest-building</b> and social interactions and improving maternal responses. Social enrichment, increased space allowance and/or straw provide promising results on welfare but are not always practical to implicate and bring forth other potential risks and concerns. Therefore, it would also be interesting to further examine the potential of other types of enrichment, such as objects or sensory enrichment (e. g. pheromones), as possible applications and their effects on piglet and sow welfare. Other aspects which need more clarification are the relation between environmental enrichment during the farrowing period and weaning age and the relation between painful procedures, such as castration and tail docking, and environmental enrichment on the behaviour of piglets. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|<b>Nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> is an {{important}} part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour. Nest building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing. Nest building is divided into two phases: one of which is the initial phase of rooting and pawing the ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material. One type of animal that does nest building are sows. The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind, and which has well-drained soil. This nest building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation. The piglets need an increased environmental temperature otherwise they could die due to the cold. The nest will provide protection against weather and predators, while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away {{from the rest of the}} herd. This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing the milk from the sow (food resource). The nest building behaviour can be influenced by internal and external stimuli. Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour. The onset of nest building is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin. While the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature or udder comfort. Nest building ends when the sow gathers softer material and distributes throughout nest by nodding head movements and pawing with the front legs. The longer time spent on nest building will increase pre-partum oxytocin, allowing for higher piglet weight gain. Nest building is related to the increased litter size, a higher responsiveness to piglet distress, and lower mortality rate in piglets. Letting the sow perform the <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> can lead to better health and welfare for both the sow and piglet.|$|E
40|$|A {{surge of}} recent work elucidating {{a role for}} {{learning}} and memory in avian <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> has challenged the long-standing assumption that nest building develops under genetic control. Whereas that work has been addressed at describing the cognitive mechanisms underpinning <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour,</b> almost nothing is known about either the neurobiological processes controlling nest building or the selection pressures responsible for the diversity in avian <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Here, I sought to identify both the neural substrates involved in <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{and some of those}} selection pressures. First, I used expression of the immediate early gene product Fos, an indirect marker of neuronal activity, to identify brain regions activated during <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the brains of nest-building and control zebra finches (Taeniogypia guttata). I found that neural circuits involved in motor control, social behaviour, and reward were activated during nest building. Furthermore, I found that subpopulations of neurons that signal using the nonapeptides vasotocin and mesotocin and the neurotransmitter dopamine located within some of these neural circuits were also activated during nest building, suggesting these cell-signalling molecules may be involved in controlling <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Next, I found that variation in the amount of folding in the cerebellum, a brain structure thought to be involved in manipulative skills, increased with increasing nest structural complexity, suggesting that the cerebellum is also involved in nest building. Finally, using evolutionary statistical models, I found support for the hypothesis that nest-site competition off-ground and increased predation pressure on the ground in Old World babblers (Timaliidae) led to the co-evolution of building domed nests on the ground. Here, then, I provide the first evidence of potential neural substrates controlling and selection pressures contributing to variation in <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{and models}} maternal <b>nest-building</b> and parturition <b>behaviour</b> in cage-bred wild rabbits (oryctolagus cuniculus), {{and its influence}} on the kits pre-weaning mortality. In a total of 91 litters, perinatal mortality was 33 %; mortality during the nursing period was 16. 05 %, and therefore the accumulated mortality up to weaning was 43. 94 %. These mortality rates, higher than those described in the literature among domestic breeds, were linked to failures in maternal behaviour. Such failures included the non-introduction of straw into the nest box (41. 8 % of births), a lack of hair lining in the nest (28. 6 %), births in which one {{or all of the}} kits were born outside the nest box (18. 7 %), and births in which one or all of the kits were cannibalised by the doe (13. 2 %). Maternal behaviour in relation to the kits viability was modelled by performing multiple correspondence and cluster analyses with two dimensions and a 67. 2 % total inertia. The fi rst dimension (inertia: 0. 400) was represented by the presence of hair in the nest box; the place where the kits were born (inside or outside the nest box), and the does previous experience (primiparous or multiparous), while the total number of kits born represents the second dimension (inertia: 0. 272). Three maternal behaviour types were identified: types 1 and 3 representing births in which the failure of maternal behaviour at kindling led to high kit mortality. Maternal behaviour type 1 corresponds to primiparous does of parity orders 1 and 2 with a high number of total kits born and of stillborn kits. Type 3 births were characterised by all of the kits died during peripartum, with a high incidence of cannibalism. Type 2 included births of experienced does showing successful development of maternal behaviour, as well as high kits survival rates during the peripartum and nursing periods.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the behaviour in captivity of the dasyurid marsupial Phascogale tapoatafa. Each behaviour was initially described and defined in terms of its observed effect, whether on the animal itself, on a conspecific, on a prey species or on an object or structure. Locomotor, exploratory and grooming behaviour of solitary animals is described. Movements involved in prey catching are defined, and their sequential relationships in encounters with various prey are examined. Movements do not occur randomly, but are ordered on the basis of facilitation of one movement by another, and of feedback to the animal from the situation and the behaviour of the prey. Prey are not divisible into classes on the basis of the predator's responses to them. Data available for other dasyurids is compared. The adaptive value of prey-catching behaviour is discussed in terms of the ability of the prey to resist predation. The reproductive strategy is examined with both field and laboratory studies. P. tapoatafa exhibits a life-history strategy similar to that of Antechinus stuartii, in which all males die after first breeding. The adaptive value of this strategy is discussed in terms of reproductive effort and the predictability of the environment. <b>Nest-building</b> and copulatory <b>behaviour</b> are briefly described. The development of behaviour is described in terms of the acquisition by the young of sensory modalities and locomotor skills, and of the changing relationships amongst the litter-mates and between the mother and her offspring. The daily pattern of activity is described. On short nights, the animal may be active for most of the night. During winter, the night is divided into periods of activity and periods of inactivity. The survival value of this strategy is discussed in terms of feeding and energetics. Communication is described in terms of the sensory modalities used, the signals observed and the observed effect on other animals. P. tapoatafa shows a small range of auditory signals which may form a graded communication system. Olfactory marking by males is pronounced during the breeding season. Olfactory cues may signal physiological state and assist in individual recognition. Agonistic behaviour is briefly described in relation to dispersal of the animals for breeding...|$|R

40|$|Intramuscular {{injection}} of the naturally occurring prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) to sexually mature female pigs induces luteolysis and rapidly elicits a behavioural response consistent with pre-partum nest-building.

The effects of PGF(2 alpha), but not cloprostenol, on <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> may be mediated via peripheral PGF(2 alpha) receptors (FP) or via direct action on central FP receptors. We have previously shown FP receptor mRNA to be localized in porcine paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON) and pars dorso-medialis of the suproptic nucleus (SOD), suprachiasmatic nucleus, choroid plexus and anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes. In this experiment, we examined hypothalamic {{expression of the}} immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun mRNA after treatment with PGF(2 alpha) or cloprostenol. Twenty-one 8 -month-old nulliparous female pigs (gilts) were injected intramuscularly with a luteolytic dose of PGF(2 alpha) (15 mg), cloprostenol (175 mug) or saline control, their behaviour was recorded and they were killed 60 min later. Coronal hypothalamic sections and control ovarian tissues were incubated with 45 -mer oligonucleotide probes complementary to porcine c-fos and c-jun genes using standard in situ hybridization histochemistry techniques. Significantly higher c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was found in PGF(2 alpha) -treated compared to saline or cloprostenol-treated pigs in the PVN, SON and SOD. Significantly higher c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression was found in corpus lutea of PGF(2 alpha) and cloprostenol-treated pigs compared to saline controls. Treatment with PGF(2 alpha) induced <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> whereas treatment with cloprostenol and saline did not.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that restriction of pre-parturient behaviour in pigs is stress-inducing, characterised by an elevation in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in gilts. To determine whether pigs adapt to behavioural restriction, through modification of <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour,</b> we studied pre-parturient pigs in either farrowing crates (no bedding, n = 7) or straw-bedded pens (n = 7) {{in their first}} (gilts) and second (sows) parity. with physiological measurements being taken in the second parity. Observations and blood sampling were carried out during the preparturient phase. Crated pigs changed posture more often than penned pigs (F- 1,F- 12 = 7. 06, P < 0. 05), {{with the number of}} posture changes reducing across parities in both environments. The reduction in posture changing was more apparent in the crated sows which may indicate that attempted <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> of sows with prior experience of farrowing crates is less fragmented. The crated pigs spent a greater proportion of time sitting across both parities (F- 1,F- 12 = 9. 4, P < 0. 01), and spent less time manipulating available substrates (F- 1,F- 12 = 10. 67, P < 0. 05). There was a tendency for penned pigs to spend a greater proportion of time standing (F- 1,F- 12 = 3. 77, P = 0. 076) with peak nesting behaviour occurring earlier in relation to parturition than in crated pigs. In addition penned sows performed more floor-directed behaviour than penned gilts, and at an earlier stage in relation to parturition. However, crated sows also performed peak nest-building earlier than crated gilts. Plasma cortisol profiles indicated elevated HPA activity in crated sows during the pre-parturient period (F- 42,F- 303 = 1. 43, P < 0. 05) suggesting increased physiological stress, however, the difference between crated and penned sows was less than that previously seen in gilts. The increased range of pre-parturient behaviours seen in the penned sows suggests that experience may result in an 'improvement' in their nest-building behaviour: earlier preparation of the nest site and then subsequent manipulation of substrates. The crated sows appeared to show some behavioural adaptation to the crate environment; earlier peak in floor directed behaviour and total substrate directed behaviour, reduced posture changing. In conclusion the <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> of pigs is modified over parities with adaptation to the behavioural restrictions imposed by the farrowing crate. However, this adaptation, through prior experience, does not completely reduce the elevation in HPA activity previously reported in pre-parturient crated gilts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that pre-parturient primiparous pigs (gilts) housed in behaviourally restrictive farrowing crates without straw redirect their <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> to non-manipulable substrates such as the bars of the crate. These gilts also show elevated plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels, particularly around the peak of nest-building activity, when compared to gilts in larger pens that have been provided with a manipulable substrate (straw). It remains unclear whether these behavioural and physiological responses to crating result from the lack of a suitable nesting substrate or from the restricted space. This study investigated the effects of space (crate [C] versus pen [P]) and straw (straw [S] versus no straw [NS]) using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Thirty-four gilts were implanted with an indwelling jugular catheter at around 12 days before parturition. They were moved to one of the four environments five days before parturition, and blood sampling and recording of behaviour were carried out during the pre-parturient period. Penned gilts (P), irrespective of straw availability, spent more time standing and walking and performed more total substrate-directed behaviour than crated (C) gilts. When straw was not available to penned gilts, a large proportion of their substrate-directed behaviour was redirected to the floor. Space also had an effect on ACTH and cortisol levels across the entire pre-parturient phase, with C gilts having higher levels than (P) gilts irrespective of straw availability, but particularly so at the peak of nest-building activity. There was no effect of straw on ACTH or cortisol levels. Overall, it appears that increased space, perhaps through allowing locomotion, increases substrate-directed behaviour of pre-parturient gilts.

40|$|Successful mouse {{breeding}} is {{a crucial}} part of providing animals for research. However, loss of single pups or entire litters after birth is a relatively common problem. Determining how pups die is crucial for the understanding of mortality, but the scientific literature does not provide a clear picture of pup mortality and the reason why pups die is still poorly understood. The overall aim with this thesis was to investigate the causes of pup mortality in laboratory mice, focusing on maternal behaviour and the effect of housing environment. Specifically the aims were to investigate if litter loss was higher in primiparous females (study 1), if female mice actively killed their pups and if there were any differences in behaviour between females that lost the litter shortly after birth and females that successfully weaned their litters (study 2), and how the conditions for nest building influenced nest building and pup survival (study 3). In study 1 (paper I), breeding data from mice of the strains C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c were used. An effect of strain but no effect of parity on litter mortality was found. In study 2, C 57 BL/ 6 females were housed in four different treatments with different amounts of nesting material and cage furnishment. Behaviours of females whose litter died were observed in detail from birth of the litter until the litter died (paper II). No evidence that females actively killed their pups was found. In paper III, both females that lost their entire litter shortly after birth and females that successfully weaned their litter were observed from 24 h before to 24 h after parturition. Litter loss was associated with females showing less <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> before parturition, more parturition-related behaviours and more time outside the nest. In the last study (paper IV) females were housed in four treatments with different amount of nesting material and structure present or absent. Females given a larger amount of nesting material built more dome shaped nests of higher quality. In summary, this thesis does not support the assumption that female mice actively kill their offspring.

Because the nona-peptides, mesotocin and vasotocin and the neurotransmitter, dopamine, play important roles in avian social behaviour, we tested the hypothesis that mesotocinergic-vasotocinergic and dopami-nergic neuronal populations in the social behaviour network and dopaminergic reward system,respectively, are active during nest building. We combined immunohistochemistry for Fos (anindirect marker of neuronal activity) and vasotocin, mesotocin or tyrosine hydroxylase on brain tissue from nest-building and non-nest-building male and female zebra finches and compared Fos immunoreactivity in these neuronal populations with the variation in <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Fos immunoreactivity in all three types of neuronal populations increased with some aspect ofnest building: (i) higher immunoreactivity in a mesotocinergic neuronal population of nest-build-ing finches compared to controls; (ii) increased immunoreactivity in the vasotocinergic neuronalpopulations {{in relation to the}} amount of material picked up by nest-building males and the length of time that a male spent in the nest with his mate; and (iii) increased immunoreactivity in a dopaminergic neuronal population in relation to the length of time that a male nest-building finch spent in the nest with his mate. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a role of the mesotocinergic-vasotocinergic and dopaminergic systems in avian nest building. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the pre-farrowing behaviour of sows with access to space. In Chapter One I discuss the current knowledge of pre-farrowing behaviour in sows {{in relation to the}} concepts of motivation and animal welfare. Chapter Two investigated the expression of pre-farrowing behaviour in sows and gilts. The pigs were observed for four days prior to farrowing in a 6. 5 x 7 m test arena with a 2 x 2 m pen in one corner. There was an increase in locomotion within fifteen hours of farrowing, with the most active period occurring between eleven and four hours prior to farrowing. <b>Nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> occurred within nine hours of farrowing. There was no difference between sows and gilts in the expression of pre-farrowing behaviour, indicating that this behaviour is not modified by previous experience of farrowing. Factors affecting the choice of farrowing site were examined in Chapter Three. The sows preferred relatively enclosed farrowing sites, but the location of the feeder and drinker was also important. In Chapter Four, operant conditioning techniques were used to determine the value sows placed on access to space. Sows were required to lift a lever on a progressive ratio schedule to gain access to a larger space. The number of responses made during the restless period was greater than during the previous days. The operant requirement did not affect the expression of pre-farrowing restlessness. The function of pre-farrowing behaviour was investigated by allowing sows access to structured space in Chapter Five. Sows did not show an increase in locomotion prior to farrowing as in previous experiments. If sows are seeking isolation prior to farrowing, the structured space may be sufficient to represent this. Alternatively the increased locomotion needed to monitor the more complex space {{in the days before the}} restless period may have obscured the pre-farrowing increase in locomotion. Sows were provided with straw in two experiments in Chapter Six. When straw was placed on the floor of the small pen in the first experiment, the sows did not show an increase in locomotion prior to farrowing. However, in the second experiment, straw was provided in a hopper in the test arena, and the sows walked further in the day prior to farrowing. The provision of straw reduced the amount of <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> directed at pen fixtures. Chapter Seven investigated the effect of exogenous administration of oestradiol benzoate on the locomotory behaviour of the sow. Sows in mid-pregnancy did not respond to oestradiol, but ovariectomized sows showed an increase in locomotion. It is concluded that it is likely that oestrogen is responsible for prefarrowing restlessness, but the concentration of progesterone must fall to allow oestrogen to act. The effect of breed, parity and experimental regime on prefarrowing behaviour was analysed with data from all of the farrowing sows in Chapter Eight. The temporal pattern of nestbuilding actions, and the effect of access to space on farrowing duration and incidence of stillbirth was also examined. Finally, I discuss the conclusions drawn from the study and offer suggestions for further research. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Nests {{are built}} by {{a wide variety of}} animals as {{functional}} receptacles for developing eggs and offspring, and they {{play a critical role in}} the reproductive biology of many species. Traditionally, research on the ecology and evolution of nest building and construction behaviour has focused primarily on birds, and avian studies have dominated the literature. However, as researchers working on non-bird models have realised the importance of nest construction in evolutionary ecology, the number of studies published on the nesting behaviour of nonbird taxa has increased. An analysis of the literature reveals that fish have become major models for studying many aspects of nest building behaviour, but whereas studies of fish nest building behaviour frequently cite classical and contemporary bird studies, the findings of recent fish nesting research appears to be slower to be recognised by bird biologists. Further analysis reveals that this citation bias may arise because of the tendency of nest building studies to be published in taxon-specific, often local journals, and this may be especially the case for bird-focused studies. In this review, I summarise the recent literature on fish nesting behaviour, focusing on aspects that should be of mutual interest to fish and bird biologists. I hope that the review may be used by bird biologists to identify complementary and insightful nest-building research in fish, and that researchers with interests in the <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> of animals across the taxonomic spectrum might use the review to focus on questions of mutual and general importance and interest.

40|$|Pigs {{in organic}} {{production}} are {{in most cases}} of the same genetic material as in conventional production. These animals are bred for high production in conventional production environments. The question therefore arises: Are these animals suitable for organic production? We investigated sow behaviour, piglet production and GxE interactions for performance traits of pigs in commercial organic and conventional herds and in SLU’s Research herd. When sows farrowed outdoors in huts they started their nest-building activities earlier in relation to farrowing start and performed a higher frequency of <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour,</b> than they did when they farrowed indoors in pens. Farrowing duration was shorter and still-birth frequency was lower when sows farrowed in huts rather than in pens. When sows and their piglets were group-housed outdoors during lactation, the sows’ and piglets’ natural weaning process was already well advanced when the herdsman separated sows and piglets. This weaning process was influenced by sow’s body condition {{and the number of}} nursing piglets. Piglet mortality was higher in the organic compared with the conventional environment. High levels of piglet mortality reduce piglet welfare why efforts to reduce piglet mortality are required. Oestrus during lactation occurred among group-housed sows in organic herds but not among single-housed sows in conventional herds. Lactational oestrus was more common in fatter sows. Herdsmen in both organic and conventional herds praised sows with good nursing behaviour, weaning large and heavy litters with low piglet mortality. We found weak GxE interactions for growth rate and carcass leanness in organic and conventional pig production environments indicating that with regard to these traits, an organic breeding index based on the existing conventional breeding evaluation would be feasible...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{that use}} {{materials}} to build nest structures {{have long since}} fascinated biologists and engineers alike. Avian nests are generally composed of collected materials brought together into a cup-like structure in which the bird sits to incubate eggs and, in many cases, it is where chicks are reared. Hence, the materials in a nest can be presumed to be loaded in compression, but relatively few studies have investigated the mechanical role of the nest elements and their position within the structure. However, recent studies on avian and primate nests have used engineering tests to quantify the structural properties of the nest elements to provide insight into how animals arrange the materials they collect and their mechanical role within the nest. In two studies, we deconstructed nests from Common Blackbirds (Turdus merula) and Bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) into their component parts. We then used three-point bending tests to investigate regional variation in the structural properties of these elements within the nest. Results indicate that the birds use materials with different physical characteristics {{in various parts of}} the nest, thereby providing an indirect indication of <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> in these species. We also used a novel cutting test, previously developed to measure the mechanical anisotropy of keratin, to investigate the mechanical behaviour of the mud-cup structure found in Common Blackbird and Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) nests. This allowed us to determine whether these species utilise and arrange mineralised materials in a particular way to improve the toughness of their nests. The applicability of similar and other mechanical testing methods are discussed in relation to future investigations of the architecture and function of songbird nests...|$|E
40|$|Do the {{two parents}} at a nest make {{simultaneous}} decisions whether {{to care for}} their offspring or to desert? If a single parent is sufficient for rearing young, one parent (typically, the male) may desert and reproduce with a new mate within the same breeding season, leaving the other parent with the brunt of care. As each parent is expected to maximize its own reproductive success, the interests of the two parents do not necessarily coincide, and a sexual conflict over care may emerge. Here we investigate the process of clutch desertion in a small passerine bird, the Penduline Tit Remiz pendulinus. Among birds, this species has a remarkably variable breeding system, because a single parent (either the male or the female) may provide the full care of the young, whereas about 30 % of clutches are abandoned by both parents. First, we show that biparental desertion occurs within a single day in 73. 7 % of the clutches (n = 14), whereas desertion decisions are sequential in 26. 3 % of the clutches (n = 5) (male first: 10. 5 % (n = 2); female first: 15. 8 % (n = 3); n = 19 clutches in total). Secondly, we observed the behaviour of both parents before desertion, and investigated whether desertion can be predicted from their behaviour. However, neither singing nor <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> predicted whether the male or the female would desert. We therefore suggest that biparental desertion may be simultaneous by male and female in our population of Penduline Tits. Furthermore, the parents do not appear to signal their intention to desert their mate. We argue that the parents' interest may be actually to disguise their intention to desert...|$|E
40|$|Domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, build a {{maternal}} nest on the {{day before}} parturition. A model for nest building has been established in pigs, in which exogenously administered prostaglandin (PG) F- 2 alpha. may be used to elicit nesting behaviour in cyclic, pseudopregnant and pregnant pigs. The central mechanisms mediating this response are unknown. The present study determined regional brain activity using semi-quantitative analysis of c-fos mRNA, after induction of <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> by PGF(2 alpha) in Large White pseudopregnant pigs. Oestradiol valerate injections (5 mg/day) were given on days 11 - 15 of the oestrous cycle to induce pseudopregnancy. The pigs were housed individually in pens (2. 8 x 1. 7 m) containing straw. On the test day (day 46 or 47 of pseudopregnancy) animals were injected with 3 ml saline (n= 5) or 15 mg of PGF(2 alpha) (Lutalyse, Upjohn; n= 6) intramuscularly. Pigs treated with PGF(2 alpha), but not saline, displayed bouts of rooting, pawing and gathering straw, which we interpret as nest building behaviour. The pigs were killed 65 min after treatment, which was 30 min after peak nest building activity, and the brain, uterus and ovaries removed for processing using in situ hybridisation. Saline-treated pigs had elevated levels of c-fos mRNA, compared to background, in the pituitary, corpus luteum and uterus, and a lower, but elevated, level of expression in cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. PGF(2 alpha) -treated pigs had significantly higher levels of c-fos mRNA expression than saline-treated pigs in the parvocellular and magnocellular regions of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus (including the pars dorso-medial is), the neural lobe of the pituitary gland and the cerebellum. PGF(2 alpha) -treated pigs also had significantly higher c-fos induction in corpus luteum. These data show that the pattern of c-fos mRNA expression in specific brain areas is different between pigs that show PGF(2 alpha) -induced nest building and saline-injected controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Since 1999, {{scientists}} have published evidence of transplacental infection by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) and reproductive failure in pigs. Affected herds have frequently been start-up herds, either naïve {{or with a}} high proportion of PCV 2 susceptible gilts. Here, delayed farrowing in non-vaccinated gilts was observed in a commercial specific pathogen free (SPF) herd. Mummified fetuses and stillborn piglets recovered from these gilts were PCV 2 positive. Case presentation The case herd was a self-recruiting, piglet producing unit of 240 sows. After detecting livestock associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA, CC 398), stamping out was imposed by the authorities. An SPF herd was re-established and all dams were vaccinated against PCV 2 until the farmer decided to exclude this vaccine. The first non-vaccinated batch consisted of 76 % gilts. Here, one gilt showed signs of impending farrowing. This gilt was slaughtered three to four weeks after the expected farrowing date without having expelled any uterine contents. In the subsequent batch consisting of 79 % gilts, three gilts showed similar clinical signs. Delayed farrowing was observed in two of these gilts and the uterine contents from the third gilt were recovered at the abattoir. Mummified fetuses and stillborn piglets were recovered from all three gilts. High levels of PCV 2 DNA (> 107 viral genomic copies/ 500  ng tissue) were found in myocardial samples by real-time PCR analysis. One myocardial sample submitted for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed moderate amounts of PCV 2 antigen. In the subsequent batch consisting of 77 % gilts, several weak-born piglets were seen across different litters. Conclusions This case report describes an apparent link between in utero PCV 2 infection, pre partum <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour,</b> mammary development and delayed farrowing. To date, no reports have described imminent signs of farrowing and delayed farrowing as clinical signs in conjunction with transplacental PCV 2 infection in Norway. Reinitiation of PCV 2 vaccination was strongly advised in this herd due to recent depopulation and repopulation and the high proportion of gilts. Vaccination was effective because no further cases have occurred since...|$|E
40|$|According to EU-regulations, sows {{should be}} {{provided}} with suitable manipulable material, this {{in order to meet}} their behavioural needs. "Strategic use of straw at farrowing" means that loose housed sows are provided with 15 - 20 kg of chopped straw once at 2 days prior to the calculated date of farrowing. This gives them increased access to nesting material and creates a more suitable environment with an improved micro-climate and increased comfort during farrowing and early lactation, compared to a limited use of straw. After farrowing, the straw is left to gradually drain through the slatted floor and is then replaced by a daily supply of 0. 5 – 1 kg straw in accordance with common Swedish management routines. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate if strategic use of straw at farrowing is technically feasible and to investigate its effect on behaviour, health and production in farrowing sows and suckling piglets by studying the sow's <b>nest-building</b> <b>behaviour</b> and farrowing duration, the prevalence of bruising, piglet weight gain and pre-weaning mortality. Two studies were conducted in six conventional piglet-producing farms in South-West Sweden. Study I shows that it is technically possible to achieve an efficient throughput of straw and to maintain good pen hygiene in partly slatted farrowing pens for loose housed sows. However, straw chop lengths need to be adjusted to the type and design of the slatted pen floor. Study II shows that strategic use of straw made sows spend more time nest-building pre-partum and less time during the first hour after birth of the first piglet, compared to limited straw access. The sows also gave birth to fewer stillborn piglets. In piglets, strategic use of straw reduced the development of skin abrasions and soft heel/sole erosions. It also increased the average daily weight gain and mean body weight at weaning. Under the conditions studied, the overall pre-weaning mortality was not affected; however, the distribution of post-mortem findings differed, with fewer piglets dying due to starvation and more due to crushing. In summary, this thesis provides knowledge about housing around farrowing and its interaction with biological and behavioural mechanisms of importance for sow welfare and piglet survival and health. ...|$|E
