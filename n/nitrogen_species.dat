25|$|The {{reactive}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species</b> arise {{once the}} {{reactive oxygen species}} destroy the mitochondria. This leads {{to the formation of}} the reactive <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species,</b> which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of reactive <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species,</b> due to the reaction between superoxides and nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with reactive oxygen species to form peroxynitrite. In cases of chronic arsenic exposure, the nitric oxide levels are depleted, due to the superoxide reactions. The enzyme NO synthase (NOS) uses L-arginine to form nitric oxide, but this enzyme is inhibited by monomethylated arsenic (III) compounds.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{can also}} exert {{neurotoxicity}} through lipid peroxidation, {{as a result}} of its pro-oxidant properties. Quinolinic acid can interact with Fe(II) to form a complex that induces a reactive oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species</b> (ROS/RNS), notably the hydroxyl radical •OH. This free radical causes oxidative stress by further increasing glutamate release and inhibiting its reuptake, and results in the breakdown of DNA in addition to lipid peroxidation.|$|E

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and have a critical role in host defense against invading microorganisms. Activated microglia secrete cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species</b> are secreted by activated microglia.|$|E
25|$|This {{antioxidant}} is {{a direct}} scavenger of radical oxygen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species</b> including OH•, O•2−, and NO•. Melatonin works with other antioxidants to improve the overall effectiveness of each antioxidant. Melatonin has been proven to be twice as active as vitamin E, {{believed to be the}} most effective lipophilic antioxidant. An important characteristic of melatonin that distinguishes it from other classic radical scavengers is that its metabolites are also scavengers in what {{is referred to as the}} cascade reaction. Also different from other classic antioxidants, such as vitamin C and vitamin E, melatonin has amphiphilic properties. When compared to synthetic, mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants (MitoQ and MitoE), melatonin proved to be a comparable protector against mitochondrial oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{can cause}} {{oxidative}} stress through {{the formation of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive <b>nitrogen</b> <b>species</b> (RNS). Reactive oxygen species are produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, synthesizing a superoxide, which is a reactive free radical. This superoxide can react to form hydrogen peroxide and a reactive oxygen species. The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more reactive oxygen species {{in the presence of}} arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The reactive oxygen species are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which reactive oxygen species cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins.|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide {{has emerged}} as one of the most {{important}} and diverse players in physiology. This small diatomic radical stunned researchers because of its existence and unique biological properties in human physiology. Over the last two decades it was found that NO often has fickle behavior in pathophysiological mechanisms. Where benefiting the host in one case yet inducing and augmenting injury in another. This has lead to confusion in is NO good or bad? Much of the answers to this dichotomy lies in the chemistry of NO and its related <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>species.</b> To help understand the complex chemistry with perspective to biology, a discussion on the chemical biology of NO is useful. The chemical biology defines the relevant chemical reaction of NO and nitrogen monoxide in the context of the biological conditions. We discuss in this article the chemistry of nitrogen oxide with different types of biological motifs. Reaction of NO with metal complexes and radicals require low concentration, where formation of reactive <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>species</b> require considerably higher amounts and generally are isolated to specific microenvironments in vivo. Though many reactive <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>species</b> are formed from chemical reactions with NO, there are several which appear to not require NO to be present, HNO and NO 2.

40|$|Many {{cellular}} {{functions in}} physiology are {{regulated by the}} direct interaction of NO with target biomolecules. In many pathophysiologic and toxicologic mechanisms, NO first reacts with oxygen, superoxide or other nitrogen oxides to subsequently elicit indirect effects. The balance between nitrosative stress and oxidative stress within a specific biological compartment can determine whether the presence of NO will be ultimately deleterious or beneficial. Nitrosative stress can be defined primarily through reactions mediated by N 2 O 3, a reactive <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>species</b> generated by high fluxes of NO in an aerobic environment. In contrast, oxidative stress is mediated primarily by superoxide and peroxides. In addition to reactive oxygen <b>species,</b> several reactive <b>nitrogen</b> oxide <b>species</b> such as peroxynitrite, nitroxyl, and nitrogen dioxide can also impose oxidative stress to a cell.

40|$|Ph. D. (Chemistry) Abstract: Interstellar {{chemistry}} {{is one of}} the areas of research which is constantly growing in the field of astrochemistry. With the advent of the Herschel Space Observatory, a new window has opened up in the field of spectroscopic researches related to space chemistry or interstellar chemistry. It has enabled the detection of many imortant molecules, especially many nitrogen containg molecules like, NH, NH 2 and NH 3, even in the cold envelopes of protostars. Observations of many new <b>nitrogen</b> containing <b>species</b> and some of the already detected <b>nitrogen</b> containing <b>species</b> in extreme cold temperatures, have brought many new constraints in the field of interstellar research. In particular, such a situation gives the opportunity to revisit the study to the chemistry of nitrogen in the interstellar medium, as the knowledge of <b>nitrogen</b> bearing <b>species</b> in interstellar medium is exceptionally important, as they can act as precursors for the formation of many pre-biotic molecules. On the other hand nitrogen has a peculiar chemistry that completely differs from those of carbon and oxygen, and also at the same time nitrogenated species are used as suitable probes for understaning the chemistry of the interstellar medium over a wide range of conditions. For the active nitrogen chemistry to get materialized in the interstellar medium, one needs to have a very large elemental nitrogen partitioning. Elemental nitrogen partitioning largely affects the active nitrogen chemistry in the ISM. One of the major components in the elemental nitrogen partitioning is the molecular form of nitrogen N 2, which is largely unreactive due to the strong triple bond (large bond dissociation energy). On the other side the second component which constitutes the more labile forms of nitrogen (combinations of [...] ...|$|R

Outcrops of ultramafic rock, the origin of nickel ore, cover 1 / 3 of the Grand Terre (main island) and possess a highly diverse flora (1800 species of phanerogams of which 1150 species are endemic to these outcrops). Nickel mine revegetation practices in New Caledonia are based on three methods. Site rehabilitation is carried out by either artificialy improving substrate conditions, hence favouring exotic species, or by implanting several gregarious <b>nitrogen</b> fixing <b>species</b> (#Casuarinaceae$, #Leguminoseae$), or by establishing a variety of endemic ultramafic colonisers (#Cyperaceae$, #Myrtaceae$, #Proteaceae$ [...] .). These three methods differ {{in their ability to}} both restore the biological conditions of the site and reconstitute its original biodiversity. Studies of the natural and secondary vegetation show the possible effects vegetation composition have on restoring the fertility of the underlying soil. Preliminary results indicate that endemic ultramafic species are slow growing due to the poor nutrient status of the substrate. Many of the species accumulate different plant nutrients. Combining these ultramafic colonizers with <b>nitrogen</b> fixing <b>species</b> may increase the growth and eventual establishment of a diverse endemic flora. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
