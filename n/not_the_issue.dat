At one point, moderator S.E. Cupp asked whether President Obama was anti-Israel, McCotter answered, [...] "Obama's motivations are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> the impact of his policies, both proposed and pursued, have strained our relationship" [...] with Israel. When asked {{to comment on the}} U.S. role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya, McCotter referred to the Obama administration's mission as [...] "ill-defined," [...] and argued for [...] "no US boots on ground."

500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{challenges}} to the Horse Protection Act on the grounds of constitutionality, mainly regarding due process and equal protection, none of which were successful. [...] Courts have also ruled on other issues with regard to the act, including whether knowledge of soring or intent to sore is required in order to prove a violation of the act, and courts have repeatedly held that it is <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> of digital palpation, one of the main methods used by inspectors to find and verify soreness, has been contested in several courts, and is the only issue that has had courts come to varying conclusions on its legitimacy. The majority of courts with appeals rising to the Circuit Court level, have held that palpation is a legitimate method for identifying soreness, and that soreness found through palpation is grounds for penalties under the Horse Protection Act. However, in a decision promulgated by the Fifth Circuit Court, it was found that soreness found through digital palpation alone was not sufficient evidence upon which to base penalties.|$|E
500|$|The ICTY indicted Croatian {{officers}} Janko Bobetko, Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac, {{for crimes}} committed during Operation Medak Pocket, but that case was also transferred to Croatian courts. Norac {{was found guilty}} and jailed for 7 years; Ademi was acquitted. Bobetko was declared unfit to stand trial due to poor health. The ICTY's indictment against General Ante Gotovina cited at least 150 Serb civilians killed {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Storm. The Croatian Helsinki Committee registered 677 Serb civilians killed in the operation. Louise Arbour, a prosecutor of the ICTY, stated that the legality and legitimacy of the Operation itself was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> but that the ICTY was required to investigate whether crimes were committed during the campaign. The Trial Chamber reiterated that the legality of Operation Storm is [...] "irrelevant" [...] for the case at hand, since the ICTY's remit is processing war crimes. In 2011, Gotovina was sentenced to 24 and Markač to 18 years in prison. In 2012, their convictions were overturned and both were immediately released. Čermak was acquitted of all charges.|$|E

2500|$|Because of its ambiguity, the novella {{has been}} read {{by some as}} racist and pro-slavery and by others as anti-racist and abolitionist.

2500|$|Another {{prominent}} area is Amberes Street, home to Mexico City’s gay community. [...] Homosexuality on {{this street}} {{and the rest of}} Zona Rosa is fairly open with hand holding and kissing among same-sex couples. [...] During Gay Pride, the nightclubs, discothèques and bars of Zona Rosa fill with members of the LGBT community starting at midday.

The parade marches along Paseo de la Reforma from Puerta de los Leones to the Glorieta de la Palma, with the entire stretch completely closed to traffic for the event. The city have even participated offering free AIDS tests to attendees. However, not all residents and business owners are happy with the area’s gay reputation. Some business owners complain that open displays of affection drives away tourists and other visitors. [...] While male and female prostitution exists in Zona Rosa, there have been complaints of the prostitution of minors, despite efforts since the 1990s to eradicate it. However, some in the gay community state that the prostitution of minors is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> that neighbors say it is, rather, the problem some have {{is that there is a}} gay community here.|$|E

He would then commence his purchases, paying for each article separately, as he got it. He would not trust any one to add up the bill and pay it all at once.

6000|$|The {{words were}} hardly {{out of his}} mouth when his voice was silenced for ever. With one prodigious heave of his whole {{physical}} force, Israel smote him over the taffrail into the sea, as if the man had fallen backwards over a teetering chair. By this time the two officers were hurrying aft. Ere meeting them midway, Israel, quick as lightning, cast off the two principal halyards, thus letting the large sails all in a tumble of canvass to the deck. Next moment one of the officers was at the helm, to prevent the cutter from capsizing by being without a steersman in such an emergency. The other officer and Israel interlocked. The battle {{was in the midst of}} the chaos of blowing canvass. Caught in a rent of the sail, the officer slipped and fell near the sharp iron edge of the hatchway. As he fell he caught Israel by the most terrible part in which mortality can be grappled. Insane with pain, Israel dashed his adversary's skull against the sharp iron. The officer's hold relaxed, but himself stiffened. Israel made for the helmsman, who as yet knew <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the late tussle. He caught him round the loins, bedding his fingers like grisly claws into his flesh, and hugging him to his heart. The man's ghost, caught like a broken cork in a gurgling bottle's neck, gasped with the embrace. Loosening him suddenly, Israel hurled him from him against the bulwarks. That instant another report was heard, followed by the savage hail--"You down sail at last, do ye? I'm a good mind to sink ye for your scurvy trick. Pull down that dirty rag there, astern!" ...|$|E
