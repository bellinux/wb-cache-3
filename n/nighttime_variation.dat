The application of this technique is illustrated using data from two nights in March 1971. The gross <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> shows reasonable similarity to the Jacchia [1970] model, and also follows the time variation of the measured exospheric temperature. However, on both nights {{there is evidence of}} a postmidnight enhancement of the O 2 /N 2 density ratio associated with a rapid decrease in the height of the F layer...|$|E
40|$|Variations in {{the carbon}} isotope {{signature}} of leaf dark-respired CO 2 (δ 13 CR) {{within a single}} night is a widely observed phenomenon. However, {{it is unclear whether}} there are plant func-tional type differences with regard to the amplitude of the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> in δ 13 CR. These differences, if present, would be important for interpreting the short-term variations in the stable carbon signature of ecosystem respiration and the partitioning of carbon fluxes. To assess the plant functional type differences relating to the magnitude of the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> in δ 13 CR and the respiratory apparent fractionation, we measured the δ 13 CR, the leaf gas exchange, and the δ 13 C of the respiratory substrates of 22 species present in the agricultural-pastoral zone of the Songnen Plain, northeast China. The species studied were grouped into C 3 and C 4 plants, trees, grasses, and herbs. A significant nocturnal shift in δ 13 CR was detected in 20 of the studied species, with the magnitude of the shift ranging from 1 ‰ to 5. 8 ‰. The magnitude of the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> in δ 13 CR was strongly correlate...|$|E

These occultation data {{have been used to}} determine the ozone number density profile at the occultation tangent point. The nighttime ozone number density profile has a bulge in its vertical profile with a peak of 1 to 3 × 10 8 cm − 3 at approximately 83 km and a minimum near 75 km. The ozone number density at high altitudes varies by as much as a factor of 4, but does not show any clear seasonal variation or <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation.</b> The retrieved ozone number density profiles define a data envelope that is compared with other nighttime observations of the ozone number density profile and also the results of theoretical models...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain the}} {{profiles}} of dry bulb and wet bulb temperature, specific humidity, q, and air density, ρ, to {{a height of}} 200 meters above the ground, a precise lightweight thermocouple psychrometer was designed. To lift the thermocouple psychrometer and the attached wires in obtaining the ρq profiles, a rigid polyethylene balloon augmented with 5. 5 -feet outdoor or 100 -g meteorological balloons were used. Using the height dependent eddy exchange coefficient and a one-dimensional time-dependent profile model, the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> of ρq {{as a function of}} height were predicted and compared with observed values. It was found that the general shape of the eddy exchange coefficient, K(Z), was approximately the same as found in recent literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of the equatorial midnight pressure on the nighttime zonal winds in the altitude range 300 - 400 km. The analysis is based on zonal momentum balance of measured quantities at the specified altitude combined with the <b>nighttime</b> average-pressure <b>variations</b> given by the Atmosphere Explorer-E (AE-E) satellite and the ion density given by the model of Chiu (1975). It is found that the <b>nighttime</b> pressure <b>variation</b> obtained from temperatures and densities measured on AE-E is consistent with the observed variations in the zonal wind and that the zonal wind decay time due to ion drag and viscosity reasonably accounts for the observed decay in velocity leading to the midnight minimum...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{photosynthetic}} pathway {{differences exist}} in the amplitude of <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> in the carbon isotope composition of leaf dark-respired CO 2 (δ 13 Cl) and respiratory apparent isotope fractionation relative to biomass (ΔR,biomass) in response to drought stress is unclear. These differences, if present, would be important for the partitioning of C 3 -C 4 mixed ecosystem C fluxes. We measured δ 13 Cl, the δ 13 C of biomass and of potential respiratory substrates and leaf gas exchange in one C 3 (Leymus chinensis) and two C 4 (Chloris virgata and Hemarthria altissima) grasses during a manipulated drought period. For all studied grasses, δ 13 Cl decreased from 21 : 00 to 03 : 00 h. The magnitude of the nighttime shift in δ 13 Cl decreased with increasing drought stress. The δ 13 Cl values were correlated with the δ 13 C of respiratory substrates, whereas {{the magnitude of the}} nighttime shift in δ 13 Cl strongly depended on the daytime carbon assimilation rate and the range of <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> in the respiratory substrate content. The ΔR,biomass in the C 3 and C 4 grasses varied in opposite directions with the intensification of the drought stress. The contribution of C 4 plant-associated carbon flux is likely to be overestimated if carbon isotope signatures are used for the partitioning of ecosystem carbon exchange and the δ 13 C of biomass is used as a substitute for leaf dark-respired CO 2. The detected drought sensitivities in δ 13 Cl and differences in respiratory apparent isotope fractionation between C 3 and C 4 grasses have marked implications for isotope partitioning studies at the ecosystem level...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, small {{enhancements}} in the VTEC {{values are}} {{observed in the}} <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> of VTEC nearly between 1800 and 2000 UT (2100 and 2300 LT), especially for days considered from equinoctial months and then drops again (mostly after 2300 UT). According to Galav et al. (2010), {{this may be due}} to the pre-reversal enhancement which is attributed to variation of the vertical F region drifts which are large and upward during 18 to 20 LT over the equator. The F region plasma is raised further up under the influence of the enhanced vertical drift at the equator during the equinoxes. This can delay the decay time of the plasma which results in high-level background density during the equinoctial months. As depicted in the lower panel of Figures  2 and 5, this event is the most pronounced on most of the days considered from equinoctial months during the high solar activity phase in the time interval of 1800 to 2000 UT (2100 to 2300 LT). Nonetheless, during the low solar activity period, the pre-reversal enhancement drifts are much smaller to affect any nighttime density enhancement at low latitude through the described process. This is clearly observed for days considered from the solstice months, especially in the June solstice months (see Figures  2, 3, and 4).|$|E

Hydroxyl (OH) radical was also measured by a Chemical Ionization Mass-Spectrometer (Berresheim et al., 2003). These datasets represent the first simultaneous measurements of OH and NO 3 radicals in the area. NO 3 radical concentrations ranged from less than 3 x 10 7 up to 9 x 10 8 radicals· cm - 3 with an average nighttime value of 1. 1 x 10 8 radicals· cm - 3. The observed NO 3 mixing ratios are analyzed {{on the basis of}} the corresponding meteorological data and the volatile organic compound (VOC) observations which were measured simultaneously at Finokalia station. The importance of the NO 3 radical chemistry relatively to that of OH in the dimethylsulfide (DMS) and nitrate cycles is also investigated. The observed NO 3 levels regulate the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> of DMS. The loss of DMS by NO 3 during night is about 75 % of that by OH radical during day.

40|$|To date, {{studies of}} the carbon and {{nutrient}} cycling in tropical montane forests have been restricted to a few, mostly neotropical, sites. This thesis investigated the carbon and nutrient cycling of early (ES) and late (LS) successional forest stands in Nyungwe forest, one of Africa’s largest remaining tropical montane forests. The stocks and fluxes of carbon and nutrients, {{as well as the}} factors controlling these, were studied in 15 new forest plots established within this PhD project. Paper I explored forest carbon dynamics and demonstrated that Afromontane tropical forests contain large amounts of carbon, with the carbon stocks of LS stands being higher than those reported for tropical montane LS forests in South Asia and Central and South America. The total C stock was 35 % higher in LS compared to ES stands due to significantly larger aboveground biomass (AGB), but productivity did not differ between the two successional stages. Differences in species composition and stem properties (wood density, height:diameter relationship) explained the differences in AGB between ES and LS forest stands. Paper II investigated canopy nutrient cycling. It was found that neither leaf nutrient concentrations (exception: K) nor nutrient resorption efficiencies during senescence differed between ES and LS species. Furthermore, total leaf litterfall and its content of C, N, P and K did not differ between ES and LS stands. Mean resorption efficiencies of N (37 %), P (48 %) and K (46 %) were much higher than for other nutrients. Nutrient resorption efficiency exhibited a very large interspecific variation which was not related to the leaf concentration of the respective element. High leaf N concentrations, intermediate N:P ratios, and low resorption efficiencies compared to values reported for other TMF together indicate high fertility and likely co-limitation by N and P in this forest. Paper III showed that interspecific variation in photosynthetic capacity among tropical montane trees was related to within-leaf N allocation rather than to total area-based leaf N content. While ES species had higher photosynthetic capacity (+ 58 to + 67 %), dark respiration (+ 41 %) and photosynthetic quantum yield (+ 38 %) than late-successional species, the two groups did not significantly differ in total leaf N content, chlorophyll content or leaf mass per unit area. Paper IV investigated the spatial and temporal variation in soil CO 2 efflux and found that the daytime variation correlated with soil temperature while the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variation</b> did not. Spatial variation in soil CO 2 efflux was strongly related to soil carbon and nitrogen content. The results demonstrate that Nyungwe montane rainforest contains large amounts of carbon (especially in LS stands) and have high productivity. The thesis also shows that accounting for the effects of forest disturbance on stand structure, especially species composition, substantially improves the estimations of carbon stocks. Furthermore, it contributes to the understanding of these forests by elucidating which factors that control tree growth, photosynthetic capacity and soil CO 2 efflux. The findings of this thesis contribute to reducing a large knowledge gap regarding the carbon and nutrient stocks and dynamics of African tropical montane forests at different successional stages...|$|E
40|$|Some {{possible}} {{physical processes}} are analysed that cause, under {{the condition of}} additional ionisation in a pre-breakdown electric field, emissions in the infrared (IR) interval. The atmospheric transparency region of the IR spectrum at wavelengths of 7 – 15 μm is taken into account. This transparency region corresponds to spectral lines of small atmospheric constituents like CH 4 , CO 2 , N 2 O, NO 2 , NO, and O 3 . The possible intensities of the IR emissions observable in laboratories and in nature are estimated. The acceleration process of the electrons in the pre-breakdown electrical field before its adhesion to the molecules is analyzed. For daytime conditions, modifications of the adsorption spectra of the scattered solar emissions are studied; for <b>nighttime,</b> <b>variations</b> of emission spectra {{may be used for}} the analysis...|$|R
40|$|Absolute {{intensity}} {{measurements of}} the (8, 6) OH band obtained during 10 flights of the December 1969 NASA Auroral Airborne Expedition are presented. Nightglow intensities higher {{by a factor of}} 2 than the usual values are recorded during flights 8, 14, and 15. The OH variations are compared with the evolution of the green line and O 2 (1 Delta g) emissions measured by other experimenters on board the aircraft. Before sunrise the twilight variations of OH down to a solar depression angle of 5 deg show a rapid decrease. A theoretical prediction of the OH, O I 5577 A, and O 2 (1 Delta g) emissions is evaluated by means of an extensive time-dependent oxygen-hydrogen model of the 25 - to 150 -km region. Twilight decrease of the OH emission is interpreted in terms of mesospheric ozone photodissociation. <b>Nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> of the emissions may be reproduced if modifications of the dynamic regime are introduced into the model...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} a response of the thermospheric neutral winds to the auroral activity, we developed a Fabry-Perot Doppler Imaging System (FPDIS) which measures Doppler shifts and widths of aurora and/or airglow emission lines of OI 557. 7 nm and OI 630. 0 nm over a wide field of view (165 °) to obtain twodimensional patterns of winds and temperatures in the E-and F-regions. We carried out the FPDIS observations at Syowa Station (69. 00 °S, 39. 58 °E), Antarctica over 57 nights covering the various auroral conditions in 1994. In this paper, we discuss the following results obtained from our observations : (1) We found that <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> in the thermospheric neutral winds depend on geomagnetic activity. Magnetically southward winds during geomagnetically active periods were stronger than during quiet periods, and {{the difference in the}} wind velocities was largest around midnight. This difference is supposed to be associated with auroral energy injection and the relative location between the auroral oval and Syowa Station. (2) Periodic enhancements in meridional winds, which were classified into middle-scale atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs), were observed on the night of 3 - 4 June 1994 during geomagnetically active periods. These wind enhancements appeared to be generated in the auroral oval which remained at a few hundred kilometers north of Syowa Station...|$|R

30|$|The {{existence}} of hot oxygen (hot O, Oh) {{in the upper}} thermosphere is mainly confirmed by optical observations of high-altitude airglow. In the experiments described here, a peak of Oh population was found {{at an altitude of}} approximately 550 km with a temperature of about 4000 K. Although it was shown that Oh concentration could reach a value of 1 – 2 % with respect to ambient (cold) O, a realistic global distribution of Oh concentration and temperature has not been established. The presence of non-thermal atoms in the thermosphere leads to variations in the thermo-dynamical regime in the upper atmosphere. The major chemical processes involved in Oh production were taken into account in the time-dependent, Global Self-consistent Model of Thermosphere, Ionosphere and Protonosphere (GSM TIP) of the Earth in order to simulate global distribution of Oh concentration and temperature (Th). Calculations were carried out in the geomagnetic coordinate system for moderate solar, quiet geomagnetic conditions, and winter season. It was shown that the maximum Oh is located at − 60 ° latitude, 300 ° longitude, and 24 UT. The Th maximum is about 2050 K. This temperature and Oh concentration cause an increase in neutral gas temperature at high thermosphere by ∼ 100 K during daytime and by ∼ 70 K during <b>nighttime.</b> <b>Variations</b> in the neutral gas velocity circulation were calculated. The maximum increase in neutral velocity was about 36 m/s, corresponding to Φ = 50 °, Λ = 180 ° in the northern and Φ = − 50 °, Λ = 270 ° in the southern hemisphere.|$|R

Results from the airglow imagers at Syowa (69 °S, 40 °E), Halley (76 °S, 27 °W), Davis (69 °S, 78 °E) and McMurdo (78 °S, 167 °E) were compared, using a new statistical analysis method based on 3 -D Fourier transform [Matsuda et al., 2014] for the observation period between 7 April and 21 May 2013. Significant day-to-day and site-to-site differences were found. The averaged phase velocity spectrum during the observation period showed preferential westward direction at Syowa, McMurdo and Halley, but no preferential direction at Davis. Gravity wave energy estimated by I’/I was ~ 5 times larger at Davis and Syowa than at McMurdo and Halley. We also compared the phase velocity spectrum at Syowa and Davis with the background wind field {{and found that the}} directionality only over Syowa could be explained by critical level filtering of the waves. This suggests that the eastward propagating gravity waves over Davis could have been generated above the polar night jet. Comparison of <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> of the phase velocity spectra with background wind measurements suggested that the effect of critical level filtering could not explain the temporal variation of gravity wave directionality well, and other reasons such as variation of wave sources should be taken into account. Directionality was determined to be dependent on the gravity wave periods...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} diurnal and {{seasonal}} variations in {{total electron content}} (TEC) over Nigeria has been prompted by the recent {{increase in the number}} of GPS continuously operating reference stations (CORSs) across Nigeria as well as the reduced costs of microcomputing. The GPS data engaged in this study were recorded in the year 2012 at nine stations in Nigeria located between geomagnetic latitudes – 4. 33 and 0. 72 ° N. The GPS data were used to derive GPS TEC, which was analysed for diurnal and seasonal variations. The results obtained were used to produce local GPS TEC maps and bar charts. The derived GPS TEC across all the stations demonstrates consistent minimum diurnal variations during the pre-sunrise hours 04 : 00 to 06 : 00  LT, increases with sharp gradient during the sunrise period (∼[*] 07 : 00 to 09 : 00  LT), attains postnoon maximum at about 14 : 00  LT, and then falls to a minimum just before sunset. Generally, daytime variations are found to be greater than <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations,</b> which range between 0 and 5  TECU. The seasonal variation depicts a semi-annual distribution with higher values (∼[*] 25 – 30  TECU) around equinoxes and lower values (∼[*] 20 – 25  TECU) around solstices. The December Solstice magnitude is slightly higher than the June Solstice magnitude at all stations, while March Equinox magnitude is also slightly higher than September Equinox magnitude at all stations. Thus, the seasonal variation shows an asymmetry in equinoxes and solstices, with the month of October displaying the highest values of GPS TEC across the latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Nocturnal {{sleepiness}} is {{a common}} complaint suffered by night-shift workers, especially in conditions of an abrupt shift of the wake–sleep cycle. Alertness management strategies can minimize the adverse effects of sleep loss and circadian rhythm desynchronization and promote optimal vigilance in operational settings. Within these strategies, one possibility is to use short periods of “prophylactic sleep” (before long periods of work), which can be facilitated by hypnotics. Vigilance can be evaluated by means of several tests which, sometimes, imply procedures and devices not easily employable in operational settings. In such conditions pencil and paper tests of vigilance can be very useful {{in the assessment of}} attentional performance degradation due to sleep loss and/or inversion of the sleep–wake cycle. In this study we evaluated the sensitivity of a three-Letter Cancellation Task (3 -LCT) in revealing <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> of vigilance in a laboratory simulation of acute night shift, after a diurnal sleep with placebo (PLC) or temazepam (TMZ). Nocturnal levels of vigilance were also assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). All tests were administered four times at 2 -h intervals during nighttime after a daytime sleep. Results show that the 3 -LCT is sensitive to variations of vigilance occurring during a laboratory simulation of acute night shift. We also found some effects of TMZ, which in the first nocturnal session caused a slowing down of visuoattentive performance. Nocturnal variations of vigilance detected through the 3 -LCT were similar to those revealed by means of MSLT, while the ability to maintain wakefulness was substantially spared during the night...|$|R
30|$|The second {{phenomenon}} {{associated with}} space weather effects is geomagnetic storms, {{which is a}} temporary disturbance in the Earth’s magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field which interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field. It is also well known that like solar flares, magnetic storms are accompanied by ionospheric disturbances which can occur up to the D and E regions (e.g., Antonova et al. 1996). Communication and navigation systems such as VLF, LF, and GPS can be significantly affected by ionospheric perturbations associated with the auroral electrojet and high-energy particle precipitation during high geomagnetic activity and can extend to the mid-latitudes (Inan et al. 1985). However, much of {{the focus of the}} impact of geomagnetic storms on the ionosphere has been at high latitudes (e.g., Kikuchi and Evans 1983). Using the phase data of NWC signal received at Uji, Japan, a low-mid latitude path, Araki (1974) found that the phase decreased in the nighttime in association with the main phase of two large geomagnetic storms during 1968 to 1969. Kleimenova et al. (2004) analyzed the NWC signal received at Kamchatka, a low-mid latitude path, and found distinct anomalies in the amplitude and phase. They obtained negative phase and amplitude variations of the VLF signal both during day and nighttimes during the main storm phase days, but the <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> were more pronounced. There have not been other studies on magnetic storm associated subionospheric changes purely at low latitude paths; however, there have been several studies on VLF perturbations due to storm-induced energetic electron precipitation at mid and high latitudes (e.g., Peter et al. 2006; Clilverd et al. 2010).|$|R

Baseline age was 71 ± 3 yrs. The number of CVHR events was also normalized to time in bed (CVHR Index). CVHR Index did not change across recordings, but males had higher values (p= 0. 009). Mean HR increase during CVHR was similar in the first 3 recording but declined on the last (p< 0. 02). CVHR duration increased, but CHS 1 vs. CHS 2 and SHHS 1 vs. SHHS 2 were NS (rest, p< 0. 007).

40|$|Abstract: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{has traditionally been}} considered an inexorably progressive disease, associated with a constant increase of symptoms that occur as the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) worsens, only intermittently interrupted by exacerbations. However, this paradigm has been challenged in recent decades by the available evidence. Recent studies {{have pointed out that}} COPD-related symptoms are not consistently perceived by patients in the same way, showing not only seasonal variation, but also changes in symptom perception during a week or even within a single day. According to the available data, patients experience the biggest increase in respiratory symptoms during the first hours of the early morning, followed by the <b>nighttime.</b> This <b>variation</b> over time is of considerable importance, since it impacts on daily life activities and health-related quality of life, as measured by a recently developed ad hoc questionnaire. Additionally, recent clinical trials have suggested that the use of rapid-onset long-acting bronchodilators may have an impact on morning symptoms, despite their current use as maintenance treatment for a determined period.

40|$|Four rocket {{observations}} of the NO γ(1, 0) 2148 Å band airglow and ground {{observations of}} the NI 5200 Å emission in the auroral zone are presented. A radiometer was developed to measure the NO γ(1, 0) band airglow in the mesosphere and thermosphere. It can extract the γ(1, 0) band airglow from intense background radiations by making use of a self-absorbing gas cell. NO density profiles were deduced from the γ(1, 0) band emission rates measured at Uchinoura (31 °N), Thumba (9 °N) and Syowa Station (69 °S). The NO densities in the thermosphere obtained at middle and low latitudes are found to vary with solar activity. In view of a considerable temperature dependence of the production rate of NO in the thermosphere, the variation {{may be attributed to}} change in thermospheric temperature, which is closely related to solar activity. Change in the solar extreme ultraviolet radiation flux may also be responsible for the variation. The NO density in the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere obtained in the auroral zone is found to be larger than those obtained at middle and low latitudes under the conditions of similar solar activity. Because of a long life time of NO in the altitude region, the observed enhancement {{may be due to the}} after-effect of a particle precipitation event which occurred within a day before in despite of no polar disturbance during the flight. The emission rate of the NI 5200 Å doublet in the aurora was measured with a tilting-filter photometer at Syowa Station from March to September 1977. The N_ 2 ^+ 1 NG(0, 1) 4278 Å band emission was measured simultaneously with the 5200 Å emission for comparison. Examining <b>nighttime</b> <b>variations</b> of the emissions obtained in thirteen clear and moonless nights, the 5200 Å emission is found to be one of the common spectral features of the aurora. A simple model calculation is performed to investigate the excitation mechanism for the 5200 Å emission in the aurora, and dissociative recombination of NO^+ is found to be insufficient to explain the observations. Alternatively, impact dissociation and excitation of N_ 2 by auroral electrons may be the major excitation process. The ratio of measured 5200 Å emission rate to the 4278 Å emission rate decreases as the 4278 Å emission rate increases. This tendency may be qualitatively explained by the combined effect due to the highly forbidden nature of the 5200 Å emission and the characteristics of the precipitating particles in that their mean energy generally increases with their total energy...|$|R

In this study, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration, one of the most typical areas experiencing drastic urbanization in China, was selected to study the SUHI intensity (SUHII) based on remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data. Pure and unchanged urban and rural pixels from 2000 to 2010 were chosen to avoid non-concurrency between land cover data and LST data and to estimate daytime and nighttime thermal effects of urbanization. Different patterns of the seasonal variations were found in daytime and nighttime SUHIIs. Specifically, the daytime SUHII in summer (4 °C) was more evident than in other seasons while a cold island phenomenon was found in winter; the nighttime SUHII was always positive and higher than the daytime one in all the seasons except summer. Moreover, we found the highest daytime SUHII in August, which is the growing peak stage of summer maize, while nighttime SUHII showed a trough in the same month. Seasonal variations of daytime SUHII showed higher significant correlations with the seasonal variations of ∆LAI (leaf area index) (R 2 = 0. 81, r = − 0. 90) compared with ∆albedo (R 2 = 0. 61, r = − 0. 78) and background daytime LST (R 2 = 0. 69, r = 0. 83); moreover, agricultural practices (double-cropping system) {{played an important role in}} the seasonal variations of daytime SUHII.

The adjusted equations were evaluated for every hour throughout the day and the results showed good fits for most of the day, except near dawn and sunset, followed by <b>nighttime.</b> The seasonal <b>variation</b> was studied by comparing the dry period against the rainy period in the dataset. The least square linear regressions resulted in coefficients equal to the coefficients found for the complete period, both in the dry period and in the rainy period. It is expected that the best fit equation to the observed data for this site be used to produce estimates in other regions of the State of So Paulo, where such information is not available.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a workplace-based intervention on actigraphic and self-reported sleep outcomes in an extended care setting. DesignCluster randomized trial. SettingExtended-care (nursing) facilities. ParticipantsUS employees and managers at nursing homes. Nursing homes were randomly selected to intervention or control settings. InterventionThe Work, Family and Health Study developed an intervention aimed at reducing work-family conflict within a 4 -month work-family organizational change process. Employees participated in interactive sessions with facilitated discussions, role-playing, and games designed to increase control over work processes and work time. Managers completed training in family-supportive supervision. MeasurementsPrimary actigraphic outcomes included: total sleep duration, wake after sleep onset, <b>nighttime</b> sleep, <b>variation</b> in <b>nighttime</b> sleep, nap duration, and number of naps. Secondary survey outcomes included work-to-family conflict, sleep insufficiency, insomnia symptoms and sleep quality. Measures were obtained at baseline, 6 -months and 12 -months post-intervention. ResultsA total of 1, 522 employees and 184 managers provided survey data at baseline. Managers and employees in the intervention arm showed no significant difference in sleep outcomes over time compared to control participants. Sleep outcomes were not moderated by work-to-family conflict or presence of children in the household for managers or employees. Age significantly moderated an intervention effect on nighttime sleep among employees (p= 0. 040), where younger employees benefited more from the intervention. ConclusionIn the context of an extended-care nursing home workplace, the intervention did not significantly alter sleep outcomes in either managers or employees. Moderating effects of age were identified where younger employees 2 ̆ 019 sleep outcomes benefited more from the intervention.

40|$|Measurements from {{a network}} of digisondes and an {{incoherent}} scatter radar In Eastern North American For January 6 - 12, 1997 have been compared with the Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) model which now includes the effects of electric field convective. With the exception of Bermuda, the model reproduces the daytime electron density very well most of the time. As is typical behavior for winter solar minimum on magnetically undisturbed nights, the measurements at Millstone Hill show high electron temperatures before midnight followed by a rapid decay, which {{is accompanied by a}} pronounced density enhancement in the early morning hours. The FLIP model reproduces the nighttime density enhancement well, provided the model is constrained to follow the topside electron temperature and the flux tube is full. Similar density enhancements are seen at Goose Bay, Wallops Island and Bermuda. However, the peak height variation and auroral images indicate the density enhancements at Goose Bay are most likely due to particle precipitation. Contrary to previously published work we find that the <b>nighttime</b> density <b>variation</b> at Millstone Hill is driven by the temperature behavior and not the other way around. Thus, in both the data and model, the overall nighttime density is lowered and the enhancement does not occur if the temperature remains high all night. Our calculations show that convections of plasma from higher magnetic latitudes does not cause the observed density maximum but it may enhance the density maximum if over-full flux tubes are convected over the station. On the other had, convection of flux tubes with high temperatures and depleted densities may prevent the density maximum from occurring. Despite the success in modeling the nighttime density enhancements, there remain two unresolved problems. First, the measured density decays much faster than the modeled density near sunset at Millstone Hill and Goose Bay though not at lower latitude stations. Second, we cannot fully explain the large temperatures before midnight nor the sudden decay near midnight...|$|R

However, this paradigm has been challenged in recent decades by the available evidence. Recent studies {{have pointed out that}} COPD-related symptoms are not consistently perceived by patients in the same way, showing not only seasonal variation, but also changes in symptom perception during a week or even within a single day. According to the available data, patients experience the biggest increase in respiratory symptoms during the first hours of the early morning, followed by the <b>nighttime.</b> This <b>variation</b> over time is of considerable importance, since it impacts on daily life activities and health-related quality of life, as measured by a recently developed ad hoc questionnaire. Additionally, recent clinical trials have suggested that the use of rapid-onset long-acting bronchodilators may have an impact on morning symptoms, despite their current use as maintenance treatment for a determined period. Although this hypothesis is to be validated in future long-term clinical trials comparing fast-onset versus slow-onset inhaled drugs in COPD, it may bring forward a new concept of long-term bronchodilator therapy. At the present time, the two available long-acting, fast-onset bronchodilators used in the treatment of COPD are formoterol and the recently marketed indacaterol. Newer drugs have also been shown to have a rapid onset of action in preclinical studies. Health care professionals caring for COPD patients should consider this variation in the perception of symptoms during their clinical interview as a potential new target in the long-term treatment plan.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between cloud cover and near-surface air temperature and its decadal changes are examined using the hourly synoptic {{data for the}} past four to six decades from five regions of the Northern Hemisphere: Canada, the United States, the former Soviet Union, China, and tropical islands of the western Pacific. The authors define the normalized cloud cover–surface air temperature relationship, NOCET or dT/dCL, as a temperature anomaly with a unit (one-tenth) deviation of total cloud cover from its average value. Then mean monthly NOCET time series (night- and daytime, separately) are area-averaged and parameterized as functions of surface air humidity and snow cover. The day- and <b>nighttime</b> NOCET <b>variations</b> are strongly anticorrelated with changes in surface humidity. Furthermore, the daytime NOCET changes are positively correlated to changes in snow cover extent. The regionally averaged nighttime NOCET varies from 20. 05 K tenth 21 in the wet Tropics to 1. 0 K tenth 21 at midlatitudes in winter. The daytime regional NOCET ranges from 20. 4 K tenth 21 in the Tropics to 0. 7 K tenth 21 at midlatitudes in winter. The authors found a general strengthening of a daytime surface cooling during the post–World War II period associated with cloud cover over the United States and China, but a minor reduction of this cooling in higher latitudes. Furthermore, since the 1970 s, a prominent increase in atmospheric humidity has significantly weakened the effectiveness of the surface warming (best seen at nighttime) associated with cloud cover. The authors apportion the spatiotemporal field of interactions between total cloud cover and surface air temperature into a bivariate relationship (described by two equations, one for daytime and one for nighttime) with surface air humidity and snow cover and two constant factors. These factors are invariant in space and time domains. It is speculated that they may represent empirical estimates of the overall cloud cover effect on the surface air temperature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{analyzed}} several {{records of}} mean volume backscattering strength (S-v) derived from 150 kHz acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCPs) moored along the equator in upwelling mesotrophic conditions {{and in the}} warm pool oligotrophic ecosystem of the Pacific Ocean. The ADCPs allow for gathering long time-series of non-intrusive information about zooplankton and micronekton at the same spatial and temporal scales as physical observations. High S-v are found from the surface {{to the middle of}} the thermocline between dusk and dawn in the mesotrophic regime. Biological and physical influences modified this classical diel cycle. In oligotrophic conditions observed at 170 degrees W and 140 degrees W during El Nino years, a subsurface S-v maximum characterized <b>nighttime</b> S-v profiles. <b>Variations</b> of the thermocline depth correlated with variations of the base of the high S-v layer and the subsurface maximum closely tracked the thermocline depth from intraseasonal to interannual time-scales. A recurring deepening (20 - 60 m) of the high S-v layer was observed at a frequency close to the lunar cycle frequency. At 165 degrees E, high day-to-day variations prevailed and our results suggest the influence of moderately mesotrophic waters that would be advected from the western warm pool during westerly wind events. A review of the literature suggests that S-v variations may result from changes in biomass and species assemblages among which myctophids and euphausiids would be the most likely scatterers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{observed}} {{behavior of the}} (F 2) layer of the ionosphere at Millstone Hill and Hobart with calculations from the field line interhemispheric plasma (FLIP) model for solar maximum, solstice conditions in 1990. During the study period the daily F(sub 10. 7) index varied {{by more than a}} factor of 2 (123 to 280), but the 81 -day mean F(sub 10. 7) (F(sub 10. 7 A)) was almost constant near 190. Calculations were performed with and without the effects of vibrationally excited N 2 (N(sup *) (sub 2) which affects the loss rate of atomic oxygen ions. In the case without N(sup *) (sub 2) there is generally good agreement between the model and measurement for the daytime, peak density of the F region (NmF 2). Both the model and the measurement show a strong seasonal anomaly with the winter noon densities a factor of 3 to 4 greater than the summer noon densities at Millstone Hill and a factor of 2 greater at Hobart. The seasonal anomaly in the model is caused by changes in the neutral composition as given by the mass spectrometer and incoherent scatter (MSIS) 86 neutral density model. There is generally little or no increase in the observed noon NmF 2 as a function of daily F(sub 10. 7) except at Millstone Hill in winter. In contrast to the generally good agreement between model and data at noon, the model badly underestimates the density at night at Millstone Hill at all seasons. At Hobart the model reproduces the <b>nighttime</b> density <b>variations</b> well in both winter and summer. The international reference ionosphere (IRI) model generally provides a good representation of the average behavior of noon NmF 2 and hmF 2 but because the data show a lot of day-to-day variability, there are often large differences. The FLIP model is able to reproduce this variability when hmF 2 is specified. The IRI model peak densities are better than the FLIP densities at night, but the IRI model does not represent the Millstone Hill summer data very well at night in 1990...|$|R
40|$|During stable <b>nighttime</b> periods, large <b>variations</b> in {{temperature}} and visibility often occur over short distances in regions of only moderate topography. These are of great practical significance and yet pose major forecasting challenges {{because of a}} lack of detailed understanding of the processes involved and because crucial topographic variations are often not resolved in current forecast models. This paper describes a field and numerical modeling campaign, Cold-Air Pooling Experiment (COLPEX), which addresses many of the issues. The observational campaign was run for 15 months in Shropshire, United Kingdom, in a region of small hills and valleys with typical ridge–valley heights of 75 – 150 m and valley widths of 1 – 3 km. The instrumentation consisted of three sites with instrumented flux towers, a Doppler lidar, and a network of 30 simpler meteorological stations. Further instrumentation was deployed during intensive observation periods including radiosonde launches from two sites, a cloud droplet probe, aerosol monitoring equipment, and an instrumented car. Some initial results from the observations are presented illustrating the range of conditions encountered. The modeling phase of COLPEX includes use of the Met Office Unified Model at 100 -m resolution, and some brief results for a simulation of an intensive observation period are presented showing the model capturing a cold-pool event. As well as aiding interpretation of the observations, results from this study are expected to inform the design of future generations of operational forecasting system...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the nighttime horizontal neutral winds {{in the middle}} atmosphere (~ 87 and ~ 98 km) and thermosphere (~ 250 km) derived from a Fabry–Perot interferometer (FPI), which was installed at Xinglong station (40. 2 ° N, 117. 4 ° E) in central China. The wind data covered the period from April 2010 to July 2012. We studied the annual, semiannual and terannual variations of the midnight winds at ~ 87 km, ~ 98 km and ~ 250 km {{for the first time}} and compared them with Horizontal Wind Model 2007 (HWM 07). Our results show the following: (1) at ~ 87 km, both the observed and model zonal winds have similar phases in the annual and semiannual variations. However, the HWM 07 amplitudes are much larger. (2) At ~ 98 km, the model shows strong eastward wind in the summer solstice, resulting in a large annual variation, while the observed strongest component is semiannual. The observation and model midnight meridional winds agree well. Both are equatorward throughout the year and have small amplitudes in the annual and semiannual variations. (3) There are large discrepancies between the observed and HWM 07 winds at ~ 250 km. This discrepancy is largely due to the strong semiannual zonal wind in the model and the phase difference in the annual variation of the meridional wind. The FPI annual variation coincides with the results from Arecibo, which has similar geomagnetic latitude as Xinglong station. In General, the consistency of FPI winds with model winds is better at ~ 87 and ~ 98 km than that at ~ 250 km. We also studied the seasonally and monthly averaged nighttime winds. The most salient features include the following: (1) the seasonally averaged zonal winds at ~ 87 and ~ 98 km typically have small variations throughout the night. (2) The model zonal and meridional <b>nighttime</b> wind <b>variations</b> are typically much larger than those of observations at ~ 87 km and ~ 98 km. (3) At ~ 250 km, model zonal wind compares well with the observation in the winter. For spring and autumn, the model wind is more eastward before ~ 03 : 00 LT but more westward after. The observed nighttime zonal and meridional winds on average are close to zero in the summer and autumn, which indicates a lack of strong stable tides. The consistency of FPI zonal wind with model wind at ~ 250 km is better than the meridional wind...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} the TIME-GCM-CCM 3 thermosphere–ionosphere–lower atmosphere flux-coupled model, and investigates how well the model simulates known F 2 -layer day/night and seasonal behaviour and patterns of day-to-day variability at seven ionosonde stations. Of the many possible contributors to F 2 -layer variability, the present work includes only the influence of ‘meteorological’ disturbances transmitted from lower levels in the atmosphere, solar and geomagnetic conditions being held at constant levels throughout a model year. In comparison to ionosonde data, TIME-GCM-CCM 3 models the peak electron density (NmF 2) quite well, except for overemphasizing the daytime summer/winter anomaly in both hemispheres and seriously underestimating night NmF 2 in summer. The peak height hmF 2 is satisfactorily modelled by day, except that the model does not reproduce its observed semiannual <b>variation.</b> <b>Nighttime</b> values of hmF 2 are much too low, thus causing low model values of night NmF 2. Comparison of the variations of NmF 2 and the neutral [O/N 2] ratio supports the idea that both annual and semiannual variations of F 2 -layer electron density are largely caused by changes of neutral composition, which in turn are driven by the global thermospheric circulation. Finally, the paper describes and discusses {{the characteristics of the}} F 2 -layer response to the imposed ‘meteorological’ disturbances. The ionospheric response is evaluated as the standard deviations of five ionospheric parameters for each station within 11 -day blocks of data. At any one station, the patterns of variability show some coherence between different parameters, such as peak electron density and the neutral atomic/molecular ratio. Coherence between stations is found only between the closest pairs, some 2500 km apart, which is presumably related to the scale size of the ‘meteorological’ disturbances. The F 2 -layer day-to-day variability appears to be related more to variations in winds than to variations of thermospheric composition...|$|R
40|$|GPS-derived TEC {{measurements}} (GPSTEC) {{represent the}} electron content up to 20, 000 km, while a new ionosonde technique estimates the ionospheric electron content (ITEC) from ground ionosondes {{from the bottom}} of the ionosphere through the peak up to 1000 km. The two independent techniques were applied to determine ITEC and GPSTEC for Athens (38 °N, 23. 5 °E) using the vertical Digisonde observations at Athens and GPSTEC maps produced by DLR/IKN for Europe using GPS measurements. Comparison of the two quantities over a 12 -month time period shows a general agreement at daytime and a systematic deviation of ITEC towards lower values during <b>nighttime.</b> The diurnal <b>variation</b> of their residual values (ÄTEC) exhibits a morning minimum and an evening maximum, which can be explained in terms of ionospheric-plasmaspheric ionization exchange. The prominent evening enhancement, observed in all seasons around 1800  2000 LT, is attributed to the plasmaspheric bulge. The application of the superposed epoch analysis method on the daily ÄTEC values for several geomagnetic storms showed a rapid decrease of ÄTEC just after the storm initiation and a consecutive increase over a time period of 9 days, a behavior that is consistent with the plasmaspheric depletion and successive replenishment following storm activity. The daily variation of the ionospheric slab thickness is compatible with the variation of the thermospheric temperature within a day. Concerning the total slab thickness, this behavior is altered by the nighttime increase, which is most prominent in winter, and it is due to the lowering of the O+/H+ transition height. In summary, this analysis presents additional proof that the residuals ÄTEC = GPSTEC ITEC provide information about the qualitative characteristics of the plasmaspheric dynamics as deduced from their diurnal behavior and their variation during geomagnetic storms...|$|R
