Scott Niedermayer retired as a player following the season, and the Ducks named Getzlaf his successor as team captain prior to the 2010–11 season. Ducks' head coach Randy Carlyle described {{the promotion of the}} 25-year-old in terms of Getzlaf's maturation as an NHL player. He added, [...] "We felt that with it being his sixth season in the League, <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the transition and the veteran players agreed with us." [...] During the season, he suffered multiple nasal sinus fractures after being struck in the face by a puck, and consequently appeared in only 67 games; he recorded 19 goals. Getzlaf's 57 assists ranked fourth in the NHL and he added six points in six post-season contests, including his 50th career playoff point.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2006, The Asylum—a {{production}} company founded in 1997—has specialized in low-budget pictures also {{inspired by the}} big-budget films that have largely usurped the B movie's place in the theatrical market. The company makes what one critic dubbed [...] "mockbusters", straight-to-video knockoffs of major studio action pictures: Transformers, for instance, is transformed into The Asylum's Transmorphers.

2500|$|In 1784, when Penniman was 24, she {{was living}} {{with her mother and}} step-father, Mr. Wall, in Westminster. He was {{probably}} attempting to recover some of the lost possessions of the family. But Brush’s vast acres had been sequestered to the state; even his library and furniture had been scattered. Gen. Ethan Allen, who had frequent occasion to visit Westminster, fell a victim to Penniman's charms. Gen. Allen was at this time a widower of 47, with three or four children. On February 16th, Gen. Allen entered Margaret’s apartment, and found Penniman in a morning gown, standing on a chair, arranging china on the shelves of a china-closet. After a few words of greeting, he said to her, “Fanny, if we are ever to be married, <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>for</b> I am on my way to Arlington." [...] “Very well,” she replied, “if you will give me time to get my josie.” In a very short time she was ready, and together they entered the breakfast-room where a group of judges were sitting. Chief-Justice Robinson was asked by Allen to perform the ceremony. To Robinson’s astonished question “When?” the answer was “Now.” The judge suggested that {{it was a matter of}} importance which required due consideration, to which Allen replied, implying that with such a bride long consideration was unnecessary. The ceremony was performed, interrupted at one point by Allen, who when called upon to promise “agreeable to the law of God,” exclaimed after a glance out the window, [...] "The law of God as written in the Book of Nature? Yes, go on." [...] The ceremony concluded, the bride’s trunk and guitar-case were placed in the sleigh and they left for their home in Arlington.|$|E
