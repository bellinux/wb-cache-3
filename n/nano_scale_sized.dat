Design/methodology/approach: The present study reports selected properties obtained by reinforcing Al 2 O 3 with 15 wt% ZrO 2 (partially stabilized with Y 2 O 3 -Y 5) and, non-stabilized zirconia. Specimens were prepared based on submicro- and nano-scale trade powders. Vickers hardness (HV 1), wear resistance and fracture toughness (KIC) at room and elevated temperatures characteristic for tool work were evaluated. Microstructure was observed {{by means of a}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Preliminary industrial cutting tests in the turning of higher-quality carbon steel C 45 grade were carried out. Findings: The addition of nanopowders does not result in a significant improvement in fracture toughness at room temperature. A reduction in fracture toughness of KIC(ET) by approximately 20 % is observed at elevated temperature (1073 K) for the specimen only with submicro powders in comparison to that at room temperature. Addition of the powder mixture in submicron and <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> <b>size</b> reveals the minor reduction of fracture toughness (up to 10 %) at elevated temperature.

40|$|Machining is an {{important}} excess-metal removal process in manufacturing. In spite of the considerable effort on metal cutting research, the mechanics of this process at a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> are not fully understood. Hence metal cutting research is a challenging field and is currently attracting the attention of workers {{in the field of}} plasticity of metals as well as those concerned with the more immediate problems in practice. <b>Nano</b> <b>scale</b> grooves such as nano channels and nano slots have many applications in semiconductor and biomedical industries, which are growing to meet the increasing demands of nano technology. Whenever nanomachining is performed to produce a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> groove on a metal surface, abrasive wear occurs. The ultimate aim of the analysis of the mechanics of metal machining at a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> is to understand the basic phenomena, to predict how the materials deforms, which mechanism is dominant and what machining parameters (depth of cut, machining velocity) are required for a given material and for a given machining condition to produce a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> groove. In this research, nanomachining was utilized to investigate the abrasive wear mechanism that produces a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> groove on metal surfaces. Two different tools (Berkovich and Conical) with the same tip radius of 100 nm but of different edge geometries were used to machine both polycrystalline materials and single crystal materials with a nano indenter equipped with a nano scratching attachment. During the machining operations, the generated normal and cutting forces were measured as a function of <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> machining parameters. It was found that the generated forces (normal and cutting) increased with an increase in depth of cut; however, there was no significant effect on the generated forces due to the variation in machining velocities. In <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> machining, the percentage of elastic recovery revealed that the deformation mechanisms were identified as elastoplastic in nature as opposed to the well-established completely plastic mode of traditional machining operations. The pile up volume due to elastoplastic deformation was utilized to distinguish between the ploughing and the cutting modes of abrasive wear mechanism. The percentage values of these two mechanisms were determined and utilized to obtain the dominant mode of an abrasive wear mechanism for producing a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> groove and to correlate this abrasive wear mechanism with the co-efficient of friction (µ) in different machining conditions. As a result of machining operations, the machined surface retains residual stress and strain. The type of residual stress, whether tensile or compressive, depends on the used machining parameters. It is however difficult to measure residual stress and strain at a <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> machining level.

40|$|International audienceThe osteocyte system {{located within}} the lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) is playing {{a key role in}} the mechanobiology of bone. Synchrotron Radiation (SR) micro-CT was {{recently}} used in a number of studies to characterize osteocyte lacunae. Nevertheless, few works are reporting three-dimensional properties of both osteocyte lacunae and canaliculi. Here, we show that SR nano-CT can be used either for a global assessment of the LCN in entire osteons or a detailed analysis around a few cells. We used SR parallel-beam micro-CT at beamline ID 19 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) to image the LCN [1]. With a nominal voxel size of 280 nm, this technique provides images of the LCN within a cubic FOV of side 600 μm, including over hundreds of cells in one or several osteons. We developed a framework to extract statistical information about the lacunae and on the number of canaliculi issued from each lacuna. Due to the limited spatial resolution of the image compared to the canaliculi diameter, the segmentation of the LCN is the most challenging part of the analysis and new solutions were investigated. This method was applied to the analysis of human femoral cortical bone samples. The mean and standard deviation of lacunar volume was 216. 44 ± 84. 7 μm 3 and their average lengths were respectively 15. 2, 7. 8 and 4. 0, with a length ratio about 4 : 2 : 1. The average distance between lacunae was found to be 23. 2 μm. The average number of canaliculi per lacuna was found to increase between 36. 9 and 108. 6 with the distance from the lacunae. The mean of the average length of the primary canaliculi was about 6. 4 μm. SR magnified phase CT at the <b>nano</b> <b>scale</b> (voxel <b>size</b> : 60 nm) was used to image the LCN on more restricted FOV (side ~ 120 μm) at beamline ID 22, ESRF [2]. This technique provides a detailed rendering of the LCN architecture including the organization of canaliculi around the lacunae, an assessment of the local degree of mineralization of bone, as well as information about the 3 D organization of the collagen fibers.
