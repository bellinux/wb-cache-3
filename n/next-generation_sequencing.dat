25|$|Duplex {{sequencing}} is {{a library}} preparation and analysis method for <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> (NGS) platforms that employs random tagging of double stranded DNA to detect mutations with higher accuracy and lower error rate. This method uses degenerate molecular tags {{in addition to}} sequencing adapters to recognize reads originating from each strand of DNA. The generated sequencing reads then will be analyzed using two methods: single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) and Duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly. Duplex sequencing theoretically can detect mutations with frequencies as low as 5 x 10−8 {{that is more than}} 10,000 fold higher in accuracy compared to the conventional <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|Second-generation sequencing, often {{referred}} to as <b>Next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> (NGS), has dominated the DNA sequencing space since its development. It has dramatically reduced the cost of DNA sequencing by enabling a massively-paralleled approach capable of producing large numbers of reads at exceptionally high coverages throughout the genome.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimated}} {{error rate}} of standard <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> platforms is 10−2 - 10−3 per base call. With this error rate billions of base calls that {{are produced by}} NGS will results in millions of the errors. The errors are introduced during sample preparation and sequencing such as polymerase , sequencing and image analysis errors. While the NGS platforms error rate is admissible to some applications such as detection of clonal variants, {{it is a major}} limit for applications that require higher accuracy for detection of low frequency variants such as detection of intra-organismal mosaicism, subclonal variants in genetically heterogeneous cancers or circulating tumor DNA.|$|E

It is modeled after the short read-mapping program RMAP, and reports either all alignments or the unambiguous best alignment for each read with any number of mismatches or differences.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{publications}} of various ‘omics’ data have provided new {{challenges and opportunities}} {{to the development of}} novel approaches to the assembly of <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequences.</b> As an attempt {{to improve the quality of}} assembled sequences, we developed a <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequence</b> clustering method by using the interdependency between genomics and proteomics data, which has not been well utilized so far in this field. Given a set of <b>next-generation</b> read <b>sequences</b> with a number of protein sequences, our method clusters the read sequences by mapping to the protein sequences. As a preliminary research, we selected Escherichia coli (E. coli) as our target species and simulated next-generation reads of E. coli to evaluate our method by analyzing the actual adjacency of the clustered reads in the E. coli genome. We found that (i) read base matching (RBM) ratio, which represents the amount of bases in a read that are mapped to a protein sequence, higher than 50 ∼ 70 % is a useful criterion for effective read clustering and (ii) higher RBM ratio does not always lead to better quality of clusters in the case of E. coli. These preliminary results demonstrate that the integrative approach is simple yet has great potential for clustering adjacent reads in a genome...|$|R
25|$|Bourbon {{virus was}} {{identified}} in 2014 by <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> of {{a blood sample}} from a man from Bourbon County, Kansas, USA, who became ill {{a few days after}} being bitten by multiple ticks, and subsequently died. It is the only known thogotovirus to be associated with human disease in the Western hemisphere. As of February 2015, Bourbon virus has not been isolated from ticks, insects or non-human vertebrates. The virus is variable in shape, with filamentous as well as spherical forms; it has a diameter broadly in the range 100–130nm. The genome contains at least six RNA segments. It is most similar to DHOV and Batken virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{has also made}} {{large-scale}} population sequencing feasible, for example the 1000 Genomes Project to characterize variation in human population groups. While common variation is easily captured, rare variation poses a design challenge: too few samples with significant sequence redundancy risks not having a variant in the sample group, but large samples with light redundancy risk not capturing a variant in the read set that is actually in the sample group. Wendl and Wilson report a simple set of optimization rules that maximize the probability of discovery for a given set of parameters. For example, for observing a rare allele at least twice (to eliminate the possibility is unique to an individual) {{a little less than}} 4-fold redundancy should be used, regardless of the sample size.|$|E

Lieberman Aiden and coworkers invented a variant of chromosome conformation capture called [...] "Hi-C" [...] which produces a genome-wide measure of contact probabilities that point to a 3-dimensional genome structure. This technique combines existing chromosome capture methodology with <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing,</b> enabling an all-versus-all measure of chromatin contacts.|$|E

2500|$|THOV and DHOV were {{identified}} in the early 1960s in Kenya and India, respectively. Two cases of human disease associated with THOV occurred in 1966, and a Russian laboratory accident in the 1980s showed that DHOV can also cause disease in humans. The two viruses were originally considered to be bunyaviruses, but characterisation in the 1980s and early 1990s revealed similarities with influenza viruses. A genus of [...] "Thogoto-like viruses" [...] within Orthomyxoviridae was proposed in 1995, and recognised by the ICTV under the name Thogotovirus the following year. The name comes from Thogoto Forest in Kenya, where THOV was first discovered. Since then, sequence analysis of five viruses discovered in the 1960–70s but unclassified or tentatively assigned to Bunyaviridae led to their being proposed as additional members of the genus.

In addition, the field is being driven forward by rapid advances in the area of <b>next-generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> technology, where sequences are generated from millions of nucleic acid templates by extensive parallelization of sequencing reactions in a custom apparatus.
