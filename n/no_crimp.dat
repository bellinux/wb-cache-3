2500|$|Alpaca fleece is {{the natural}} fiber {{harvested}} from an alpaca. It is light or heavy in weight, depending on how it is spun. It is a soft, durable, luxurious [...] and silky natural fiber. While similar to sheep’s wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and has no lanolin, which makes it hypoallergenic. Alpaca is naturally water-repellent and difficult to ignite. Huacaya, an alpaca that grows soft spongy fiber, has natural crimp, thus making a naturally elastic yarn well-suited for knitting. Suri has <b>no</b> <b>crimp</b> and thus is a better fit for woven goods. The designer Armani has used Suri alpaca to fashion men's and women's suits. Alpaca fleece is made into various products, from very simple and inexpensive garments made by the indigenous communities to sophisticated, industrially made and expensive products such as suits. In the United States, groups of smaller alpaca breeders have banded together to create [...] "fiber co-ops," [...] to make the manufacture of alpaca fiber products less expensive.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} crimp {{corresponds}} to the fineness of the wool fibers. A fine wool like Merino may have up to 100 crimps per inch, while coarser wool like karakul may have as few as one or two. In contrast, hair has little if any scale and <b>no</b> <b>crimp,</b> and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} crimping techniques in stapes surgery for otosclerosis patients measured by hearing outcomes on pure-tone audiometry. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. METHODS A systematic search was conducted. Studies comparing the effect of different crimping methods on pure-tone audiometric results in patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis were included. Relevance and risk of bias were assessed. Absolute risks and risk differences, means and mean differences, and 95 % confidence intervals were extracted or calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes, which were air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less, mean postoperative air-bone gap, and postoperative sensorineural hearing loss. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with moderate or high risk of bias were included for data extraction. Air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less was assessed in 17 studies and mean postoperative air-bone gap in 20 studies. The hearing outcomes did not consistently favor one crimping method. However, the differences that were statistically significant were consistently in favor of heat crimping over manual and <b>no</b> <b>crimping</b> (difference in air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less ranged between 22 % and 42 % in these studies and difference in mean postoperative air-bone gap between 2. 8 dB and 7. 4 dB) and in favor of manual <b>crimping</b> over <b>no</b> <b>crimping</b> (30 % difference in air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less and difference in mean postoperative air-bone gap between 2. 6 dB and 6. 0 dB). CONCLUSION Moderate to high risk of bias and inconsistent results characterize the current evidence...|$|R

5000|$|All lead wadcutters require proper {{lubrication}} {{to prevent}} leading of rifling and forcing cones {{when used in}} firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940 ft/s. Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both [...]38 Special and [...]357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both [...]44 Special and [...]44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths {{may need to be}} set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), <b>no</b> <b>crimping</b> is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case.|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} no method to restore normal function in tendon injuries {{that result in}} a gap. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the early healing of tendon defects implanted with a porous collagen–glycosaminoglycan (CG) matrix, previously shown to facilitate the regeneration of dermis and peripheral nerve. A novel animal model that isolates the tendon defect site from surrounding tissue during healing was employed. This model used a silicone tube to entubulate the surgically produced tendon gap of 10 mm, allowing for the evaluation of the effects of the analog of extracellular matrix on healing of tendon, absent the influences of the external environment. The results showed that tendon stumps induced synthesis of a tissue cable inside the silicone tube in both the presence and absence of CG matrix. The presence of the CG matrix, however, altered the process of tendon healing. Tubes filled with CG matrix contained a significantly greater volume of tissue at the time periods of evaluation: 3, 6, and 12 weeks. Granulation tissue persisted for a longer period of time in the lesion site of CG-filled defects, and the amount of dense fibrous tissue increased continuously during the period of study in defects filled with CG matrix. In contrast, the amount of dense fibrous tissue decreased after 6 weeks in originally empty tubes. In tubes that did not contain the CG matrix, the new tissue consisted of dense aggregates of crimped fibers with a wavelength and fiber bundle thickness that were significantly shorter than those in normal tendon, and consistent with the type of scar that is the end result of repair of many connective tissues. Although, CG-filled tubes contained dense fibrous tissue by 12 weeks, the tissue had <b>no</b> <b>crimp.</b> The CG matrix may have prolonged the synthesis of granulation tissue and delayed or prevented the formation of scar...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of archaeological textilia is important. The empower this statement, the textilia {{of the past}} have to be understood. Why did people make and use these products? To get a grasp of the answer, the production process has to be understood. Due to its complexity, {{every part of the}} chain functions as a choice, influencing the final product. This thesis focusses on the sorting preparation of woollen fibres, comparing experimentally processed and spun threads with archaeological samples of woollen yarn from Roswinkel, Smilde-Ravensmeer and Oss. The research starts with setting up a new methodology for the experiment, because little to none has been written on the subject. Focussing on the preparation of woollen fibres, the different reactions to carding, combing and teasing techniques are captured in a handspun thread. The visible reaction of the fibres are noticeable under a microscope. Differences are use of different fibre types, different fibre lengths, the alignment, the amount of crimp and the airiness between the fibres. The feel often corresponds with the used technique. The threads spun of the teased fibres feel either carded or combed, but are much less aligned. Comparing the analysis of the experimental yarn to the archaeological samples, the fibres show much alignment and almost <b>no</b> <b>crimp.</b> The threads are also of a very fine diameter. By using a VP-SEM instead of a stereo light microscope, as had been used for the experimental samples, many details are noticeable. Much {{can be seen in the}} material excavated from the peat, but the Oss material was often too mineralized. Therefore, the seemingly fibre reaction to the preparation technique could have been due to post-depositional causes. Contradictory, it seems unlikely that the fibres align (almost) perfectly in nature, concluding some sorting technique must have been used...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the hearing results of stapes surgery with two different titanium stapes prostheses. A crimping and a non-crimping prosthesis. METHODS: Retrospective analyses {{were carried out}} on the pre- and postoperative hearing results obtained after 126 primary stapedotomies with two different prostheses in patients with otosclerosis. Sixty-three patients had a stapedotomy with a K-piston Titanium (No. 1006107) type and 63 patients received a CliP-piston àWengen Titanium (No. 1006807) type after stapedotomy. The results were compared according to mean audiometrical parameters. A Chi-square Test analysis (a contingency table) was performed with odds ratio to analyze this retrospective case-control study. RESULTS: The hearing results of both titanium stapes prostheses were comparable. There {{was no difference in}} the final hearing results between the two pistons studied. No statistically significant difference between the postoperative air-bone gap closures by the two titanium stapes prostheses studied could be demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the different properties of the two titanium piston studied (CliP-piston àWengen Titanium type, <b>no</b> <b>crimping</b> and K-piston Titanium crimping necessary) a difference in the closure of the air-bone gap could be suspected. This comparative study could not demonstrate a statistical better air-bone gap closure for one of the titanium pistons.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Cullman, Alabama to evaluate the effects of three different rollers/crimpers on terminating a rye (Secale cereale L) cover crop, soil moisture, and sweet corn yield in a no-till system. Three roller types were tested: a straight bar roller, a smooth roller with crimper, and a two-stage roller at speeds of 2 and 4 MPH. Termination rates provided by the three rollers/crimpers were compared to a smooth drum roller (<b>no</b> <b>crimping</b> bar) plus glyphosate (Roundup TM WeatherMax) * * applied at 1 lb/acre. Initialdata indicates that three weeks after rolling 100 % termination was attained by the smooth roller and glyphosate. A termination of 68 % was attained following the smooth roller with crimper at 4 MPH; however, {{no significant differences were}} found between the straight bar roller at both speeds, the smooth roller with crimper and the two-stage roller at 4 MPH (67 %). Roller type did not affect soil moisture after the first and second week from rolling. No significant difference in sweet corn yield was found between straight bar roller at 4 MPH, two-stage roller at 2 MPH, and smooth roller plus glyphosate. The lowest yield was found with smooth drum roller plus glyphosate. The highest yield (15, 348 lbs/ac or 6. 85 tonnes/ac) was recorded following the smooth roller with crimper at 4 MPH...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Although in {{stapes surgery}} {{successful}} hearing improvement may {{be achieved in}} the majority of patients, unsatisfactory closure of the air-bone gap can be recorded. One of many reasons for unexpected failures of stapes surgery may be the insufficient crimping of a stapes prosthesis onto the incus. The objectives of the study were to assess the amount of sound transmission loss in response to the quality of prosthesis crimping and to identify a required loop attachment pattern to obtain good sound transmission results. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental. METHODS: A temporal bone model was developed to measure the sound transmission properties between incus and prosthesis on 17 fresh human temporal bones. The attachment of a titanium stapes piston was assessed without crimping, followed by loose crimping and tight fixation to the incus, using scanning laser Doppler interferometry, endoscopic photography, micro grinding technique, and scanning electron microscopy. An algorithm had to be developed to simulate acoustical stimulation using electromechanical stimulation. RESULTS: Optimal tight crimping of the stapes piston revealed consistent good sound transfer function ranging from 0 to 7 dB loss, and loss remained, on average, at 2 dB. The mean transmission losses for conditions of loose <b>crimping</b> and <b>no</b> <b>crimping</b> were surprisingly small (within 10 dB). However, these unusual crimping conditions allowed a wide range of losses up to 28 dB. A close coupling at least at two opposite points was obligatory to obtain consistently good results. CONCLUSIONS: Perfect hearing reconstruction necessitates ideal crimping of a prosthesis to obtain consistently good results. However, the final functional gain depends on many different intraoperative and postoperative factors...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) represents a major {{global health problem}} with increasing prevalence and morbidity. CVI is due to an incompetence of the venous valves, which causes venous reflux and distal venous hypertension. Several {{studies have focused on}} the replacement of diseased venous valves using xeno- and allogenic transplants, so far with moderate success due to immunologic and thromboembolic complications. Autologous cell-derived tissue-engineered venous valves (TEVVs) based on fully biodegradable scaffolds could overcome these limitations by providing non-immunogenic, non-thrombogenic constructs with remodeling and growth potential. Methods: Tri- and bicuspid venous valves (n= 27) based on polyglycolic acid-poly- 4 -hydroxybutyrate composite scaffolds, integrated into self-expandable nitinol stents, were engineered from autologous ovine bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and endothelialized. After in vitro conditioning in a (flow) pulse duplicator system, the TEVVs were crimped (n= 18) and experimentally delivered (n= 7). The effects of crimping on the tissue-engineered constructs were investigated using histology, immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, grating interferometry (GI), and planar fluorescence reflectance imaging. Results: The generated TEVVs showed layered tissue formation with increasing collagen and glycosaminoglycan levels dependent on the duration of in vitro conditioning. After <b>crimping</b> <b>no</b> effects were found on the MSC level in scanning electron microscopy analysis, GI, histology, and extracellular matrix analysis. However, substantial endothelial cell loss was detected after the crimping procedure, which could be reduced by increasing the static conditioning phase. Conclusions: Autologous living small-diameter TEVVs can be successfully fabricated from ovine BM-MSCs using a (flow) pulse duplicator conditioning approach. These constructs hold the potential to overcome the limitations of currently used non-autologous replacement materials and may open new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of CVI in the future...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic avulsions of {{ligament}} or tendon insertions rarely {{occur at}} the actual interface with bone, which suggests that this attachment is strong or otherwise protected from injury by {{the structure of the}} insertion complex. In this study we describe the terminal extent of quadriceps tendon fibres where they insert into the patellae of adult rabbits, humans, dogs and sheep. Specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). To facilitate tracing of tendon fibres the specimens were decalcified for SEM, and polarised light microscopy (PLM) was used in the LM segment of the study. By SEM it was possible to identify mature bone by the presence of osteocytes and a lamellar organisation. PLM and SEM showed that, unlike tendon fibres elsewhere, those in the calcified fibrocartilage were not <b>crimped.</b> <b>No</b> specific cement line was identified by SEM. Tendon fibres interdigitated among separate bone lamellar systems, (osteons or marrow spaces), but did not merge with the collagen systems of individual lamellae. The interdigitation was more extensive and the margin between tendon and bone was less distinct in the anterior third of the insertion. The segment of calcified tendon which interdigitated with bone stained less intensely blue and was less cellular than the more proximal calcified fibrocartilage zone adjacent to the tidemark. Lamellar collagen fibres of the bony trabeculae in the anterior patella were unusually parallel and longitudinal in orientation, making distinction of interposed tendon fibres difficult on LM and PLM sections. LM, SEM and transmission electron microscopy of rabbit patellae at birth revealed that anterior quadriceps tendon fibres extended over the patella in a fibrous cellular layer. By 2 wk of age, this layer had acquired chondroid features (i. e. cell lacunae and metachromasia) and contained vessels extending from patellar marrow. At 6 wk of age, part of this fibrocartilaginous layer was replaced by mature bone and osteoid. In the young adult animal, the quadriceps tension interdigitates extensively with the patellar bone. This segment of the insertion is perhaps the remnant of calcified fibrocartilage which has been remodelled by bone formation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{responds}} to a tendency in contemporary theatre practice and scholarship to overlook play texts when exploring the media-‐theatre relation. It challenges recent shifts in critical discourse concerning the mediatisation of theatre: the growing artistic and academic emphasis on performance; and misconceptions about postdramatic theatre as a non-‐textual {{form and the}} text’s presumed inability to accommodate the new reality of mediatised culture and consciousness. In light of this, the thesis examines the impact of media technologies and culture on a selection of British plays written since the 1990 s, exploring how they negotiate a media-‐saturated culture in both form and content. I introduce the concept of ‘mediatised dramaturgy’ to describe the shifts {{in the fabric of}} plays due to omnipresent mediatisation. I argue that mediatised dramaturgy is present not only in texts that overtly use media forms, but also in aesthetic subtleties that echo the phenomenon of mediatisation without direct reference to the mass media. The thesis also considers the reception of these plays in selected productions in order to gauge British theatre’s ability to respond to their dramaturgical challenges. Chapter 1 examines Martin <b>Crimp’s</b> <b>No</b> One Sees the Video (1990), Mark Ravenhill’s Faust is Dead (1996) and Enda Walsh’s Chatroom (2004) as ‘dramatic’ plays, arguing that thematisation of mediatisation without formal engagement limits the plays’ ambit. Chapter 2 explores the workings of mediatised language in Patrick Marber’s Closer (1997), Crimp’s Attempts on Her Life (1997) and Sarah Kane’s Crave (1998) to suggest language use in ‘no-‐longer-‐dramatic’ texts speaks to altered ontological and epistemological conditions of the media-‐saturated, globalised world. Chapter 3 assesses the impact changing modes of subjectivity and interpersonal relations have had on the presentation of character by analysing Tim Crouch’s My Arm (2003) and An Oak Tree (2005), and Simon Stephens’s Pornography (2007). This chapter argues that they destabilise the dramatic model of characterisation in order to engage with the heterogeneous and objectified nature of contemporary subjectivity. Lastly, Chapter 4 focuses on Douglas Maxwell’s use of videogame in Helmet (2002) and the televisual aesthetics of Caryl Churchill’s Heart’s Desire (1997), exploring how different approaches to remediation in plot structure affect the plays’ capacity to relate to mediatised socio-‐cognitive conditions. The thesis demonstrates that plays, on the page and in performance, have undergone significant change, proving that the old medium of text is capable of responding to the mediatised age...|$|R
