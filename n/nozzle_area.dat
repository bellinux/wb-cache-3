40|$|A {{computer}} code capable of simulating almost any conceivable turbine engine is described.

50|$|The <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> is {{increased}} during AB operation {{to limit the}} upstream effects on the engine. To run a turbofan to give maximum airflow (thrust), the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> may be controlled to keep the fan operating line in its optimum position. For a turbojet to give maximum thrust, the area may be controlled to keep the turbine exhaust temperature at its limit.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{vectoring}} axisymmetric ejector nozzles were designed and experimentally tested for internal performance and pumping characteristics at NASA-Langley Research Center. These ejector nozzles used convergent-divergent nozzles {{as the primary}} nozzles. The model geometric variables investigated were primary <b>nozzle</b> throat <b>area,</b> primary <b>nozzle</b> expansion ratio, effective ejector expansion ratio (ratio of shroud exit <b>area</b> to primary <b>nozzle</b> throat <b>area),</b> ratio of minimum ejector <b>area</b> to primary <b>nozzle</b> throat <b>area,</b> ratio of ejector upper slot height to lower slot height (measured on the vertical centerline), and thrust vector angle.

40|$|In general, {{jet engines}} operate with choked nozzle during take-off, climb and cruise, whereas unchoking occurs while landing and taxiing (when engine is not running at full power). Appropriate thrust in an {{aircraft}} in {{all stages of}} the flight, i. e., take-off, climb, cruise, descent and landing is achieved through variation in the <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>area.</b> This paper describes the effect on thrust and IR radiance of a turbojet engine due to variation in the exit area of a just choked converging nozzle (M-e = 1). The variations in the <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>area</b> result in either choking or unchoking of a just choked converging nozzle. Results for the change in <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>area</b> are analyzed in terms of thrust, mass flow rate and specific fuel consumption. The solid angle subtended (Omega) by the exhaust system is estimated analytically, for the variation in <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>area</b> (A(ne)), as it affects the visibility of the hot engine parts from the rear aspect. For constant design point thrust, IR radiance is studied from the boresight (phi = theta degrees, directly from the rear side) for various percentage changes in <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>area</b> (%Delta A(ne)), in the 1. 9 - 2. 9 mu m and 3 - 5 ism bands.

5000|$|On some {{engines that}} are {{equipped}} with an afterburner the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> is also varied during non-afterburning or dry thrust conditions. Typically the nozzle is fully open for starting and at idle. It may then close down as the thrust lever is advanced reaching its minimum area before or at the Military or max dry thrust setting. Two examples of this control are the General Electric J-79 and the Tumansky RD-33 in the MIG-29. Reasons for varying the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> are explained in section [...] "Nozzle area control during dry operation".|$|E
50|$|In some applications, {{such as the}} J79 {{installation}} {{in various}} aircraft, during fast throttle advances, the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> may be prevented from closing beyond a certain point to allow a more rapid increase in RPM and hence faster time to maximum thrust.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a 2-spool turbojet, such as the Olympus 593 in Concorde, the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> may be varied to enable {{simultaneous}} achievement of maximum LP compressor speed and maximum turbine entry temperature over the wide range of engine entry temperatures which occurs with flight speeds up to Mach 2.|$|E
40|$|Boundary {{conditions}} are formulated for treating selected patches {{of a subject}} configuration as inlet or <b>nozzle</b> <b>areas.</b> For subsonic inflow, the mass flow through the inlet {{is controlled by the}} exhaust conditions and the effects of mass and heat addition. For supersonic inflow, the exhaust {{conditions are}} based on the inlet conditions and on combustion data. These formulations were included into an existing Euler/Navier-Stokes solver. Comparisons with experimental data demonstrate that the resulting software package efficiently permits the assessment of propulsion-induced effects on external flow fields, particularly around highly blended configurations...|$|R
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan working line {{by using a}} convergent-divergent nozzle with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the <b>nozzle</b> exit <b>area</b> controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the <b>nozzle's</b> <b>area</b> to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan working line slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a joint {{study of the}} acoustics of conical convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzles such as those found on high-performance military aircraft. In this paper we examine the influence of chevrons on a <b>nozzle</b> with an <b>area</b> ratio corresponding to a design Mach number of 1. 5 (design pressure ratio of 3. 67). The nozzle is tested at its design condition and at pressure ratios of 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 representing overexpanded conditions and 4. 0, 4. 5 and 5. 0 representing underexpanded conditions. Each case is compared to a baseline nozzle at the same condition without chevrons. Shadowgraph images show that chevrons reduce the shock cell spacing, and introduce additional weak shock waves. Far-field acoustic measurements show that the application of chevrons reduces screech, broad-band shock-associated noise and mixing noise except for frequencies above the broad-band shock-associated noise peak for over-expanded and perfectly expanded conditions. Near-field acoustic reveal that chevrons produce significant noise near the nozzle exit across {{the whole range of}} frequencies, but reduce mixing noise, and broad-band shock-associated noise elsewhere and they all but eliminate screech.

50|$|The {{thrust reversers}} on some engines are {{incorporated}} into the nozzle itself and are known as target thrust reversers. The nozzle opens up in 2 halves which come together to redirect the exhaust partially forward. Since the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> {{has an influence on}} the operation of the engine (see below), the deployed thrust reverser has to be spaced the correct distance from the jetpipe to prevent changes in engine operating limits. Examples of target thrust reversers are found on the Fokker 100, Gulfstream IV and Dassault F7X.|$|E

The convergent section may be fully controlled with the divergent section following a pre-determined relationship to the convergent throat area.

50|$|The {{limiting}} {{case of the}} Venturi effect is when a fluid reaches the state of choked flow, where the fluid velocity approaches the local speed of sound. When a fluid system {{is in a state}} of choked flow, a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment will not lead to an increase in the mass flow rate. However, mass flow rate for a compressible fluid can increase with increased upstream pressure, which will increase the density of the fluid through the constriction (though the velocity will remain constant). This is the principle of operation of a de Laval nozzle. Increasing source temperature will also increase the local sonic velocity, thus allowing for increased mass flow rate but only if the <b>nozzle</b> <b>area</b> is also increased to compensate for the resulting decrease in density.|$|E

The study is conducted by means of an approximated method, essentially based on substituting the performances maps of compressors, fan and turbines by means of approximated analytical expressions. The approximation given by the method is verified by comparing results with those theor£ tically obtained without simplifications and with actual data obtained from air data computer measurements carried out in flight resulting in both cases excellent approximations. Final results show that modest but significant reduction in fuel consumption may be obtained by varying the exhaust areas and specific work of the fan, which couples with important reductions in turbine inlet temperature. All this might be of special interest for large turbofan engines specially designed for short range aircraft...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} design {{optimization}} of brick-lined autoclaves to reduce wall thickness without compromising autoclave integrity. The use of acid resistant, brick lined, horizontal, autoclaves {{is common for}} hydrometallurgical processing within the mining industry. To prevent corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary, autoclaves are often lined with an acid proof flexible membrane and high nickel alloy overlay localized at <b>nozzle</b> <b>areas.</b> A brick lining protects the membrane against high temperature and abrasive damage {{that would result in}} corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary. Because of stringent out-of-roundness and deflection requirements, autoclave designers are faced with the challenge of choosing the proper thickness and layout of the autoclaves. Common practice for satisfying stringent requirements is to design much thicker autoclave than what is required to satisfy pressure and temperature conditions. This paper provides a methodology for the design that utilizes stiffening rings for controlling out-of-roundness that results in thinner and lighter autoclaves...|$|R
