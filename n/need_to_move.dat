5|$|Three {{divisions}} {{were established}} within the new council: Finance and General Purposes; Public Health, Buildings and Sewerage; and Highways. The council sought {{to save money}} from the outset; {{reducing the number of}} workmen employed on the highways from ten to seven and cancelling the cleaning of ditches beside the roads. The lowest-paid man working on the sewers was informed he would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> within the district and take a pay cut from £1:6s to £1:3s or be made redundant. He accepted.|$|E
5|$|After their Hampstead {{home was}} hit by bomb {{shrapnel}} in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London {{to live in a}} farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. This was to become Moore's home and workshop {{for the rest of his}} life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years. In 1943 he received a commission from the Church of St. Matthew, Northampton, to carve a Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.|$|E

The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in {{exchange}} for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be. In 1793, the King of Spain decided that there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the boundary from Natchitoches to the Sabine River, as had been recommended by some Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{first strike}} against Kaafjord was {{launched}} on 22 August. While flying conditions were poor due to low cloud, Moore decided to attack that day {{as some of}} his ships were starting to run low on fuel and would soon <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from Norway to refuel. At 11:00 am a force comprising 32 Barracudas, 24 Corsairs, 11 Fireflies, 9 Hellcats and 8 Seafires was launched from the three fleet carriers. No Avengers were dispatched as the cloudy conditions were unsuitable for the execution of their task. Because few mines were available and the Avengers could not safely land while still carrying these weapons, the mine-dropping element of the plan would fail if the aircraft were unable to locate Tirpitz and had to dump their loads into the sea.|$|E
5|$|While {{camouflage}} tricks are {{in principle}} limitless, both cost and practical considerations limit {{the choice of}} methods and {{the time and effort}} devoted to camouflage. Paint and uniforms must also protect vehicles and soldiers from the elements. Units <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> fire their weapons and perform other tasks to keep functional, some of which run counter to camouflage. Camouflage may be dropped altogether. Late in the Second World War, the USAAF abandoned camouflage paint for some aircraft to lure enemy fighters to attack, while in the Cold War, some aircraft similarly flew with polished metal skins, to reduce drag and weight, or to reduce vulnerability to radiation from nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E
5|$|Hassett came in {{with the}} score at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October the RPF {{suffered}} a significant reversal, when leader Fred Rwigyema {{was shot in}} the head and killed. There is a dispute about the exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, however, Prunier states that it is likely Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> slowly, and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi, wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible; the argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{after trying}} to make the troublemaker Zhang {{apologize}} for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E
5|$|His brother Howard Burnham (1870–1918), born {{shortly before}} {{the family moved to}} Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and {{suffered}} from tuberculosis. During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft, how to shoot, and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg. Howard moved to Africa, became a mining engineer in the Johannesburg gold mines, and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation. He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany. Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying. From his death bed, Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> allied troops away from the Western Front. Howard was buried at Cannes, France, leaving behind his wife and four children. He had been named after his second cousin, Lieutenant Howard Mather Burnham who was killed in action in the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Another {{view of the}} {{evolution}} of Resnais's career saw him moving progressively away from a realistic treatment of 'big' subjects and overtly political themes towards films that are increasingly personal and playful. Resnais himself offered an explanation of this shift in terms of challenging what was the norm in film-making at the time: having made his early films when escapist cinema was predominant, he progressively felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from exploration of social and political issues as that itself became almost the norm in contemporary cinema. Experimentation with narrative forms and genre conventions instead became a central focus of his films.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} a low resting {{metabolism}} is that it requires far less fuel to sustain bodily functions. By using temperature variations in their surroundings, or by remaining cold {{when they do not}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> reptiles can save considerable amounts of energy compared to endothermic animals of the same size. A crocodile needs from a tenth to a fifth of the food necessary for a lion of the same weight and can live half a year without eating. Lower food requirements and adaptive metabolisms allow reptiles to dominate the animal life in regions where net calorie availability is too low to sustain large-bodied mammals and birds.|$|E
25|$|Earliest {{sites in}} Anosy found by archeologists to date focused on fishing, others {{possibly}} on cattle.

Settlement sites were small (0.5ha in size), seasonal in some cases and even temporary, based on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to obtain food. They were concentrated near the coast in dunal areas and were part of what was a very simple economic and social system. One of the sites is located on sand dunes overlooking the Efaho estuary (Rakotoarisoa, 1998).|$|E
