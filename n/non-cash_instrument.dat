40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies show}} that the impact of an {{exogenous}} monetary policy shock on bank lending is different across bank sizes and across various levels of capitalization and liquidity. However, there is little evidence on the impact of other exogenous influences such as the shift from cash- to <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments</b> on bank lending. The shift to electronic payments significantly alters bank balance sheets and consumer liquidity restrictions and, therefore, it is likely to affect bank lending decisions. This paper explores the effects of the increasing use of <b>non-cash</b> payments <b>instruments</b> on bank lending in Spain during 1992 - 2000. The results show that banks appear to have taken advantage of the <b>non-cash</b> <b>instruments</b> to adjust their loan supply when interest rates increase (120 words).

50|$|These {{types of}} {{innovations}} may also affect monetary policy by reducing real household balances. Especially {{with the increased}} popularity of online banking, households are able to keep greater percentages of their wealth in <b>non-cash</b> <b>instruments.</b> In {{a special edition of}} 'International Finance' devoted to the interaction of electronic commerce and central banking, Goodhart (2000) and Woodford (2000) express confidence in the ability of a central bank to maintain its policy goals by affecting the short-term interest rate even if electronic money has eliminated the demand for central bank liabilities, while Friedman (2000) is less sanguine.|$|R

In Romania, the most common payment method is transfer credit, because of its simplicity and because it is less risky than the other non-cash payment methods, while in EU direct debit and credit cards are more common. However, the value per transaction for any type of <b>non-cash</b> <b>instruments</b> (except for cheques) is smaller in Romania than in other EU countries...|$|R
50|$|In June 2009, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) began {{proceedings}} in the Federal Court of Australia against Cabcharge {{alleging that}} Cabcharge had breached the Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into {{an agreement to}} substantially lessen competition. The action centered on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taxi meters and fare updates at below actual cost or at no cost. On 24 September 2010, Cabcharge admitted to three contraventions of the TPA to settle the proceedings. The Federal Court approved the settlement, and declared that Cabcharge had breached the TPA {{by taking advantage of}} its substantial degree of power in the Australian markets for the supply of services to enable non-cash payments for taxi fares and charges by taxi passengers and <b>non-cash</b> <b>instruments</b> that could be used only for the payment of taxi fares and charges. The Court imposed the highest ever penalty for misuse of market power, imposing a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs).|$|R
50|$|Cheques {{are still}} the most {{important}} <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments</b> in Australia, {{in terms of the}} value transferred. The number of monthly cheque transactions in 2008 was 33.7 million with a value of $139.3 billion. Cheque use is in decline worldwide, but it is declining faster in Australia than many other countries. Between 2010 and 2014, cheque use in Australia declined by 42.8% with just over seven cheques written per person in 2014. In 2014, 166.6 million cheques were used in Australia, compared to 291.1 million in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Standard {{transaction}} cost arguments can only partially {{explain why the}} share of cash transactions is still high in many countries. This paper shows that consumers 2 ̆ 019 desire to monitor liquidity {{is one of the}} reasons. Consumers make use of a distinctive feature of cash 2 ̆ 013 a glance into one 2 ̆ 019 s pocket provides a signal for both the remaining budget as well as the level of past expenses. We propose a theoretical framework which incorporates this feature of cash, and derives implications not only for cash usage as such but also for a broader set of payment-related activities. Survey data from Germany on consumers 2 ̆ 019 payment and withdrawal patterns are used to test these implications empirically. The data are consistent with all theoretical predictions: consumers who need to keep control over their remaining liquidity and who have elevated costs of information processing and storage will conduct a larger percentage of their payments using cash, hold fewer <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments,</b> withdraw less often and hold larger cash balances than other consumers. Such consumers also use payment cards for some transactions; they switch to <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments</b> only at higher transaction values than other consumers, however. Our model provides an explanation of why cash usage has declined only slowly in some countries despite broad diffusion of non-cash means of payment...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{in the use of}} <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments,</b> {{specifically}} debit and credit cards, has become a prominent feature of modern economies. With an interest in the explanation of this phenomenon and differences in use across countries, we apply a model of payment instrument use to model the relationship between the dependent variables (total volume of card transactions, debit card transactions, and credit card transactions) and the five independent variables based on income, infrastructure, substitution, and institutional influences. We estimate the model and perform a regression analysis on a panel of 22 countries over the period 2009 to 2013. We find that crime, bank concentration, and income have positive relationship with the use of card instruments, while cash is found to be both a complement and substitute to card payments. The variable based on infrascture yields insignificant results. With the results, our purpose is to give greater insight into {{to the use of the}} card payments and the explanations for differences in use across countries. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{social cost}} of a payment system {{comprises}} between 1 % to 1. 5 % of GDP. This cost can be reduced if non-cash payments shift from paper to electronics since the {{cost of a}}n electronic payment is estimated to be from one-third to one-half that of a paper-based transaction. We examine the use of cash and five <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments</b> in 14 developed countries over 1987 - 1993. Our purpose is (1) to outline the current use of check, paper giro, electronic giro, credit card, and debit card payments and (2) to determine why some payment instruments are used more intensively than others, especially electronic versus paper-based payments. Standard demand theory influences (own price and incomes, institutional factors, and simple availability measures across countries are examined, as is the effect of habit formation. Payment substitution relationships are also estimated and indicate that checks will decline with further growth of electronic payments while the instruments that make up electronic payments will tend to expand together rather than replace one another.

40|$|Payment {{transactions}} {{with electronic}} money {{were conducted by}} transferring the fund electronically to merchant terminal, which would directly subtract the value of electronic money on electronic device managed by the owner. The characteristic of electronic money are as follows: to be deposited in advance to the issuer; the sum of money is electronically deposited in a particular medium, it can be card or other communication instrument; its function is as a non cash payment instrument to merchant not to the issuer of electronic money; and the sum of electronic money does not constitute saving product {{because it does not}} include in those guaranteed by Deposit Guarantor and it is not given any interest or reward. Electronic money is essentially cashless money, whose monetary value comes from the value of money deposited in advance to the publisher, then stored electronically in an electronic media such as server (hard drive) or chip card, which functions as a <b>Non-cash</b> payment <b>instrument</b> to the non-electronic issuer concerned.

40|$|One of {{the most}} heated debates in {{bankruptcy}} law scholarship has been the optimal design of corporate bankruptcy law. While traditionalist scholars defended {{the actual practice of}} Chapter 11 of the Bakruptcy Code, the law-and-economics movement has by and large heavily crticized Chapter 11 and called for its replacement. Several models of corporate bankruptcy have been offered in the literature as imporved alternatives thereto. In this article, I examine the various models offered in the literature, as well as the basic model of Chapter 11, against a certain realistic background: that of an economy characterized by the concentrated dominance of a few banks. Concentrated banking has been a subject of economic research in recent years. However, what has been lacking is a clear analysis of the ramifications of concentrated banking on corporate bankruptcy. This paper fills this gap by presenting such an analysis. In the paper, I show the anticompetitive measures which the banks, as senior lenders of the corporate debtor on one hand and the financers of any cash-driven resolution of bankruptcy on the other hand, might impose. Such measures cast doubt whether the various bankruptcy substitute models previously porposed, all of which rely on the use of cash money in the resolution of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s financial distress, are applicable to concnetrated banking markets. As a result, this paper calls for implementing a market-based bankruptcy regime which allows the acquisition of the debtor firm through the use of <b>non-cash</b> payment <b>instruments.</b> The article shows how such a regime would encourage a healthy competition over the control of the corportae debtor and enhance the return to its prebankruptcy creditors...|$|R
