40|$|The {{regional}} {{blood flow}} of the urinary bladder of rabbits was measured by electrochemically generated hydrogen gas. Then the effects of increased bladder capacity, and of systemic administration of scopolamine and <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> on regional blood flow were examined. The local blood {{flow of the}} rabbit bladder was 75. 9 +/- 8. 4 ml/ 100 g/min (mean +/- S. E.) and it decreased by increased bladder capacity.

40|$|Agricultural, pharmaceutical, {{and other}} biologically active {{substances}} are emptied or leach into waterways and groundwater, {{where they can}} dose-relatedly cause pharmacologic or toxic effects on the resident or dependent animal species. Standard methods {{can be used to}} evaluate the effects of individual substances, but evaluation of combinations of substances is more difficult. The mathematically rigorous method of isobolographic analysis was coupled with a simple in vivo invertebrate model. Planarians were selected because they are the lowest extant species with a centralized nervous system. <b>Neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> and monopotassium phosphate (KH 2 PO 4 ) were selected as representative of two types of potential pollutants. <b>Neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> and KH 2 PO 4 individually produced dose-related lethality over a 60 -minute observation period with LD 50 values of 122 and 70 mM, respectively. The LD 50 value of a 1 : 1 combination of the two was significantly different (p < 0. 05) from the isobolographic line of additivity. We used planarians as a representative fresh-water species and joint-action (‘isobolographic’) analysis to examine possible interaction between pollutants. In the demonstrative example reported here, there was a subadditive interaction between a 1 : 1 fixed-ratio combination of <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (as a representative acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in pesticides) and potassium phosphate (used in fertilizers and detergents) ...|$|E
40|$|The two novel ion-pairs (PB-TPB and NB-TPB) of {{quaternary}} ammonium drugs; propantheline bromide (PB), N,N-Diisopropyl-N-methyl-N-[2 -(xanthen- 9 ylcarbonyloxy) ethyl] ammonium bromide and <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (NB), 3 -(dimethylcarbamoyloxy) phenyl]-trimethylazanium have been synthesized, respectively and incorporated in poly (vinyl chloride) -based membrane electrodes for the quantification of propantheline bromide and <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> in different pharmaceutical preparations. The influences ofmembranecompositionsonthepotentiometric responses ofmembrane electrodes {{have been found}} to substantially improve the performance characteristics. The best performance was reported with membranes having composition (w/w) of PB-TPB or NB-TPB (6 %) : PVC (34 %) : o-NPOE (60 %). The proposed electrodes exhibit nernstian response in the concentration ranges of 2. 1 × 10 − 7 M to 1. 0 × 10 − 2 Mand 4. 4 × 10 − 7 Mto 1. 0 × 10 − 2 Mwith detection limit of 1. 5 × 10 − 7 Mand 3. 3 × 10 − 7 M, respectively. Both the membrane electrodes perform satisfactorily over pH ranges of (3. 5 – 7. 5 and 4. 0 – 7. 0) with fast response times (11 s and 13 s), respectively. These drugs (PB and NB) were further utilized as different ion-pairs of Prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) and Deoxycholate (DOC) in poly (vinyl chloride) -based membrane electrodes for the determination of bioavailability of Prostaglandin E 1 and Deoxycholate in plasma of different patients...|$|E
40|$|Received on 03 - 11 - 2010 Accepted on 20 - 11 - 2010 Intranasal {{administration}} {{is an ideal}} alternative to the parenteral route for systemic drug delivery. Various conventional dosage forms have been employed for this purpose but they lack to provide the desired bioavailability of the drug due to poor residence time and faster clearance in the nasal cavity. Formulating multiparticulate system with mucoadhesive polymers may provide {{a significant increase in}} the nasal residence time. <b>Neostigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> a cholinesterase inhibitor is conventionally given by oral and i. v. route for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. The aim of the present approach was to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional dosage forms by formulating intranasal microspheres of <b>Neostigmine</b> <b>Bromide</b> with Carbopol 974 P NF and HPMC K 15 M along with film forming polymer ethyl cellulose by emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The prepared microspheres were characterized for encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, particle size, and surface morphology, degree of swelling, in-vitro mucoadhesion, drug release, in-vivo studies and stability studies. Formulations FN 1 and FN 5 displayed the best results for carbopol and HPMC based microspheres respectively. Entrapment efficiency was 75. 74 ± 0. 50 and 70. 27 ± 0. 61; mucoadhesion was 98. 5 and 85. 3; and drug release up to 8 h was 87. 86 and 84. 5 for FN 1 and FN 5 respectively.

40|$|We were {{interested}} to see, {{if there is}} a possibility to detect any activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the water extract of the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), if acetylthiocholine chloride (AChCl) is used as a substrate. We wished to study at what rate the enzyme activity is affected, if we add different concentrates of the substrate and different inhibitors. In samples of the oyster mushroom, activity of the enzyme AChE was successfully proven. The activity linearly grew in correspondance with increasing concentration of the AChCl substrate. Inhibitors eserine, <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> and poly APS at 1 mM concentration of AChCl, do not block the enzyme activity. We suggest further studies with other substrates, containing thiocholine. We also suggest studies of the enzyme inhibition at higher concentrations of substrate acetylthiocholine chloride...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} local {{administration}} of cholinergic {{drugs on the}} release of acetylcholine in the septo-hippocampal system were investigated using intracerebral microdialysis. Dialysis probes were implanted in the cell-body area of septo-hippocampal neurones in the medial septal area, and in the terminal area of the same neurones in the ventral hippocampus. Drugs were administered locally via the dialysis probe. Administration of the mixed muscarinic/nicotinic receptor agonist carbachol caused a decrease, whereas administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist methyl-atropine caused {{an increase in the}} output of acetylcholine in both the hippocampus and the medial septal area. In contrast, perfusion with the same drugs and the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> in the septal area had little or no effect on the output of acetylcholine in hippocampus. The results indicate that acetylcholine autoreceptors are localised on nerve terminals in medial septal area and hippocampus, and exert an inhibitory control over acetylcholine release. However, autoreceptors seem to be sparse or absent on dendrites and cell bodies of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present {{work was}} envisaged {{to reduce the}} dosing {{frequency}} and improve patient compliance by designing and evaluating Sustained Release Mucoadhesive (SRM) microspheres of <b>Neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (NB) for effective control of myasthenia gravis. Microspheres were prepared by emulsification-internal gelation technique using Sodium alginate, Carbopol 934 P (CP), and Hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose K 15 M (HPMC) as a mucoadhesive polymers. Microspheres prepared were found discrete, spherical and free flowing. The microspheres exhibits good mucoadhesive properties and showed high drug entrapment efficiency. NB release from these microspheres was slow and extended and dependent {{on the type of}} polymer used. The mean particle size decreased and the drug release rate increased at higher Stirring speed of emulsion content. Among all the formulation, formulation F 6 containing sodium alginate, 4 % & HMPC, 1 % and F 9 containing sodium alginate, 4 % & carbopol, 1 % showed the best reproducible results and mucoadhesive profile with good surface morphology. The data obtained thus suggest that mucoadhesive microspheres can successfully design for sustained delivery of NB and to improve patient compliance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Neostigmine is a {{frequently}} used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor administered to reverse muscular relaxation caused by nondepolarizing neuromuscular relaxants in patients recovering from general anesthesia. Severe allergic reactions and urticaria are rarely reported following {{the use of}} <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide,</b> and never with methylsulfate-containing drugs. In this case, bigeminal premature ventricular contractions added to urticaria provides a warning {{about the possibility of}} a life-threatening situation. Case presentation We report the case of a 23 -year-old Persian woman who presented with bigeminal premature ventricular contractions along with urticarial lesions on her arm and trunk as soon as she was administered neostigmine methylsulfate after undergoing a laparoscopy for ectopic pregnancy. Conclusion This case report could be of value not only for anesthesiologists who routinely use neostigmine but also for others who administer the pharmaceutical preparation in other situations. The report presents a rare case of drug reaction following neostigmine use. As a result, one should consider any drug a probable cause of drug reaction. The preparation of resuscitative facilities, therefore, is necessary prior to the prescription of the medication. </p...|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) {{has been}} {{increasingly}} recognized in plants by indirect evidence of its activity. Here, we report purification and cloning of AChE from maize (Zea mays), thus providing {{to our knowledge}} the first direct evidence of the AChE molecule in plants. AChE {{was identified as a}} mixture of disulfide- and noncovalently linked 88 -kD homodimers consisting of 42 - to 44 -kD polypeptides. The AChE hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine and propyonylthiocholine, but not S-butyrylthiocholine, and the AChE-specific inhibitor <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> competitively inhibited its activity, implying that maize AChE functions in a similar manner as the animal enzyme. However, kinetic analyses indicated that maize AChE showed a lower affinity to substrates and inhibitors than animal AChE. The full-length cDNA of maize AChE gene is 1, 471 nucleotides, which encode a protein having 394 residues, including a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited no apparent similarity with that of the animal enzyme, although the catalytic triad was the same as in the animal AChE. In silico screening indicated that maize AChE homologs are widely distributed in plants but not in animals. These findings lead us to propose that the AChE family, as found here, comprises a novel family of the enzymes that is specifically distributed in the plant kingdom...|$|E
40|$|Different {{approaches}} {{were chosen}} to examine ionization reproducibility of analytes after separation by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) in a commercially available sheath-flow electrospray interface. For this task three different standard samples were examined. Sample 1 contained <b>neostigmine</b> <b>bromide</b> (cationic), paracetamol (PCM) (neutral) and nicotinic acid (anionic component). Results were evaluated using internal standard (IS) calculations. Sample 2 represented an isotopically labelled IS of the quantified substance (PCM/D 4 -PCM), while sample 3 (neostigmine bromide/scopolamine hydrobromide) provided an IS closely migrating to the tested substance. Furthermore, short-time variations inside the interface were examined by multiple injections of the same substance. For sample 1, the relative standard deviations (RSD%s) were between 8 and 25 % (n at least 58) for the peak area ratios. Multiple injected samples gave 5. 5 - 19. 4 % (n = 25) for peak area RSD%. Using a closely migrating IS, sample 3, RSD%s between 6. 5 and 10 % (n at least 63) were achieved. With isotopically labelled IS, sample 2, an RSD% of 3 - 4 % was achieved for peak area ratios over long periods (n = 25), for shorter periods (n = 9) even 1 - 2 % RSD% was obtained. Keeping the instrument settings constant, the influence on the ionization efficiency and reproducibility was tested, varying the buffer pH, the organic buffer modifier and the sample concentration. Repeatabilities of migration time and peak area were measured and compared. Two 10 mM ammonium acetate buffers with pH 4. 0 and 8. 5 were investigated. No influence of buffer pH on peak area reproducibility was found. Isopropanol as organic buffer modifier significantly improved the ionisation leading to larger peak areas, but reduced reproducibility. The basic buffer produced slightly better RSD%s for migration times (2. 5 - 4. 0 %) (n = 180) and faster analysis for the different test analytes of sample 1, while with the acetic buffer, RSD%s from 3. 9 to 6. 0 % were obtained (n at least 163). The positioning of the capillary {{turned out to be}} the crucial parameter to ensure reproducible results. Thus, a procedure was established to ensure a defined ion-intensity level after capillary changes. The investigation of the different sample concentrations gave negligible differences in RSD%, showing that the signal-to-noise ratio was not the crucial parameter for reproducibility here, in contrast to CE-UV detection...|$|E
