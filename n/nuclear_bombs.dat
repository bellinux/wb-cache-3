5|$|On 24 January 1961, a B-52G {{broke up}} in midair and crashed after {{suffering}} a severe fuel loss, near Goldsboro, North Carolina, dropping two <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> in the process without detonation. 3 of the 8 crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having a}} main {{military}} goal of deterrence, strategists envisioned the Swiss nuclear strike capability {{as part of}} a preemptive war against the Soviets. The Swiss Air Force Mirage III jet {{would have been able to}} carry <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> as far as Moscow. They also suggested the weapons could be used on Swiss soil against a possible invading force.|$|E
5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in small quantities in the plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 6 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was an American <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> {{based on}} the earlier Mark 4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> and its predecessor, the Mark 3 Fat Man <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> design.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 11 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was an American <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> {{developed}} from the earlier Mark 8 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> in the mid-1950s. Like the Mark 8, the Mark 11 was an earth-penetrating weapon, {{also known as a}} <b>nuclear</b> bunker buster <b>bomb.</b>|$|R

5|$|In April 1975, {{a single}} Jaguar {{was used to}} test the aircraft's rough {{airstrip}} capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways might be the only runways left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the bestselling Ashwin Sanghi thriller The Rozabal Line (2007), {{mention of}} Opus Dei and Illuminati are frequent. Sanghi, often termed the Indian Dan Brown, created an {{intricate}} plot revolving around themes of Jesus' tomb and <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> and the events, though global, have India {{as an important}} theatre.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1959, a B-52 {{from the}} 492d Bomb Squadron at Columbus AFB, Mississippi {{carrying}} 2 nuclear weapons collided in midair with a KC-135 tanker near Hardinsburg, Kentucky; 4 of the 8 crew {{members on the}} bomber and all 4 crew on the tanker were killed. One of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> was damaged by fire but both weapons were recovered.|$|E

50|$|The Mark 13 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> and its variant, the W-13 nuclear warhead, were {{experimental}} {{nuclear weapons}} {{developed by the}} United States from 1951 to 1954. The Mark 13 design {{was based on the}} earlier Mark 6 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> design, which was in turn based on the Mark 4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> and the Mark 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> used at the end of World War II.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to a range of}} free-fall <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs,</b> later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for standoff nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel; it had been intended for the American Skybolt missile to be introduced; however, development of Skybolt was cancelled. Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight, as well in advance of the mission. It was reported that, with intensive work, a B.2 missile carrier could revert to carrying free-fall nuclear weapons or conventional munitions within 30 hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stage (Nuclear Storm), the player must - among other things - prevent the {{destruction}} of a major oil production facility, disable a nuclear power plant and several finished parts for nuclear weapons, and finally take down Kilbaba himself. Kilbaba attempts to escape in a bomber plane armed with <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs,</b> but the player destroys him and his plane before it leaves the runway.|$|E
5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to shear off. Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was an American <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> design {{produced}} {{starting in}} 1949 and in use until 1953.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 8 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was a <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb,</b> {{designed}} in the late 1940s and early 1950s, which was in service from 1952 to 1957.|$|R
50|$|Hansen's {{research}} indicates that the Tsetse primary {{was used in the}} US B43 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb,</b> W44 <b>nuclear</b> warhead, W50 nuclear warhead, B57 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb,</b> and W59.|$|R
5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
5|$|When the Cold War {{ended in}} 1991, {{there were more}} than 500 US nuclear weapons in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were Ground Launched Cruise Missiles, and {{approximately}} 100 were B57 nuclear depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155mm nuclear artillery shells. The cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991 {{under the terms of the}} 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range nuclear weapons. The last US warheads, including the B57s and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American nuclear weapons then remaining in the UK were 110 or so B61 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> stored at RAF Lakenheath for USAF F-15E Strike Eagles, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British WE.177 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British nuclear weapons were British warheads on the Trident missiles of the s.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|The Tsetse primary {{was used}} in the US B43 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb,</b> W44 <b>nuclear</b> warhead, W50 nuclear warhead, B57 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb,</b> and W59 <b>nuclear</b> warhead, {{according}} to researcher Chuck Hansen.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 24 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was an American {{thermonuclear}} bomb design, {{based on the}} third American {{thermonuclear bomb}} test, Castle Yankee. The Mark 24 bomb was tied as the largest weight and size <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> ever deployed by the United States, with {{the same size and}} weight as the Mark 17 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> which used a very similar design concept but unenriched Lithium.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark-12 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was a {{lightweight}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> designed and manufactured by the United States of America {{which was built}} starting in 1954 and which saw service from then until 1962.|$|R
5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs,</b> but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. The plane was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|In October 1951, in {{anticipation}} of a major build-up of the USAF to 95 groups, and of delays in the B-47 program, the Air Materiel Command was ordered to modify a further 180 B-29s then in storage to carry the Mark 4, Mark 5, Mark 6, and Mark 8 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs.</b> Modifications were carried out in Oklahoma City and Sacramento. By the time the aircraft were all delivered in September 1953, the B-29 was being phased out, and the modified aircraft went back into storage without seeing further service.|$|E
5|$|Production B.1 Victors were {{powered by}} the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 {{turbojets}} rated at , and was initially deployed with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon, re-deploying with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon. A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard {{by the addition of}} Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.|$|E
25|$|While the {{introduction}} of the Mark 4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> to replace the Fat Man (the Mark 3) in 1949 caused few problems, that of the Mark 5 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> in 1951 required extensive re-tooling. The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and Salt Wells Pilot Plant staffs agreed to adopt direct machining of the explosive components. While this was known to generate additional heat, tests at both sites had been conducted without an explosive accident. Further re-tooling was required for the Mark 12 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> explosives, which the Salt Wells Pilot Plant began manufacturing in 1953. It also began tooling up for the Mark 13 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Mark 10 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> was a {{proposed}} American <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> {{based on the}} earlier Mark 8 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> design. The Mark 10, like the Mark 8, is a Gun-type nuclear weapon, which rapidly assembles several critical masses of fissile nuclear material by firing a fissile projectile or [...] "bullet" [...] into a hollow opening in a larger fissile [...] "target", using a system which closely resembles a medium-sized cannon barrel and propellant.|$|R
5|$|The Prime Minister {{receives}} a communiqué from SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) {{explaining that the}} organisation has hijacked a Villiers Vindicator and seized its two <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs,</b> which it will use to destroy two major cities unless a £100,000,000 ransom is paid. This is SPECTRE's Plan Omega. SPECTRE is headed by criminal mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Count Lippe was dispatched to Shrublands to oversee Giuseppe Petacchi of the Italian Air Force, at the Boscombe Down Airfield, a bomber squadron base. Although Lippe was successful, Blofeld considered him unreliable, because of his childish clash with Bond and, as a consequence, Blofeld has Lippe killed.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado {{is capable}} of {{delivering}} air-launched nuclear weapons. In 1979, Britain considered replacing its Polaris submarines with either the Trident submarines or alternatively the Tornado as the main bearer of its nuclear deterrent. Although the UK proceeded with Trident, several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional and nuclear weapons, namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb, which was retired in 1998. German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs,</b> which are made available through NATO.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has {{the second}} largest {{standing}} military force in NATO, after the US Armed Forces, with an estimated strength of 495,000 deployable forces, according to a 2011 NATO estimate. Turkey {{is one of five}} NATO member states which are part of the nuclear sharing policy of the alliance, together with Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. A total of 90 B61 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bombs</b> are hosted at the Incirlik Air Base, 40 of which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a nuclear conflict, but their use requires the approval of NATO.|$|E
50|$|A lighter Mark 8 variant, the Mark 10 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb,</b> was {{developed}} as a lightweight airburst (surface target) bomb. The Mark 10 project was cancelled prior to introduction into service, replaced by the much more fissile-material-efficient Mark 12 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb</b> implosion design.|$|R
50|$|The W34 was {{deployed}} in several applications: Mark 101 Lulu <b>nuclear</b> depth <b>bomb,</b> the Mark 45 ASTOR torpedo and the Mark 105 Hotpoint <b>nuclear</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|R
