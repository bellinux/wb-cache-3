40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of my work}} was {{to draw attention to}} nutritional aspects in the formation of cavities. The thesis focuses on foods that have a proven or potential impact on tooth decay, especially saccharides. The target group consisted of 100 patients registered at the same dental office. All participants filled out a simple questionnaire that included 19 questions on not only their eating habits, but also their oral hygiene. All respondents were assigned a KPE index value, which quantifies tooth decay, according to their health records. All data was processed, compared and analyzed in Microsoft Excel, 2007. The results show that respondents who consume sweets one time and more per day show higher tooth decay (KPE 16. 58) than those who consume sweets less than one time per day (KPE 9. 41). A similar situation exists for the consumption of soft drinks, where drinking at least one per day is associated with a significantly higher average of KPE (16. 30) than in people who indulge less in sweetened beverages (KPE 12. 87). Respondents who did <b>not</b> <b>sweeten</b> their coffee, tea or other beverages and foods are much less affected by cavities (KPE 11. 07) than those who sweeten them only sometimes or all the time (KPE 16. 27). A major link between consuming fruits and fruit drinks and the formation of carious lesions was not detected. The data points to a connection between the intake of simple saccharides and higher tooth decay. Also demonstrable was the connection between a healthy lifestyle (frequent consumption of vegetables, eating fast food sporadically, the absence of sugary drinks and sweets) and lower incidence of cavities. A significant role is likewise played by socioeconomic factors (such as education) and, of course, the emphasis on preventing dental problems, meaning regular dental checkups, the proper technique for cleaning teeth, and good choice of dental aids...|$|R

40|$|Potatoes are {{increasingly}} {{consumed in the}} form of processed foodstuffs such as French fries and crisps. After harvest, potatoes need to be kept at low temperature to prevent sprouting during storage for round-the-year processing. However, tubers accumulate reducing sugars at low temperatures, a phenomenon referred to as cold-induced sweetening (CIS). The processing of these high sugar potatoes into crisps or fries leads to a dark brown to black product that renders them unfit for human consumption and causes a great loss to the processing industry. To prevent sprouting and diseases, chemical treatments have been applied to tubers in storage. The recent withdrawal of these chemicals has increased the reliance on cold storage for potato tubers and highlighted the importance of CIS. Extensive research is required to produce a cultivar resistant to cold induced sweetening (CIS) along with good processing quality. The present work focused on increasing the understanding of the biological processes (physiological, biochemical and molecular) contributing to the initiation and/or controlling of CIS in potato tubers. The genetic basis of this trait was examined in progeny from a cross between potato cultivars with poor and excellent CIS response. This included molecular markers for candidate genes of known position on potato chromosomes to assess the role of different alleles involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Association studies between marker alleles and the phenotype of the progeny were performed. Among all the candidate genes, allele diversity for apoplastic invertase inhibitor gene was further studied from resistant and susceptible potato cultivars. In total five alleles were identified. Polymorphism was observed in both exon and intron regions. Three alleles had a unique substitution at the predicted junction of the signal peptide and mature protein. In order to identify the specific alleles that {{may play a role in}} resistance to CIS, transgenic potato plants have been produced with overexpression and antisense repression of apoplastic invertase inhibitor alleles. The results revealed that there were no consistent differences in CIS traits among the transgenic lines with the various alleles. However, the results of the transcript analysis showed much higher and stable transcripts levels of the apoplastic invertase inhibitor in the 1021 / 1 derived transgenic lines. This greater accumulation or stability of the apoplastic invertase inhibitor transcripts in 1021 / 1 may be a key factor contributing to the CIS trait of this cultivar. A key difference from previous studies involves the use of 1021 / 1, a potato cultivar known to have the very high resistance to CIS. This study provided to help identify key genes for the future genetic improvement of tuber properties with respect to long-term storage and processing characteristics. The development of a potato that does <b>not</b> <b>sweeten</b> in the cold will revolutionize the potato industry as this problem currently contributes 20 percent losses after crop harvest. Once identified, clones resistance to CIS could be used in potato breeding programmes for the development of cold-resistant processing cultivars. Eliminating the need for chemical application of sprout inhibitors will be helpful to develop sustainable approaches to benefit both mankind and potato industries. These biotechnological tools will be used to identify elite potatoes with improved properties of the tuber with respect to long-term storage and processing characteristics (cold-sweetening and after-cooking darkening) ...|$|R
40|$|Background—Sugar-sweetened {{beverage}} {{consumption is}} associated with weight gain and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Few studies have tested for a relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD) or intermediate biomarkers. The role of artificially sweetened beverages is also unclear. Methods and Results—We performed {{an analysis of the}} Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, a prospective cohort study including 42 883 men. Associations of cumulatively averaged sugar-sweetened (eg, sodas) and artificially sweetened (eg, diet sodas) beverage intake with incident fatal and nonfatal CHD (myocardial infarction) were examined with proportional hazard models. There were 3683 CHD cases over 22 years of follow-up. Participants in the top quartile of sugar-sweetened beverage intake had a 20 % higher relative risk of CHD than those in the bottom quartile (relative risk 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 09 – 1. 33; P for trend 0. 01) after adjustment for age, smoking, physical activity, alcohol, multivitamins, family history, diet quality, energy intake, body mass index, pre-enrollment weight change, and dieting. Artificially sweetened beverage consumption was not significantly associated with CHD (multivariate relative risk 1. 02; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 93 – 1. 12; P for trend 0. 28).
