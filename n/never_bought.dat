Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered {{for a few}} weeks to receive {{assurance}} that it still applied to him even though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|In the two Grand Punk Railroad novels, set during late 1931, {{the pair}} receive {{a letter from}} Ennis and decide to visit her in Manhattan. To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail Tracer has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria make up their minds to ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E

The Florida and Mid-South territories (along with those companies' rosters of wrestlers) were absorbed into WCW. Jim Crockett Promotions now owned NWA St. Louis, the Universal Wrestling Federation, Mid-Atlantic, Central States Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Georgia and Championship Wrestling from Florida as well.|$|E

25|$|Because {{under this}} {{approach}} land cannot be sown but existing plants can be tended and harvested, {{the approach is}} applied to orchards, vineyards, and other perennial crops. A beit din, or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. Individual consumers appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a legal arrangement is created whereby the crops themselves are <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the badatz is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine-Ottoman {{wars and}} the Ottoman wars in Europe brought {{large numbers of}} slaves into the Islamic world. To staff its bureaucracy, the Ottoman Empire {{established}} a janissary system which seized {{hundreds of thousands of}} Christian boys through the devşirme system. They were well cared for but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry. They were <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> or sold. The Empire gave them significant administrative and military roles. The system began about 1365; there were 135,000 janissaries in 1826, when the system ended. After the Battle of Lepanto, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the Ottoman fleet. Eastern Europe suffered a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves into jasyr. Seventy-five Crimean Tatar raids were recorded into Poland–Lithuania between 1474 and 1569.|$|E
25|$|Two {{locomotives}} were {{inherited from}} the predecessor companies: Moel Tryfan and Russell. When these proved insufficient, Baldwin 590 was acquired by H.F. Stephens and several Festiniog Railway locomotives saw regular use on the Welsh Highland Railway throughout its entire pre-closure existence from 1923 to 1937. 590 was planned {{to be part of}} a larger fleet to replace Moel Tryfan and Russell but it gained so little popularity that Stephens <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> another. By 1936 Moel Tryfan was out of use at Boston Lodge. When Russell and 590 were withdrawn the following year, they were placed in Dinas shed, but when the Second World War broke out, the Ministry of War came to see about appropriating them for the war effort. After some examination of the engines and questioning of those who had worked them, Russell (regarded as a good engine) was removed for further use, and 590 (seen as an unreliable, rough rider with difficult controls and inadequate adhesion) was broken up at Dinas. Despite the unpopularity of 590, the WHHR (Porthmadog) is currently refurbishing a similar Baldwin to act as a replica.|$|E

Chrysler UK continued {{with a range}} of increasingly outmoded rear-wheel-drive family cars such as the Hillman Avenger (introduced in 1970) and Hillman Hunter (introduced in 1966), while the Imp—which by now had most of its teething problems ironed out—was largely ignored by the new management.|$|R
500|$|Adams <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> a {{slave and}} {{declined}} on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, [...] "I have, through my whole life, held {{the practice of}} slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived {{for many years in}} times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." [...] Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should [...] "sleep for a time." [...] He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution, due to opposition from southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.|$|E
500|$|Talk {{of doing}} a {{crossover}} with Millennium {{had been going on}} even when both shows were still on the air. After Millennium was cancelled, however, The X-Files staff realized that a crossover made sense. Despite this, writing the story proved difficult. The writers of the episode did not know whether to write an episode that dealt solely with wrapping-up Millennium or if they should feature elements of Millennium intermixed within an X-Files investigation. The writers eventually went with the latter. Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, explained that from the planning stages of the episode, the staff's intentions were not to focus solely on a wrap-up for Millennium, but rather to answer the question of [...] "what would happen if Frank Black came into Mulder and Scully's world?" [...] Gilligan also maintains that the episode was not solely written to bring closure to the Millennium arc, but also as a way to finally write an episode of The X-Files about zombies. He explained: [...] "It wasn't about the plot as much as getting [...] down in the basement of this creepy old house with these zombies climbing up out of the ground, and having to [...] in the head." [...] According to Gilligan, another part of the inspiration for the episode was the fear surrounding the perceived Year 2000 problem. This was an issue for both digital and non-digital documentation and data storage situations which resulted from the practice of abbreviating a four-digit year to two digits. However, many people believed that it would signal a disaster or potentially the end of the world. Gilligan later joked that he was [...] "proud to say I <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> into any of that Y2K BS for a minute!" ...|$|E

2500|$|A third {{category}} of wine fraud {{relates to the}} investment wine industry.

In the US, investors have been duped by fraudulent investment wine firms too. Independent guidelines to potential wine investors are now available.|$|E
2500|$|By 1861 {{there were}} several small river mill settlements, some mining camps and about nine or ten towns (seven platted) in Jasper County, Missouri. [...] Avilla was newly formed and [...] "bustling" [...] with over one hundred {{citizens}} (compare with the county seat of Carthage, Missouri that had an estimated population between four and five hundred at that time). As {{in all of the}} border state towns, families in Avilla were split over the question of Missouri secession, and some were slave owners. [...] Dr. Jaquillian M. Stemmons actually owned eight inherited slaves himself; however, he and the other town leaders were Unconditional Unionists and remained aligned with newly elected president Abraham Lincoln. [...] Dr. J.M. Stemmons <b>never</b> <b>bought</b> or sold slaves and was known to have retained his family inherited slaves simply for their very own safety. [...] He supported the abolition of slavery in the United States. [...] Avilla's political alignment was in sharp contrast to neighboring Sarcoxie to the south where the first regional Confederate flag was raised. The rebel [...] "Stars & Bars" [...] also flew over Carthage [...] to the west in 1861, following an early Confederate victory at the Battle of Carthage on July 5. [...] At a distance of only two counties away, Arkansas had already become the ninth state to secede, and on October 28, 1861 Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson met with the Missouri General Assembly in Neosho and declared Missouri as the twelfth state to join the Confederate States of America. In spite of being engulfed by the Confederacy, the United States flag continued to fly over Avilla, boldly hoist {{to the top of a}} flagpole in the town center park and guarded by the townsmen. [...] Schoolhouses were closed and many families evacuated their women and small children to safer areas in other states.|$|E

5000|$|However a {{major problem}} with this {{approach}} was that European authorities were very reluctant to certificate such schemes as they undermined the well proven concepts of [...] "pure" [...] autoland systems.
