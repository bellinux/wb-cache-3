5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs {{for the benefit of}} their local prefecture or county. This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.|$|E

The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> is a complex concept consisting of many interests that occur at several levels, converging towards assuring security, freedom, justice and welfare. The state is the main defender of the <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> has as objective the definition of the national development priorities in order to ensure the survival and the prosperity of the country concerned, by following a trend of sustainable development and it is based on several factors, including foreign direct investments. These are a necessity for the development of an economy, especially when national savings do not meet the needs of capital for investments. But in order to serve the <b>national</b> <b>interest,</b> foreign direct investments have to be channeled towards the areas of <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> After the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> is defined, there are presented the characteristics of the economic <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> and the ways through which foreign direct investments can support the achievement of the economic interest of an economy. Then, the article highlights a few of the areas toward which foreign direct investments should be directed in Romania in order to sustain the sustainable development of our country...|$|R

5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for {{religious and ethnic}} minorities, and limit {{the powers of the}} government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> and challenges.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour.

Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those who viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
40|$|The 1976 {{amendments}} to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) were primarily aimed at enabling the statute to better accommodate the demands placed on coastal resources {{by an increase in}} domestic energy exploration and production. The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision (Section 306 (c) (8) confronts the problem of potential conflicts arising out of the pursuit of equally important coastal zone management goals as stated in the CZMA. The CZMA states that there is a <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> in the 2 ̆ 2 effective management, beneficial use, protection and development of the Coastal Zone 2 ̆ 2. Due to the increasing likelihood of more energy facility sittings in the coastal zone Congress {{wanted to make sure that}} 2 ̆ 2 adequate consideration 2 ̆ 2 was given to energy facility siting proposals. The <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision and attendant federal regulations are designed to ensure that each federally approved coastal zone management program treats such proposals in a comprehensive fashion. Congress 2 ̆ 7 wording of the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision is the cause of much controversy. 2 ̆ 2 Adequate consideration 2 ̆ 2 is subject to various interpretations by state and federal officials and private industry. Chapter I reviews the CZMA 2 ̆ 7 s legislative history, court proceedings, state and federal records and private industry comments to display the complexity involved in interpreting the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision. Chapter II evaluates how well Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastal zone management programs comply with the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> clause. Both states compliance procedures are subject to question as there have not been any specific cases involving the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> to this date. Massachusetts and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s programs are ambiguous with regard to how final decisions on <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> facility sittings are made. Chapter III presents findings and conclusions with regard to Massachusetts and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s compliance with the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision. Program recommendations are made pursuant to the goals as stated by Congress in the CZMA. The major finding in both states is that there is a lack of adequate <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> assessment criteria. Decision makers presently review federal and private industry impact assessments, however, they have nothing to base their evaluations on. It is advocated here that a facility should be subject to <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> scrutiny, whenever a NEPA assessment is required. After such designation, federally promulgated <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> assessment guidelines should be available for state and local decision makers. Such standards will unify each state 2 ̆ 7 s approach to <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> facility siting and ensure equal treatment of project proposals. Specifically, Massachusetts should provide for better consideration of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> facilities valued at less than five million dollars. Presently, the Energy Facility Siting Council is responsible for fulfilling the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision, but is not legally bound to do so. Measures should be taken to depoliticize the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> process in Massachusetts. Rhode Island does not have an energy facility siting body and is in need of an adequate energy facility planning process. The Coastal Resources Management Council is the best mechanism available for implementing this planning process. Rhode Island also needs a stronger regulatory mechanism to ensure that the regional benefit clause of the CZMA is not ignored. Non-compliance with the regional benefit clause could undermine the effects of the <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> provision. An energy facility siting process similar to Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Council would ensure such compliance. Lastly, regional consideration of <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> proposals is advocated in an effort to improve upon the comprehensive approach now attempted in considering the <b>national</b> <b>interest...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own.

The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar.

5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|E
5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of the Provincial Assembly included defining provincial and municipal budgets and levying the taxes necessary to support them; providing primary and secondary schools (higher education was {{the responsibility of the}} national government); oversight and control of provincial and municipal expenditures; and providing for law enforcement and maintenance of police forces. The Assemblies also controlled the creation and abolishment of, and salaries for, positions within provincial and municipal civil services. The nomination, suspension and dismissal of civil servants was reserved for the president (governor) of the province, but how and under what circumstances he could exercise these prerogatives was delineated by the Assembly. The expropriation of private property (with due monetary compensation) for provincial or municipal interests was also a right of the Assembly. In effect, the Provincial Assembly could enact any kind of law—with no ratification by Parliament—so long as such local laws did not violate or encroach upon the Constitution. However, provinces were not permitted to legislate in the areas of criminal law, criminal procedure laws, civil rights and obligations, the armed forces, the national budget or matters concerning <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> such as foreign relations.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E
5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR.

The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> Once full operational capability was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.|$|E
