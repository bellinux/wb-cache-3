40|$|Individual {{participation}} in preventive care {{may depend on}} preventive health behavior in an individual’s peer group. This paper analyzes {{the importance of social}} interactions in the context of new social policies (PROGRESA) in Mexico that aim to increase the {{participation in}} different types of preventive care. We follow the promising approach of analyzing social interactions in real world peer groups. Identification of social interactions is based on a partial-population design. Results indicate that PROGRESA succeeded in increasing preventive care usage among program eligible households. In addition, endogenous social interactions increase preventive care usage both among eligibles and <b>non-eligibles</b> for various types of prevention. The overall treatment effect of PROGRESA on prevention can be decomposed in a direct effect related to financial incentives and an indirect effect related to social interactions. The indirect effect accounts for 10 % up to 58 % of the total treatment effect. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} allocating a binary treatment among a target population based on discrete and continuous observed covariates. The goal is to maximize the mean social utlity of an eventual outcome when a budget constraint limits what fraction of the population can be treated. We propose a treatment allocation procedure based on sample data from randomized treatment assignment. We examine this procedure {{in the light of}} statistical decision theory and derive asymptotic frequentist properties of the allocation rule and the welfare generated from it. The resulting distribution theory is used to conduct inference on the welfare loss resulting from restricted covariate choice and on the dual value, i. e. the minimum resources needed to attain aspecific average welfare via efficient treatment assignment. The methodology is applied to the optimal provision of anti-malaria bed net subsidies, using data from a randomized experiment conducted in western Kenya. We find that a government which can afford to distribute bed net subsidies to only 50 % of its target population can, with an efficient allocation rule based on multiple covariates, increase bed-net use by 8 percentage points (25 percent) relative to random allocation and by 4 percentage points (11 percent) relative to one based on wealth only. Our methods do not rely on functional form assumptions and can be extended to situations encompassing conditional cash transfers, imperfect treatment take-up and spillover effects on <b>non-eligibles.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The study compared the relative effectiveness of two types of residential treatment in reducing the subsequent offending of delinquent boys. It was undertaken in two house-units of an approved school in the West of England which admitted delinquent boys {{between the ages of}} 13 - 15 on entry. Under comparison were a therapeutic community (the Experimental or E House), and a traditional regime (the Control or C House) which emphasised training rather than treatment as a means of rehabilitating young offenders. A controlled trial design was used, boys considered eligible for treatment being randomly allocated between the E and C Houses. Boys entering the School but considered ineligible were sent to a Third House. (Comparison data is included for this group.) Data on the treatment processes and boys' reactions were collected, and a standardized two-year follow-up of those released, using data from criminal records, was carried out. Main Topics : Background characteristics of the boys at entry; post hoc determination of eligibility criteria used to govern entry into the controlled trial subsample; success of the random allocation process; the treatment processes and boys' reactions to them; a standardized two-year follow-up to measure the post-treatment reconviction rate of E and C regimes; comparisons with a third regime, housing the <b>non-eligibles,</b> which {{was not part of the}} controlled trial.

In addition to having a Baccalauréat, Chamakh is also very interested in politics and, in February 2010, voiced his support for the Democratic Movement (MoDem) political party ahead of the upcoming regional elections. In the 2010 regional elections, Chamakh was, surprisingly, listed as a candidate by the MoDem for the Gironde department in the Aquitaine region. The lead deputy of the party, Jean Lassalle, stated on the decision to name Chamakh to the ballot: [...] "I want to gather all the forces of Aquitaine to sustain our region, and Marouane is one of those forces who Aquitaine needs."

60|$|When Augustine, pale as death, {{was found}} {{lying on the}} sofa, and pleaded sudden sick-headache {{as the cause of}} his distress, she {{recommended}} to him to smell of hartshorn; and when the paleness and headache came on week after week, she only said that she never thought Mr. St. Clare was sickly; but it seems he was very liable to sick-headaches, and that it was a very unfortunate thing for her, because he didn't enjoy going into company with her, and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they were just married. Augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life. Marie never had possessed much capability of affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she had, had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a selfishness the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of any claims but her own. From her infancy, she had been surrounded with servants, who lived only to study her caprices; the idea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her, even in distant perspective. Her father, whose only child she had been, had never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility; and when she entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an heiress, she had, of course, all the eligibles and <b>non-eligibles</b> of the other sex sighing at her feet, and she had no doubt that Augustine was a most fortunate man in having obtained her. It is a great mistake to suppose that a woman with no heart will be an easy creditor in the exchange of affection. There is not on earth a more merciless exactor of love from others than a thoroughly selfish woman; and the more unlovely she grows, the more jealously and scrupulously she exacts love, to the uttermost farthing. When, therefore, St. Clare began to drop off those gallantries and small attentions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship, he found his sultana no way ready to resign her slave; there were abundance of tears, poutings, and small tempests, there were discontents, pinings, upbraidings. St. Clare was good-natured and self-indulgent, and sought to buy off with presents and flatteries; and when Marie became mother to a beautiful daughter, he really felt awakened, for a time, to something like tenderness.|$|R
