5|$|The kakapo {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>falcon</b> and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.|$|E

40|$|The {{breeding}} behaviour {{and development of}} <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco novaeseelandiae) were recorded at 2 nests in Kaingaroa Forest during a 4 -month period up to 2 March 2007. This covered the later part of incubation, and the entire nestling and early post-fledging periods. Incubation was shared between parents; the male primarily incubated the eggs, during which time the female hunted. The male only provided occasional prey for the female. Brooding by both parents was intensive for the first 6 days and then gradually declined until the chicks reached 14 days old at which point it ceased. Assisted feeding of the chicks was almost always undertaken by the female. The male’s primary role during the nestling period was prey delivery. During the early nestling period the female spent {{the majority of the}} time brooding chicks before shifting to hunting for the young. falsePublishe...|$|R

40|$|We tracked two {{adult and}} three {{juvenile}} <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco novaeseelandiae) in Kaingaroa Forest pine plantation from 2002 to 2008 using Argos satellite technology. The home ranges for both adults and juveniles varied, ranging between 44 and 587 &#x 2009;km 2. The falcons occasionally utilised areas {{outside the forest}} and used stands of all ages within the forest, generally in proportion to their availability. For the most part, the juveniles remained within ca. 8 &#x 2009;km of their nests and dispersed at 58, 69, and 68 days after fledging.

40|$|Prey {{remains and}} regurgitated pellets of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>falcons</b> Falco novaeseelandiae, from Adams I in the Auckland Is, were {{collected}} {{to determine the}} diet of this species in the subantarctic part of their range. Dissection of pellets revealed 1588 bones from 215 individuals of 18 species of birds preyed upon. Feathers associated with the remains supported the bone identifications. Rangle stones were also collected. The presence of procellariiform seabirds in the diet of falcons suggests some nocturnal hunting. While the single most frequent prey species was the bellbird (Anthornis melanura), Antarctic prion (Pachyptila desolata) and subantarctic diving petrel (Pelecanoides urinatrix exsul) were also common. When measured by prey weight, endemic land birds such as Auckland I rail (Lewinia muelleri), Auckland I snipe (Coenocorypha aucklandica aucklandica), and Auckland I teal (Anas aucklandica) constituted {{a third of the}} prey. Like many island birds, these ground-dwelling species cannot co-exist with introduced mammalian predators, but survive despite predation by native falcons. Noel H. S. Hyde; Trevor H. Worth...|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{management}} {{is an important}} area of conservation {{and has become a}} priority for many countries and organisations around the world. One of the fundamental components of a sound wildlife management plan is a good understanding of a species’ behaviour and habitat. For animals within inaccessible environments, satellite tracking provides a powerful tool for revealing information on animal movements and their habitat requirements. In this dissertation, the conservation benefits and technical effectiveness of satellite tracking are examined through four case studies representing a diverse range of threatened species studied for periods between six months and five years. The studies revealed important ecological insights on the in situ movement and behaviour of the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), Kruger National Park, South Africa; the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> bush <b>falcon</b> (Falco novaeseelandiae), Central North Island, New Zealand; the estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), Darwin, Australia; and the northern royal albatross (Diomedea sanfordi), Taiaroa Head, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> and Chile. For each of these studies, satellite telemetry provided location data enabling analyses of the animals’ movements and home ranges, and these analyses inform specific management recommendations. For example, the long time series study on African elephants highlighted the importance of developing reciprocal animal management policies where cross-boundary movements of animals occurred between adjacent parks. The strengths and weaknesses of different satellite tracking systems are compared and guidelines developed to assist wildlife managers in selecting the best technology to suit their research needs. An assessment of the trade-offs between the technical features built into transmitters and the associated cost is also presented. The study shows how the use of satellite tracking systems provides conservation agencies with a better understanding of wildlife behaviour and strengthens their ability to improve wildlife management planning...|$|R
5000|$|The Chapel of the Snows is a non-denominational Christian church {{located at}} the United States' McMurdo Station on Ross Island, Antarctica {{and is one of}} eight churches on Antarctica. The chapel is the second southernmost {{religious}} building in the world and has regular Catholic and Protestant services. During the Austral Summer, the chapel is staffed by rotational chaplains. The U.S. Air National Guard supplies Protestant chaplains and the Diocese of Christchurch supplies Catholic priests. The chapel is also host to services and meetings for other faith groups such as Latter Day Saints, Baha'i, and Buddhism and non-religious groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. These meetings are dependent on lay leadership to be the points of contact and facilitators. The building itself may hold up to 63 worshippers. [...] The original Chapel of the Snows burned down in 1978 and was replaced with a new temporary chapel. That makeshift building was converted to other uses after the current chapel was built and has also since burned. The current chapel, dedicated in 1989, features custom stained glass featuring the Antarctica Continent, the Erebus Chalice (during Austral Summers only), and memorabilia from the US Navy's historic involvement in Operation Deep Freeze. The altar of the Chapel of the Snows comes from St Saviour's Chapel in Lyttelton, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> where Robert <b>Falcon</b> Scott worshiped prior to embarking on the ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>falcon</b> or kārearea (Falco novaeseelandiae) is New Zealand's only falcon and {{the only}} {{remaining}} diurnal bird of prey endemic to New Zealand.

The kārearea is the country’s most threatened bird of prey with only around 3000-5000 breeding pairs remaining.|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the bird family Falconidae, the Kārearea or <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>falcon</b> is mainly found in heavy bush and the steep high country in the South Island, and is rarely seen north of a line through the central area of the North Island.
