40|$|The {{argument}} {{presented in}} this paper, very simply, is that the closed book, invigilated final examination has become an anachronism. Some universities have been {{doing the same thing}} now for centuries. Can a business school claiming to be at the ‘leading edge ’ of business education afford to be associated with such an antiquated practice? There has always been a question mark over the usefulness of examinations. Entwistle and Entwistle (1991), for example, are in no doubt that examinations do not assess deep conceptual understanding and process skills. Indeed, the anecdotal evidence one often hears from students is that ‘cramming ’ the night before amounts to ‘datadumping’ on the day, with little knowledge retention thereafter. Is this experience the exception or the rule? Several hours scouring the education databases trying to locate an article in a refereed education journal published in the last 30 years extolling the virtues of closed book, invigilated final examinations produces a <b>nil</b> <b>return.</b> The defence of the traditionalists for the continued use of closed book, invigilated final examinations over openbook, unsupervised final assessments {{is that we have to}} have the former because students will cheat unless we supervise them.

The Estates Management Statistics dataset (EMS) is an initiative which began in 1999 through the Association of University Estates Directors and was jointly funded by the UK funding councils. In 2008 / 09 {{it was announced that}} the Funding Councils were no longer going to provide direct funding for this activity and HESA was asked to take on the responsibility. The EMS dataset is designed to provide standardised, reliable and useful property information to help managers understand current performance, promote sharing of best practice and drive improvements. The dataset provides rich information on the estates of all higher education institutions in England and Wales. For example it includes data on environmental staff employed by each institution, numbers of sites and buildings, site area, teaching space, functional stability and student bed spaces. All higher education institutions in England and Wales must make an Estate Management Statistics return. Not all fields are mandatory. More specifically, the Estate Management Statistics dataset contains mandatory questions that higher education institutions must complete. This includes information on building conditions, waste consumption and energy emissions. Scottish higher education institutions do not have to submit data but are encouraged to do so. Where this is the case, they must still submit a <b>nil</b> <b>return</b> to HESA. The Estate Management Statistics dataset has been collected since 1999. However, HESA took responsibility for the collection from 2008 / 09. Updates to the Estate Management Statistics dataset are completed on an annual basis between the 1 st August and the 31 st July. As an indicator of the timing of data release, data for the previous year become available in May. Although HESA operates a rigorous data quality control system, {{due to the nature of}} the information collected, institutions may have to provide estimates rather than actual figures. Be aware that some institutions change their name over time. The University of London is a confederal organisation and has different colleges and schools documented in the dataset. Finally, despite the fact that the return is mandatory for higher education institutions in England and Wales, some institutions still do not make a return and this should be checked at the time of application. In general, the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) collects a wide variety of information about higher education in the UK, covering students at university and their destinations once they leave, university staff, finances and estate management. The HESA website provides a summary EMS data, analysis and publications which are available to view, download, or purchase directly. Research Usage and Linkage The Estate Management Statistics is a rich source of information and can be used to look at a wide variety of green, energy and efficiency related performance issues across higher institutions. In particular it has been used to consider the effect of growth of the student population and the corresponding growth in space and to help measure carbon emissions. People & Planet are a student network in Britain which campaigns to help protect the environment. They produce an annual Green League which ranks each UK University by their ethical and environmental performance. The EMS dataset is used to help compile this league. Up until 2009 / 10, the Higher Education Funding Council for England produced an annual report on the EMS dataset. In theory the dataset can be linked to other HESA datasets to build a detailed profile of higher education institutions, their staff, students and finance. </div...|$|E
