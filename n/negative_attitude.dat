5|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> towards Schubert's piano sonatas persisted {{well into}} the twentieth century. Only around the centennial of Schubert's death did these works begin to receive serious {{attention}} and critical acclaim, with the writings of Donald Francis Tovey, and the public performances of Artur Schnabel and Eduard Erdmann. During the following decades, the sonatas, and especially the final trilogy, received growing attention, {{and by the end}} of the century, came to be regarded as essential members of the classical piano repertoire, frequently appearing on concert programs, studio recordings, and musicological writings. Some late twentieth century scholars have even argued that Schubert's last sonatas should rank together with Beethoven's most mature sonatas. The B-flat Sonata, the last of them all, has gained the highest acclaim and popularity among the three.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately {{the revolutionary}} {{excesses of the}} period would prove {{disastrous}} for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure {{at the hands of}} more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E

His performances earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation praised his stamina, spin and ability to bowl on all kinds of pitches but noted that he was easily discouraged and had a <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> if circumstances went against him. He achieved his highest season total of wickets to date, taking 166 at an average of 13.84, and came third in both the Yorkshire and national bowling averages. His best performance came in the first match of the season, when he took seven wickets for 13 against Glamorgan as they were dismissed for 63. Later in the season, he took a hat-trick against Warwickshire while claiming five for 42. With the bat, Macaulay scored 463 runs at an average of 18.52. There were no international matches that season, but Macaulay was selected for The Rest in a Test trial against England in which he took just one wicket.|$|E

40|$|Compassionate release, {{or medical}} parole, allows the early release of terminally ill {{offenders}} {{so that they}} may spend time with loved ones. Such programs have received little attention from psychological researchers. This study examines attitudes of undergraduate students toward compassionate release and factors that affect these attitudes. A total of 163 participants completed questionnaires regarding attitudes toward compassionate release, attitudes toward prisoners, and fear of AIDS. Results indicate that undergraduate students have <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward compassionate release of offenders and toward prisoners, in general, with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward prisoners significantly associated with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward compassionate release. Fear of AIDS, however, was not associated with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward compassionate release, as was expected.

5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The <b>negative</b> <b>attitude</b> to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to exploit {{regional}} variation in <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards immigration in order to analyse whether the mobility decisions and the labour market outcomes of refugees are affected by such attitudes.

We choose to analyse income as the labour market outcome variable as it is affected by both wages and employment.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} personal, {{professional}} and institutional predictors of health institution personnel's attitudes regarding access to healthcare for refugee claimants in Canada. In Montreal, {{the staff of}} five hospitals and two primary care centres (n = 1772) completed an online questionnaire documenting demographics, occupation, exposure to refugee claimant patients, and attitudes regarding healthcare access for refugee claimants. We used structural equations modeling to investigate the associations between professional and institutional factors with latent functions of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward refugee's access to healthcare. Younger participants, social workers, participants from primary care centres, and from 1 st migrant generation had the lowest scores of <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Respondents who experienced contact with refugees had lower scores of <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> (B = - 14 % standard deviation [SD]; 95 % CI: - 24, - 4 %). However, direct contact with refugees increased scores of <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> in the institution with the most <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> by 36 % SD (95 % CI: 1, 71 %). Findings suggest that institutions influence individuals' attitudes about refugee claimants' {{access to health care}} and that, in an institutional context of <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes,</b> contact with refugees may further confirm negative perceptions about this vulnerable group...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the views of primary school {{teachers}} with <b>negative</b> and positive <b>attitudes</b> towards rubrics comparatively in terms of various variables. 292 teachers from 17 primary schools in Ankara province of Turkey participated into the study. The data obtained from the views of teachers with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards rubrics were examined with figures. The findings indicated that the teachers with positive attitudes towards the rubrics benefited from the rubrics more than the teachers with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> when they were evaluating the achievement of the students in performance tasks. Both the teachers with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> stated that they had knowledge about the rubrics and they used the course books while getting this information. Moreover, the teachers with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> consulted their colleagues more than the teachers with positive attitudes. It was observed that the teachers with positive attitudes prepared the rubrics themselves more often than the teachers with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> and they used the information obtained from the rubrics for “observing the development of students’ higher order thinking skills” and “observing to what extent the students used their knowledge and skills in real life situations”.

The hypothesis was that individuals feel Asian Americans constitute a realistic threat because they possess too many positive qualities (Ho & Jackson, 2001). The first study surveyed factors related to Asian Americans, including positive stereotypes, <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes,</b> and threats reported by participants, adapted from Stephan et al (2002). The second study used scenarios to place participants in a situation to test the effects of realistic threat in a classroom context. Realistic threat proved to mediate the relationship between positive stereotypes (i. e. too good) and <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> (i. e. threatening) in the first study.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recent work {{on attitudes}} toward homosexuals {{promotes}} {{the view that}} males typically have more <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> than females; and African Americans have more <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> than their white counter-parts. However, among African Americans, women {{are thought to have}} the greatest <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> because they perceive themselves as competing for a limited pool of black male partners. This study uses the National Black Politics Study to examine African American gender differences in attitudes toward homosexual men. Multivariate findings show that of the variables analyzed: (1) Among African American females, age, income, education, and urban residence are statistically significant; and (2) among African American males, frequency of religious attendance was the only statisti-cally significant variable. It is, therefore, argued that black masculinity ex-plains the gendered differences and that <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> within th...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S. W., Social Work) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. This study {{examined}} possible predictors such as hypermasculinity and ethnicity in explaining <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards the LGBTQ student community {{in a college}} campus {{in the context of}} queer theory within the paradigm of social constructionism. A non-probability sample of 158 undergraduate students was studied using the Hypermasculinity Inventory (HMI ??? Modified) consisting of 26 scale questions and Herek???s (1988) Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) scale. Demographic information such as age, ethnicity, college major and gender were collected to contextualize the study responses. The hypothesis that hypermasculinity scores are significantly correlated with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards LGBTQ population was tested as was the hypothesis that ethnic background is correlated with <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards individuals with the LGBTQ identity. Study findings indicate a positive weak correlation of (r =. 227, N= 158, p<. 05) between hypermasculinity and <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards LGBTQ and a positive weak correlation between ethnicity and attitudes toward LGBTQ population (r=. 154, N= 158, p<. 05). In light of the small value of correlation coefficients the following predictions must be considered with caution. The regression equations are: <b>Negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward LGBT community members (Y) =. 309 +. 332 (hypermasculinity) and <b>Negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward LGBT community (Y) = -. 199 (ethnicity) + 2. 193. Although the possible levels of variations that can be explained in the dependent variable, the <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward LGBTQ population, due to the variation in the independent variables of hyper masculinity and ethnicity are relatively small the fact that as scores on hypermasculinity increases, the scores on <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> also increases with an ascending slope is a significant finding in this study. This relationship is worthy of further investigation. These findings need further examination with random samples and more rigorous standardized scales to measure the relationship between <b>negative</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward LGBTQ population in particular and the hypermasculinity scores. The findings hold relevant implications for the field of social work in broadening the narrowly defined gender conceptualizations thus warranting advocacy at the macro level, and in providing direct services to clients/students.

In the present research, we investigate whether the positive and negative aspects of user attitudes are separable using constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model, one of the most frequently tested models in information systems research.
