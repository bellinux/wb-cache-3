On {{the basis of the}} NIST security model, this paper describes three security control schemes in safety management model and the relationship between the security service and security mechanism in the <b>network</b> information <b>security</b> architecture. On this basis, a <b>network</b> information <b>security</b> system model is proposed, which is composed of three parts, namely, the core layer, the logic layer and the implementation layer.

40|$|Abstract—The OpenFlow (OF) {{switching}} specification {{represents an}} innovative and open standard for enabling the dynamic programming of flow control policies in production networks. Unfortunately, thus far researchers have {{paid little attention}} to the development of methods for verifying that dynamic flow policies inserted within an OpenFlow network do not violate the <b>network’s</b> underlying <b>security</b> policy. We introduce FLOVER, a model checking system which verifies that the aggregate of flow policies instantiated within an OpenFlow network does not violate the <b>network’s</b> <b>security</b> policy. We have implemented FLOVER using the Yices SMT solver, which we then integrated into NOX, a popular OpenFlow network controller. FLOVER provides NOX a formal validation of the OpenFlow <b>network’s</b> <b>security</b> posture. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—What is a <b>security</b> <b>network?</b> In this paper, a <b>security</b> <b>network</b> is {{considered}} as a diagram of security systems deployed in different places in a guard zone. For a <b>security</b> <b>network,</b> its vulnerability is an important metric to judge whether its protection effectiveness is good or not. How to evaluate the vulnerability of a <b>security</b> <b>network?</b> We bring forward a protection model of a security system based on Neyman-Pearson criterion. According to the model, we propose methods to determine the most vulnerable path of a <b>security</b> <b>network.</b> The protection probability of the most vulnerable path is {{used to assess the}} vulnerability of a <b>security</b> <b>network.</b> Ultimately, we can gain insight about the vulnerability of a <b>security</b> <b>network.</b> Keywords-security network; vulnerability evaluation; neyman-pearson criterion; protection probability.

In {{this kind}} of attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in IP packets sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.|$|E
