5|$|While {{attending}} {{her college}} reunion at Salve Regina University with Peter, Lois spots her old roommate, Naomi Robinson, {{with whom she}} had a brief lesbian relationship in college. Peter is shocked but excited to discover that Lois was bisexual in college. Naomi indicates that she would like to discuss an important matter with them at their home. Assuming that he will participate in a threesome with Lois and Naomi, Peter sends Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian out of the house. After Naomi arrives, she introduces her husband Dale. Peter expects that they will now be participating in an orgy, and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes. When they clear the air to a dismayed Peter that they're <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> sex, Naomi and Dale tell Lois and Peter they've had trouble conceiving and ask Lois to be a surrogate mother for them, and Lois considers the matter.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

25|$|The islanders {{want the}} top soil removed, {{but the money}} is <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the cleanup. The {{opportunity}} for some Bikini islanders to potentially relocate back to their home island creates a dilemma. While the island may be habitable in the near term, {{virtually all of the}} islanders alive today have never lived there. Most of the younger generation have never visited. , unemployment in the Marshall Islands was at about 40 percent. The population is growing at a four-percent growth rate, so increasing numbers are taking advantage of terms in the Marshall Islands’ Compact of Free Association that allow them to obtain jobs in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific dock stood {{just north}} of Colman Dock {{at the foot of}} Marion Street. The {{original}} dock was built in 1910 as the largest wooden pier on the West Coast. It was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> long. On July 30, 1914, it was swept away by an explosion and massive fire. The cause has never been determined. Five people died and 29 more were injured. The flames were hot enough to scorch several parts of Colman Dock, but the fire department managed to contain the fire largely to the one pier. A replacement dock was promptly built, and survived until 1964, when it was replaced by waiting area for automobiles boarding ferries at the new ferry terminal.|$|E
25|$|After a short truce {{which ended}} in April 1258, Henry III called upon his feudal host to {{assemble}} in Chester in preparations for yet another Welsh expedition when political sentiment in England shifted against Henry III’s government and threatened to swell into a constitutional crisis. England’s nobility was dutifully armed for campaigning when they gathered at Chester by 17 June, but they were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a renewed war but for redress against the misgovernment of Henry III. The war against Gwynedd was now completely eclipsed by the mounting domestic crisis in England. Meanwhile, the Welsh of Cemais and Peuliniog raided Earl William of Pembroke lands, with Earl William blaming the nascent 'reformerer' party for spurring the Welsh into open revolt. Faced with a pending rebellion, Henry III came to terms with Llywelyn II. The two parties agreed to a 13-month truce in which Llywelyn retained all of his conquest on condition that Henry III could provision the castles of Diserth and Deganwy.|$|E

500|$|There {{were many}} critics among {{politicians}} and officials. Representatives {{of the police}} force in Sydney {{were among the most}} severe, and New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, the head of APEC's lead security agency, was angered because the comedians could have been shot by police snipers, who were [...] "clearly... there because they mean business. They're <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> show." [...] In response, Licciardello expressed his faith in the snipers' professional ability: [...] "They are highly trained, competent people and they're not going to shoot people if they're in an Osama bin Laden costume if they clearly don't pose a threat".|$|E
500|$|... wrong {{decisions}} and about how" [...] {{and how the}} Christian church is <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> her. Hall began writing the song around 2000 about a girl in his youth group; it ultimately encompassed around 15-20 girls who due to their father not being there for them tried to find intimacy elsewhere, ultimate [...] " [...] themselves away to {{the first person who}} loves them". Hall said that [...] "We [...] attach identities to people, saying, 'It’s too late to reach this person,' or 'This person here, there’s still some good there, so we should try on this one,' or 'This one’s a lost cause, we just need {{to get him out of}} here'. That’s a scary place to live if you’re that person — if you didn’t make the church’s 'list'".|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{shows how}} Chicanas, like women {{of many other}} ethnicities, {{internalize}} these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In The House on Mango Street, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman’s hips have: [...] "They’re good for holding a baby when you’re cooking, Rachel says... You need them to dance, says Lucy... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know." [...] Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her [...] "sexual initiation"—an assault {{by a group of}} Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> her, but [...] "by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives.|$|E

[...] Weldon's office initially denied that he attended the event and when shown the invitation showing him as a cosponsor {{said that he had}} been unable to attend the event. They retracted those claims upon being shown photos proving his attendance, claiming that his participation was [...] "limited to his attendance." [...] Investigative reporter John Gorenfeld then found a photo depicting Weldon as giving the opening [...] "congratulatory remarks" [...] from the stage. Weldon gave a speech about his recent trip to Libya in front of a photo of him pinning an award on Muammar al-Gaddafi. A spokesman for Weldon then said he [...] "was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the crowning" [...] and that [...] "If we had known that Reverend Moon was going to attend the event, be crowned and make an unbelievably interesting speech, the congressman likely would not have attended." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{was sent}} to Cheltenham College in 1841 {{when he was only}} seven, but after he had been there a year he {{was sent to}} a school kept by the Rev. Samuel Ollis Garrard in Gloucestershire. He {{attended}} the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1848, where he was a contemporary and friend of Charles George Gordon (no relation, later 'Gordon of Khartoum') and Thomas Bland Strange (later known as [...] "Gunner Jingo"). There Gordon appears to have been good at sports, but not studious and certainly undisciplined – [...] and like Richard Henry Horne, he was asked to leave. Gordon was again admitted a pupil at Cheltenham College. He was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> long – he appears to have left in the middle of 1852 – but the story that he was expelled from Cheltenham is without foundation. Then Gordon was sent to the Royal Grammar School Worcester in 1852. Gordon began to lead a wild and aimless life, contracted debts, and was a great anxiety to his father, who at last decided that his son should go to Australia and make a fresh start in 1853 to join the mounted police with a letter of introduction to the Governor.|$|E

2500|$|William Otterburn-Hall {{describes}} the men as close around the star [...] "like a football scrum after a loose ball." [...] He relates {{that they were}} a [...] "friendly bunch" [...] who, when Elvis began to sing just for fun during his interview, followed [...] "suit, singing, clowning, all on their feet". According to Patrick Humphries, they [...] "acted as Elvis' bodyguards, babysitters, drug procurers, girl-getters, mates and car buyers." [...] The author also mentions other functions of the guys: [...] "various members of the Memphis Mafia had ... played vital roles in keeping Elvis' numerous dirty secrets out of the public eye. A couple of them had been arrested with false prescriptions attempting to collect drugs for Elvis, quite a few had taken physical hits in the service of protecting Elvis and none were paid more than $500 a week. For that they were often shouted at, abused and belittled by the King when he felt like it." [...] noted Buzz Cason. Marty Lacker states, [...] "Everyone had assigned responsibilities and they were far from leeches, hangers on or whatever else they were called." [...] "They all had jobs to do so that Elvis could do his and as far as being there for the money, that's laughable because there really wasn't much in that area to be there for." [...] Marty went on to say, [...] "Most of us were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the money, we were there because we all cared about Elvis and each other like brothers." ...|$|E
