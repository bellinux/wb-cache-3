5|$|During the 2015 Labour {{leadership}} election, Andy Burnham {{said that}} he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership. A graduate tax has been criticised because there would be <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> recover the money from students who move to a different country, or foreign students who return home.|$|E

5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus {{to decide between}} the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the genitalia engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts and <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> stop the clock, Florida State {{was able to}} run out the remaining time {{in the game and}} secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E
5|$|In this context, a {{dependency}} graph is a graph {{that has}} a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because there would be <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.|$|E

5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E
5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight. An interruption-save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E

5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible {{due to the lack}} of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff, Teller, {{was named}} after Teller from the {{illusion}} and comedy duo Penn and Teller. The pair had wanted to appear on an episode of the show, but when Chris Carter could find <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> work them into the show this reference was added instead. The Astadourian Lightning Observatory {{was named after}} Mary Astadourian, Chris Carter's executive assistant. Darin Oswald was named after writer Darin Morgan.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and small capital letters usually represent uvular consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in Visible Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in Hangul).|$|E

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E
5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an {{aircraft}} carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty {{an aircraft carrier}} design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, {{but it was not}} accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E
