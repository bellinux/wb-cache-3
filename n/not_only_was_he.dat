25|$|Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria abdicated on 7 September 1886, {{leading to}} various {{candidates}} being advocated by interested nearby nations; {{the two most}} concerned were Russia and Germany under the respective governments of Emperor Alexander III and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Duke Alexander was subsequently recommended, at the Russian government's suggestion, for the Bulgarian throne. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> married to a Russian princess, and was himself the grandson of a Russian grand duchess, but he also held the positions of Adjutant-General to Emperor Alexander, and was the Commanding General of the Imperial Guard. In several desperate attempts to prevent Russia from gaining control of Bulgaria however, the throne was offered to candidates who lacked Russian ties, such as a prince of Denmark or even the king of Romania. In the end, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was chosen, becoming Ferdinand I of Bulgaria.|$|E

25|$|On average, {{a single}} herd of cattle on a drive {{numbered}} about 3,000 head. To herd the cattle, {{a crew of}} at least 10 cowboys was needed, with three horses per cowboy. Cowboys worked in shifts to watch the cattle 24 hours a day, herding them in the proper direction in the daytime and watching them at night to prevent stampedes and deter theft. The crew also included a cook, who drove a chuck wagon, usually pulled by oxen, and a horse wrangler {{to take charge of}} the remuda, or herd of spare horses. The wrangler on a cattle drive was often a very young cowboy or one of lower social status, but the cook was a particularly well-respected member of the crew, as <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> in charge of the food, he also was in charge of medical supplies and had a working knowledge of practical medicine.|$|E

In the Cockettes' performances, he was usually given an entire scene to himself, often with little relevance to the narrative and theme {{of the rest of the}} show, although through doing so, he gained his own following. With a piano player named Peter Mintum, Sylvester worked on solo scenes in which he exhibited his interest in blues and jazz by imitating several of his musical idols like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker.

The novel's plot is simple, detailing 16-year-old Holden's experiences in New York City following his expulsion and departure from an elite college preparatory school. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> expelled from his current school, he had also been expelled from three previous schools. The book is more notable for the persona and testimonial voice of its first-person narrator, Holden. He serves as an insightful but unreliable narrator who expounds on the importance of loyalty, the [...] "phoniness" [...] of adulthood, and his own duplicity. In a 1953 interview with a high school newspaper, Salinger admitted that the novel was [...] "sort of" [...] autobiographical, explaining, [...] "My boyhood was very much {{the same as that of}} the boy in the book... t was a great relief telling people about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy, in {{addition}} to his directing duties, appears {{towards the end of the}} film as Spock, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which Leonard McCoy talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> in the scene, but his eyes are closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: [...] "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids." [...] Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis. Frank Welker provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.|$|E
500|$|With the {{publishing}} of Yue Fei's 17th folklore biography, The Story of Yue Fei (1684), a new distinct fictional Zhou Tong emerged, which differed greatly from his historical persona. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> now from Shaanxi; {{but he was}} Yue's adopted father, a learned scholar {{with knowledge of the}} eighteen weapons of war, and his personal name was spelled with a different, yet related, Chinese character. The novel's author portrayed him as an elderly widower and military arts tutor who counted Lin Chong and Lu Junyi, two of the fictional 108 outlaws on which the Water Margin is based, among his former pupils. A later republican era folktale by noted Yangzhou storyteller Wang Shaotang not only adds Wu Song to this list, but represents Zhou as a knight-errant with supreme swordsmanship. The tale also gives him the nickname [...] "Iron Arm", which he shares with the executioner-turned-outlaw Cai Fu, and makes the outlaw Lu Zhishen his sworn brother. Because of his association with the outlaws, he is often confused with the similarly named outlaw Zhou Tong.|$|E

500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's {{such a thing as a}} performance gene.

500|$|The fifty-year {{reign of}} Vikramaditya VI, the most {{successful}} of the later Chalukya rulers, was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to by historians as the [...] "Chalukya Vikrama era". <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> successful in controlling his powerful feudatories in the north (Kadamba Jayakesi II of Goa, Silhara Bhoja and the Yadava King) and south (Hoysala Vishnuvardhana), he successfully dealt with the imperial Cholas whom he defeated {{in the battle of}} Vengi in 1093 and again in 1118. He retained this territory for many years despite ongoing hostilities with the Cholas. This victory in Vengi reduced the Chola influence in the eastern Deccan and made him emperor of territories stretching from the Kaveri River in the south to the Narmada River in the north, earning him the titles Permadideva and Tribhuvanamalla (lord of three worlds). The scholars of his time paid him glowing tributes for his military leadership, interest in fine arts and religious tolerance. Literature proliferated and scholars in Kannada and Sanskrit adorned his court. Poet Bilhana, who immigrated from far away Kashmir, eulogised the king in his well-known work Vikramankadeva Charita. Vikramaditya VI was not only an able warrior but also a devout king as indicated by his numerous inscriptions that record grants made to scholars and centers of religion.|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer {{replaced}} the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was [...] "a very good officer, {{devoted to his}} duties; his patriotism has been attacked {{in the time of}} Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious from all these charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army." [...] Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following morning when he attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> a good soldier, but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps. François Christophe Kellermann then in command of both armies, wrote, [...] "It is to the coolness and courage of this excellent officer that was due the success of this glorious day." ...|$|E
