Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from marine seaweeds have been known to produce positive effects on physiological activities in human tissues. In this study, an electrospun nanofiber containing brown seaweed EPS was proven to be a candidate biomaterial for <b>neural</b> tissue <b>engineering.</b> Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a specific marker protein increased in the astrocytes cultured on the polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber containing EPS (EPS-PCL nanofiber), compared with PCL nanofiber. The upregulation of GFAP indicates that the EPS-PCL nanofiber induced astrocyte activation, which supports physiological agents favorable to restore injured neural tissue. Astrocytes could infiltrate into the EPS-PCL nanofiber mat without toxicity, comparable to PCL nanofiber. These results imply that EPS-PCL nanofiber could be a useful biomaterial to regulate astrocyte activity at a molecular level and could be considered as a novel therapeutic material for <b>neural</b> tissue <b>engineering...</b>|$|R

Electrospinning technique with the ability to mimic the structure and function of an extracellular matrix is a preferable method to customize the scaffold features. PVDF nanofibrous scaffolds were successfully fabricated by the electrospinning technique. The influence of PVDF solution concentration and other processing parameters like applied voltage, tip-to-collector distance, feeding rate, collector speed and the solvent were studied. The optimal parameters were 30  w/v% PVDF concentration, 15  kV applied voltage, 18  cm tip-to-collector distance, 0.5  ml/h feeding rate, 2500  rpm collector speed and N,N′-dimethylacetamide/acetone as a solvent. The mean fiber diameter of the obtained scaffold was 352.9  ±  24  nm with uniform and aligned morphology.
