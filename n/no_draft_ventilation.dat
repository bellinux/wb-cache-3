Whilst evidence for collective behaviour in competitive running events exists, {{it is not}} clear if this results from energetic savings conferred by drafting. This study modelled the effects of drafting on behavior in elite 10, 000 m runners. Methods Using performance data from a men’s elite 10, 000 m track running event, computer simulations were constructed using Netlogo 5. 1 to test the effects of three different drafting quantities on collective behaviour: <b>no</b> <b>drafting,</b> drafting to 3 m behind with up to 8...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{scientific}} {{principles of}} air exchange and air distribution calculations are meant {{in the development}} of calculation methods based on complex consideration of stream flows and approximative models regularity – i. e. system of heat-air balance equations compiled for specific volumes of the premise. The article defines most significant factors affecting the formation of gas, moisture and velocity fields in the premise, namely: heat emission sources, intake streams, descending convective air flows occurring near cold surfaces, heat losses (or intakes), <b>draft</b> <b>ventilation</b> (general exchange and local). Issues regarding determination of intake air volumes and distribution of the above inside the premises were considered in close interrelation with each other (i. e. principle of air exchange and air distribution conjoint calculation). Consistency of calculation methods has been repeatedly proved with physical models and in field conditions. Introduction. Role of rational air exchange and air distribution concept for premises with mechanical ventilation Actuality of rational air exchange and air distribution concept is determined, first of all, by th...|$|R
