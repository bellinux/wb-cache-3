"There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's [...] "heroism" [...] of saving Iris, and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which {{is the goal of}} so many of Scorsese's characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{argued that}} tax {{policy should be}} used to promote energy conservation. When his {{lieutenant}} governor supported a temporary suspension of the state gasoline tax to provide consumers some relief during a period of especially high gasoline prices in 2006, Romney rejected the proposal, arguing that maintaining the tax would help encourage energy conservation: “I don’t think that now is the time, and I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> will be the right time, for us to encourage the use of more gasoline.... I am very much in favor of people recognizing that these high gasoline prices are probably here to stay and that the appropriate action for us to take is to find ways to find fuel conservation.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{reasoning}} for the film's relative success, {{according to}} Steve Rothenberg, Lions Gate president of domestic distribution, {{is due to}} its targeted market appeal, [...] "I believe that we're {{in all the right}} theaters...I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there's</b> much room for expansion." [...] To illustrate the point, Lions Gate's exit polls showed 52 percent of the audience were black women over the age of 35.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2011, Roberts {{stated that}} she had started work on a second album. On 13 January 2012 Nicola commented on her second album, stating [...] "Maybe. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>There's</b> lots of stuff coming up and I think there always {{has to be a}} right time. I'm always working on music and if a second album came out then that would be a great thing to happen."

60|$|Princess Ozma {{took the}} Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, {{although}} she was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was a wagon road {{all the way to}} the Lake of the Skeezers. The Land of Oz is a pretty big place, surrounded on all sides by a Deadly Desert which it is impossible to cross, and the Skeezer Country, according to the map, was in the farthest northwestern part of Oz, bordering on the north desert. As the Emerald City was exactly in the center of Oz, it was no small journey from there to the Skeezers.|$|E

They asked what meals you {{took in the}} house, at what hour you went out and at what hour you returned. Then the shorter of the two wished to take the room above yours. I asked him {{more than double the}} price, but he would have engaged it. Then I told him that I was <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>There</b> was a gentleman to whom it was offered.

"I wish {{to consult}} with you," [...] she broke out, and again she came to a sudden pause; and as she looked into his {{vigilant}} face, {{in which she was}} <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was not a hovering derision, she could not continue. She felt that she ought to gather courage from {{the fact that he had}} not started, or done anything positively disagreeable when she had asked for a consultation; but she could not, and it did not avail her to reflect that she was rendering herself liable to all conceivable misconstruction,--that she was behaving childishly, with every appearance of behaving guiltily.|$|E
6000|$|... "By San Giovanni, though," [...] {{said the}} fat {{purchaser}} of leeks, {{with the air}} of a person rather shaken in his theories, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> isn't some truth in what Ser Cioni says. For I know I have good reason to find fault with the quattrini bianchi myself. Grumble, did he say? Suffocation! I should think we do grumble; and, let anybody say the word, I'll turn out into the piazza with the readiest, sooner than have our money altered in our hands as if the magistracy were so many necromancers. And it's true Lorenzo might have hindered such work if he would--and for the bull with the flaming horns, why, as Ser Cioni says, there may be many meanings to it, for the matter of that; it may {{have more to do with}} the taxes than we think. For when God above sends a sign, it's not to be supposed he'd have only one meaning." ...|$|E

"'I did {{not think}} so then,' he answered, 'and I am not sure I think so now; for really they were very well suited to each other, and there did seem to be danger that the man might marry my Aunt Amanda, and that, as {{it seemed to me}} then, and seems to me now, would have been a deplorable thing.' ('If you had known a little more, you scheming youngster,' said Miss Amanda, 'you would have {{understood}} that there was not the least danger of anything of the kind--that is to say, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> was any danger.') 'It was not long after these two people became acquainted before I had additional cause for congratulating myself that I had done a wise and prudent thing. Bridges came to see my Aunt Amanda every afternoon, just the same as {{he had been in the}} habit of doing, and yet he spent nearly every evening with Rebecca; and that proved to me he was not a fit lover for my Aunt Amanda, no matter how you looked at it.' ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{questioned}} about Sega AM2's plans for Virtua Cop 2 in a February 1995 interview, AM2 manager Fumio Kurokawa stated [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if <b>there</b> {{will be a}} VC2.

6000|$|It {{is a great}} {{pleasure}} to write the word; but I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is not a certain impudence in pretending to add anything to it. Venice has been painted and described many thousands of times, and of all the cities of the world is the easiest to visit without going there. Open the first book and you will find a rhapsody about it; step into the first picture-dealer's and you will find three or four high-coloured [...] "views" [...] of it. There is notoriously nothing more to be said on the subject. Every one has been there, and every one has brought back a collection of photographs. There is as little mystery about the Grand Canal as about our local thoroughfare, and the name of St. Mark is as familiar as the postman's ring. It is not forbidden, however, to speak of familiar things, and I hold that for the true Venice- lover Venice is always in order. There is nothing new to be said about her certainly, but the old is better than any novelty. It would be a sad day indeed when there should be something new to say. I write these lines with the full consciousness of having no information whatever to offer. I do not pretend to enlighten the reader; I pretend only to give a fillip to his memory; and I hold any writer sufficiently justified who is himself in love with his theme.|$|E
60|$|Of course {{these boys}} kept chickens. The {{favorite}} chicken {{in those days}} was a small white bantam, and the more feathers it had down its legs the better. My boy had a bantam hen that was perfectly white, and so tame that she would run up to him whenever he came into the yard, and follow him round like a dog. When she had chickens she taught them to be just as fond of him, and the tiny little balls of yellow down tumbled fearlessly about in his hands, and pecked the crumbs of bread between his fingers. As they got older they ran with their mother to meet him, and when {{he sat down on the}} grass they clambered over him and crept into his shirt-bosom, and crooned softly, as they did when their mother hovered them. The boy loved them better than anything he ever had; he always saw them safe in the coop at night, and he ran out early in the morning to see how they had got through the night, and to feed them. One fatal morning he found them all scattered dead upon the grass, the mother and every one of her pretty chicks, with no sign upon them of how they had been killed. He could only guess that they had fallen a prey to rats, or to some owl that had got into their coop; but, as they had not been torn or carried away, he guessed in vain. He buried them with the sympathy of all the children and all the fellows at school who heard about the affair. It was a real grief; it was long before he could think of his loss without tears; and I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> is so much difference of quality in our bereavements; the loss can hurt more or it can hurt less, but the pang must be always the same in kind.|$|E
5000|$|However he also {{commented on}} the world's view on {{homosexuality}} by stating: [...] "In many ways, there is more tolerance. On YouTube, for example, you can see many young boys “coming out” as gay. And - at least in Denmark - parents are becoming more accepting. I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> has been much progress in U.S.A. however, where many young gay teenagers are still driven to suicide because of general and specific social harassment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Brott," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{forced to}} confide in you. Lucille is in terrible danger.

Are you {{prepared}} to make a great sacrifice for her sake--to leave England at once, {{to take her to}} the uttermost part of the world?" ...|$|R
