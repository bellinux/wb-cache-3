25|$|A single Jianghu I (hull 516) was {{modified}} very recently. It has its anti-ship missiles replaced with several multiple-rocket launchers. The rockets are of 122mm caliber, and {{are based on}} the Type 89 system, which is itself quite similar to the Soviet BM-21 rocket system. The 122mm rockets are launched from a stabilized launcher, meaning that even if the ship is affected by wave motion, the launcher itself will be stabilized. The rockets have a range of up to 40km, and can achieve reasonable accuracy in fire. This installation may be seen as an experiment by the PLAN to make use of older warship designs, by turning them into shore bombardment platforms. Though only one ship is being tested for <b>now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very possible concept for future PLAN conversions of their large number of old Luda's and Jianghu's. Fire support from ships is seen as very important by the PLAN when conducting amphibious operations.|$|E

[...] The International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda warned [...] "those involved in these criminal acts is clear: stop {{the destruction of the}} religious buildings <b>now.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> war crime which my office has authority to fully investigate." [...] She cited Mali's accession to Article 8 of the Rome Statute that says any [...] "deliberate attacks against undefended civilian buildings which are not military objectives are a war crime."

[...] The United States intention to bring in settlers {{as well as the}} railroad had been an established policy for years, as was plainly stated in newspapers and governmental reports of the time. [...] Governor Ramsey's journal of the treaty negotiations contained his speech to the assembled Ojibwe in which he, as a trained lawyer and experienced politician and Indian negotiator, directly misrepresented {{the purpose and}} intent of the treaty: Now, there is growing up a trade of considerable importance between the British settlements on the north and the American settlements on the south. ... <b>Now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> trade which cannot and must not be interrupted. [...] And their Great Father, feeling this, and desirous to prevent any trouble between his white and red people, has sent us here to come to some understanding with you about it. [...] Their Great Father has no especial desire to get possession of their lands. [...] He does not want their lands at all if {{they do not want to}} part with them. [...] He has more land now than he knows what to do with. [...] He simply wishes that his people should enjoy the privilege of traveling through their country on steamboats and wagons unmolested Even after the initial proposal for a mere right of way was rejected, he was representing that if they sold their land, the Ojibwe could still occupy it and hunt on it for a long time.|$|E
