If the {{representative}} is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the competitor's performance, they may ask them to sing another song. After all five auditioners have sung, the representatives may make comments, and announces auditioners that will not go through to the second round. The successful auditioners will be given a Yellow Ticket, and will return to the waiting room to wait for an audition crew to lead them to a separate waiting room where they wait for the second round of audition.|$|E
25|$|King Janamejaya's {{ancestor}} Shantanu, {{the king}} of Hastinapura, has a short-lived marriage with the goddess Ganga and has a son, Devavrata (later to be called Bhishma, a great warrior), who becomes the heir apparent. Many years later, when King Shantanu goes hunting, he sees Satyavati, {{the daughter of the}} chief of fisherman, and asks her father for her hand. Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death. To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the prince's children honouring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.|$|E

25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners {{said that}} it seemed all the {{prominent}} pieces created for The X-Files were created by [...] "accident". According to Manners, Davis {{was nothing more than}} an extra leaning on a shelf. At the start, the producers of the show were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> making the Smoking Man the main antagonist. Paul Rabwin commented once {{that he did not know}} if Davis could handle the role, because he was not sure if he was a [...] "good enough" [...] actor for the role. Manners later commented that Davis knew that the Smoking Man had two different characters, the first being the one played by Davis and the second was the cigarettes. He further stated that the cigarette smoke could tell a [...] "whole story" [...] by itself, thanks to Davis' talent.|$|E

500|$|Kenny Kramer {{initially}} {{demanded that}} he would play the part of Kessler, as he served as {{the inspiration for the}} character. However, David did not want this and it was decided upon that casting sessions would be held. Among those who auditioned for the part of Kramer were Steve Vinovich, Tony Shalhoub and Larry Hankin. Although he was not cast for the part Hankin would later portray an in-show fictional version of Kramer in the season four episode [...] "The Pilot". Seinfeld and David were both familiar with Michael Richards, and David had worked with him on Fridays. Richards did his final audition at the Century Plaza Hotel on April 18, 1989, reputedly finishing with a handstand. David was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> casting Richards, as he was trying to cast an actor who resembled the original Kramer. However, impressed by Richards' audition, Seinfeld convinced David that Richards would be the right actor for the part.|$|E
500|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{performed}} at the Liverpool Stadium on 3 May 1960, on the same bill as Gene Vincent. Larry Parnes {{became interested in the}} Hurricanes, and invited them to audition at the Wyvern Club as a backing group for Billy Fury. Storm turned up at the audition, but only so he could have his picture taken with Fury. In July 1960, the group secured a residency at Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (playing in the Rock 'n' Calypso Ballroom) for £25 each per week (equivalent to £ in [...] ). Starr was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> giving up his job as an apprentice at Henry Hunt's, where he made climbing frames for schools, until Storm put forward the idea of [...] "Starr-time" [...] (a solo spot) with Starr singing songs like [...] "Boys" [...] by the Shirelles. Starr finally agreed when Storm told him about how many women would be [...] "available". It was during this season that Starr (who had been known as [...] "Ritchie" [...] until then) changed his name to [...] "Ringo".|$|E
500|$|The ban expired {{the week}} ending 30 May 2008, with the {{conviction}} of Goussis {{for the murder of}} Lewis Moran, paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes; however, Andrew Rule, who co-wrote the book on which the series is based, says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria anytime soon, saying [...] "the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges. That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held... That could be some time. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> several , but it might be two years." [...] However, Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008, after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes. Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes, but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal. The edited versions had whole scenes cut out, and Tony Mokbel's face was pixelated. Reactions from viewers were not favourable, mainly because most had already seen the entire series.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012, Aguilera {{confirmed}} {{that she and}} Green had worked on a new track entitled [...] "Make the World Move" [...] and described it as [...] "positive" [...] and [...] "full of life." [...] Regarding the collaboration, she said: [...] "I'm just excited to share the stage with Cee Lo because we both get off on production and dancers and having all of those fun elements about being on stage and being a performer... So {{the two of us}} together joining forces is going to be huge!" [...] When asked if [...] "Make the World Move" [...] would be released as a single, Aguilera replied saying that she was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> what would be done with the song. In an interview with MTV News in November, Aguilera explained how she felt the song would be suited to Green as she felt a male vocal contribution was needed, saying: [...] "I got to collaborate with my good buddy Cee Lo... There was a part for a potential male vocal on the chorus, and I just heard immediately Cee Lo's voice on it, his signature Cee Lo, and it was fun collaborating with him and having him on my record and us joining forces together." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{searching for}} {{prospective}} collaborators, Madonna chose {{to work with}} Babyface, whose previous work with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. She was also fond of Babyface's song, [...] "When Can I See You" [...] from his third studio album For the Cool in You (1994). The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting and see if they wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, and she found a way to take the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords. From there we collaborated and built it up... I was living in Beverly Hills and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write." [...] Together they agreed that the first line of the song should be its title, and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was written. The words were never repeated in the track again.|$|E
500|$|The Downward Spiral was {{conceived}} after the Lollapalooza festival tour as Trent Reznor {{thought of a}} [...] "negative vibe" [...] felt by the band {{when they were in}} a European hotel. Nine Inch Nails live performances were known for its aggressive on-stage dynamic, in which band members act angry, injure themselves, and destroy instruments. Reznor had a feud with TVT Records that resulted in him co-founding Nothing Records with his former manager John Malm, Jr. and signing with Interscope. He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the album's themes; he later used the concept as lyrics. The concept was based on Reznor's social issues at the time: he had personal conflicts with band member Richard Patrick and was known for enjoying alcohol. When developing The Downward Spiral, Reznor struggled with drug addiction and was depressed as he wrote songs related to personal issues. His friends suggested that he could take Prozac (fluoxetine), an antidepressant, but this choice did not appeal to him. He wanted the album's sound to diverge from Broken, emphasizing mood, texture, restraint and subtlety, although he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> its musical direction. The album was made with [...] "full range" [...] and focused on texture and space, avoiding explicit usage of guitars or synthesizers.|$|E

500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That had never occurred to me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E

It could have gone either way.|$|E

2500|$|Sacks left Britain {{and flew}} to Montreal, Canada on 9 July 1960, his 27th birthday. He visited the Montreal Neurological Institute and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), {{telling them that}} he wanted to be a pilot.

Dr. Taylor, the head medical officer, told him, [...] "You are clearly talented and we would love to have you, but I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> your motives for joining." [...] He was told to travel for a few months and reconsider. He used the next three months to travel across Canada and deep into the Canadian Rockies, which he described in his personal journal, later published as Canada: Pause, 1960.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the role}} of Dr. Emilio Lizardo, the studio wanted to cast an unknown actor, but Mac Rauch had written the role with John Lithgow in mind. Like Weller, he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the character, but Richter {{convinced}} him by [...] "claiming what a real feast for an actor this wonderful Jekyll and Hyde character was", the actor said. Lithgow told an interviewer, [...] "I have had roles where I {{came very close to}} going over the top. In [...] I almost went over the top several times. But this role is completely over the top. It makes the role in Twilight Zone seem like a model of restraint. I do it in a wild, red fright wig and rotten false teeth with a thick Italian accent. It's wild." [...] For Lizardo's accent, Lithgow spent time with an Italian tailor at MGM and recorded his voice. He changed his walk to that of an [...] "old crab, and because my alien metabolism is supposed to be messed up". Lithgow said of his character, [...] "playing Lizardo felt like playing the madman in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} rumoured that Walsh {{was about to}} make a record deal with her band's record label, Fascination Records, {{although}} nothing has been confirmed. Soon after the rumour, Walsh confirmed on Suck My Pop, a programme that she co-hosts on the digital TV station Viva, that she will feature on English rapper Aggro Santos' upcoming single, [...] "Like U Like". The track will be her first step away from Girls Aloud as a singer. Walsh was asked for OK! Magazine: [...] "Kimberley, there are rumours, that you will be releasing a solo album..." [...] and Walsh said: [...] "Gosh! I haven't got any plan to do that. Gary Barlow signed Aggro Santos and he asked me to sing Like U Like, and I've done a song for the Horrid Henry film that I'm in titled [...] "Everybody Dance". I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> doing anything big on my own just yet." [...] In 2012 she made her West End theatre debut, playing Princess Fiona in the London production of Shrek the Musical. The announcement came after Amanda Holden announced her pregnancy in August 2011. Walsh teamed up with Alfie Boe to record a version of Queen's [...] "One Vision" [...] as the Official Olympic Team Great Britain Single. Walsh has also performed with several artists including Neyo with [...] "Hate That I Love You", Ronan Keating's [...] "No Matter What" [...] and James Cullum with [...] "Rainy Days and Mondays". In August 2012 it was announced that Walsh is in discussions with Gary Barlow to release a solo album for a 2013 release.|$|E
