40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a larger project that explores haole (white people, foreigners) as a colonial form of {{whiteness}} in Hawai‘i—as a dynamic social assemblage. Haole was forged and reforged in over two centuries of colonization, and it must be understood through that history. I use the recent Supreme Court decision in Harold F Rice v Benjamin J Cayetano, 528 US 495 (2000), as an entry point into the interrogation of haole. Framed by the dominant discourse, the case appeared to be about Native Hawaiians (asking questions about who they are and what rights they have), and not about haole (assuming there are no questions as to who they are and what rights they have). The Rice case illustrates how Western law renders indigenous claims inarticulable by racializing native peoples, while simultaneously <b>normalizing</b> <b>white</b> subjectivity by insisting on a color-blind ideology. The inherent contradiction in these two positions—race matters /race does not matter—is played out in the frictions surrounding the Rice decision and is evidence of the cracks in the hegemony of Western law that complicate any easy binary of colonizer–colonized. Through an analysis of Rice, I explore how the Western legal framework is set up to accept the teleological narrative of the development, to problematize native identity, and to naturalize white subjectivity. I then broaden the lens to explore the ways Rice points to an epistemological disconnect between Western notions of the production of knowledge and indigenous articulations of the same...|$|E

40|$|Activating alleles of Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) such as JAK 2 V 617 F {{are central}} to the {{pathogenesis}} of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting that small molecule inhibitors targeting JAK 2 may be therapeutically useful. We have identified an aminopyrimidine derivative (CYT 387), which inhibits JAK 1, JAK 2, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK 2) at low nanomolar concentrations, with few additional targets. Between 0. 5 and 1. 5 μM CYT 387 caused growth suppression and apoptosis in JAK 2 -dependent hematopoietic cell lines, while nonhematopoietic cell lines were unaffected. In a murine MPN model, CYT 387 <b>normalized</b> <b>white</b> cell counts, hematocrit, spleen size, and restored physiologic levels of inflammatory cytokines. Despite the hematologic responses and reduction of the JAK 2 V 617 F allele burden, JAK 2 V 617 F cells persisted and MPN recurred upon cessation of treatment, suggesting that JAK 2 inhibitors may be unable to eliminate JAK 2 V 617 F cells, consistent with preliminary results from clinical trials of JAK 2 inhibitors in myelofibrosis. While the clinical benefit of JAK 2 inhibitors may be substantial, not the least due to reduction of inflammatory cytokines and symptomatic improvement, our data add to increasing evidence that kinase inhibitor monotherapy of malignant disease is not curative, suggesting a need for drug combinations to optimally target the malignant cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of JAK 2 and MPL mutations {{in patients with}} myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) provided important insight into the genetic basis of these disorders {{and led to the}} development of JAK 2 kinase inhibitors for MPN therapy. Although recent studies have shown that JAK 2 kinase inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in a JAK 2 V 617 F murine bone marrow transplantation model, the effects of JAK 2 inhibitors on MPLW 515 L-mediated myeloproliferation have not been investigated. In this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo effects of INCB 16562, a small-molecule JAK 2 inhibitor. INCB 16562 inhibited proliferation and signaling in cell lines transformed by JAK 2 and MPL mutations. Compared with vehicle treatment, INCB 16562 treatment improved survival, <b>normalized</b> <b>white</b> blood cell counts and platelet counts, and markedly reduced extramedullary hematopoeisis and bone marrow fibrosis. We observed inhibition of STAT 3 and STAT 5 phosphorylation in vivo consistent with potent inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. These data suggest JAK 2 inhibitor therapy may be of value in the treatment of JAK 2 V 617 F-negative MPNs. However, we did not observe a decrease in the size of the malignant clone in the bone marrow of treated mice at the end of therapy, which suggests that JAK 2 inhibitor therapy, by itself, was not curative in this MPN model...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several genetic markers {{have been}} {{associated}} with multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility; however, uncovering the genetic aetiology of the complex phenotypic expression of MS has been more difficult so far. The most common approach in imaging genetics is based on mass-univariate linear modelling (MULM), which faces several limitations. Objective: Here we apply a novel multivariate statistical model, sparse reduced-rank regression (sRRR), to identify possible associations of glutamate related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple MRI-derived phenotypes in MS. Methods: Seven phenotypes related to brain and lesion volumes for a total number of 326 relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive MS patients and a total of 3809 glutamate related and control SNPs were analysed with sRRR, which resulted in a ranking of SNPs in decreasing order of importance ('selection probability'). Lasso regression and MULM were used as comparative statistical techniques to assess consistency of the most important associations over different statistical models. Results: Five SNPs within the NMDA-receptor- 2 A-subunit (GRIN 2 A) domain were identified by sRRR in association with normalized brain volume (NBV), normalized grey matter volume and <b>normalized</b> <b>white</b> matter volume (NMWM). The association between GRIN 2 A and both NBV and NWMV was confirmed in MULM and Lasso analysis. Conclusions: Using a novel, multivariate regression model confirmed by two other statistical approaches we show associations between GRIN 2 A SNPs and phenotypic variation in NBV and NWMV in this first exploratory study. Replications in independent datasets are now necessary to validate these findings. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObjective: To {{quantify}} {{total and}} regional brain damage {{in subjects with}} cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) by using MR-based quantitative measures. Background: CTX is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by progressive neurological impairment. Appropriate therapy can slow disease progression. Measures of brain volume changes {{have been used in}} several neurological disorders due to their value in assessing disease outcome and monitoring patients' evolution. Methods: Twenty-four CTX patients underwent conventional MRI to measure total and regional brain volumes. In five CTX patients who started therapy at baseline, clinical and MRI examinations were repeated after 2 years. Clinical disability, overall cognitive performance and cerebellar function were evaluated using modified Rankin Scale (RS), Mini-Mental-Status Examination (MMSE) and cerebellar functional system score (CB-FSS). Results: Measures of normalized brain, cortical and cerebellar volumes were lower in CTX patients than in healthy controls (p< 0. 01). Instead, there were no differences in <b>normalized</b> <b>white</b> matter volumes between the two groups (p= 0. 1). At regional analysis, significant volume decrease was found in each cortical region (p< 0. 01 for all regions). Normalized cortical volumes correlated closely with age (r=- 0. 9, p< 0. 0001), RS (r=- 0. 65, p< 0. 001) and MMSE (r=- 0. 60, p< 0. 01). Normalized cerebellar volumes correlated closely with CB-FSS scores (r=- 0. 58, p< 0. 01). In the five CTX patients followed over time, the annual brain volume decrease was - 1. 1 ± 0. 2 %. Conclusions: Cortical volume, rather than white matter volume, is diffusely decreased in CTX patients and correlates closely with the patients'clinical status. These data provide evidence for the presence of clinically relevant neuronal-axonal damage in the brains of CTX patients...|$|R

40|$|The Huntingtin {{interacting}} protein 1 (HIP 1) -platelet-derived {{growth factor}} beta receptor (PDGFβR) fusion oncogene (H/P), {{resulting from a}} somatic t(5; 7) translocation, causes expression of a constitutively active tyrosine kinase and is associated with myelomonocytic leukemia. To {{gain an understanding of}} the mechanism of leukemogenesis, we generated a mouse model with a conditional H/P knockin allele. We found that activation of this allele in vivo in hematopoietic cells of adult mice was not sufficient to induce leukemia. However, co-induction with a conditional human t(8; 21) AML 1 -ETO (A/E) knockin allele resulted in a fully penetrant, rapid onset aggressive myeloproliferative disease. The leukemic cells were completely recombined and were uniformly Gr- 1 positive. This leukemia was associated with a decreased frequency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow and was sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibition by imatinib. Imatinib treatment <b>normalized</b> <b>white</b> blood cell counts and restored bone marrow stem cell frequency but unexpectedly increased the ability of the leukemia to be transferred to syngeneic recipients. We show that a leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) persists in vivo during imatinib therapy, shares phenotypic characteristics with HSCs, and does not depend on H/P signaling for survival. Mobilization of the LIC was unable to enhance sensitivity to imatinib. This first example of a conditional knockin mouse model of a leukemogenic tyrosine kinase has facilitated the identification of an A/E cooperating mutation and has shed surprising light on the differential response of different leukemia cells to imatinib targeted therapy. The persistence of an LIC corroborates clinical data and provides a model system for testing of novel therapies. The disparity between different cancer cells in the same tumor is an issue that needs to be resolved and from such models as that described here the resolution of this issue is now more tractable...|$|R

40|$|IMPORTANCE: The {{investigation}} of cortical gray matter (GM), deep GM nuclei, and spinal cord damage {{in patients with}} primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS) provides insights into the neurodegenerative process responsible for clinical progression of MS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical, deep GM, and spinal cord damage and their effect on clinical disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of 26 patients with PP-MS (mean age, 50. 9 years; range, 31 - 65 years; including 14 women) and 20 healthy control participants (mean age, 51. 1 years; range, 34 - 63 years; including 11 women) enrolled at a single US institution. Clinical disability was measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale, 9 -Hole Peg Test, and 25 -Foot Walking Test. We collected data from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013. Data analysis was performed from January 21 to April 10, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cortical lesion burden, brain and deep GM volumes, spinal cord area and volume, and scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (score range, 0 to 10; higher scores indicate greater disability), 9 -Hole Peg Test (measured in seconds; longer performance time indicates greater disability), and 25 -Foot Walking Test (test covers 7. 5 m; measured in seconds; longer performance time indicates greater disability). RESULTS: The 26 patients with PP-MS showed significantly smaller mean (SD) brain and spinal cord volumes than the 20 control group patients (normalized brain volume, 1377. 81 [65. 48] vs 1434. 06 [53. 67] cm 3 [P =. 003]; <b>normalized</b> <b>white</b> matter volume, 650. 61 [46. 38] vs 676. 75 [37. 02] cm 3 [P =. 045]; normalized gray matter volume, 727. 20 [40. 74] vs 757. 31 [38. 95] cm 3 [P =. 02]; normalized neocortical volume, 567. 88 [85. 55] vs 645. 00 [42. 84] cm 3 [P =. 001]; normalized spinal cord volume for C 2 -C 5, 72. 71 [7. 89] vs 82. 70 [7. 83] mm 3 [P <. 001]; and normalized spinal cord volume for C 2 -C 3, 64. 86 [7. 78] vs 72. 26 [7. 79] mm 3 [P =. 002]). The amount of damage in deep GM structures, especially {{with respect to the}} thalamus, was correlated with the number and volume of cortical lesions (mean [SD] thalamus volume, 8. 89 [1. 10] cm 3; cortical lesion number, 12. 6 [11. 7]; cortical lesion volume, 0. 65 [0. 58] cm 3; r =- 0. 52; P <. 01). Thalamic atrophy also showed an association with cortical lesion count in the frontal cortex (mean [SD] thalamus volume, 8. 89 [1. 1] cm 3; cortical lesion count in the frontal lobe, 5. 0 [5. 7]; r =- 0. 60; P <. 01). No association was identified between magnetic resonance imaging measures of the brain and spinal cord damage. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the neurodegenerative process occurring in PP-MS appeared to spread across connected structures in the brain while proceeding independently in the spinal cord. These results support the relevance of anatomical connectivity for the propagation of MS damage in the PP phenotype...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging–based {{apparent}} {{diffusion coefficient}} (ADC) and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements have been related respectively to both cell and microves-sel density in brain tumors. However, {{because of the}} high degree of heterogeneity in gliomas, a direct correlation between these MR imaging–based measurements and histopathologic features is re-quired. The {{purpose of this study was}} to correlate regionally ADC and rCBV values with both cell and microvessel density in gliomas, by using coregistered MR imaging and stereotactic biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (9 men, 9 women; age range, 19 – 78 years) with gliomas underwent diffusion-weighted and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR imaging before biopsy. Eighty-one biopsy samples were obtained and categorized as peritumoral, infiltrated tissue, or bulk tumor, with quantification of cell and microvessel density. ADC and rCBV values were measured at biopsy sites and were <b>normalized</b> to contralateral <b>white</b> matter on corresponding maps coregistered with a 3 D MR imaging dataset.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{emergence}} of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) as commonMR imaging findings {{raises the question}} of how MR imaging parameters influence CMB detection. To evaluate the effects of modified gradient recalled-echo (GRE) MR imaging methods, we performed an analysis of sequence, section thickness, and field strength on CMB imaging properties and detection in subjects with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a condition associated with microhemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple MR images were obtained from subjects with probable CAA, with varying sequences (GRE versus susceptibility-weighted imaging [SWI]), section thicknesses (1. 2 – 1. 5 versus 5 mm), and magnetic field strengths (1. 5 T versus 3 T). Individual CMB were manually identified and analyzed for contrast index (lesion intensity <b>normalized</b> to normal-appearing <b>white</b> matter signal intensity) and diameter. CMB counts were compared between 1. 5 T thick-section GRE and thin-section SWI for 3 subjects who underwent both protocols in the same scanning session. RESULTS: With other parameters constant, use of SWI, thinner sections, and a higher field strength yielded medium-to-large gains in CMB contrast index (CI; Cohen d 0. 71 – 1. 87). SWI was also associ-ated with small increases in CMB diameter (Cohen d 0. 3). Conventional thick-section GRE identified only 33 % of CMB (103 of 310) seen on thin-section SWI.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascularity, metabolism, and histologic grade {{are related}} in gliomas but the exact {{determinants}} {{of these relationships}} are not fully defined. We used image coregistration and stereotactic biopsies to regionally compare cerebral blood volume (CBV) and (11) C-methionine (MET) uptake measurements in brain gliomas and to assess their relationship by histopathologic examination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with brain gliomas underwent MR imaging, including dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR and positron-emission tomography (PET) using MET acquired in identical stereotactic conditions before biopsy. MR-based CBV maps were calculated and both CBV maps and PET images were coregistered to anatomic images. Sixty-five biopsy samples were obtained on trajectories targeted toward high MET uptake area. The following histopathologic features were semiquantified in each sample: mitotic activity, endothelial proliferation, cellular pleomorphism, and tumor necrosis. CBV and MET uptake values were measured in the biopsy area and <b>normalized</b> to contralateral <b>white</b> matter. CBV ratios were compared with MET uptake ratios, and both measurements were compared with histologic features of each sample. RESULTS: CBV ratios ranged from 0. 08 to 10. 24 (median = 1. 73), and MET uptake ratios ranged from 0. 30 to 4. 91 (median = 1. 67). There was {{a positive correlation between}} CBV ratios and MET uptake ratios (r = 0. 65, P <. 001). Both CBV and MET uptake ratios were found to be significantly related to endothelial proliferation and mitotic activity (P <. 01). CONCLUSION: Within glial tumors, there is a local relationship between CBV and MET uptake measurements. Both provide indices of focal malignant activity...|$|R

Objective: To explore the relationship of cognitive performance to patterns of nodal centrality derived from magneto-encephalography (MEG). Methods: 34 early relapsing-remitting MS patients (median EDSS 2. 0) and 28 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) had a MEG, a neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI. Resting-state functional connectivity {{was determined by the}} synchronization likelihood. Eigenvector Centrality (EC) was used to quantify for each sensor its connectivity and importance within the network. A cognition-score was calculated, and <b>normalized</b> grey and <b>white</b> matter volumes were determined. EC was compared per sensor and frequency band between groups using permutation testing, and related to cognition. Results: Patients had lower grey and white matter volumes than HC, male patients lower cognitive performance than female patients. In HC, EC distribution showed highest nodal centrality over bi-parietal sensors ("hubs"). In patients, nodal centrality was even higher bi-parietally (theta-band) but markedly lower left temporally (upper alpha- and beta-band). Lower cognitive performance correlated to decreased nodal centrality over left temporal (lower alpha-band) and right temporal (beta-band) sensors, and to increased nodal centrality over right parieto-temporal sensors (beta-band). Network changes were most pronounced in male patients. Conclusions: Partial functional disconnection of the temporal regions was associated with cognitive dysfunction in MS; increased centrality in parietal hubs may reflect a shift from temporal to possibly less efficient parietal processing. To better understand patterns and dynamics of these network changes, longitudinal studies are warranted, also addressing the influence of gender. © 2012 Hardmeier et al...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. If F is an {{automorphism}} of Ωn, the n 2 -dimensional spectral unit ball, we show that, in {{a neighborhood}} of any cyclic matrix of Ωn, the map F can be written as conjugation by a holomorphically varying non singular matrix. This provides a shorter proof of a theorem of J. Rostand, with a slightly stronger result. 1. Background Let Mn be the set of all n × n complex matrices. For A ∈ Mn denote by sp(A) the spectrum of A. The spectral ball Ωn is the set Ωn: = {A ∈ Mn: ∀λ ∈ sp(A), |λ | < 1 }. Let F be an automorphism of Ωn, that is to say, a biholomorphic map of the spectral ball into itself. Ransford and White [6] proved that, by composing with a natural lifting of a Möbius map of the disk, one could reduce oneself to the case where F(0) = 0, and that in that case the linear map F ′(0) was a linear automorphism of Ωn, so that by composing with its inverse, one is reduced to the case F(0) = 0, F ′(0) = I (the identity map). We then say that the automorphism if <b>normalized.</b> Ransford and <b>White</b> [6] proved that such automorphisms preserve the spectrum of matrices. We say that two matrices X, Y are conjugate if there exists Q ∈ M− 1 n such that X = Q− 1 Y Q.
