5|$|Many of the {{numerous}} human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage {{in a wide range}} of activities; some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with <b>nature.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption.|$|E

5|$|The opening song {{played in}} the first four seasons (and the end credits in all seasons) has a folk rock {{instrumentation}} with bass guitar, trumpets and rhythmic drums. Its beat is fast in the opening and leisurely in the closing credits. It is in the minor key and it features a tritone or a diminished fifth, creating a melodic dissonance, which captures the show's surrealistic <b>nature.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> latter parts of season 4 and season 5, the opening tune has an electro funk arrangement with pop qualities. Seasons 6-9 have a sprightly bluegrass instrumentation with a usage of banjo and is set in the major key. For the later seasons, the arrangement is electro rock with a breakbeat influence, which feature electric guitars backed up by synthesized, groovy drumbeats.|$|E
5|$|The serial expands on Austen's metaphorical use of landscapes, {{reinforcing}} {{beauty and}} authenticity. Elizabeth takes {{every opportunity to}} enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine. The most symbolic use of <b>nature</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners' visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire, where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for Darcy. The story makes nature integral {{in the form of}} Old England. Elizabeth's appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates Darcy in her and her relatives' opinion. Darcy's gaze through the window works as a movie screen, projecting Elizabeth's actions for him and the viewer. His participation in the English landscape is his redemption.|$|E
