40|$|Buckypaper are {{self-supporting}} {{films of}} carbon nanotubes (CNT), {{which can be}} used as electrodes, <b>nano</b> <b>filter</b> or for the reinforcement of polymers, for instance. Usually they are produced by filtration of CNT dispersions. The disadvantages of filtration process are discontinuous operation, long duration of filtration and limited size of the buckypaper. The aim of this project was to develop a special tape casting process for buckypaper production. Due to the small particle size and high aspect ratio of the CNT, the maximum CNT content in castable dispersions is limited to 3 wt. %. This leads to low layer thicknesses, high shrinkages and high crack formation during the drying of casted films. To increase the buckypaper thickness, a multi-layer tape casting process has been developed. For the production of buckypaper, water based CNT dispersions have been used. Rheological and zeta potential measurements have been used for characterization of CNT dispersions. The influence of casting parameters on the films was investigated by using design of experiments. The films were examined according to thickness, bulk density, porosity and electrical conductivity. Index Terms — carbon nanotubes, buckypaper, tape casting I...|$|E

Objectives of this research are to study the performance of combustion system and propose a new design of combustor system for industrial furnace. 99. 5 % of pure zinc was heated in the furnace within two hours and the sprue gas went through nanoparticle collector. The apparatus involved in this experiment are diesel blower, cooling tower, circulating pump, collector tank, furnace, infrared thermometer and thermocouples. All the temperatures distribution from the furnace until the nanoparticle collector system is measured. The result obtained is collected and there are three samples were provided. The smallest particle size obtained from the ZnO is ! 03 "! ƞm and the largest size is 12 "# µm. At 300 second highest temperature in the furnace was at channel 6 which is 1069. 52 oC while the lowest temperature obtained at channel 16 which is 139. 06 °C.

40|$|Swift {{heavy ion}} {{irradiation}} produces damage in polymers {{in the form}} of latent tracks. Latent tracks can be enlarged by etching it in a suitable etchant and thus nuclear track etch membrane can be formed for gas permeation / purification in particular for hydrogen where the molecular size is very small. By applying suitable and controlled etching conditions well defined tracks can be formed for specific applications of the membranes. After etching gas permeation method is used for characterizing the tracks. In the present work polycarbonate (PC) of various thickness were irradiated with energetic ion beam at Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi. Nuclear tracks were modified by etching the PC in 6 N NaOH at 60 (± 1) oC from both sides for different times to produce track etch membranes. At critical etch time the etched pits from both the sides meet a rapid increase in gas permeation was observed. Permeability of hydrogen and carbon dioxide has been measured in samples etched for different times. The latent tracks produced by SHI irradiation in the track etch membranes show enhancement of free volume of the polymer. <b>Nano</b> <b>filters</b> are separation devices for the mixture of gases, different ions in the solution and isotopes and isobars separations.

40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{drinking}} water, coagulants - such as aluminium salts - are widely used for precipitation and separation of impurities from raw water. The residual from the process is sludge, which presents a disposal problem. The REAL process is a method for recycling the aluminium from the sludge. In a first step, the aluminium hydroxide is dissolved in sulphuric acid. In a second step, an ultra filtration will separate all suspended matter and large molecules, leaving a concentrate of 15 - 20 % dry solids. The permeate will contain the trivalent aluminium ions together with 30 - 50 % of the organic contaminants. In a third step, by concentrating the permeate in a <b>nano</b> <b>filter,</b> the concentration of aluminium will be high enough to, in a fourth step, be precipitated with potassium sulphate to form a pure crystal: potassium aluminium sulphate. The potassium aluminium sulphate is comparable to standard aluminium sulphate. The process will give a residual in form of a concentrate from the ultra filtration, representing a few per cent of the incoming volume. This paper presents the results from a long time pilot-scale continuous test run at Vasteras water works in Sweden, as well as calculations of costs for full-scale operations...|$|E

Both {{qualitative}} and quantitative effect of TiO 2 suspension presence in cigarette filter have been analyzed {{in order to reduce}} harmful substances in cigarette smoke, optimizing the capability of TiO 2 suspension as <b>nano</b> <b>filter</b> in cigarette filters and reviewing the analysis in order to obtain results with the best variation.

40|$|<b>Nano</b> fibers in <b>filter</b> {{media have}} become {{increasingly}} interesting for filtration applications. The benefit of using nano fibers is the improvement with respect to filter efficiency and the relatively low pressure drop due to the nano slip. The cost of nano fibers and slow down in production process when using them leads to the desire to use as few nano fibers as possible. We treat such optimization issues by simulating filter media and filtration processes resolving the smallest scale. When considering the nano regime, two problems arise: The scales of the <b>nano</b> fibers and <b>filter</b> media thickness are very far apart, and the models for fluid flow and particle movement have to be extended by new physical effects like slip flow.

40|$|Zero bias {{conductance}} per spin of nanotube {{double junction}} (NTDJ) is investigated theoretically using the tight binding model, unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation and non-equilibrium Green’s functions. NTDJ {{consists of two}} metallic nanotubes joined by a piece of semiconducting nanotube, with the transition between the nanotubes made up of sets of 5 and 7 member carbon rings. A quantum well forms in the central semiconducting NT region, bounded by Schottky barriers. Spin current occurs when Coulomb interactions raise the spin degeneracy of resonant levels in the quantum well. As long as an appropriate semiconducting NT length is chosen, spin direction can be controlled by gate voltage, i. e., NTDJ functions as a <b>nano</b> spin <b>filter.</b> The combination of nanotechnology based on carbon nanotubes (NTs) [1, 2] and spintronics [3] {{is thought to be}} extremely promising for future technological innovations.

30|$|In {{the last}} decade, electrospinning {{has seen its}} growth in {{multiple}} fields such as biomedical engineering, energy storage, and electronics [1, 2]. Applications using electrospun nanofibers include gas sensors, nerve guidance scaffolds, air <b>filters,</b> <b>nano</b> sensors, energy storage capacitors and solar cells [3 – 8]. A typical production rate of the electrospun nanofibers using a single spinneret is 0.01 – 0.1  g/h, which may be appropriate for lab usage or small scale experiments, but not for large scale usage and production [9]. Techniques to produce high throughput nanofibers have been studied by scaling up the spinneret count [10, 11]. Multiple spinnerets can be implemented by using an array of metallic needles either in a linear [12] or a circular [13] array. Although the multiple metallic needle approach gives a production rate of 0.024  g/h per nozzle which {{is comparable to the}} single needle production rate [13], the metallic spinnerets are bulky, difficult to assemble, and expensive. To implement non-metallic jetting sources, Dosunmu et al. [14] have used a highly porous reservoir and a conductive wire to charge the polymer. While the technique gives a high production rate of 5  g/h, it shows a wide distribution of nanofiber diameters. By drilling holes half-way through the porous walls, Varabhas et al. [15] have improved the diameter uniformity but lowered the production rate to 0.3  g/h and increased the operating voltages to 60  kV. Using microfluidic channels, Srinivasta et al. [16] have demonstrated intricate janus architecture nanofibers, but the open channel approach has lowered throughput to 0.1  g/h with 8 nozzles. Also, drilled holes in plastic films [17] and drilled holes into syringe filters [18] have been reported. But these approaches suffer from non-uniformity in nanofiber diameter or not quite scalable.|$|R
40|$|Nano {{as well as}} micro {{structuring}} in {{the volume}} of transparent materials is enabled by ultrafast laser radiation. By laser radiation with pulse durations in the fs and ps regime multi photon processes are efficiently induced resulting in a high resolution of less than 1 µm 3, a very low heat input and a high writing flexibility in all three dimensions. High transparent materials such as sapphire and glasses are locally modified in the volume to change the refractive index for optical applications or to increase the corrodibility selectively for the manufacturing of micro channels and micro structured parts for the use in micro systems and medical technology. The miniaturization of products for micro optics, the medical technology and micro systems engineering requires transparent components with structure sizes in the micrometer range and accuracies of approx. 100 nm. In-volume Selective Laser-induced Etching (ISLE) is an appropriate manufacturing process for micro machining of transparent materials such as sapphire and glasses, e. g. fused silica. By focusing the laser radiation (wavelength 1040 nm, pulse duration 500 fs, repetition rate 0. 1 - 5 MHz, pulse energy < 1 µJ) in the volume the material is locally modified. By scanning the laser focus with pulse overlap inside the material, connected volumes of modified material are created. The modified volumes are subsequently removed by chemical etching in a second processing step using aqueous solution of e. g. HF or KOH. Periodical nano structures (ripples, nanoplanes) are fabricated inside transparent materials exploiting fs-laser induced nano optics with potential applications such as <b>nano</b> sieves for <b>filtering,</b> optical gratings or functionalized internal surfaces. Direct laser writing of waveguides in transparent materials by fs laser radiation is well known. Further applications include crack-free 3 D micro markings in transparent materials consisting e. g. of micro-gratings, which result in a colorful experience in the observers eye due to diffraction and interference. To exploit the high manufacturing velocities possible with ultrafast lasers with repetition rates of several MHz a high speed scanning system with large numerical aperture and pre-compensation of spherical aberrations has been developed for in-volume nano and micro structuring. With this system high writing velocities (50 - 400 mm/s), small focus size (0. 6 - 2. 2 mm) and high precision (100 - 400 nm) are combined {{for the first time}} on rather large scanning fields (0. 6 - 1. 5 mm) and material depth of up to 2 mm...|$|R
