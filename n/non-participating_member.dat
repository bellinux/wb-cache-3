40|$|This article {{examines}} the European Commission’s Proposal for a Council Directive implementing a financial transaction tax through the enhanced cooperation procedure published on February 14, 2013. It starts by providing a brief description {{and analysis of the}} Proposal and the accompanying Impact Assessment, focusing on the newly added features of the proposed tax and its potential impact on both participating and <b>non-participating</b> <b>Member</b> States. Next, the {{article examines}} the Proposal from the perspective of public international law, discussing the controversial extraterritorial reach of the proposed tax. It is argued that doubts exist with respect to the compatibility of the “contagion effect” and the issuance principle with internationally recognised legal principles. The article then turns to EU law and considers the legal requirements imposed by the EU Treaties on the use of enhanced cooperation. Whilst raising some concerns in relation to the Proposal’s compliance with these requirements, the article concludes that the political and judicial controlling mechanisms in place appear weak and therefore the outcome of any potential political or judicial challenge remains uncertain. The importance of this debate {{is not limited to the}} financial transaction tax, but also extends to the use of enhanced cooperation in other areas of taxation and beyond...|$|E

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of patents as an asset, {{which may be}} traded by way of assignment, licensing or as security, has become increasingly important. In this regard, Art. 7 of the new EU Regulation No. 1257 / 2012 of 17 December 2012 on unitary patent protection provides that, {{as an object of}} property, a European patent with unitary effect shall be treated in its entirety and in all participating Member States as a national patent of the participating Member State in which that patent has unitary effect and in which the applicant had her/his residence or principal place of business or, by default, had a place of business on the date of filing the application for the European patent. In case the applicant had no such form of domicile in a participating Member State, German law applies (Art. 7 (3)). The result of Art. 7 is that, whereas unitary patents held by owners having some domicile in participating Member States typically will be subject to the national law of the patentee, firms from <b>non-participating</b> <b>Member</b> States, which do not have some form of domicile within the territory of enhanced cooperation, will never have their national law applied to unitary patents covering their inventive achievements. The author submits that Art. 7 is in conflict with both the purpose of the creation of unitary patent protection and with primary EU law...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: This case {{looked at}} the cost benefit factor of e-Choupal model in rural India from {{socio-economic}} perspective since it is being projected {{as one of the}} models of rural empowerment. Questions were raised whether its growth both horizontally and vertically might be detrimental to sustainability of traditional agrarian economy. It also examined the role of ICT and government policies in this context. Approach: The study examined the above mentioned issues from the context of rural India. Empirical literature was referred to build a link between various rural issues and e-Choupal. Results: e-Choupal model may not be leading towards a holistic development since the individual income increase of participating members may be at the expense of <b>non-participating</b> <b>members</b> of the rural commune. Conclusion: The results indicated that the present modus operandi of e-Choupal may perhaps lead to further rural consolidation through corporatization rather than rural empowerment...|$|R

In this article based on both survey research and church administrations, several levels of involvement are explored within church membership. Nowadays, 40 % of the Dutch population is an initiated member of a Chris-tian church. Almost 30 % of the Dutch population considers themselves {{as a member of a}} church and almost 10 % attends church on a regular basis. The participating church members have, besides their religious socialization, social and intrinsic motives to belong to their church. For all other members, church involvement seems to be an inheritance of their parents and almost nothing more than that. This has strong implications for the future while we expect that these large groups of <b>non-participating</b> <b>members</b> will not pass their church involvement on to next generations. Therefore church membership rates on all levels of involvement are expected to drop further...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the WTO in 1995, major changes and liberalization of its rules have been realized by issue-based plurilateral agreements, as exemplified by the Financial Services and Telecommunication Services Agreement, the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The WTO Doha Round is in a stalemate under the principle of consensus decision making and a single undertaking, leading to accelerating competition among free trade agreements (FTAs) /regional trade agreements (RTAs). In order to maintain global governance of the trade regime, the necessity for utilizing issue-based plurilateral agreements is expected to increase. Based primarily on the analyses of the ITA and the ACTA in which the author was heavily involved, this paper looks at the various issues related to issue-based plurilateral agreements from multi-faceted angles including legal and proposes the utilization of plurilateral agreements and their limitations. It analyzes, inter alia, 1) Necessity and Characteristics, 2) Incorporation into WTO Agreements and Limitations, 3) Ensuring Consistency with Existing WTO Agreements and Limitations, 4) Relationships with <b>Non-participating</b> WTO <b>Members</b> in Rights and Obligations, 5) Secretariat Functions, 6) Incentives for Non-participants to Participate, and so forth, and also proposes possible specific areas/issues where issue-based plurilateral agreements can be developed...|$|R

Later, after an {{examination}} by Rachel's doctor reveals that she suffers from tonsillitis and may need to have her tonsils removed, she is afraid to have the surgery lest it affect her voice, as she believes her singing ability is her only asset. Finn, who accompanied her to the doctor's, tries to convince her that he loves everything about her {{and that there is}} more to her than her voice. He warns her that if she loses her ability to sing then Jesse (Jonathan Groff) would no longer find her attractive. Rachel tells Finn that she still cares about Jesse and that he needs to move on, prompting Finn to sing [...] "Jessie's Girl" [...] as his solo assignment. To put her fear into perspective, Finn introduces her to his friend Sean (Zack Weinstein), who was paralyzed from the upper chest down during a football game. At first, Rachel is nervous and overwhelmed by the meeting, but Finn forces her to stay as Sean tells her about his grueling experiences with his disability and how he realized that a person is not just one single thing. She then begins to understand why Finn brought her and thanks Sean as she leaves.|$|R
40|$|South African organisations and {{particularly}} {{institutions of higher}} learning have been confronted with workforces that increasingly reflect the diversity of the South African population. This changing workforce composition implies that the multitude of individual and cultural differences and similarities become increasingly apparent among employees. These differences and similarities can be disruptive and may lead to disharmony, but if managed appropriately, they can also result in increased vigour, stimulation and energy. The importance of workforce diversity in especially a university environment cannot be over-emphasised, as these positive consequences are conducive and sustain universities in their role to expand knowledge that benefits the communities within which they operate. Various transformative initiatives to address diversity, have been devised and implemented, but the impact needs to be measured and assessed to enable leaders to manage diverse workforces more effectively. This article therefore aims to firstly, statistically identify the underlying dimensions of diversity within the largest university in Africa, namely the University of South Africa (Unisa). The responsiveness of university staff members who attended transformative diversity-training workshops are secondly investigated by comparing their responses to that of a matched sample of <b>non-participating</b> staff <b>members.</b> These workshops aimed to sensitise academic, administrative and professional staff at middle-management level to the new realities of an increasing diverse workforce. It is evident that the workshops had a positive impact and that they could be described as successful. The importance of noting that diversity interventions not only entail creating awareness of diversity issues, but also applying the principles of diversity management on a continuous basis, is underscored in this article.

40|$|In recent years, {{the topic}} of {{differentiated}} integration in the European Union has become increasingly discussed in both political science research and politics in general. Whereas differentiated integration is viewed as necessary for deeper cooperation, recent findings suggest that it increases the gulf between participants and non-participants, {{making it difficult for}} non-participating countries to join in later negotiations. However, {{there is a lack of}} theoretical and empirical work regarding the relationship between different levels of participation in the EU and national policy outcomes. This article addresses this question by comparing the policy outcomes in fully participating, selectively participating (opting-in) and <b>non-participating</b> (opting-out) EU <b>Member</b> States relative to EU legislation. The findings show that selective participation (opting-in) increases state conformity with EU laws relative to no integration at all (opting-out), but it does not completely bridge the gap between fully integrated Member States and non-participants. The results suggest that countries with flexible arrangements are generally less likely to implement EU laws than full participants, even when they choose to legally commit to the EU requirements. This finding raises some further questions about the rationale behind selective participation and its consequences for policy conformity, if its application expands to other policy areas and more Member States in the future...|$|R
40|$|Hai {{district}} fanners {{have observed}} {{a decline in}} bean crop production in Hai district {{in recent years and}} after consultations with researchers and extension personnel, they associated the situation to damage by insect pests and diseases as well as unreliable weather conditions and infertile soils. The implementation of IPDM project in Hai district was based on farmers' and partners' participatory efforts in reducing bean crop losses caused by pests and diseases in the district. Available sources of information confirmed that the common bean is an important crop produced in different parts of Tanzania where the scale of production varies depending on gender, wealth and location. Consequently, the decline in bean production in Hai district had many negative effects to bean farmers especially the smallholders who are the main producers of the crop. Beans are the main source of family food and household cash income for smallholder farmers in the district. This study was conducted in Hai District, northern Tanzania in 2004. The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess the social and economic benefits of IPDM technologies to at the household level. Secondary and primary data were collected to improve our understanding of agriculture technologies and bean production in Tanzania, particularly in Hai district. The study and the information on bean production in Tanzania revealed different production constraints to bean farming including the problem of insect pests and diseases. In order to gather appropriate information for this study, farmers in Hai communities were first grouped into two (project participating farmers and non participating farmers). Focus group discussions were conducted with IPDM project group members. Survey questionnaires were administered to both participating and <b>non-participating</b> community <b>members</b> to understand farmers' perception on the effectiveness of the IPDM technologies, adoption rate and participation in the dissemination of the technologies. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted to assess other stakeholders' perception and participation. The common bean is the second most important crop after maize that is produced in the district both for household consumption and cash income. Although bean crop production is limited by different constraints, insect pests and diseases are among the major production constraints that were mentioned by almost each farmer interviewed in the community. Farmers selected IPDM technologies to address bean pests because they are easy to use, efficient, cost effective and result in increased production. Furthermore, the study revealed the important role played by IPDM project groups and village extension officers (VEOs) in the dissemination of information on the technologies. In this case, 72 % and 68 % of interviewed farmers received the information on the technologies from VEOs and IPDM group members, respectively. Furthermore, the study found several limitations to increased adoption and dissemination of information. These includes; lack of capital, unpredictable weather conditions, market access, NGOs regulations and land shortage. Although, the livelihood of the majority of people in Hai district have roots in agriculture farmers also experience problems associated with policies, NGOs participation, shortage of botanicals and dissemination constraints, the study recommended that a stakeholders' workshop be organised to review and discuss about the various problems and draw conclusions for future action.
