40|$|<b>Nucleate</b> <b>boiling,</b> {{especially}} {{near the}} {{critical heat flux}} (CHF), can provide excellent economy along with high efficiency of heat transfer. However, the performance of <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> may deteriorate in a reduced gravity environment and the <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> usually has a potentially dangerous characteristic in CHF regime. That is, any slight overload can result in burnout of the boiling surface because the heat transfer will suddenly move into the film-boiling regime. Therefore, enhancement of <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer becomes more important in reduced gravity environments. Enhancing <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> and critical heat flux can be reached using micro-configured metal-graphite composites as the boiling surface. Thermocapillary force induced by temperature difference between the graphite-fiber tips and the metal matrix, which is independent of gravity, will {{play an important role}} in bubble detachment. Thus boiling heat transfer performance does not deteriorate in a reduced-gravity environment. Based on the existing experimental data, and a two-tier theoretical model, correlation formulas are derived for <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> on the copper-graphite and aluminum-graphite composite surfaces, in both the isolated and coalesced bubble regimes. Experimental studies were performed on <b>nucleate</b> pool <b>boiling</b> of pentane on cooper-graphite (Cu-Gr) and aluminum-graphite (Al-Gr) composite surfaces with various fiber volume concentrations for heat fluxes up to 35 W per square centimeter. It is revealed that a significant enhancement in boiling heat transfer performance on the composite surfaces is achieved, due to the presence of micro-graphite fibers embedded in the matrix. The onset of <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> (the isolated bubble regime) occurs at wall superheat of about 10 C for the Cu-Gr surface and 15 C for the Al-Gr surface, much lower than their respective pure metal surfaces. Transition from an isolated bubble regime to a coalesced bubble regime in boiling occurs at a superheat of about 14 C on Cu-Gr surface and 19 C on Al-Gr surface...|$|R

This free-particle technique brings about <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> at a low degree of superheat by means of metal particles that are not fixed to the heated surface, but rather are free to move {{with respect to the}} surface. The effects of copper particles with sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to 9 mm on <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer and critical heat flux (CHF) of the wetting dielectric fluid FC- 72 are investigated. Visualizations of the bubble nucleation characteristics due to the free particles are presented. Experimental results show that the introduction of microscale free particles onto a superheated surface effectively facilitates bubble nucleation and thus increases the <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer coefficients. Millimeter-sized as well as nanoscale free particles do not have a strong effect on the boiling heat transfer performance of this wetting fluid. Introduction of a large quantity of microscale free particles reduces CHF by increasing the resistance to liquid replenishment and vapor departure; however, by properly selecting particle size and quantity, an improvement in both <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer and CHF is observed.

In addition to macroscopic parameters like the average heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux [CHF] value, more fundamental parameters such as the bubble departure diameter and frequency, growth and wait times, and nucleation site density [NSD] were directly measured for a thin, resistively heated, indium-tin-oxide surface deposited onto a sapphire substrate.
