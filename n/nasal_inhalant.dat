40|$|In the paper, the {{in vitro}} {{dissolution}} of borneol in 12 hours from 6 batches of optimized inhalant samples were investigated. As a new dosage form, the in vitro release apparatus of <b>nasal</b> <b>inhalant</b> was invented and a pushing bump was used {{according to the}} simulation of the nose expiration and inspiration. Based on the data of r 2 in the profile and similar factor f 2 from 6 linear release tendencies, a good controlled release and a zero order tendency were observed. It can be suggested {{that there is a}} good correlation between the in vitro controlled release and the nose steady self-controllable expiration and inspiration, which will contribute to the trend of insoluble volatile drug controlled release and the effect of quick absorption in nasal pulmonary delivery to cure severe or acute cardiovascular or lung diseases at patients' sleeping, such as angina or breathing obstruction. Also, it was concluded that the prescription composed of insoluble volatile drugs can be prepared to be <b>nasal</b> <b>inhalant</b> from which drugs can be absorbed through nose steady self-controllable inspiration to the lung then into the blood and have a great effectiveness improvement of bioavailability at night timing drug delivery system...|$|E
40|$|PET is a {{technique}} with a strong potential for use in drug evaluation and development. In particular, the distribution and pharmacokinet-ics of locally administered drugs may be advantageously explored noninvasively using labeled compounds. This pilot study was per formed to demonstrate the effectiveness of PET for drug develop ment and to determine the human biodistribution and kinetics of triamcinolone acetonide, labeled with 11 C, formulated and nasally administered as NasacortÂ®AQ <b>nasal</b> <b>inhalant.</b> Methods: Carbon- 11 -labeled triamcinolone acetonide was formulated as the commer cial product, and PET scans of the heads of four volunteers were performed in a vertical orientation. Region-of-interest analysis with MRI coregistration was {{used to analyze the}} distribution and kinetics in nasal tissues. Results: Deposition {{of the majority of the}} dose on target tissues was immediate. Penetration into sinuses was ob served. There was moderate redistribution and slow migration of th...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Meth{{amphetamine}}, {{part of the}} amphetamine {{group of}} drugs, was first discovered in Japan in 1919. It has been clandestinely manufactured in the United States since the 1960 s, and is still legally produced there as a <b>nasal</b> <b>inhalant,</b> as treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder and exogenous obesity, as well as off-label treatment for narcolepsy. (1) It is a cheap (about R 15 - 30 per 'straw'), easily obtainable, odourless, white powder, which has a bitter, taste, but dissolves easily in water or alcohol. Known as, amongst others, ' speed', 'ice', 'crystal', 'chalk', 'glass', 'crank', and locally, 'tik', it can be smoked, snorted, orally ingested, injected intravenously or even administered anally. In South Africa the preferred method consists of placing the powder or crystal in a light bulb (from which the metal threading has been removed) and inhaling the fumes produced while heating the bulb from below with a lighter. (2). The use of methamphetamine has risen sharply globally over the last decade, used by 26 million people worldwide by 2007, more than heroin and cocaine combined, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. This has been ascribed to many interlocking reasons: it is cheap, easily obtainable, easy to use {{without the need for}} needles or other special 'equipment', and it produces in the user a characteristic 'rush'. This feeling of confidence, power and heightened sexual levels, of feeling 'on top of the world' has made it especially popular amongst teenagers and young adults. (3...|$|E
