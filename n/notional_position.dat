50|$|Cleary {{lost the}} seat to Labor at the 1996 federal election. Wills had {{undergone}} a redistribution, by adding territory to the division, which weakened Cleary's <b>notional</b> <b>position</b> against Labor. Cleary's vote of 22.7% was a decrease of 6.7% from the 29.4% he polled in 1993, on different boundaries. It was a decrease of 2.6% from 25.3% he notionally polled on the new boundaries, {{but that is not}} a very meaningful figure since it assumes that he polled no votes in the territory added to the division.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} simple model of futures {{arbitrage}} that implies that if purchases by commodity index funds influence futures prices, then the <b>notional</b> <b>positions</b> {{of the index}} investors should help predict excess returns in these contracts. We find {{no evidence that the}} positions of index traders in agricultural contracts as identified by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can help predict returns on the near futures contracts. Although there is some support that these positions might help predict changes in oil futures prices over 2006 – 2009, the relation breaks down out of sample. 1...|$|R
50|$|Co-located {{satellites}} cannot {{actually be}} positioned {{at the same}} point on the geostationary satellite arc. In fact, they are just close enough together to appear to be at the same position so far as the beamwidth of the receiving dish is concerned. SES maintains its co-located satellites within an imaginary 150 km cube in space, centred on the <b>notional</b> orbital <b>position.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} brought {{substantial}} increased participation in commodity markets by index funds that maintain long {{positions in the}} near futures contracts. Policy makers and academic studies have reached sharply different conclusions {{about the effects of}} these funds on commodity futures prices. This paper proposes a unifying framework for examining this question, noting that according to a simple model of futures arbitrage, if index-fund buying influences prices by changing the risk premium, then the <b>notional</b> <b>positions</b> of the index investors should help predict excess returns in these contracts. We find no evidence that the positions of traders in agricultural contracts identified by the CFTC as following an index strategy can help predict returns on the near futures contracts. We review evidence that these positions might help predict changes in oil futures prices, and find that while there is some support for this in the earlier data, this appears to be driven by some of the dramatic features of the 2007 - 2009 recession, with the relation breaking down out of sample...|$|R
40|$|We show whether central {{clearing}} {{of a particular}} class of derivatives lowers counterparty risk. For plausible cases, adding a {{central clearing}} counterparty (CCP) for a class of deriva-tives such as credit default swaps reduces netting efficiency, leading {{to an increase in}} av-erage exposure to counterparty default. Further, clearing different classes of derivatives in separate CCPs always increases counterparty exposures relative to clearing the combined set of derivatives in a single CCP. We provide theory as well as illustrative numerical ex-amples of these results that are calibrated to <b>notional</b> derivatives <b>position</b> data for major banks.

40|$|Existing {{numerical}} {{models of}} the swash zone are relatively inflexible in dealing with sediment transport due to a high dependence of the deployed numerical schemes on empirical sediment transport relations. Moreover, these models are usually not well-balanced, meaning {{they are unable to}} correctly simulate quiescent flow. Here a well-balanced and flexible morphological model for the swash zone is presented. The nonlinear shallow water equations and the Exner equation are discretized by the shock-capturing finite volume method, in which the numerical flux and the bed slope source term are estimated by a well-balanced version of the SLIC (Slope LImited Centered) scheme that does not depend on empirical sediment transport relations. The satisfaction of the well-balanced property is demonstrated through simulating quiescent coastal flow. The quantitative accuracy of the model in reproducing key parameters (i. e., the <b>notional</b> shoreline <b>position,</b> the swash depth, the flow velocity, the overtopping flow volume, the beach change depth and the sediment transport rate) is shown to be satisfactory through comparisons against analytical solutions, experimental data as well as previous numerical solutions. This work facilitates an improved modeling framework for the swash hydrodynamics and sediment transport. Comment: 25 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the concept}} of {{available}} potential energy (APE) density is extended to a multicomponent Boussinesq ﬂuid with a nonlinear equation of state. As shown by previous studies, the APE density is naturally interpreted as the work against buoyancy forces that a parcel needs to perform to move from a <b>notional</b> reference <b>position</b> at which its buoyancy vanishes to its actual position; because buoyancy can be deﬁned relative to an arbitrary reference state, so can APE density. The concept of APE density is therefore best viewed as deﬁning a class of locally deﬁned energy quantities, each tied to a diﬀerent reference state, {{rather than as a}} single energy variable. An important result, for which a new proof is given, is that the volume integrated APE density always exceeds Lorenz’s globally deﬁned APE, except when the reference state coincides with Lorenz’s adiabatically re-arranged reference state of minimum potential energy. A parcel reference position is systematically deﬁned as a level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) : depending {{on the nature of the}} ﬂuid and on how the reference state is deﬁned, a parcel may have one, none, or multiple LNB within the ﬂuid. Multiple LNB are only possible for a multicomponent ﬂuid whose density depends on pressure. When no LNB exists within the ﬂuid, a parcel reference position is assigned at the minimum or maximum geopotential height. The class of APE densities thus deﬁned admits local and global balance equations, which all exhibit a conversion with kinetic energy, a production term by boundary buoyancy ﬂuxes, and a dissipation term by internal diﬀusive eﬀects. Diﬀerent reference states alter the partition between APE production and dissipation, but neither aﬀect the net conversion between kinetic energy and APE, nor the diﬀerence between APE production and dissipation. We argue that the possibility of constructing APE-like budgets based on reference states other than Lorenz’s reference state is more important than has been previously assumed, and we illustrate the feasibility of doing so in the context of an idealised and realistic oceanic example, using as reference states one with constant density and another one deﬁned as the horizontal mean density ﬁeld; in the latter case, the resulting APE density is found to be a reasonable approximation of the APE density constructed from Lorenz’s reference state, while being computationally cheaper...|$|R
