The maximum likelihood method and MUSIC algorithm were introduced into the parameter estimation of partially polarized waves. Attitude reference information for an aircraft that was calibrated by an information base station was delivered by polarized electromagnetic waves. Through receiving and processing the information of the aircraft, a single electromagnetic vector sensor can acquire the aircraft attitude in a geographic coordinate system. Differing from the triangle calculation method which relies on a multi-point measurement, the proposed method only needs a base station signal and a single receiver on the motion platform to realize the posture perception of aircraft. It can therefore serve {{as a substitute for}} aircraft attitude <b>navigation</b> and aircraft <b>heading</b> <b>navigation.</b> The introduction of the motion platform attitude estimation algorithm provides a technology support for engineering applications...|$|R
5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother <b>Navigation</b> <b>heads</b> westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|R

As the scheme had been approved by Parliament and was clearly in the interests of trade, there was little chance that objectors would prevail, but the committee's recommendations were moderate. Pitson was granted an order protecting his investment and requesting the county authorities take more care to keep the peace.

40|$|While high-degree {{models of}} the Earth’s gravity {{potential}} have been inferred from measurements {{for more than a}} decade, corresponding geomagnetic models are difficult to produce. The primary challenge lies in the estimation of the magnetic potential, which is not completely determined by available field intensity measurements and cannot be computed by direct integration. Described here is the methodology behind the third generation of the National Geophysical Data Center’s degree- 720 magnetic model. Key issues are (1) the ellipsoidal harmonic representation of the magnetic potential, (2) the reduction of ambiguities by a suitable penalty function, and (3) the use of an iterative method to estimate the model coefficients. The NGDC- 720 model provides the lithospheric magnetic field vector at any desired location and altitude close to and above the Earth’s surface.

The evidence considered included consequences {{for the quality of}} driver performance and possible startle effects.

Possible effects of different implementations of the secondary light source (high-intensity discharge and incandescent) were also briefly discussed.
