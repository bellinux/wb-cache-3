Even if the structure of the active catalyst is not known, Corey’s model proposes the following: the aldehyde is activated by complexation with the chiral catalyst (R)-BINOL-TiX2 via the formyl lone electron pair syn to the formyl hydrogen to form a pentacoordinate Ti structure. CH—O hydrogen bonding occurs to the stereoelectronically most favorable oxygen lone pair of the BINOL ligand. In such a structure, the top (re) face of the formyl group is much more accessible to a nucleophile attack, as the bottom (si) face is shielded by the neighboring <b>naphtol</b> moiety, thus affording the observed configuration of the product.|$|E

40|$|Histocytological {{characteristics}} of Eucalyptus urophylla 9 Eucalyptus grandis shoot apical meristems (SAMs) were described, comparing five outdoor and in vitro sources of akin genotypes differing in their physiological age. The {{size and the}} number of cells of the five zones identified within each SAM, i. e. the two tunica layers (L 1 and L 2), the central mother cells (CMC), the peripheral zone (PZ) and the combination of these four zones (4 CZ) varied according to physiological age and plastochron phase. These five zones were significantly larger with higher numbers of cells for SAMs from mature and juvenile trees than for those from physiologically rejuvenated, in vitro mature and in vitro juvenile plants. However, these origin-related differences were not significant for SAMs in their early plastochron phase, to become obvious in a more advanced plastochron stage. Individual cell and nuclear measurements confirmed the rationale of distinguishing within SAM zones, characterized by specific cell and nuclear sizes liable to vary according to physiological age. The various histocytological investigations carried out established that SAM cell characteristics appeared to be the more reliable indicators of phase change. This was particularly true for the nucleoplasmic ratio and for more qualitative differences observed also at the nuclear level. SAM nuclei of the two in vitro origins were more evenly stained by <b>naphtol</b> blue-black, uniformly light for the juvenile source, whereas the mature source showed also darker nuclei. In contrast, SAM nuclei from outdoor origins had more chromocenters, darker and diffusely spread for the mature source than for the rejuvenated and the juvenile origins, where they were more peripherally distributed and where the nucleoli appeared more clearly. These results were discussed with respect to physiological ageing and in vitro culture influence, and suggest a determining influence of SAM cell nuclei on phase change phenomenon of arborescent species.

40|$|On this {{research}} has been done the optimization of the batik wax waste utilization through batik wax making with blending method using bees wax, gum rosin, paraffin and lard. This research has been expected to be able to reduce the water pollution along with the decline in the quantity of batik solid waste which has been discharged into water bodies. However, research needs to be done regarding the quality of batik product resulting from a production process using wax which involves the use of batik wax waste. The batik product quality is determined by latched power, and the resistance of the wax against cracking and alkaline chemicals of batik wax product which has been used. The latched power test results from four groups of batik wax product showed the area with minimum latched power on temperature range of 50 - 70 ˚C for batik wax which have been made from blending of bees wax, wax waste, and gum rosin, 50 - 80 ˚C for batik wax which have been made from blending of bees wax, wax waste, and paraffin;  50 - 90 ˚C for batik wax which have been made from blending of bees wax, gum rosin and lard. Compared with wax product which have been made from blend of bees wax, wax waste and gum rosin as well as with paraffin, the batik wax product which have been made from the blend of bees wax, gum rosin and lard have lower resistance to cracking that has been observed from the occurance of yellow color on the fabric sample resulted from the dyeing process using yellow <b>naphtol.</b> The different result has been obtained from resistance test of the wax product against alkaline chemicals which showed that all kind of batik wax product resulted on {{this research}} have a good resistance against alkaline chemicals which has been observed from the absence of wax mass reduction of the fabric samples before and after treatment in the alkaline chemicals...|$|E
40|$|In {{the embryo}} of Triturus pyrrhogaster (BOIE), the unique {{character}} of the organiser, i. e. the capacity of self-differentiation and primary induction, appears as early as in St. 7 (64 cells) and is highly enhanced until St. 9 (early blastula) (NAKAMURA et al., 1962 - 1967). In parallel with it, the fine structure of the cells involved in the organiser region undergoes remarkable changes, including the utilization of the yolk (NAKAMURA et al., 1965, 1966). Then, it has been attempted to study the activity in these stages of the enzymes supposed likely to have close relation to these changes. The present communication concerns exclusively with the activity of aliesterases demonstrated histochemically {{by the use of}} the procedure devised by GOMORI (1956). After being supplied with <b>naphtol</b> AS acetate as the substratum, enzyme activity was detected by the reaction upon the azo dye, Fast blue RR. The specific color indicating the activity of aliesterases was noted in all cells of the morula in St. 7 and St. 8. In these stages, the activity was apparently predominant in the animal hemisphere. But, the exact reverse {{was the case in the}} next stages (Text-fig.). The cells in the animal hemisphere of the blastula in St. 9 and St. 10 were dyed very faintly, while those in the vegetal hemisphere were laden with a heavy and deep color. In the gastrula in St. 12, a strong activity was shown in only a small region, namely in the cells covering the floor of archenteron which had just appeared as a narrow cavity. All of the remaining cells reacted very weakly. Especially, the coloration in the animal hemisphere was slight so as to be hardly recognizable. Through the whole course of experiments, the cells in the organiser region reacted in the same way as other cells in the vegetal hemisphere. It seems unlikely that changes in the activity of aliesterases is an immediate cause of the establishment of the unique {{character of the}} organiser...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{composition}} {{of an art}} paint is influenced by several factors: the painting technique used by the artist, the decay processes affecting the painting materials over time due to environmental factors, and the different materials possibly used for the protection and conservation of the object. Improved knowledge on the material {{composition of}} paint layers on heritage items will allow {{a better understanding of}} the painting technique used by the authors, will contribute to the characterization assignment and authentication of artworks, and sustainable conservation of the heritage objects. This thesis presents a research related to the characterization and physical chemical properties of organic materials used in paint layers both from natural and synthetic origin. Organic materials can be used in painted surfaces for different purposes: as adhesives, when joining together two surfaces; as binging media, if applied in order to assure cohesion in a paint layer; as consolidant if used to return the lost coherence a paint layer; as varnish or protective layer or coatings of the painted surfaces. In this thesis we focus our attention on proteinaceous materials used as binders in tempera paint layers, their interaction with coloured pigments and their ageing behavior, and on alkyd resins used in modern and contemporary art; in particular synthetic resin produced by the Winsor & Newton, Series Griffin – fast drying oil colour were considered. Two formulations of siloxanes produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) to be used as protective coatings were studied as well. Analysis were performed by using several techniques with a particular focus on thermoanalytical ones. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetric and evolved gas analysis coupled with Fourier infrared spectroscopy (TG-EGA-FTIR), and Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on the solid samples enabled the characterization of the chemical physical behavior of the paint layer components. The first chapter of the thesis introduces the different organic materials studied, natural and synthetic, in particular proteins, proteinaceous materials and alkyd resins. The second chapter presents the technical aspects of sampling giving an overview of the methods used for binding media and resins analysis (TGA, TG-FTIR, FTIR and DSC) revealing advantages and limits for each of them. Beginning from the third chapter the thesis presents the analysis of the material studied. The pure pigments (natural or synthetic) used in proteinaceous and alkyd binders, and filler are characterized by TGA and FTIR. The fourth chapter studies the proteinaceous binder (ovalbumin, casein and rabbit glue), their interaction with five different inorganic pigments (azurite, red ochre, calcium carbonate, cinnabar and minium) and the effect of artificial UV-ageing. The fifth chapter studies the alkyd resins produced by the Winsor & Newton- series Griffin- Fast drying oil colour and their interaction with ten different pigments, organic (arylamide yellow, phthalocyanine, <b>naphtol</b> carbamide) and inorganic (cadmium-zinc sulphide, chromium oxide and sulphoselenide, aluminium-silicate of sodium, titanium dioxide and bone black), the effect of natural ageing of 8 months and of artificial ageing with acetic acid. The sixth chapter studies the silane/siloxane coatings, in particular alkyl silane and alkyl-alkoxy siloxane, their characterization, their ageing after two years of natural outdoor ageing and their interactions with acrylic colour. These two formulations of coatings are produced by Caparol (Disboxan 450) and Phase Restauro (Hydrophase) and the selected product will be applied on the wall painting “Tuttomondo” of Keith Haring on the Church of Sant’ Antonio in Pisa...|$|E
