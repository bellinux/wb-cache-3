5|$|A Megalosaurus rib {{figured in}} 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a {{pathological}} swollen spot <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of its capitular process. The swollen spot {{appears to have}} been caused by a healed fracture and is located at the point where it would have articulated with its vertebra.|$|E
5|$|Stela 43 {{dates to}} AD 514. It {{was set in}} a vaulted chamber <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of Structure 2. The text is damaged but carries an early {{spelling}} of the k'uhul chatan winik non-royal noble title used in Calakmul and the Mirador Basin.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects {{to a system of}} tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are {{two pairs of}} malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
5000|$|The flower {{has four}} yellow petals a few {{millimeters}} long {{which may have}} red spots <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} bears 1 to 7 erect bell-shaped flowers. Each flower {{has three}} sepals and three yellow petals with reddish areas <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The erect stalks {{grow up to}} 30 centimeters tall. They bear poppy {{flowers with}} yellow petals one half to two centimeters long, often with orange spots <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> fruit is a capsule 4 to 7 centimeters long {{containing}} tiny netted brown seeds.|$|R
5|$|Other Marasmius {{species with}} a {{pinwheel}} arrangement of gills are readily distinguished from M.rotula by differences in color, including the orange M.siccus, the pink M.pulcherripes, and the rust M.fulvoferrugineus. Mycena corticola {{is smaller than}} Marasmius rotula, has a pale pink-brown cap, and is usually found growing singly or in small groups on bark <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of living trees.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) {{operates}} the Cole M. Rivers Hatchery <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{of the dam}} at Lost Creek Lake, slightly upstream of the former Rogue–Elk Hatchery built by Hume. It raises rainbow trout (steelhead), Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) built the hatchery in 1973 to offset the loss of fish habitat and spawning grounds in areas blocked by construction of the Lost Creek Dam on the main stem and the Applegate and Elk Creek dams on Rogue tributaries. It is the third-largest salmon and steelhead hatchery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
50|$|Odontodactylus scyllarus is a burrower, {{constructing}} U-shaped {{holes in}} <b>the</b> loose substrate <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of coral reefs in water ranging from 3 to 40 m deep.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{a cluster}} of a few bright yellow flowers with petals up to 1.5 centimeters long and sometimes marked with red <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> fruit is a narrow, curving utricle up to 2.6 centimeters in length which contains many minute seeds which are bumpy under magnification.|$|R
2500|$|... 28 June 1996: an IRA unit mortared a British Army base at Osnabrück in Germany. The attack caused {{widespread}} damage when a shell landed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base's</b> fuel depot.|$|R
5|$|Other animals Deinonychus shared {{its world}} with include herbivorous dinosaurs {{such as the}} armored Sauropelta and the ornithopods Zephyrosaurus and Tenontosaurus. In Oklahoma, the {{ecosystem}} of Deinonychus also included the large theropod Acrocanthosaurus, the huge sauropod Sauroposeidon, the crocodilians Goniopholis and Paluxysuchus, and the gar Lepisosteus. If the teeth found in Maryland are those of Deinonychus, then its neighbors would include Astrodon and a nodosaur (called Priconodon) only known from teeth. The middle portion of the Cloverly Formation ranges in age from 115 ± 10Ma <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> to 108.5 ± 0.2Ma near the top.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
5|$|Physically, the Australian blacktip shark {{can only}} {{reliably}} {{be distinguished from}} the common blacktip shark {{by the number of}} vertebrae (174–182 total, 84–91 before the tail in C. tilstoni, 182–203 total, 94–102 before the tail in C. limbatus). It has a moderately robust, spindle-shaped body and a long, pointed snout. The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The furrows at the corners of the mouth are barely evident. There are 32–35 upper and 29–31 lower tooth rows; each upper tooth has a slender, upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> while the lower teeth are narrower and more finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The forewings are very dark purplish {{with a white}} spot on the costa at the apical third, shaded with black anteriorly. There are two black discal spots shaded with white <b>near</b> <b>the</b> middle of the wing and a similar one on the fold, below <b>the</b> first and <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are yellowish.|$|R
50|$|Adults are uniform mouse-colour, {{with the}} {{forewings}} a shade {{darker than the}} hindwings, the former crossed by two curved lines, <b>the</b> first <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> very indistinct, <b>the</b> second broken into spots.|$|R
50|$|The flowers grow atop thin erect {{stems and}} are usually yellow and {{occasionally}} white, or yellow with white spots <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> four spoon-shaped petals. The stamens are short compared to Camissonia.|$|R
5|$|Private flying can be {{for both}} {{recreational}} purposes and personal transport, using aircraft that are owned individually, collectively {{as part of a}} syndicate, or rented from a flying club. A survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day trips away. Half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from, and only 9 per cent involved an overnight stay away from home.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} {{are dark}} purple, more greyish at <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> {{with a broad}} dark yellow fascia nearly in the middle, very nearly straight, but rather <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> on <b>the</b> inner margin than on the costa. The hindwings are coppery-brown, but paler at <b>the</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{inflorescence}} bears 2 to 6 erect bell-shaped flowers. Each flower {{has three}} sepals and three white or pinkish petals. The petals {{are up to}} 3 centimeters long and spotted with red and yellow <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases,</b> where there are patches of yellow hairs.|$|R
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on {{the tips of the}} toes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operational}} {{deployment of}} RAAF Hornets {{took place in}} 2001. Following the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Australian Government agreed to deploy F/A-18s to protect the major USAF air base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, which was being used to mount operations in Afghanistan. Four No.77 Squadron Hornets and 70 personnel departed for the island on 9 November. No.3 Squadron pilots and ground crew relieved the No.77 Squadron personnel in early February 2002. RAAF Hornets were not assigned to the War in Afghanistan as {{at the time they}} were less capable than other available coalition aircraft. While the F/A-18s were occasionally scrambled in response to reports of aircraft <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> no threat developed. The detachment returned to Australia on 21 May 2002.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to Phorcus turbinatus in form, but usually has the {{outlines}} of the spire more convex. The columella projection or tooth is <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> than in <b>the</b> Phorcus turbinatus, and the diverse color patterns will serve to further distinguish the two species.|$|R
5000|$|Flies in this genus {{have become}} model organisms in sound {{localization}} experiments {{because of their}} [...] "ears", which are complex structures inside <b>the</b> fly's prothorax <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> front legs. The most common and widespread species, Ormia ochracea, has been {{the center of this}} research.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 78 mm. Both wings are dull greyish brown, with erect dark broadish postmedian stripes. The forewings have a subbasal, erect, slightly oblique dark line angled below the costa {{and there are}} four hyaline spots below each other, {{as well as a}} fifth minute one <b>near</b> <b>the</b> angled line. The hindwings have three small hyaline spots below each other, and two smaller ones below each other <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> <b>The</b> posterior margin and long tail are rather darker {{than the rest of the}} wing.|$|R
5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a hot blast, {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> The hot blast temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other red-pored, bluing boletes {{that could be}} {{confused}} with S.amygdalinus. The poisonous European species Rubroboletus satanas and its North American counterpart R.eastwoodiae have lighter colored caps and a reticulate pattern on the stipe. B.subvelutipes is a highly variable species from eastern North America that includes red in its range of cap colors, and has a fuzzy coating of hairs <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of its stipe; it may represent a group of species. Another similar species is B.luridiformis, found in North America and Northern Europe under both broadleaf trees and conifers. Unlike S.amygdalinus, however, B.luridiformis has a dark brown to nearly blackish-brown cap, and a yellow stipe with a dense covering of red pruina (dots).|$|E
5|$|When feeding, this flycatcher makes many short {{flights from}} perch to perch, preferring to hunt in shrubs with small leaves, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} genera Adesmia, Baccharis, and Porlieria. A tit-tyrant tends to land <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the shrub and make its way upwards while frequently flicking its tail upwards and shuddering its wings. It has also been observed pivoting on its perch throughout this process. While foraging, the tufted tit-tyrant averages three attacks on prey items per minute. Its feeding style {{has been compared to}} that of a kinglet.|$|E
