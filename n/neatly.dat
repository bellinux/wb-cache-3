5|$|The {{majority}} of pulpal toothache falls {{into one of}} the following types; however, other rare causes (which do not always fit <b>neatly</b> into these categories) include galvanic pain and barodontalgia.|$|E
5|$|A <b>neatly</b> {{assembled}} setup, with regulators, gauges, {{and delicate}} computers stowed inside the BCD, or clipped {{where they will}} not be walked on, and stowed under the boat bench or secured to a rack, is the practice of a competent diver.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were {{arranged}} <b>neatly</b> into four groups of four, based on commonality of their orbital elements. Since then, {{the large number}} of new small outer moons has complicated this picture. There are now thought to be six main groups, although some are more distinct than others.|$|E
5|$|The gardens were {{constructed}} {{in a series}} of 'rooms', which are separated from each other by high, <b>neatly</b> clipped box and yew hedges. The gardens were influenced by the Arts and Crafts style popular at the time. The Jenners had a garden staff of four.|$|E
5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall <b>neatly</b> {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built <b>neatly</b> on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|In {{times of}} armed {{conflict}} and war, the SBS and SAS are required to operate in small parties in enemy-controlled territory. Operations of this nature require men of courage and high morale who have excellent tactical awareness be it knowledge of special tactics or simply knowing one's place in a polyvalent unit. Self-discipline <b>neatly</b> ties into this. Intelligence, reliability, determination and also being physically fit are key skills.|$|E
5|$|Process {{philosophy}} {{is even more}} difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be <b>neatly</b> separated. The 32-volume State University of New York series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian David Ray Griffin displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} <b>neatly</b> organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|The Country Wife is more <b>neatly</b> {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but {{is typical of}} its time and place in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's impotence trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less <b>neatly</b> scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{due process}} clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not <b>neatly</b> sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
5|$|The final {{versions}} of the sonatas convey {{the impression of a}} single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828. The sonatas were labeled Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of the}} last folio of the third sonata the date September 26. As compared to the sketches, the final versions are written much more <b>neatly</b> and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|E
5|$|The {{gardens are}} listed as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special {{historic}} interest in England. The original 17th-century gardens have disappeared. However, the Jenners laid them out in an Arts and Crafts style {{with a series of}} 'rooms', which are separated from each other by high, <b>neatly</b> clipped box and yew hedges. These are complemented by ponds and walks in and between each of the 'rooms'.|$|E
5|$|Told in letters, {{it is as}} <b>neatly</b> plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of {{the most}} {{outrageous}} of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category <b>neatly.</b> Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be <b>neatly</b> categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit <b>neatly</b> into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands <b>neatly</b> fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often {{seems to have a}} life of its own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit <b>neatly</b> into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses <b>neatly</b> to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are <b>neatly</b> arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length and weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and <b>neatly</b> black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|With Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman {{developed}} {{a model of}} weak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process {{is a combination of}} vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an antineutrino). Although E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because the weak interaction was <b>neatly</b> described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation.|$|E
5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a <b>neatly</b> bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit <b>neatly</b> into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, and because it is only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a <b>neatly</b> trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both his arms. In addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This <b>neatly</b> demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|The episode's teleplay {{was written}} by Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri from a story by Michael Borkow (part one) and Jill Condon & Amy Toomin (part two). The episode's genesis came during the break between seasons three and four, when Channel 4, the British first-run {{broadcaster}} of Friends proposed an episode set in the United Kingdom to the series producers. The proposal fitted <b>neatly</b> with a storyline already being planned, whereby the character of Ross would be married {{at the end of}} the fourth season. The episode was filmed in March 1998 under the direction of executive producer Kevin S. Bright on locations in London, and in front of a live studio audience at The Fountain Studios. Scenes featuring Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe Buffay were filmed on the show's sets in Burbank, California, as Kudrow was too pregnant to fly to London with the rest of the cast. Kudrow gave birth to her son on the day of the episode's original airing.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{called by}} the State {{supported}} Farrar's and the prosecutors' earlier claims that police had been called to the home {{a month before the}} fire, that Green's behavior had been cause for concern at the time, and that Farrar had turned in to police at that time seed packets containing castor beans. The Earl May store clerk who had identified Green as the purchaser of multiple packets of castor bean seeds testified to that effect. Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit <b>neatly</b> within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of ricin poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for ricin antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to ricin.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and <b>neatly,</b> carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded <b>neatly</b> on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|The main {{veins and}} the crossveins form the wing venation pattern. The venation {{patterns}} {{are different in}} different species. There may be very numerous crossveins or rather few. The Australian Flatwing Damselfly's wings {{are one of the}} few veins patterns. The venation pattern is useful for species identification. Almost all Anisoptera settle with the wings held out sideways or slightly downward, however most Zygoptera settle with the wings held together, dorsal surfaces apposed. The thorax of Zygoptera is so oblique that when held in this way the wings fit <b>neatly</b> along the top of the abdomen. They do not appear to be held straight up as in butterflies or mayflies. In a few zygopteran families the wings are held horizontally at rest, and in one anisopteran genus (e.g. Cordulephya, Corduliidae) the wings are held in the typical damselfly resting position. Adult species possess two pairs of equal or subequal wings. There appear to be only five main vein stems. A nodus is formed where the second main vein (subcosta) meets the leading edge of the wing. In most families a conspicuous pterostigma is carried near the wing tip. Identification as Odonata can be based on the venation. The only likely confusion is with some lacewings (order Neuroptera) which have many crossveins in the wings. Until the early years of the 20th century Odonata were often regarded as being related to lacewings and were given the ordinal name Paraneuroptera, but any resemblance between these two orders is entirely superficial. In Anisoptera the hindwing is broader than the forewing and in both wings a crossvein divides the discoidal cell into a Triangle and Supertriangle.|$|E
25|$|Ma Bufang also {{promoted}} education. He made businessmen methodically {{clean up}} Xining, {{the capital of}} Qinghai, by serving as insect exterminators, killing flies, and <b>neatly</b> disposing of them.|$|E
25|$|One {{manifestation of}} SLE is {{abnormalities}} in apoptosis, {{a type of}} programmed cell death in which aging or damaged cells are <b>neatly</b> disposed of {{as a part of}} normal growth or functioning.|$|E
25|$|Concurrency {{supports}} the primary method of error-handling in Erlang. When a process crashes, it <b>neatly</b> exits and {{sends a message}} to the controlling process which can then take action, such as for instance starting a new process that takes over the old process's task.|$|E
