40|$|Abstract – Simulation and {{experimental}} results shown on {{this paper describes}} {{the performance of a}} developed Single-Phase Series Active Conditioner that regulates the voltage being delivered to a load. This Custom Power device is a solution for power quality issues related with voltage amplitude variations, which are responsible for innumerous flaws in industrial processes which brings with it high financial losses. The Single-Phase Series Active Conditioner is a back-to-back converter, composed by two power converters sharing a common DC link. One of the converters is series connected to the electrical grid, whereas the other one is shunt connected. The first is used to compensate load voltage, and the second to regulate the DC link voltage. This paper shows the results obtained with the Series Active Conditioner in Sag, Swell and Flicker events, and also Voltage Harmonics compensation, in order to deliver to the load a sinusoidal voltage, at <b>nominal</b> <b>amplitude.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{work out}} {{the impact of the}} general {{relativistic}} Lense-Thirring effect on the Earth-Mercury range caused by the gravitomagnetic field of the rotating Sun. The peak-to peak <b>nominal</b> <b>amplitude</b> of the resulting time-varying signal amounts to 1. 75 10 ^ 1 m over a temporal interval 2 yr. Future interplanetary laser ranging facilities should reach a cm-level in ranging to Mercury over comparable timescales; for example, the BepiColombo mission, to be launched in 2014, should reach a 4. 5 - 10 cm level over 1 - 8 yr. We looked also at other Newtonian (solar quadrupole mass moment, ring of the minor asteroids, Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Trans-Neptunian Objects) and post-Newtonian (gravitoelectric Schwarzschild solar field) dynamical effects on the Earth-Mercury range. They act as sources of systematic errors for the Lense-Thirring signal which, in turn, if not properly modeled, may bias the recovery of some key parameters of such other dynamical features of motion. Their nominal peak-to-peak amplitudes are as large as 4 10 ^ 5 m (Schwarzschild), 3 10 ^ 2 m (Sun's quadrupole), 8 10 ^ 1 m (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta), 4 m (ring of minor asteroids), 8 10 ^- 1 m (Trans-Neptunian Objects). Their temporal patterns are different with respect to that of the gravitomagnetic signal. Comment: LaTex 2 e, 19 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures.

40|$|An {{approach}} to a solution of two major problems in operating Annular Phased Arrays in deep body hyperthermia is presented: an E-field sensor capable of measuring phase and amplitude at 70 MHz {{and the concept of}} a power transmission factor to determine the effective amplitude of each applicator. In the four-waveguide Phased Array operating at 70 MHz, which is in clinical use at the department of Radiotherapy of the Academic Medical Center (AMC), the incident fields of the waveguides were scanned in phase and amplitude over the complete aperture midplane, inside an elliptical and a square phantom filled with saline. As a check on the application of the superposition principle, superpositions of the incident fields were compared with the electric field in the measured interference set-ups. With all four applicators radiating at equal amplitude and in phase, the maximum difference over the complete midplane of the phantom between superimposed and measured interference scans was 20 % and l 0 ' in the elliptical phantom, ancl, 20 % and 30 ' in the square phantom. After having determined <b>nominal</b> <b>amplitude</b> and phase patterns by a vector probe, any interference set-up can be superimposed from measurement of the actual incident field of each applicator. Therefore, the availability of a vector sensor as described here will contribute to solve a problem of hyperthermia quality assurance: the performance evaluation of Phased Arrays...|$|E

The tests were carried out on plates made of FeP 04 -UNI 8092 deep-drawing steel.

The MTS 809 servo-hydraulic device was used for tests performed at the Department of Management and Engineering in Vicenza (Padova University).

40|$|Recently, the {{existence}} of a pointlike pertuber PX with 1 m_Mars≲ m_X≲ 2. 4 m_⊕ supposedly moving at 65 - 80 AU along a moderately inclined orbit has been hypothesized in order to explain certain features of the midplane of the Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). We preliminarily selected two possible scenarios for such a PX, and numerically simulated its effect on the Earth-Saturn range ρ(t) by varying some of its orbital parameters over a certain time span; then, we compared our results with some existing actual range residuals. By assuming m_X = 1 m_Mars and a circular orbit, such a putative new member of our Solar System would nominally perturb ρ(t) by a few km over Δ t = 12 yr (2004 - 2016). However, the Cassini spaceraft accurately measured ρ(t) to the level of σ_ρ≃ 100 m. Nonetheless, such a scenario should not be considered as necessarily ruled out since the Cassini data were reduced so far without explicitly modeling any PX. Indeed, a NASA JPL team recently demonstrated that an extra-signature as large as 4 km affecting the Kronian range would be almost completely absorbed in fitting incomplete dynamical models, i. e. without PX itself, to such simulated data, thus not showing up in the standard post-fit range residuals. Larger anomalous signatures would instead occur for m_X > 1 m_Mars. Their <b>nominal</b> <b>amplitude</b> could be as large as 50 - 150 km for m_X = 2. 4 m_⊕, thus making less plausible their existence. Comment: LaTex 2 e, 10 pages, no tables, 2 figures.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been made of the effect of vibration on heat transfer from a cylinder in crossflow. The cylinder used was 3 / 16 -inch in diameter and was sinusoidally oscillated in the vertical direction by a mechanical drive mechanism while immersed in an open water channel. <b>Nominal</b> <b>amplitude</b> ratios, a/d, varied from 0. 125 to 1. 43 while frequency varied from 0 to 6. 5 cycles per second. Data was taken at three flow Reynolds numbers: 64; 103 and 144. Temperature difference between the cylinder and the water was held at approximately 10 °F. A hydrogen bubble technique was used in conjunction with dye studies to observe the flow near the cylinder. It was found that the heat transfer could be increased or decreased by vibration, depending on the amplitude ratio and the vibrational Reynolds number, (N[subscript Re]) [subscript v] = awρ d/√ 2 μ. Below a critical vibrational Reynolds number, which increased with the flow Reynolds number, oscillation had no effect on the heat transfer. After this critical point was passed, the data for the amplitude ratios 0. 125, 0. 250, and 0. 500 showed a decrease in the heat transfer while the data for higher amplitude ratios (a/d = 1. 00; 1. 43) gave a steady increase. After reaching a minimum, the data for a/d = 0. 500 increased to converge with the data of higher amplitudes; this trend was also suggested by the lower amplitude ratios but was not completely substantiated because of the frequency limitation of the drive mechanism. The maximum decrease in the heat transfer below stationary conditions was about 20 percent; the maximum increase in the heat transfer was 180, 125, and 90 percent for flow Reynolds numbers of 64; 103 and 144 respectively. The vortex shedding frequencies were in the range of frequency used for mechanical oscillation; noting this, an attempt was made to oscillate the cylinder through the immediate frequency range of vortex shedding to see if any special heat transfer effects would result. No change occurred other than the general increase due to increasing the vibrational intensity. The increases in heat transfer are attributed to vibrationally induced turbulence. An adequate explanation of the decreases in heat transfer was not provided by this investigation; however, it is thought that the phenomenon occurring may be similar to the observations of Kubanskii (11) who imposed acoustical vibrations on a cylinder in crossflow. By appropriately locating the cylinder with respect to the nodes of the sound field he found that the point of flow separation shifted toward the upstream side of the cylinder resulting in lower heat transfer rates. A critical (N[subscript Re]) [subscript v]/(N[subscript Re]) [subscript f] required to alter the heat transfer was established for this investigation and although it had a weak dependence on the amplitude ratio, a value of 0. 35 serves as a good approximation for the data of this experiment...|$|E

We prepared six types of specimen of ADC 12 high pressure die cast aluminum alloy, where the casting condition was different to each other, and obtained the S-N curve for each specimen type from the fatigue test. The porosity volume fraction for all specimens was calculated using the X-ray CT images. The image-based finite element analysis was also carried out for all specimens to evaluate the maximum first principal stress corresponding to the <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude</b> in the fatigue test. The maximum stress {{was referred to as}} the local stress amplitude, and its ratio to the <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude</b> was defined as the local stress concentration factor. We modified the S-N data by using the local stress amplitude instead of the <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude,</b> and obtained a single master S-N curve. From the statistical investigation, the local stress concentration factor was found to be determined empirically by the porosity volume fraction. The relationship was identified by the least-square approximation. Consequently, we found that the fatigue strength was predicted from the porosity volume fraction via the local stress amplitude and the master S-N curve...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Fatigue {{behavior}} of hybrid welded joints made of titanium alloy grade 5 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) has been experimentally investigated.

Fatigue curves have been plotted {{both in terms of}} local strain <b>amplitude</b> and <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude.</b> According to the WELFARE method, electrical strain gages have been bonded at the weld toe in order to measure the local strain amplitude as representative parameter of fatigue damage. Experimental results show that the fatigue strength is highly dependent from microstructural variations, and especially from defects and imperfections due to the welding process. Titanium welded joints fatigue strength is much more higher than classical materials such as steel, but internal porosity and external macro-defects, like fused material drops, definitely decrease mechanical characteristics and the fatigue life of titanium welded joints...|$|R

40|$|International audienceExisting {{methods for}} {{computing}} {{the life of}} critical components in jet engines, such as discs, are based on determining the design allowable forcing function (e. g. stress, strain). This is done by subtracting six standard deviations from {{the mean of the}} property in question. For example, if a stress amplitude-based criterion is used, then the design allowable life is given by:View the MathML sourceNadesign=Namean-nσastddevTurn MathJax on where:View the MathML sourceNadesign = the safe operating design life at a given <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude,</b> View the MathML sourceσanom. View the MathML sourceNamean = the mean life at the <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude.</b> View the MathML sourceσastddev = the experimentally measured standard deviation in life from the mean at the <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude.</b> n = the number of standard deviations or “knock down” from the mean life that will produce an acceptable safe operating life. In the aerospace industry, this value traditionally was 3 but now “ 6 σ” has become common and even the norm. This means that those factors which affect the dispersion of results in the High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) and Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) regimes must be well understood and controlled in order to allow higher operating stresses or, conversely, longer lives at a given operating stress. The fatigue resistance of metallic materials suffers from a number of uncertainties, in particular the dispersion associated with variance in microstructure and a component size effect (i. e. scale effect). At low stresses and longer lives, such dispersions are particularly troublesome since small variations in microstructure, for example, can produce large dispersions or uncertainties in life. An understanding of the life-limiting tail of the defect distribution is crucial for modelling and predicting minimum safe operating fatigue lives. This paper concentrates on the two problems of microstructural variance and on the effect of component or specimen size in introducing uncertainty. In the first part, an attempt is made to summarize the micromechanisms of crack initiation by the formation of intrusions/extrusions along the slip bands in pure metals. This is an attempt to develop microstructural elements which are necessary to model the dispersion in fatigue life. While these features are, for the most part, illustrated by using recent results published on Ni-based and Fe-Ni based superalloys, the procedures are applicable {{to a wide range of}} other classes of alloys. In the second part an attempt is made to account for the dispersion associated with specimen or component size in terms of the interaction between the defect distribution and size when fatigue cracks are initiated from inclusions. The case of a Nickel-based alloy, IN 718, in which inclusions are mainly formed by niobium carbides (NbC) is examined in more detail. It is shown how the fatigue resistance of smooth and notched specimens of this material can be simply modelled, knowing the size and the distribution of NbC particles which act as fatigue initiation sites. The approach is further developed to model the fatigue life of notched specimens. The results obtained with this microstructure-sensitive model are compared with those obtained empirically and used in the design of discs in aircraft engines...|$|R

40|$|The {{predicted}} {{orientation of}} Venus' rotation axis relative to its orbit ran be uniquely determined given knowledge of its J 2 gravity coefficient and polar {{moment of inertia}} C if its free obliquity is fully damped. This assumption seems warranted given the dominant damping mechanism: turbulent fluid friction at a core mantle boundary (CMB). This skin friction results from differential obliquity of mantle and core spin axes, and the associated damping rate could be as short as 1 / 10 (exp 6) year. However, the observed pole orientation indicates a free obliquity amplitude epsilon approx. = 2. 1 deg compared with a <b>nominal</b> forced <b>amplitude</b> of 0. 5 deg. There are two plausible explanations. The most likely is that the observed obliquity is a tidally evolved end state in which core friction, modulated by CMB ellipticity and core obliquity amplitude, counterbalances solid and atmospheric tidal torques. This concept is similar to the explanation for the retrograde spin omega as an end state in which solid and atmospheric thermal tidal torques balance at the present spin rate because of the omega(sup - 1) dependence of the axial thermal torque. Weaker effects such as solid and thermal tides can then compete with core friction and for plausible models, their sum tends to increase free obliquity. The obliquity balance is controlled by the nonlinear (and nearly quadratic) dependence of the CMB turbulent "skin friction" torque on obliquity. Core ellipticity also has a profound effect on tidal evolution of Venus obliquity...|$|R

40|$|Crack growth {{caused by}} load repetitions in geometricaliy similar notched {{concrete}} specimens {{of various sizes}} is measured {{by means of the}} compliance method. It is found that the Paris law. which states that the crack length increment per cycle is a power function of the stress intensity factor amplitude. is valid only for one specimen size (the law parameters being adjusted for that size) or asymptotically. for very large specimens. To obtain a general law. the Paris law is combined with the size-effect law for fracture under monotonic load-ing. proposed previously by Ba!ant. This leads to a size-adjusted Paris law. which gives the crack length increment per cycle as a power function of the amplitude of a size-adjusted stress intensity factor. The size adjustment is based on the brittleness number of the struc-ture. representing the ratio of the structure size d to the transitional size d., which separates the responses governed by nominal stress and stress intensity factor. Experiments show that do for cyclic loading is much larger than do for monotonic loading. which means that the brittleness number for cyclic loading is much less than that for mon-otonic loading. The crack growth is alternatively also characterized in terms of the <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude.</b> In the latter form. the size ef-fect vanishes for small structures while. in terms of the stress inten-sity factor amplitude. it vanishes for large structures. The curves of crack length versus the number of cycles are also calculated and are found to agree with data...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{methodology for}} predicting the fatigue life of cast steel components with shrinkage porosity is developed and validated through comparison with previously performed measure-ments. A X-ray tomography technique {{is used to}} reconstruct the porosity distribution in 25 test specimens with average porosities ranging from 8 to 21 pct. The porosity field is imported into finite element analysis (FEA) software to determine the complex stress field resulting from the porosity. In the stress simulation, the elastic mechanical properties are made {{a function of the}} local porosity volume fraction. A multiaxial strain-life simulation is then performed to deter-mine the fatigue life. An adaptive subgrid model is developed to reduce the dependence of the fatigue life predictions on the numerical mesh chosen and to account for the effects of porosity that is too small to be resolved in the simulations. The subgrid model employs a spatially variable fatigue notch factor that is dependent on the local pore radius relative to the finite element node spacing. A probabilistic pore size distribution model is used to estimate the radius of the largest pore {{as a function of the}} local pore volume fraction. It is found that, with the adaptive subgrid model and the addition of a uniform background microporosity field with a maximum pore radius of 100 lm, the measured and predicted fatigue lives for nearly all 25 test specimens fall within one decade. Because the fatigue lives of the specimens vary by more than four orders of magnitude for the same <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude</b> and for similar average porosity fractions, the results demonstrate the importance of taking into account in the simulations the distribution of the porosity in the specimens...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Strain {{amplitude}} control {{is most often}} employed when carrying out fatigue testing of rubber components. Often the design engineer requires fatigue test data {{that is based on}} load {{amplitude control}}. This is analogous to engineering or <b>nominal</b> stress <b>amplitude</b> control. This usually makes it easy to maintain the load within the specified test limits during extended testing. Values of true stress and strain can be obtained from this approach, but the magnitudes of the maximum true stresses in these tests increase with accumulated cycles, whereas the equivalent maximum engineering stress values remain constant. This is easily demonstrated in the uniaxial case; however the nature of the applied load in equi-biaxial testing adds complexity. The effect in the equi-biaxial case is amplified as the principal stretch ratios have a more pronounced influence on both true stress and strain than in the uniaxial case. Engineering stress-strain data is particularly useful when representing the fatigue behaviour of elastic materials; however it does not represent reality in the case of rubber samples subjected to repeated high strains. True stress control testing can provide data to verify viscoelastic models used to describe elastomeric behaviour under bi-axial fatigue conditions. A test programme has been devised to examine the effect on fatigue life and stress strain relationships of a material tested under conditions of maximum biaxial true stress. This paper compares the difference in fatigue test predictions when using engineering stress and true stress amplitudes as the control parameters. The Experiments are in the form of equi-biaxial bubble inflation fatigue tests employing the DYNAMET system as described in previous CER publications...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} thin-walled and preflawed aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes. Flaws were machined as external axial surface notches. The tubes were 1) statically loaded with oil, 2) statically loaded with nitrogen, and 3) dynamically loaded with gaseous detonations traveling at 2. 4 km/s. The {{experiments were}} controlled so that comparisons could be made on sets of specimens with the same material, tube and flaw geometry, <b>nominal</b> loading <b>amplitude,</b> and flange supports, with the only difference being {{the dynamics of the}} loading. It was found that there is a significant difference in crack propagation behavior for the three types of loading. In this paper, fracture behavior will be discussed along with the fluid dynamics involved. The tubes were also instrumented with pressure transducers, crack detection gages, and strain gages so that data on loading, crack propagating speeds, and strain history can be compared.

Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of elastically supported cylinders in cross-flow is studied experimentally for cylinder mass ratios (average cylinder density / fluid density), [ [...] . ]. For small mass ratios below 10, a new VIV mode is discovered {{which does not}} involve a lock-in behavior. The oscillation and the shedding frequencies coalesce and deviate slightly from the nominal Strouhal frequency of St= 0. 2 to smaller values with increasing free stream velocity U. With increasing mass ratio above 10 (m*> 10), the frequency growth with free stream velocity U appears to approach the lock-in limit while the amplitude and the frequency range of oscillations diminish. Additionally, a novel technique is employed to deduce the unsteady lift coefficient on the body using VIV time traces of the cylinder displacement and their numerical derivatives. An analytical study of the dynamical equation shows that the oscillation amplitude (A/D) is inversely proportional to effective stiffness, [ [...] . ], where U represents the non-dimensional flow speed and [ [...] . ], {{the ratio of the}} oscillation to natural frequencies. It is hence maintained that at high mass ratio cases studied previously (m*> 100), lock-in behavior ([ [...] . ] for U ~ 1) is a prerequisite for <b>nominal</b> vibration <b>amplitudes.</b> At low values of mass ratio, however, [ [...] . ] is minimized naturally without a need for lock-in. Through a detailed study {{of a large number of}} cases with low to medium mass ratios in different experimental settings, it is additionally argued that lock-in is a sporadic phenomenon that appears at various mass ratios. The few occurrences of lock-in at low mass ratios with nominal damping and the unexpected absence of any oscillations at medium mass ratios (m*~ 30), except for a few cases exhibiting lock-in tendencies indicate that lock-in is not as common as classically believed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo quantitatively {{estimate}} {{rolling contact}} fatigue strength as a crack problem, rolling contact fatigue tests {{were performed on}} JIS-SUJ 2 bearing steel using specimen plates into which small holes of various diameters and depths had been drilled. In all the tests, fatigue cracks initiated at the edge {{near the bottom of}} the hole, and then propagated by the shear-mode. Even in the specimens that did not fail after being tested up to N = 2 × 108 cycles, short fatigue cracks were found at the edge. The fatigue life Nf plotted against the maximum contact pressure qmax varied greatly on the basis of the diameter and depth of the hole. The effect of the depth of crack initiation on Nf was uniquely characterized by using the <b>nominal</b> shear stress <b>amplitude</b> τa, instead of qmax Further, by considering the rolling contact fatigue strength as a small shear-mode crack problem, the fatigue life data was plotted using the novel parameter, τa/(√area) − 1 / 6, where the area is a projected area of the hole. Consequently, all the fatigue life data was successfully fitted to a unified line irrespective of the diameter and depth of the hole, i. e., a defect size dependence on the rolling contact fatigue strength was manifested in a small crack regime...|$|R
40|$|Hitherto only a {{small amount}} of fatigue data for laser welded steel plates are available. For that reason the fatigue {{behaviour}} of several basic types of laser weldments was determined under constant amplitude axial loading. The specimens were machined of the steel St 14 with a thickness of 0. 8 mm and 2. 0 mm. Also test series on specimens with a zinc layer on the surface were foreseen (material thickness 0. 9 mm). The results of the examinations were interpreted in terms of <b>nominal</b> tensile stress <b>amplitudes</b> as well as structural equivalent stress amplitudes to give the design engineer a reliable database for construction. Additionally, component-like hollow sections with wall thicknesses of 0. 8 mm and 2. 0 mm were examined under constant and variable amplitude torsion loading. The application of the laser technique led to a clear improvement of the fatigue strength under constant amplitude loading when compared to butt welded specimens of the same size. The positive results of the laser technology were also visible in the case of variable amplitude loading: the laser welded specimens with a wall thickness of 0. 8 mm rather failed by buckling during the higher amplitudes than by cracking in the weldment...|$|R
