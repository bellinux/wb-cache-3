5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or <b>not.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

500|$|LeGrow {{comments}} that the series [...] "is about life, death and fabulous outfits (<b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> order)" [...] and notes {{that there are}} [...] "a lot of religious themes" [...] present. The town of Bizenghast [...] "represents a world cut off from that sort of constant access [...]" [...] The series was initially written to span about fourteen volumes and be divided into three seasons: the first seven volumes would make up the first story arc; the second season, volumes eight through eleven, would center on the mausoleum's relationship with the other guilds; and season three would focus on the afterlife and consist {{of the last three}} volumes. LeGrow also considered writing a spin-off based on Bizenghast with a guest artist, after she finished the first story arc of Bizenghast. The spin-off would contain chapters not present in the original series, and after her other series was completed, she would continue Bizenghast. LeGrow concluded Bizenghast at eight volumes.|$|E

500|$|In early 2015, Nintendo {{launched}} its Creator Program, {{in order to}} share revenue with YouTube video creators who feature gameplay of their products in videos. PewDiePie joined various gamers in criticising the programme. PewDiePie called the program a [...] "slap {{in the face to}} the YouTube channels that [...] focus on Nintendo game exclusively", adding, [...] "The people who have helped and showed passion for Nintendo's community are the ones left in the dirt the most." [...] Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike, Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected, causing an extension on the 72-hour wait time for video approval through the program. Additionally, PewDiePie, stated, [...] "I'll still play Nintendo games that I want to play on my channel as usual. I'm lucky to be in a situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won't matter. However, many people on YouTube are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation." [...] Ultimately, the focal point of criticism is toward the approval of a video which Nintendo has to administer, and may be motivated by biased intentions.|$|E
500|$|Stevie's {{relationship}} with Olly is complicated and he treats her badly, but she ignores his flaws and holds onto any nice thing he does, however small. When he ends their relationship, Stevie is heartbroken, alone and lost, {{and does not}} fit in. She invites Asher to stay and is surprised when he brings Sol and Naz as well, but because Stevie loves to make new friends, she reacts in a way most people would <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation. She builds relationships with them and they grow to love her eventually. Fairbank-Hynes commented: [...] "Sol, Naz and Asher inform her about {{the real world and}} help her harden up just enough to survive in Albert Square!" [...] Stevie starts to see her new friends as the family she always wanted, but it proves to be difficult as they all have family issues of their own. Stevie wants to look after her new friends, which confuses them. The actress described the four friends as an unlikely gang, and said her favourite scenes were when Stevie and Sol caused a blackout across Albert Square, as the two characters did not have much interaction before then. Thompson described Stevie as a [...] "fish out of water", and Hussen said Stevie starts off being unappreciated, but eventually her friends see that she is important to them.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} largely {{based upon the}} 1985 film Spies Like Us, which starred Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and the movie is {{mentioned}} in the episode itself. The episode was also based on the 1977 spy film Telefon about brainwashed Russian spies in the U.S. who can be activated by a special code phrase. When Peter {{has to go to}} the bathroom, he runs to Cleveland's empty home, which has been put up for sale since he left to live in Virginia with his new family. A montage of Peter going to the bathroom is shown, while Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Let's Get Loud" [...] plays. When Peter becomes aware that Cleveland's house is being rented by actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, he mentions that he is honored to have dinner with [...] "two of the three Ghostbusters." [...] Chase then replies that he was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> movie; Peter also notes that he is honored to meet [...] "two of the Three Amigos," [...] a movie starring Chase but not Aykroyd. After dinner, Stewie is seen drawing and coloring Sebastian the crab, a character from the Disney film The Little Mermaid. When Aykroyd and Chase ask Stewie and Brian {{if they want to be}} [...] "spies like us", Stewie asks if they can be [...] "spies like them" [...] and points to Black Spy and White Spy from Spy vs. Spy, one of the head comic strip features of MAD magazine. When Aykroyd and Chase explain to Stewie and Brian how they were recruited as official spies by Reagan, a cutaway is shown of an event in which 1985 is awarded the [...] "Awesomest Year of the 80's" [...] prize and all characters spontaneously start dancing to the 1983 song [...] "(Keep Feeling) Fascination." [...] Later, Brian and Stewie agree to become agents, and Stewie asks if [...] "Ron Howard's weird-looking brother is here." [...] There is a cutaway to The Brady Bunch, in which it is revealed Mike Brady killed his first wife, and housekeeper Alice walks in and demands a raise.|$|E
