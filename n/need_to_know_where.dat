[...] She had, in her {{compressed}} state, another pause, and {{it made her feel}} as if she were immensely resisting. Strange enough was this sense for her, and altogether new, the sense of possessing, by miraculous help, some advantage that, absolutely then and there, in the carriage, as they rolled, she might either give up or keep. Strange, inexpressibly strange--so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever. And what her husband's grasp really meant, as her very bones registered, was that she SHOULD give it up: it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic. He KNEW HOW to resort to it--he could be, on occasion, as she had lately more than ever learned, so munificent a lover: all of which was, precisely, a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely, a part of his large and beautiful ease, his genius for charm, for intercourse, for expression, for life. She should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didn't resist. To this, as they went, every throb of her consciousness prompted her--every throb, that is, but one, the throb of her deeper <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> she [...] "really" [...] was. By the time she had uttered the rest of her idea, therefore, she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it; though she was also staring out of the carriage-window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen, indistinguishable, perhaps, happily, in the dusk. She was making an effort that horribly hurt her, and, as she couldn't cry out, her eyes swam in her silence. With them, all the same, through the square opening beside her, through the grey panorama of the London night, she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted; and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay. [...] "It's not to leave YOU, my dear--for that he'll give up anything; just as he would go off anywhere, I think, you know, if you would go with him.

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{connectivity}} information in the XYZ file format is implied rather than explicit. According to the man page for XYZ (part of XMol), Note that the XYZ format doesn't contain connectivity information. This intentional omission allows for greater flexibility: to create an XYZ file, you don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> a molecule's bonds are; you just <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> its atoms are. Connectivity information is generated automatically for XYZ files as they are read into XMol-related applications. Briefly, if the distance between two atoms is less than the sum of their covalent radii, they are considered bonded.|$|E

In a distributed environment, the DBMS <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> each node is located. The main role of data localization layer is to localize the query’s data using data distribution information.

40|$|Grasping {{an object}} is usually only an {{intermediate}} goal for a robotic manipulator. To finish the task, the robot <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> {{the object is}} in its hand and what action to execute. This paper presents a general statistical framework to address these problems. Given a novel object, the robot learns a statistical model of grasp state conditioned on sensor values. The robot also builds a statistical model of {{the requirements of the}} task in terms of grasp state accuracy. Both of these models are constructed by offline experiments. The online process then grasps objects and chooses actions to maximize likelihood of success. This paper describes the framework in detail, and demonstrates its effectiveness experimentally in placing, dropping, and insertion tasks. To construct statistical models, the robot performed over 8000 grasp trials, and over 1000 trials each of placing, dropping and insertion...|$|R

5000|$|Mater's {{color was}} {{originally}} baby blue {{as shown in}} a flashback {{when he was a}} young child; however, over the years he has rusted into a patchwork light brown/orange color with some of the blue still showing through. He is missing his hood and his left headlight. In the short Mater and the Ghostlight, his right headlight fell out as well. During the first Cars movie credits Mater fished his hood from a cliff up in Tailfin Pass, and his hood showed more of its original color than the rest of Mater. But then Mater sneezed, causing the hood to fall back down the cliff. His license plate number is A113.Mater is also capable of racing, as well as being the (self-proclaimed) world's best backwards driver. He attributes his skill to his rear-view mirrors and his own philosophy: [...] "Don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> I'm going, just <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> I've been." [...] He teaches Lightning this skill and is proud when he uses it in the Piston Cup race, proudly telling Chick's stunned pit crew [...] "I taught him that!" [...] This was further noted in Cars 2, when Mater drives backwards away from McQueen (so that he can get the bomb that was strapped in his air filter away from McQueen's reach), he was able to avoid himself from crashing, an act that left Darrell Cartrip saying, [...] "He's gotta be the world's best backwards driver".|$|E

Our algorithm can be divided into three distinct parts. First, the robot has to take the final positions of the objects and compute the correct order to move them. Next, given the order, we plan the path from initial and final locations for each object. Lastly, we take the paths and move the robot’s arms accordingly. For the experiments, we us...|$|R
