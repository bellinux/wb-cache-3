40|$|Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) {{is often}} used to {{calculate}} nucleation rates, but CNT has assumptions which break down for a nano-sized bubble: it assumes planar sharp interfaces and bulk phases inside bubbles. Therefore, since the size of a <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubble</b> is comparable {{to the size of the}} polymer molecule, we assumed that a bubble surface is a curved surface, and we ivestigated effects of curvature on the nucleation barrier. SCFT results show that sharper curvatures of smaller s cause a higher polymer configurational entropy and lower internal energy, and also the collapse of the bulk phase for smaller bubbles causes low internal energy. Consequently, the homogenous bubble nucleation barrier for curved surfaces is much smaller than flat surface (CNT prediction).|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the Majorana fermion has been {{postulated}} more than eighty years ago; however, this elusive particle has never been observed in nature. The non-local character of the Majorana fermion can be useful for topological quantum computation. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that the 3 He-B phase is a time-reversal invariant topological superfluid, with a single component of gapless Majorana fermion state localized on the surface. Such a Majorana surface state contains half the degrees of freedom of the single Dirac surface state recently observed in topological insulators. We show here that the Majorana surface state can be detected through an electron spin relaxation experiment. The Majorana nature of the surface state can be revealed though the striking angular dependence of the relaxation time on the magnetic field direction, 1 /T_ 1 ∝ sin^ 2 θ where θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the surface normal. The temperature dependence of the spin relaxation rate can reveal the gapless linear dispersion of the Majorana surface state. We propose a spin relaxation experiment setup where we inject an electron inside a <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubble</b> below the helium liquid surface.

40|$|The {{deuterium}} (D) bubbles {{formed in}} W exposed to high flux D plasma were researched by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy. After D plasma exposure at 500 [*]K and 1000 [*]K, a layer of <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubbles</b> were homogenously distributed in W subsurface region. The D bubbles were homogenously nucleated due to the high D concentration, and the nucleation process {{is not related to}} the vacancy defects. At low temperature (500 [*]K), D bubbles can grow by surface blistering, which caused different nano scale morphologies on different surfaces. At high temperature (1000 [*]K), D bubbles mainly grow by vacancy clustering, which caused pinholes on the surface...|$|R

For this purpose the initial pure Cu ribbons were internally carbonised to obtain very fine, some 100 nm-sized graphite particles homogeneously distributed in the Cu matrix. By the internal oxidation process the reaction of dissolved oxygen with graphite yields the gas products (CO, CO 2) which cannot be dissolved in the crystal lattice of the metal. The gas products are meshed in the space previously occupied by graphite {{and they have a}} greater specific volume than the solid graphite, thus establishing the compressive stresses in the metalic matrix and consequently causing the strengthening offect. On the other hand, such stress fields can react with sliding dislocation, whereby they impede the dislocation motion and consequently we would expect that the composite mechanical properties would be improved.

40|$|In this study, stable <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubbles</b> (nanobubbles [NBs]) were {{produced}} using the mechanical agitation method {{in the presence}} of perfluorocarbon gases. NBs made with perfluoropropane had a smaller size (around 400 [*]nm) compared to that of those made with perfluorobutane or nitrogen gas. The lipid concentration in NBs affected both their initial size and post-formulation stability. NBs formed with a final lipid concentration of 0. 5 [*]mg/ml tended to be more stable, having a uniform size distribution for 24 [*]h at room temperature and 50 [*]h at 4 [*]°C. In vitro gene expression revealed that NBs/pDNA in combination with ultrasound (US) irradiation had significantly higher transfection efficacy in colon C 26 cells. Moreover, for in vivo gene transfection in mice left limb muscles, there was notable local transfection activity by NBs/pDNA when combined with US irradiation. In addition, the aged NBs kept at room temperature or 4 [*]°C were still functional at enhancing gene transfection in mice. We succeeded in preparing stable NBs for efficient in vivo gene transfection, using the mechanical agitation method...|$|R
40|$|My summer {{research}} {{focused on}} the two-dimensional fluid dynamics problem of a single air bubble traveling through a viscous fluid between two parallel plates, separated by a uniform spacing, namely a Hele-Shaw cell. Several factors affect {{the behavior of the}} rising bubble: the gap size, the fluid, the angle of elevation, and the surface properties of the plates. Recent development in microfluidic devices ask questions regarding how micro and <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubbles</b> travel through a Hele-Shaw cell. Thus, we extend our work from previous summers to smaller sized bubbles. One of the challenging questions is how the surface properties of the plates affect the traveling bubbles. A new apparatus was designed and created to deal with the smaller sized bubbles. In order to define the surface properties of the plates, we first found the contact angle that clean water droplets made on different plates. We then measured the velocities of varying sized bubbles at varying angles of elevation. Graphs of velocity versus the sin of the angle were used for analysis. We confirmed that air bubble velocities increase as the angle of elevation increases. We found the lower the viscosity of a fluid, the higher the velocity of the air bubble. Finally, when using a more hydrophobic surface compared to glass, such as plexi-glass, air bubble velocities decrease considerably in clean water ? to the point of not rising...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSi (001) -oriented {{substrates}} (p-type) {{were implanted}} at 10 keV with He ion doses in the 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 2) range. They were annealed at 973 K for 1 h {{to create a}} buried layer of <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Layers of Si 0. 37 Ge 0. 23 about 215 nm thick were grown by low pressure chemical vapor deposition at 848 K on these silicon wafers. The surface roughness and morphology were checked by atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy before and after etching with a modified Shimmel recipe to reveal etch pit dislocations. The thickness, composition, crystalline quality and relaxation-state of the SiGe layer were assessed by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. A fully relaxed strain-state was obtained for Si 0. 77 Ge 0. 23 layers that did not exhibit the classical cross-hatched pattern morphology while having a threading-dislocations density below 10 (3) cm(- 2). This low dislocation density was confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy. From high resolution transmission electron microscopy observations, the quasi-total strain-relief is assumed to take place by emission of dislocation loops protruding down into the Si substrate from the SiGe/Si interface and terminating at void surfaces of the buried-nanoporous layer. Possible annihilation of dislocation segments coming from either the SiGe/Si interface or punched out in glide planes by overpressurized nanobubbles may also occur. This near surface porous Si is well adapted for multiple junction solar cell manufacturing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{building}} insulation {{is an important}} part of today´s efforts on energy saving. Here, nano-insulation materials promise especially low thermal conductivity. Therefore, an easy and cost-efficient production of these materials is an aim of present material research. One approach towards these materials is the expansion and fixation of polymerisable microemulsions of supercritical blowing agents. However, the <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubbles</b> are found to undergo undesired coarsening processes. In order to reduce the increasing interfacial tension emerging during expansion and therewith the coarsening it was suggested to add low-molecular hydrophobic substances to the supercritical microemulsion. And indeed, the addition of cyclohexane to a microemulsion of the type brine – CO 2 – fluorinated surfactants was found to reduce the fluorinated surfactant content – a measure for the interfacial tension - considerably. In this work a systematic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) contrast variation was performed and the data were analysed by model-independent Fourier analysis. It was found that a concentration gradient of cyclohexane inside the CO 2 /cyclohexane microemulsion droplets forms. Interestingly, the analysis reveals a depletion zone close to the amphiphilic film which presumably develops due to the known repulsive interactions of cyclohexane and the fluorinated surfactant tails. Using a specially designed high pressure SANS cell to perform stroboscopic pressure jumps, the influence of cyclohexane on pressure-induced elongation of microemulsion droplets as well as the early state of foaming after expansion was studied. Here, the pressure-dependent thermodynamic stability of such microemulsions allows for a fast repeatability of the pressure cycles. It turned out that cyclohexane systematically slows down the structural changes in all processes. Parallel pressure jump experiments with poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) particles revealed that hydration and dehydration kinetics can be studied with the same experimental setup. The first kinetic experiments which combine a CO 2 -microemulsion mixed with PNIPAM particles indicate that PNIPAM acts as a stabiliser for the microemulsion and further reduces the thermodynamic driving force of the demixing process...|$|R
40|$|Superhydrophobic {{titanium}} surfaces fabricated by {{femtosecond laser}} ablation {{to mimic the}} structure of lotus leaves were assessed {{for their ability to}} retain coccoid bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus CIP 65. 8 T, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 14990 T and Planococcus maritimus KMM 3738 were retained by the surface, to varying degrees. However, each strain was found to preferentially attach to the crevices located between the microscale surface features. The upper regions of the microscale features remained essentially cell-free. It was hypothesised that air entrapped by the topographical features inhibited contact between the cells and the titanium substratum. Synchrotron SAXS revealed that even after immersion for 50 min, <b>nano-sized</b> air <b>bubbles</b> covered 45 % of the titanium surface. After 1 h the number of cells of S. aureus CIP 65. 8 T attached to the lotus-like titanium increased to 1. 27 × 105 mm- 2, coinciding with the replacement of trapped air by the incubation medium...|$|R
30|$|Several factors {{should be}} {{considered}} when designing imaging probes for aHSCs. First, the liver {{is regarded as the}} second most complex organ. Other cell types of the liver, such as Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, may nonspecifically uptake the probes. High molecular weight proteins, like serum albumin, are mainly metabolized by the liver. Although serum albumin-based carriers (M 6 P 21 -BSA, pCVI-HSA, pPB-HSA) preferentially targeted HSCs in fibrotic livers, they were uptaken by endothelial cells [75, 97] or hepatocytes [105] in normal livers. Therefore, the accumulation level of these carriers in both fibrotic and normal livers was similar [75, 97, 105]. This characteristic makes these carriers suitable for HSC-targeted drug delivery rather than imaging. Low molecular weight ligands (such as peptides, aptamers), which are cleared mainly through the kidneys, will be more appropriate for this kind of imaging. Besides, the addition of PEG to probes could decrease the nonspecific uptake by Kupffer cells [46]. Second, novel MR techniques including MR elastography [5 – 7], MR DWI [10 – 12], T 1 ρ MR imaging [13 – 15], and MR PWI [16, 17] have emerged for detecting liver fibrosis. A combination of these techniques with aHSC-targeted MR imaging could provide abundant disease information on anatomical, functional, and molecular levels. Nuclear imaging techniques, including SPECT and positron emission tomography (PET), are often used for tumor imaging [114]. They not only have high sensitivity but also cause radio damage. Therefore, the pros and cons should be weighed before applying these techniques to liver fibrosis diagnosis. Third, ultrasound imaging has the advantages of high soft tissue contrast, low cost, and no radiation. Various kinds of bubbles have been developed as ultrasound contrast agents [115]. Among them, <b>nano-sized</b> <b>bubbles,</b> which can extravasate from blood vessels, are more suitable for imaging of extravascular cells. Thus, aHSC-targeted ultrasound imaging could potentially be accomplished through conjugating specific ligands to nanobubbles. Four, recent studies imply the bidirectional crosstalk between aHSCs and tumor cells [116, 117]. Tumor-derived factors activate HSCs, and in turn, aHSCs promote phenotypic changes, proliferation, and invasion of tumor cells. Therefore, aHSC-targeted imaging in liver cancers could help better understand the pathophysiology of the tumor microenvironment and further instruct therapy.|$|R
40|$|The loss {{of optical}} {{transparency}} when polymer films are immersed in water, {{which is called}} “water whitening,” severely limits their use as clear barrier coatings. It is found that this problem is particularly acute in films deposited from polymers synthesized via emulsion polymerization using surfactants. Water whitening is less severe in secondary dispersion polymers, which are made by dispersing solution polymers in water {{without the use of}} surfactants. NMR relaxometry in combination with optical transmission analysis and electron microscopy reveal that some of the water sorbed in emulsion polymer films is contained within <b>nano-sized</b> “pockets” or <b>bubbles</b> that scatter light. In contrast, the water in secondary dispersion polymer films is mainly confined at particle interfaces, where it scatters light less strongly and its molecular mobility is reduced. The addition of surfactant to a secondary dispersion creates a periodic structure that displays a stop band in the optical transmission. The total amount of sorbed water is not a good indicator of polymers prone to water whitening. Instead, the particular locations of the water within the film must be considered. Both the amount of water {{and the size of the}} local water regions (as are probed by NMR relaxometry) are found to determine water whitening...|$|R
