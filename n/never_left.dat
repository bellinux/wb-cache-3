5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and <b>never</b> <b>left</b> the area to run out on the field or made very much noise.|$|E
5|$|Four {{of the men}} deserted {{when they}} reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for twomonths. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight {{surviving}} members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having <b>never</b> <b>left</b> East Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Adams {{retired from}} the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was {{approaching}} his sixtieth birthday and suffered from tremors that made writing difficult. But he also wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth. He returned to Boston in 1781, and <b>never</b> <b>left</b> Massachusetts again.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus {{stayed with}} Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), {{when he left}} the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the {{kindness}} of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus <b>never</b> <b>left</b> Sweden again.|$|E
5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had <b>never</b> <b>left</b> the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Sparrow {{returns in}} the fifth film, portrayed once again by Johnny Depp. Five years after {{the quest for the}} Fountain of Youth, Jack has {{reassembled}} a small crew, but the Black Pearl is still trapped in a bottle, his new ship the Dying Gull has <b>never</b> <b>left</b> berth, and his latest plans have met with failure, while his rival, Barbossa, has became the richest and most powerful pirate of the seven seas.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1926, <b>Nevers</b> <b>left</b> the Browns to play {{professional}} football for the Duluth Eskimos of the National Football League (NFL). [...] Nevers' childhood friend Ole Haugsrud owned the Eskimos. The 1926 Eskimos, with a 16-man roster, played a 29-game schedule and compiled a 19-7-3 record. Nevers reportedly played 1,714 minutes {{out of a}} possible 1,740 minutes that year. Highlights of Nevers' 1926 season included the following: ...|$|R

5|$|The jury <b>never</b> <b>left</b> the box, {{but instead}} conferred {{together}} and found Thornton not guilty in six minutes. They were then resworn on the rape allegation. The prosecution informed {{the court that}} it had no evidence to offer on that count, and Mr Justice Holroyd directed the jury to find the prisoner not guilty of rape, which they did. Thornton was set free.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse <b>never</b> <b>left</b> America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{travels to}} Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), {{a member of}} Quantum who seduces women with {{valuable}} connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau (Stana Katic), a Canadian Intelligence agent, of his true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene {{was found dead in}} the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he <b>never</b> <b>left.</b> Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.|$|E

5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride that he <b>never</b> <b>left</b> any book {{in his hands}} unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|In the unbroadcast pilot We Are Mongrels, another {{character}} was included called Debbie. Debbie was a suicidal chicken who <b>never</b> <b>left</b> her coop. However, {{it was decided}} that the character did not go anywhere and could not be sustained for a full series, so the {{character was}} axed. Another chicken character called Wendy appeared in the first broadcast episode as a reference to Debbie. Both characters had the same voice actress, Ruth Bratt, who performed Wendy's voice in exactly the same manner as that of Debbie.|$|E
5|$|Reagan <b>never</b> <b>left</b> the United States {{during the}} war, {{but he kept}} a film reel that he {{obtained}} {{while he was in}} the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E

5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships <b>never</b> <b>left</b> Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had <b>never</b> <b>left</b> Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had <b>never</b> <b>left</b> Europe at all. When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was {{probably}} an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he <b>never</b> <b>left</b> his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued {{in the service of the}} next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely that he ever received much schooling.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the success of}} the legislation, most of the 333,456 large cents struck in 1857 <b>never</b> <b>left</b> the Philadelphia Mint, and were later melted. Snowden purchased a new set of rollers and other equipment so that the Mint could produce its own cent planchets, the first time it had done so in over 50 years. Although the legislation was still a day from final passage, Snowden recommended Longacre's designs to Guthrie on February 20. Guthrie approved them on the 24th, though he requested that the edge of the coin be made less sharp; Snowden promised to comply. Flying Eagle cents were struck beginning in April 1857 and were held pending official release. The Mint stored the pieces pending accumulation of a sufficient supply; in mid-May, Snowden notified Philadelphia newspapers that distribution would begin on May 25.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the central British state began to reacquire {{control of the}} sites. Caernarfon had <b>never</b> <b>left</b> the direct control of the Crown, but Harlech was {{transferred}} to the control of the Office of Works in 1914, Beaumaris followed in 1925 and Conwy was finally leased to the Ministry of Works in 1953. The state invested heavily in conservation of the sites. The 1920s saw large-scale conservation programmes at both Beaumaris and Harlech, stripping back the vegetation, digging out the moat and repairing the stonework, but otherwise leaving the sites intact and avoiding outright restoration. Major work was undertaken at Conwy in the 1950s and 1960s, including the clearing away of newer buildings encroaching on the 13th-century walls.|$|E
