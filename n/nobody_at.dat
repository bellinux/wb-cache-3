5|$|On the 60th {{anniversary of}} the sinking, 60 Minutes ran a story demonstrating that the wreck was not Centaur. It was {{revealed}} that <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the Queensland Maritime Museum had yet seen Dennis' footage, {{and when it was}} shown to Museum president Rod McLeod and maritime historian John Foley, they stated that the shipwreck could not be Centaur due to physical inconsistencies, such as an incorrect rudder. Following this story, and others published around the same time in newspapers, the Navy sent three ships to inspect the site over a two-month period; HMA Ships , , and , before concluding that the shipwreck was incorrectly identified as Centaur. An amendment was made to the gazettal, and the Hydrographic Office began to remove the mark from charts.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the new locomotives, given serial number 807 by Aveling and Porter and {{numbered}} 1 by the Tramway, was delivered to Wotton station on 27January1872. On the day of its delivery, the now-redundant horses had been sent away. <b>Nobody</b> <b>at</b> Wotton could operate the locomotive so a horse had to be hired from Aylesbury until the driver arrived. After the delivery of the second locomotive on 7 September 1872, all passenger services were drawn by locomotive except on Thursdays, when locomotives were replaced by horses to allow for maintenance. The line carried 104 passengers in January 1872, rising to 224 in April, and 456 in August 1872.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1772, English {{scientist}} Joseph Priestley {{discovered the}} gas nitrous oxide. Initially, people thought this gas to be lethal, even in small doses, like some other nitrogen oxides. However, in 1799, British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy {{decided to find}} out by experimenting on himself. To his astonishment he found that nitrous oxide made him laugh, so he nicknamed it laughing gas. Davy wrote about the potential anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide, but <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> that time pursued the matter any further.|$|E

25|$|Imo was {{repaired}} {{after the}} explosion and returned to service. Renamed Guvernøren ("The Governor") in 1920, she served as a whale oil tanker until 30 November 1921, when {{the man at the}} helm fell down drunk after celebratory drinking, leaving <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the wheel. The ship ran aground on rocks at Cow Bay two miles off Cape Carysfort approximately 20 miles from Port Stanley on East Falkland. No crew were lost.

25|$|That Warwickshire's Championship win in 1911 {{was not a}} {{reflection}} of their ability but of the abnormal weather was doubted by <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the time, and 1912 – a summer as abnormally wet as 1911 was dry – saw his county fall back to mid-table after winning their first four games. Faults in his batting technique were clearly revealed on slow and treacherous pitches: his average fell from 44 to 19, but Foster again did very well in bowling – taking 5 for 16 in one Test against South Africa, 11 for 87 against Middlesex and 12 wickets against Leicestershire.|$|E

25|$|A new {{investigation}} in the early 1980s, by a team under Dr. Thomas Cahill at the University of California, Davis, using Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) found that only trace amounts (<nbsp&0.0062% by weight) of titanium appeared {{to be present in}} the ink, which should have been too little for some of McCrone's analyses to detect. The Cahill team acknowledged, however, that titanium was the only element within their technique's measurement capability which was significantly more concentrated in the ink than on the bare parchment (other elements such as iron and zinc were found concentrated in some inked samples, but only a minority). One member of the team, Gregory Möller, also analyzed loose particles retrieved from the split {{down the middle of the}} map by a different method, finding that most of them were rich in titanium (though a few black particles were rich in chromium and iron). Because they were the first to apply PIXE to ink analysis, <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the time could explain the difference between the Cahill and McCrone figures. Attempting to reconcile the conflicting results, the Cahill team suggested that the high concentrations found by McCrone were due to a combination of contamination from modern dust, and poor sample selection (i.e. choosing contaminant particles like those in the split); however, they also chose not to publish or publicise Möller's loose particle study. The accumulation of large amounts of PIXE data from other laboratories around the world in the ensuing decades was sufficient by 2008 to show that the Cahill figures for all elements in the inks of the map and its companion documents are at least a thousand times too small, so the discrepancy is due to a problem with their work.|$|E
500|$|As a {{teenager}} in Lincoln, Nebraska, Sweet was {{a big fan of}} Mitch Easter. Easter produced R.E.M.'s first single, the Hib-Tone version of [...] "Radio Free Europe". Sweet loved its B-side, [...] "Sitting Still", and became a fan of the band. When R.E.M. performed in Lincoln in September 1982, Sweet went to the show. At that point R.E.M. were still relatively unknown, so there was almost <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the concert. Sweet met the band and gave Michael Stipe a tape of songs he had been working on. R.E.M. was from Athens, Georgia, which was becoming famous for its vibrant music scene. Sweet had also read about Athens in New York Rocker magazine.|$|E
500|$|Kenney left day-to-day {{operations}} at SAC {{in the hands}} of his deputy commander, Major General St. Clair Streett. Part of the reason for Kenney's lack of focus on SAC was also his assignment as U.S. representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, which appeared at that time to be potentially an important assignment. In January 1947, Streett was replaced by Major General Clements McMullen. With McMullen serving officially as Kenney's deputy but actually in command, a cross-training program was implemented in early 1948 to teach bomber crew members each other's tasks, the goal being to reduce each bomber's contingent of officers from five to three. Morale suffered as a result. Major General Lauris Norstad, responsible for reporting the readiness of American airpower to the U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, heard from unhappy airmen that the SAC was in a poor state of readiness, and he initiated an investigation. He selected Charles Lindbergh and Paul Tibbets to perform the inquiry. Tibbets told Norstad that he found <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> SAC knew their job. Lindbergh said that McMullen's cross-training program [...] "seriously interfered with training the primary mission." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{movie is a}} mess: a gassy costume epic with <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the center." [...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why does she have to die at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
500|$|From a cricketing viewpoint, most critics {{agreed that}} D'Oliveira should {{probably}} have been selected based on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the usefulness of his bowling. The selectors left him out, however, deciding that his bowling was {{not strong enough to}} classify him as an all-rounder. Oborne points out that, judged in cricketing terms, this was [...] "not an outrage". D'Oliveira had several rivals as a batsman, and of the places available, one went to Ken Barrington, who had a good Test record, and the other to Keith Fletcher, who was much younger than D'Oliveira. Oborne judges both of these decisions fair. <b>Nobody</b> <b>at</b> the selection meeting supported including D'Oliveira. Some of those present said later that, despite his prior assurances to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey opposed his selection at the meeting, which influenced others there. Fraser-Sampson suggests that Cowdrey, who later tried to justify his role in events, may have inwardly supported D'Oliveira's inclusion, but spoken against it out of a lack of confidence and decisiveness. It is also possible, argues Fraser-Sampson, that if May had been aware of the true state of affairs, he may have confided in Cowdrey, a close friend; this would have left Cowdrey, who was very keen to lead a team to South Africa, in a difficult and conflicted position. Fraser-Sampson concludes: [...] "Far from being the villain of the piece, Cowdrey may simply have been an honourable man pushed beyond the limits of his character and overwhelmed by events." ...|$|E

2500|$|Archie Hahn {{became a}} major star, and Fitzpatrick was {{credited}} with inventing his unusual running style.

Even to see Hahn's new stride is not to analyze how he manages to lift his feet so high in front. The new stride suggests that {{he is trying to}} climb a hill.

2500|$|As a cricketer, Smith was {{primarily}} a right arm fast bowler, though {{he was also a}} useful right-hand lower-order batsman and a good slip fielder. He is widely {{regarded as one of the}} best bowlers to play the game. His oddly curved bowling run-up, which started from deep mid-off, earned him the nickname [...] "Round the Corner Smith". When he bowled round the wicket his approach was concealed from the batsman by the umpire until he emerged, leading W. G. Grace to comment [...] "it is rather startling when he suddenly appears at the bowling crease." [...] He played for Cambridge University (1882–85) and for Sussex at various times from 1882 to 1892. While in South Africa he captained the Johannesburg English XI. He captained England to victory in his only Test match, against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in 1888-89, taking five wickets for nineteen runs in the first innings. The English team who played were by no means representative of the best players of the time and <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the time realised that the match would enter the cricket records as an official Test match.|$|E

2500|$|Houdini's {{funeral was}} held on November 4, 1926, in New York City, with more than 2,000 mourners in attendance. He was interred in the Machpelah Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, with {{the crest of the}} Society of American Magicians inscribed on his grave site. A {{statuary}} bust was added to the exedra in 1927, a rarity, because graven images are forbidden in Jewish cemeteries. In 1975, the bust was destroyed by vandals. Temporary busts were placed at the grave until 2011 when a group who came to be called The Houdini Commandos from the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania placed a permanent bust with the permission of Houdini's family and of the cemetery. The Society of American Magicians took responsibility for the upkeep of the site, as Houdini had willed a large sum of money to the organization he had grown from one club to 5,000-6,000 dues-paying membership worldwide. The payment of upkeep was abandoned by the society's dean George Schindler, who said [...] "Houdini paid for perpetual care, but there's <b>nobody</b> <b>at</b> the cemetery to provide it", adding that the operator of the cemetery, David Jacobson, [...] "sends us a bill for upkeep every year but we never pay it because he never provides any care."

2500|$|Some Democratic {{critics of}} Bush {{suggested}} that the memos were produced by the Bush campaign to discredit the media's reporting on Bush's National Guard service.

At a community forum in Utica, New York in 2005, U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove's objectives: [...] "Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush's draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away." [...] After being criticized, Hinchey responded, [...] "I didn't allege I had any facts.
