2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of surviving mantuas, which are made of the rich brocaded silks popular {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, the Kimberley mantua is a practical winter costume, made of striped woolen fabric embroidered with silver-gilt yarns. The fabric, sometimes described as broadcloth, is actually a [...] "soft, fine, tabby-woven (over one, under one) woolen fabric that has been given a <b>napped</b> <b>surface</b> though not the dense, felted finish characteristic of broadcloth." [...] The background color is something between [...] "brownish" [...] and [...] "warm grey". The stripes, woven parallel to the weft (across the width of the fabric), are [...] "ultramarine" [...] blue [...] "bordered by vibrant terracotta" [...] and [...] "dark mustard yellow" [...] "bordered by a pair of magenta stripes".|$|E

50|$|The gig mill, which {{eventually}} {{became known as}} Thrupp Mill, was leased to Edward Ferrabee in 1793. By 1828 the entire premises were leased to the Ferrabees, and an iron works, the Phoenix Iron Works, had been established. The Ferrabees became well known for their production of cloth-making machines, steam engines, agricultural machinery and water wheels. It was here that John Lewis had invented a machine in 1815 to shear the surplus fibres or <b>nap</b> from the <b>surface</b> of cloth, using a horizontal blade.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the technology of measuring radiance from the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface using multiple-wavelength airborne scanning spectrometers. Concurrently, advances were being made in the application of computer-implemented pattern recognition techniques to these multispectral data. Together these two tools have resulted in a capability for <b>napping</b> various earth <b>surface</b> features with extreme rapidity and varying degrees of accuracy. This study compared computer-implemented mappings based on spectral properties of bare soil surfaces with mapping units of interest to soil surveyors. Some soil types could be differentiated by their spectral properties. In other cases, soils with similar surface colors and textures could not be distinguished spectrally. The spectral maps seemed useful for delineating boundaries between soils in many cases...|$|R
50|$|This {{all changed}} with the {{invention}} of the lawnmower by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830. Budding had the idea for a lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular <b>nap</b> from the <b>surface</b> of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. His mower design was to be used primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and he was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.|$|R
40|$|Low-dimensional {{semiconductors}} {{have attracted}} great interest {{due to the}} potential for tailoring their linear and nonlinear optical properties over a wide-range. Semiconductor nanocrystals (NC's) represent a class of quasi-zero-dimensional objects or quantum dots. Due to quantum cordhement and a large surface-to-volume ratio, the linear and nonlinear optical properties, and the carrier dynamics in NC's are significantly different horn those in bulk materials. <b>napping</b> at <b>surface</b> states {{can lead to a}} fast depopulation of quantized states, accompanied by charge separation and generation of local fields which significantly modifies the nonlinear optical response in NC's. 3 D carrier confinement also has a drastic effect on the energy relaxation dynamics. In strongly confined NC's, the energy-level spacing can greatly exceed typical phonon energies. This has been expected to significantly inhibit phonon-related mechanisms for energy losses, an effect referred to as a phonon bottleneck. It has been suggested recently that the phonon bottleneck in 3 D-confined systems can be removed due to enhanced role of Auger-type interactions. In this paper we report femtosecond (fs) studies of ultrafast optical nonlinearities, and energy relaxation and trap ping dynamics in three types of quantum-dot systems: semiconductor NC/glass composites made by high temperature precipitation, ion-implanted NC's, and colloidal NC'S. Comparison of ultrafast data for different samples allows us to separate effects being intrinsic to quantum dots from those related to lattice imperfections and interface properties...|$|R
50|$|Concealment {{holsters}} {{are designed}} to be easily concealed, as well as lightweight and unobtrusive. They are generally designed for subcompact and compact handguns since they are easier to conceal. Concealment holsters {{are designed to}} be worn under clothing, such as on the belt under a coat, under pants in an ankle holster, or in a trouser pocket. Since the holster is held close to the body, comfort is important, and concealment holsters often have broad surfaces in contact with the user's body, to distribute the pressure across a wider area and prevent abrasion of the skin. Protecting the handgun from the user's perspiration is often an important consideration in such carry locations. Often the outside of the holster is broader, to help break up the outline of the handgun and prevent printing, where the outline of the gun can be seen through clothing. For pocket holsters, the external flat side is often the side with a <b>nap,</b> or rougher <b>surface,</b> to hold the holster in place when drawing the pistol.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhototransformation is {{important}} for the fate in surface waters of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac (DIC) and naproxen (NAP) and for clofibric acid (CLO), a metabolite of the drug clofibrate. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of the prevailing photochemical processes, which these compounds undergo in the different conditions found in freshwater environments. The modelled photochemical half-life times of NAP and DIC range from a few days to some months, depending on water conditions (chemistry and depth) and on the season. The model indicates that direct photolysis is the dominant degradation pathway of DIC and <b>NAP</b> in sunlit <b>surface</b> waters, and potentially toxic cyclic amides were detected as intermediates of DIC direct phototransformation. With modelled half-life times in the month-year range, CLO is predicted to be more photostable than DIC or NAP and to be degraded mainly by reaction with the •OH radical and with the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (3 CDOM*). The CLO intermediates arising from these processes and detected in this study (hydroquinone and 4 -chlorophenol) are, respectively, a chronic toxicant to aquatic organisms and a possible carcinogen for humans. Hydroquinone is formed with only ∼ 5 % yield upon CLO triplet-sensitised transformation, but it is highly toxic for algae and crustaceans. In contrast, the formation yield of 4 -chlorophenol reaches ∼ 50 % upon triplet sensitisation and ∼ 10 % by ·OH reaction. The comparison of model predictions with field data from a previous study yielded a very good agreement in the case of DIC and, when using 4 -carboxybenzophenone as proxy for triplet sensitisation by CDOM, a good agreement was found for CLO as well. In the case of NAP, the comparison with field data suggests that its direct photolysis quantum yield approaches or even falls below the lower range of literature values...|$|R

[...] It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be worked by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. The first machine produced was 19 inches in width with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind with motive power coming from the rear land roller which drove gears to transfer the drive to the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. There was another roller placed in between the cutting cylinder and the land roller which was adjustable to alter the height of cut. On cutting, the grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front of the machine which could be used to help pull it along. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. [...] In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud.|$|R
