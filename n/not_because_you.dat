Therefore, according to the group, you are not that chatty, but you are either doing the proper performance.

2500|$|Blackman {{attended}} a Baptist church during her teenage years, but became {{a follower of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{at the age of}} 18; she also started studying Kabbalah in the 2000s. Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship. [...] "I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or <b>not,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have a focused intent", says Blackman. [...] "You transcend, because you're crossing barriers {{that a lot of people}} and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then you can do something good with it. I don't keep that in mind 100 per cent of the time – I'm human – but I try to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crisler {{was born}} in Earlville, Illinois in 1899. He participated in {{football}} at Mendota High School and was an outstanding student. Articles in the October 7, 1915 and October 19, 1916 Sun Bulletins of Mendota, Illinois, show {{him to be a}} powerful football player who [...] "sent shivers up and down the spinal columns of the opposing team." [...] Crisler enrolled at the University of Chicago on an academic scholarship with plans to become a doctor. Crisler often told the story of his introduction to college football. Crisler recalled that he wandered over the football field as a freshman, where he saw the legendary coach Amos Alonzo Stagg directing a practice session. According to Crisler, Stagg knocked him over on the sideline while {{trying to get out of}} the way of an end sweep play. Stagg reportedly told the diminutive Crisler, [...] "If you're going to play football, why don't you put on a suit?" [...] Crisler worked out with the football team for a few days, but gave it up to return to his studies. When Stagg encountered Crisler a short time later on campus, Stagg said, [...] "I would have never picked you for a quitter." [...] Crisler recalled that he returned to the team in response to Stagg's taunt and noted, [...] "I've been in athletics ever since." [...] Stagg was also responsible for Crisler's nickname. After Crisler fouled up four consecutive plays during a practice session, Stagg told him, [...] "Crisler, from now on you are 'Fritz' after the master violinist. <b>Not</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> resemble him, but because you are so different." ...|$|E
