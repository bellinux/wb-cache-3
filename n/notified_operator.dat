40|$|Abstract—False routing {{announcements}} are {{a serious}} security problem, {{which can lead}} to widespread service disruptions in the Internet. A number of detection systems have been proposed and implemented recently, however, it takes time to detect attacks, <b>notify</b> <b>operators,</b> and stop false announcements. Thus detection systems should be complemented by a mitigation scheme that can protect data delivery before the attack is resolved. We propose such a mitigation scheme, QBGP, which decouples the propagation of a path and the adoption of a path for data forwarding. QBGP does not use suspicious paths to forward data traffic, but still propagates them in the routing system to facilitate attack detection. It can protect data delivery from routing announcements of false sub-prefixes, false origins, false nodes and false links. QBGP incurs overhead only when there are suspicious paths, which happen infrequently in real BGP traces. Results from large scale simulations and BGP trace analysis show that QBGP is light-weight yet effective, and it converges faster and incurs less overhead than Pretty Good BGP. I...|$|R

5000|$|The {{findings}} of the report were disputed {{by many in the}} aviation industry, in particular the emphasis on lead oxybromide deposits formed {{as a result of the}} engines running at high temperatures due to the company's fuel saving policies. The report attributed these deposits as the cause of detonation within the cylinder head which blew a hole in the right engine, although the validity of this finding was disputed outside of the Bureau. Commentators in the United States where the aircraft was manufactured weighed in to the controversy. John Deakin, a highly experienced pilot and writer for US aviation news website AVweb raised further questions. Deakin pointed out that one month after the report was published, engine manufacturer Textron Lycoming <b>notified</b> <b>operators</b> of the same model fitted to flight 904 of a recall to address defective crankshafts, and provided a number of plausible scenarios leading to engine failures which were overlooked by the investigation. With a lack of corroborating evidence other than the ATSB's own research, Deakin labeled the findings as [...] "junk science". Flying magazine editor Richard Collins disagreed however, describing the report as [...] "the most complete accident report on a mechanically related general aviation piston airplane accident" [...] he had ever seen.|$|R

2500|$|Other than recent drinking, {{the most}} common source of mouth alcohol is from belching or burping. This causes the liquids and/or gases from the stomach—including any alcohol—to rise up into the soft tissue of the {{esophagus}} and oral cavity, where it will stay until it has dissipated. The American Medical Association concludes in its Manual for Chemical Tests for Intoxication (1959): [...] "True reactions with alcohol in expired breath from sources other than the alveolar air (eructation, regurgitation, vomiting) will, of course, vitiate the breath alcohol results." [...] For this reason, police officers are supposed to keep a DUI suspect under observation for at least 15 minutes prior to administering a breath test. Instruments such as the Intoxilyzer 5000 also feature a [...] "slope" [...] parameter. This parameter detects any decrease in alcohol concentration of 0.006g per 210L of breath in 0.6second, a condition indicative of residual mouth alcohol, and will result in an [...] "invalid sample" [...] warning to the <b>operator,</b> <b>notifying</b> the <b>operator</b> {{of the presence of}} the residual mouth alcohol.
