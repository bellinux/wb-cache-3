5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> decomposing {{organic matter}} found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches.

5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E

5|$|The stomach in the {{cephalothorax}} {{acts as a}} pump {{that sends}} the food deeper into the digestive system.

5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E
30|$|The {{concentration}} of Cu, Na, Ca, K and Mg is comparatively {{higher in the}} plants nourished by gamma ray-irradiated textile effluent than the plants nourished with raw textile effluent and only water. This {{is due to the}} bioavailability of the <b>nutrient</b> <b>from</b> the textile effluent after gamma ray irradiation. In the raw effluent the nutrient element remains as a ligand that binds to the central metal atom in a complex form. But after irradiation the complex form has broken down and the nutrient element becomes available as a free element. And plants are then able to uptake the <b>nutrient</b> <b>from</b> water. Depending upon the exposure route, all these elements (Cu, Na, Ca, K and Mg) are least toxic trace elements if ingested (USEPA 1995). Finally it can be easily concluded that the hazardous and toxic elements in the plant are present in negligible amounts but the nutrients essential for plant growth and human health are found in higher rate. So the gamma ray-irradiated textile effluents have proved as the fertilizer-containing irrigation water.|$|R

Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists {{can help}} {{determine}} potential grave sites {{that might have}} been overlooked. Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E

A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides <b>nutrients</b> <b>from</b> terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|E
