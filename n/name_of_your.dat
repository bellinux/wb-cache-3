25|$|On 6 June 1843, Prescod {{was one of}} {{two people}} elected from the new {{constituency}} of Bridgetown. This was particularly difficult, as not only had he to overcome the prejudices, he had to work especially hard since it was only people who owned land who could vote. Moreover, this was not a secret ballot. At that time the polling booth was a piece of paper with the names of the candidates shown. Beneath the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> choice you had to sign your name for all to see.|$|E

Behold, therefore, four stars reserved for your illustrious name ... which ... make their journeys and orbits with a marvelous speed around the star of Jupiter ... like children of the same family ... Indeed, it appears the Maker of the Stars himself, by clear arguments, admonished me to call these new planets by the illustrious <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Highness before all others.|$|E
500|$|The {{intense heat}} at the outdoor Bastille Day event on 14 July {{exhausted}} {{the former prime}} minister, and that evening Rainilaiarivony developed a fever. He slept poorly, disturbed by a dream in which he saw the former queen Rasoherina stand beside his bed, saying, [...] "In the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> brother, Rainivoninahitriniony, be ready." [...] One of Rainilaiarivony's servants reported the dream to Vassé, explaining it as a premonition that foretold Rainilaiarivony's impending death. The former prime minister remained in bed and rapidly weakened {{over the next several}} days as his fever worsened and he developed a headache. He was constantly attended by his closest friends and loved ones. Rainilaiarivony died in his sleep on 17 July 1896.|$|E

6000|$|... "But say, isn't {{that rather}} rough upon your uncle?" [...] he asked doubtfully. [...] "We can't bother him with every little thing. Surely {{there can be}} nothing indiscreet in your giving me the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> guests. Most people send them to the papers themselves." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Time {{magazine}} {{asked about}} The Harry Potter Alliance, Rowling said, [...] "It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting {{to see people}} {{going out there and}} doing that in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause." [...] Rowling awarded The Harry Potter Alliance a Fan Site Award in December 2007.|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, 2015, Huckabee {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} seek the Republican nomination {{for president of the}} United States in the 2016 election. In his speech, which was delivered in the hometown that he shares with Bill Clinton, Huckabee attacked trade deals that he said drive down U.S. wages, opposed raising the age for Social Security benefits, criticized President Obama for what he said was putting more pressure on Israel than Iran, and made an unusual plea for donations of $15 or $25 a month, saying: [...] "I will ask you to give something in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> children and grandchildren." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rashi {{taught that}} God's words [...] "I am the Lord" [...] in [...] meant that God was {{faithful}} to recompense {{all those who}} followed God. Thus [...] "I am the Lord" [...] means that God is faithful to exact payment when it is stated in conjunction with an act warranting punishment, as in [...] "or you will profane the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> God; I am the Lord." [...] And [...] "I am the Lord" [...] means that God is faithful to give reward when it is stated {{in conjunction with the}} fulfillment of commandments, as in [...] "And you shall keep My commandments and perform them; I am the Lord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Mr. Tyritt protested, {{the slight}} {{irritation}} passing from his manner. [...] "Such a visit as yours is an agreeable break in my routine work. I {{feel as though}} I might be {{a character in a}} great modern romance. The <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> amateur criminals are still tingling in my memory." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not carry a letter," [...] Dick said, [...] "for it would {{compromise}} you if we were taken. It would be better, if I might suggest, for the countess to write to him direct, saying that when two persons arrive and give some pass-word, say, for instance, the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> three daughters, we shall not forget them, he is to give us any help we may require." ...|$|R
2500|$|At 9p.m. of {{the same}} day Nicholas {{received}} a cryptic and threatening message from Yakov Rostovtsev. Rostovtsev's report did not specify any names but threatened Nicholas with a multitude of disasters. Surprisingly well informed about the correspondence between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw, Rostovtsev advised Nicholas to go to Warsaw himself rather than wait for Constantine. His report, [...] "a candle to the Lord and to Satan", sounded like an ultimatum: [...] "You have seriously irritated a great number against you. In the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own glory I entreat you not to hasten to reign." [...] Nicholas did not heed Rostovtsev's proposals which ran completely contrary to his plans. In another irrational twist, he treated Rostovtsev with respect and affection, and shielded him from prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|The September 11 {{attacks on}} the United States, and various other acts of Islamic {{terrorism}} over the 21st century, have resulted in many non-Muslims' indictment of Islam as a violent religion. In particular, the Qur'an's teachings on matters {{of war and peace}} have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. On the one hand, some critics claim that certain verses of the Qur'an sanction military action against unbelievers as a whole both during the lifetime of Muhammad and after. The Qur'an says, [...] "Fight in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> religion with those who fight against you." [...] On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context, and argue that when the verses are read in context it clearly appears that the Qur'an prohibits aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|Most of his contemporaries, {{who also}} wrote earlier, are less evasive: {{in the letter}} sent to Queen Joanna and Emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) by the constable and town {{authorities}} of la Rica Villa de la Vera Cruz, Cortés's captains narrate the origin of Hernández's expedition saying: [...] "as it is the custom in those islands that in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> majesties are peopled with Spaniards to go for Indians to the islands that are not peopled with Spaniards, to obtain services from them , they sent the abovementioned..... two boats and a brigantine in order that from said islands they would bring Indians to the so-called Fernandina Island, and we think [...] that said Diego Velázquez [...] has the fourth part of said armada". In his Relación de las cosas de Yucatán ("Relation of the Things of Yucatán"), [...] Fray Diego de Landa writes that Hernández de Córdoba went... "to gather slaves for the mines, now that in Cuba the population is getting smaller", although a while later he adds, [...] "Others say that he left to discover land and that he brought Alaminos as a pilot..." [...] Bartolomé de Las Casas also says {{that even if the}} original intent was to kidnap and enslave Indians, at some point the objective was broadened to one of discovery, which justifies Alaminos.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{they are}} interesting," [...] he replied. [...] "The {{atmosphere}} {{at the present}} moment is electric, charged with all manner of strange possibilities.

2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and I must confess are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
