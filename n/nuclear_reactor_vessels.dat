50|$|High-energy {{neutrons}} {{damage and}} degrade materials over time; bombardment of materials with neutrons creates collision cascades {{that can produce}} point defects and dislocations in the material, the creation {{of which is the}} primary driver behind microstructural changes occurring over time in materials exposed to radiation. At high neutron fluences this can lead to embrittlement of metals and other materials, and to swelling in some of them. This poses a problem for <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels</b> and significantly limits their lifetime (which can be somewhat prolonged by controlled annealing of the vessel, reducing the number of the built-up dislocations). Graphite moderator blocks are especially susceptible to this effect, known as Wigner effect, and must be annealed periodically. The Windscale fire was caused by a mishap during such an annealing operation.|$|E

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steel has structural values {{in almost all}} industries. It {{is one of the}} most widely used materials. Qualitative assessment of such important components is of greater importance in very sensitive applications such as <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels.</b> Ultrasonic based Time of Flight diffraction is a reliable technique in testing the materials for many types of defects in welds. Echo signals obtained by the receiver are also accompanied by ambient scattering noise due to the signal interaction with the grains of the material. This noise degrades the quality of the defect echo signal and at times completely deteriorates the shape of the defect signal there by making it unsuitable for characterization. Signal processing is a necessary aspect in restoring the defect signal‟s shape, size etc for proper detection and positioning of the defect in the material. Wavelet Transform is one such popular technique for denoising of the signals in which thresholding of high frequency components removes the unwanted noise. Conventional global thresholding gives good improvement in SNR values.

30|$|Functionally graded {{materials}} (FGMs) are {{the advanced}} materials {{of the family}} of engineering composites made of two or more constituent phases with a continuous and smoothly varying composition (Koizumi 1997). These advanced materials with engineered gradients of composition, structure and/or specific properties in the preferred direction/orientation are superior to homogeneous material composed of similar constituents. These materials possess numerous advantages that make them appropriate in potential applications including the potential reduction of in-plane and through-the thickness transverse stresses, improved thermal properties, high toughness, etc. FGMs consisting of metallic and ceramic components are well known to enhance the properties of thermal-barrier systems, because cracking or de-lamination, which are often observed in conventional multi-layer systems are avoided due to the smooth transition between the properties of the components. By varying percentage contents of volume fractions of two or more materials spatially, FGMs can be formed which will have desired property gradation in spatial directions. The mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus of elasticity, Poisson’s ratio, shear modulus of elasticity, material density, etc. vary smoothly and continuously in preferred directions in FGMs because of continuous changes in the composition, microstructure, porosity, etc. These materials are gaining wide applications in various branches of engineering and technology with a view to make proper use of potential properties of the available materials in the best possible way. FGMs can be employed in thin-walled members, like plates and shells which are used in <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels,</b> turbines and other machine parts, which are prone to failure from buckling, large amplitude deflections, or excessive stresses induced by thermal or combined thermo-mechanical loading.

40|$|Application of the Master Curve {{method and}} {{associated}} reference temperature of ASTM E 1921 {{to define the}} ductile to brittle transition in ferritic structural steels used in commercial <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels</b> requires extensive experimental verification. Recent suggestions have proposed replacing the nil-ductility reference temperature RTNDT of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code with a RTTo reference temperature. This reference temperature could then be used to position the median and lower bound transition toughness curves {{for the purpose of}} thermal shock evaluations or for life extension of existing US commercial nuclear power stations. In this experimental program different C(T), SE(B), and pre-cracked Charpy specimen geometries have been investigated including both deep and shallow cracked SE(B) geometries. Two or more test temperatures were used for each geometry and at least 6 identical specimens of each specimen configuration have been tested at each temperature. Specimen geometries have ranged from 5 mm thick SE(B) specimens to standard 1 T (25 mm by 50 mm) three point bend specimens and crack length to specimen width ratios for the SE(B) specimens ranged from a/W = 0. 12 to 0. 6. The material utilized was an A 533 Grade B steel obtained from the decommissioned Shoreham nuclear power plant pressure vessel. Three distinct populations of data appear to exist in the results of this program corresponding to C(T) specimens, SE(B) specimens, and shallow crack SE(B) specimens.

40|$|In present design practice, the {{statistical}} approach {{is used for}} strength but not for deformations, including creep and shrinkage. However, predicting concrete creep properties from design strength and con-crete composition involves a large uncertainty, much larger than that of strength. It is shown that by carrying out some short-time creep measurements, even rather limited ones, the uncertainty can be drastically reduced, and extrapolation of short·time measurements can be made much more reliable. This is accomplished by developing a Bayesian approach to creep prediction. Prior information consists of the coefficient of variation of deviations from the creep law for concrete in general, as determined in a recent statistical analysis of the numerous creep data that exist in literature. This information is com-bined, according to Bayes ' theorem, with the probability of a given concrete's creep values to yield the posterior probability distribution of the creep values for any load duration and age at loading. Only a linear creep case is considered, and a normal distribution of errors is assumed for the given concrete {{as well as for the}} prior infor-mation. To demonstrate and verify the method developed, various creep data reported in literature are considered. Predictions made on the basis of only a part of the test data are compared with the rest of the data, and very good agreement is found. The effects of various amounts of measured data, and of various degrees of uncertainty in the prior information, are also illustrated. The present approach is recommended for concrete structures for which the creep deflections, creep-induced cracking, or creep buckling are of special concern, e. g., <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>vessels</b> and containments, certain very large bridges, shells, or building frames...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe are {{concerned}} with the time-dependent multiphysics problem of heat and moisture transfer in the context of civil engineering applications.
