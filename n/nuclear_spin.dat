5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} iron {{consists of}} four stable isotopes: 5.845% of 54Fe, 91.754% of 56Fe, 2.119% of 57Fe and 0.282% of 58Fe. Of these stable isotopes, only 57Fe has a <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> (−). The nuclide 54Fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to 54Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×1022 years has been established.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Rabi {{returned}} to the United States, where Columbia offered him a faculty position. In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm {{the properties of the}} atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic moment and <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Nuclear magnetic resonance became an important tool for nuclear physics and chemistry, and the subsequent development of magnetic resonance imaging from it has also made it important to the field of medicine.|$|E
5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} homonuclear periodic {{array of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> I = 1 / 2, owing to hyperfine interaction of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> with electronic magnetic moments in antiferromagnetic structure, is considered. The neighbor <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> in such array are opposite oriented and have resonant frequencies determined by hyperfine interaction constant, {{applied magnetic field}} value and interaction with {{the left and right}} <b>nuclear</b> neighbor <b>spins.</b> The resonant frequencies difference of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins,</b> when the neighbor spins have different and the same states, is used to control the spin dynamics by means of selective resonant RF-pulses both for single <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> and for ensemble of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> with the same resonant frequency. A model for the NMR quantum computer of cellular-automata type based on an one-dimensional homonuclear periodic array of spins is proposed.

40|$|An all-optical {{scheme to}} {{polarize}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> {{in a single}} quantum dot is analyzed. The hyperfine interaction with randomly oriented <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> presents a fundamental limit for electron spin coherence in a quantum dot; by cooling the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins,</b> this decoherence mechanism could be suppressed. The proposed scheme is inspired by laser cooling methods of atomic physics and implements a "controlled Overhauser effect" in a zero-dimensional structure...|$|R
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did not agree with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> on the resistance of helical edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators (2 DTIs). Via the hyperfine interaction, <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> allow electron backscattering, otherwise forbidden by time reversal symmetry. We identify two backscattering mechanisms, {{depending on whether the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> are ordered or not. Their temperature dependence is distinct but both give resistance, which increases with the edge length, decreasing temperature, and increasing strength of the electron-electron interaction. Overall, we find that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> will typically shut down the conductance of the 2 DTI edges at zero temperature.

As {{examples of the}} application the method, the multile-quantum coherence dynamics in clusters of a linear chain of four <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> and a ring of six spins coupled by dipole-dipole interaction are considered. The calculated 0 Q- and 2 Q intensities in a linear chain of four <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> and 6 Q intensity in a ring of six spins vs {{the duration of the}} preparation period agree well with the exact solutions (for linear chain of four <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins)</b> and simulation data (for linear chain of four <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> and a ring of six spin).

5|$|Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes, with 79Br making up 51% of natural bromine and 81Br {{making up the}} {{remaining}} 49%. Both have <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> 3/2− and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although 81Br is more favourable. The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 79Br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium; that of isotopes heavier than 81Br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} vanadium {{is composed}} of one stable isotope, 51V, and one radioactive isotope, 50V. The latter has a half-life of 1.5×1017 years and a natural abundance of 0.25%. 51V has a <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> of , which is useful for NMR spectroscopy. Twenty-four artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 40 to 65. The most stable of these isotopes are 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 16.0 days. The remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, most below 10 seconds. At least four isotopes have metastable excited states. Electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than 51V. For the heavier ones, the most common mode is beta decay. The electron capture reactions lead {{to the formation of}} element 22 (titanium) isotopes, while beta decay leads to element 24 (chromium) isotopes.|$|E
25|$|The radical pair {{may either}} cross {{over to a}} singlet {{electron}} state and then recombine, or separate and perish in side reactions. The relative probability of these two pathways for a given radical pair depends on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> state and leads to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> state sorting and observable nuclear polarization.|$|E
40|$|Quantum Hall (QH) systems {{consist of}} many-body {{electron}} and <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins.</b> They are coupled so weakly through the hyperfine interaction that normally electron spin dynamics are scarcely {{affected by the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins.</b> The dynamics of the QH systems, however, may drastically change when the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> interact with low-energy collective excitation modes of the electron spins. We theoretically investigate the nuclear-electron spin interaction in the QH systems as hybrid quantum systems driven by the hyperfine interaction. In particular, we study {{the interaction between the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode with the linear dispersion relation associated with the U(1) spin rotational symmetry breaking. We show that such an interaction is described as <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> collectively coupled to the NG mode, and can be effectively described by the Dicke model. Based on the model we suggest that various collective spin phenomena realized in quantum optical systems also emerge in the QH systems...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of an electron spin in a graphene quantum dot, which is interacting with a bath of less than ten <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> via the anisotropic hyperfine interaction. Due to substantial progress in the fabrication of graphene quantum dots, the consideration of such {{a small number of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> is experimentally relevant. This choice allows us to use exact diagonalization to calculate the longtime average of the electron spin as well as its decoherence time. We investigate the dependence of spin observables on the initial states of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> and on the position of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> in the quantum dot. Moreover, we analyze the effects of the anisotropy of the hyperfine interaction for different orientations of the spin quantization axis with respect to the graphene plane.

25|$|In {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} description of electron and <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> {{systems that have}} {{a limited number of}} possible states, and therefore a discrete upper limit of energy they can attain, it is possible to obtain a negative temperature, which is numerically indeed less than absolute zero. However, this is not the macroscopic temperature of the material, but instead the temperature of only very specific degrees of freedom, that are isolated from others and do not exchange energy by virtue of the equipartition theorem.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{physical}} circumstances {{do not allow}} molecules to be studied in solution, {{and at the same}} time not by other spectroscopic techniques to an atomic level, either. In solid-phase media, such as crystals, microcrystalline powders, gels, anisotropic solutions, etc., it is in particular the dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy that become dominant to the behaviour of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> systems. In conventional solution-state NMR spectroscopy, these additional interactions would lead to a significant broadening of spectral lines. A variety of techniques allows establishing high-resolution conditions, that can, at least for 13C spectra, be comparable to solution-state NMR spectra.|$|E
25|$|Because CT and MRI are {{sensitive}} to different tissue properties, {{the appearance of the}} images obtained with the two techniques differ markedly. In CT, X-rays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image, so the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor. In MRI, while any nucleus with a net <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> can be used, the proton of the hydrogen atom remains the most widely used, especially in the clinical setting, because it is so ubiquitous and returns a large signal.

25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
25|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{body that}} is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's center of momentum) may have various kinds of internal energy at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin.</b> These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However all internal energies of all types contribute to body's mass, inertia, and total energy.|$|E
25|$|CIDNP was {{discovered}} in 1967 by Bargon and Fischer, and, independently, by Ward and Lawler. Early theories were based on dynamic nuclear polarisation (hence the name). The subsequent experiments, however, have found {{that in many cases}} DNP fails to explain CIDNP polarization phase. In 1969 an alternative explanation was proposed by Closs, and, independently, by Kaptein and Oosterhoff, which relied on the ability of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spin</b> interactions to alter the recombination probability in reactions that proceed through radical pairs. This mechanism, known as the Radical Pair Mechanism is currently accepted as {{the most common cause of}} CIDNP. There are, however, exceptions, and the DNP mechanism was found to be operational, for example, in many fluorine-containing radicals.|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{entanglement}} {{mechanism of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> in quantum dots {{driven by the}} electric current accompanied by the spin flip. This situation is relevant to a leakage current in spin-blocked regions where electrons cannot be transported unless their spins are flipped. The current gradually increases the components of larger total spin of nuclei. This correlation among the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> markedly enhances the spin-flip rate of electrons and hence the leakage current. The enhancement of the current is observable when the residence time of electrons in the quantum dots is shorter than the dephasing time T*_ 2 of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Compared to electrons, {{holes in}} InAs quantum dots have a {{significantly}} weaker hyperfine interaction {{that leads to}} less dephasing from <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins.</b> Thus many recent {{studies have suggested that}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> are unimportant for hole spin dynamics compared to electric field fluctuations. We show that the hole hyperfine interaction can have a strong effect on hole spin coherence measurements through a nuclear feedback effect. The nuclear polarization is generated through a unique process that is dependent on the anisotropy of the hole hyperfine interaction and the coherent precession of <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins,</b> giving rise to strong modulation at the nuclear precession frequency.

We derive an effective magnetic Hamiltonian for the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> which is of the RKKY type and where the interactions between the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> are strongly modified by the electron-electron interactions. We show that the nuclear magnetic ordering at finite temperature relies on the (anomalous) behavior of the 2 D static electron spin susceptibility, and thus provides a connection between low-dimensional magnetism and non-analyticities in interacting 2 D electron systems. Using various perturbative and non-perturbative approximation schemes {{in order to establish}} the general shape of the electron spin susceptibility as function of its wave vector, we show that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>spins</b> locally order ferromagnetically, and that this ordering can become global in certain regimes of interest.
