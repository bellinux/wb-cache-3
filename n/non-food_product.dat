The choice experiment was part of a survey of 1510 randomly selected consumers in Germany that was mailed in spring 2005. Attitudes towards gene technology, institutions and technical progress were measured using 22 items. A factor analysis revealed five factors describing consumer attitudes: support, risk, trust, attitude towards technical progress and attitude towards technical innovation. Based on these factors we identify four different classes of consumers in a latent class model for both products. Analysis of these classes shows strong differences between willingness to pay estimates for benefits compared to risk reduction as well as differences between the classes.

40|$|Abstract: The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of the network model of entrepreneurship in the regional consumer market by the example of the Volgograd region. The presented model is based on the network approach, which choice is substantiated in the work. As part of the model, three categories of network entrepreneurship in the consumer market of the Volgograd region are distinguished in the segment of non-food products: internal networks, vertical networks and inter-market network; the main components of the model (the participants (agents), resources and activities), their interaction and the nature of relations are presented and described. Considering the peculiarities of the network-approach, the article highlighted the specific features of business processes in the enterprise network of the analyzed area. As an integral component of the model, the organizational structure of the entrepreneurship network was developed and its key element, a "trade network”, was described in details; the level of consumer access to non-food stores in the Volgograd region was identified. Considering the mentioned level the standard models of the non-food trade network location according to administrative purposes are distinguished. To determine the effectiveness of the developed model the estimation algorithm is presented; it considers the impact and effectiveness of the network functioning through the prism of its development and growth.

40|$|Moringa oleifera, or the {{horseradish}} tree, is a pan-tropical {{species that}} is known by such regional names as benzolive, drumstick tree, kelor, marango, mlonge, mulangay, nébéday, saijhan, and sajna. Over the past two decades, many reports have appeared in mainstream scientific journals describing its nutritional and medicinal properties. Its utility as a <b>non-food</b> <b>product</b> has also been extensively described, but will not be discussed herein, (e. g. lumber, charcoal, fencing, water clarification, lubricating oil). As with many reports of the nutritional or medicinal value of a natural product, there are an alarming number of purveyors of “healthful ” food who are now promoting M. oleifera as a panacea. While much of this recent enthusiasm indeed appears to be justified, {{it is critical to}} separate rigorous scientific evidence from anecdote. Those who charge a premium for products containing Moringa spp. must be held to a high standard. Those who promote the cultivation and use of Moringa spp. in regions where hope is in short supply must be provided with the best available evidence, so as not to raise false hopes and to encourage the most fruitful use of scarce research capital. It is the purpose of this series of brief reviews to: (a) critically evaluate the published scientific evidence on M. oleifera, (b) highlight claims from the traditional and tribal medicinal lore and from non-peer reviewed sources that would benefit from further, rigorous scientific evaluation, and (c) suggest directions for future clinical research that could be carried out by local investigators in developing regions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Food {{marketing}} {{is linked to}} childhood obesity through its influence on children’s food preferences, purchase requests and food consumption. We aimed to describe the volume and nature of outdoor food advertisements and factors associated with outdoor food advertising in the area surrounding Australian primary schools. Methods: Forty primary schools in Sydney and Wollongong were selected using random sampling within population density and socio-economic strata. The area within a 500 m radius of each school was scanned and advertisements coded according to pre-defined criteria, including: food or <b>non-food</b> <b>product</b> advertisement, distance from the school, size and location. Food advertisements were further categorised as core foods, non-core foods and miscellaneous drinks (tea and coffee). Results: The number of advertisements identified was 9, 151, of which 2, 286 (25 %) were for food. The number of non-core food advertisements was 1, 834, this accounted for 80 % of food advertisements. Soft drinks and alcoholic beverages were the food products most commonly advertised around primary schools (24 % and 22 % of food advertisements, respectively). Non-core food products were {{twice as likely to}} be advertised close to a primary school (95 non-core food advertisements per km 2 within 250 m vs. 46 advertisements per km 2 within 250 - 500 m). Conclusions: The density of non-core food advertisements within 500 m of primary schools, and the potential for repeated exposure of children to soft drink and alcoholic beverage advertisements in particular, highlights the need for outdoor food marketing policy intervention. Implications: Outdoor advertising is an important food marketing tool that should be considered in future debates on regulation of food marketing to children...|$|E

40|$|Whereas, Obesity {{rates have}} tripled in {{children}} and teens {{over the past two}} decades. More than nine million young people aged six to nineteen years are considered obese. 1 Whereas, A nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 82 % of schools sell food to raise money. Of those schools, 75 % sell chocolate candy, 67 % sell baked goods that are not low fat, and 63 % sell nonchocolate candy. 2 Whereas, On-campus, food-related practices, such as the sale of low-nutrition foods in vending, a la carte, or fundraisers are associated with increases in children’s body mass index (BMI). Every separate food related practice that promotes low-nutrition foods in a school is associated with a 10 % increase in students ’ BMI. 3 Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture, many schools have found that they can make as much money selling healthy snacks and beverages as unhealthy options. 5 An increasing number of fundraising companies offer “healthier ” or <b>non-food</b> <b>product</b> alternatives, enabling schools to switch easily to selling healthier products. 6 Whereas, Selling low-nutrition foods in schools contradicts nutrition education and sends children the message that good nutrition is not important. 4 School environments should reinforce classroom nutrition education by modeling and supporting healthy behaviors. Resolved, The __________ _ school (or school district) PTA will promote and implement healthy fundraisers.

40|$|Aims To {{examine the}} extent and content of outdoor food {{advertisements}} and food availability from outlets {{in the vicinity of}} secondary schools. Methods The sample of schools (n= 10) was randomly selected from a sample frame of schools in both an urban and rural region (Wellington and Wairarapa regions respectively) and at each extreme of the socioeconomic status (SES) distribution (based on school characteristics). An area of 1 -km radius around the schools was examined for food and <b>non-food</b> <b>product</b> advertisements and shops/outlets. Results Out of 1408 outdoor advertisements for products, 61. 5 % were for food (i. e. 28 per square kilometre). The major categories were soft drinks (21. 6 %), frozen confectionary (16. 2 %), savoury snacks (11. 4 %), and alcohol (8. 1 %). Overall, 70. 2 % of food advertisements were for foods classified as ‘unhealthy ’ (i. e. inconsistent with the national nutritional guidelines for adolescents). A majority of the 224 outlets sold food (i. e. 56. 3 %). Those that primarily sold food were (on average) closer than other outlets to the secondary schools (p= 0. 03). Out of those schools that sold meals, the proportion of these that advertised a salad option was significantly lower in the low SES neighbourhoods (p= 0. 006). Other significantly different patterns for food outlet distribution, and category of advertised food were found by SES and rurality. Conclusion Although only a pilot study, the information obtained suggests that food advertising and food outlets are prevalent in the vicinity of secondary schools and that the advertising is generally not compatible with nutritional guidelines for adolescents. Larger studies into such advertising are needed as well as consideration of policy options to control aspects of the ‘obesogenic environment. ’ There is growing concern over the prevalence of obesity and related chronic diseases such as diabetes in New Zealand (for example, as shown in the New Zealand Medical Journal articles that appeared in the 17 December 2004 ‘theme ’ issue.

40|$|This paper {{researches}} {{a number}} of {{similarities and differences between}} European legal regimens with regard to food and <b>non–food</b> <b>product</b> safety, {{based on the assumption that}} these regimens may have overly diverged. A tentative conclusion is that there are enough similarities to justify an effort to reconcile the two regimens. The point of departure for this research (Section 1) is an overview of sources of law laid down in the EC Treaty for drawing up legislation in the area of product safety (food and non–food). In Section 2, the Product Safety Law acquis is presented; this is the cumulative body of European law implemented so far, based on these sources. EC–Treaty articles constitute the legal basis for the Product Safety Law acquis, which in turn forms the legal basis for policies. Therefore, Section 3 deals with the Commission’s current policy intentions: indications of what can be expected in this area in years to come. A core characteristic of the Product Safety Law acquis is the precautionary principle (Section 4), which refers to safety risk management, intended to prevent the marketing of defective products. Should preventive risk management measures fail, the producer’s ability to trace already marketed hazardous products is crucial in order to limit liability, as explained in Section 5. Section 6 highlights an important legal presumption in non–food safety law. The safety of non–food products is presumed if production took place according to standardised norms. A long term European law–reform programme is introduced in Section 7. This so–called Better Regulation programme is a perfect opportunity to adjust the Product Safety Law acquis to new insights. Section 8 summarizes our observations and findings. Section 9 discusses the utility of the Confident Consumer concept. Because it seems disadvantageous to focus on the differences between food and non–food safety rules, the possible advantages of a policy and law reform are assessed. Therefore Section 10 concludes to attune both parts of product safety law to the similarities instead of focusing on differences. Maintaining the dichotomy is disadvantageous to progress...|$|E
