40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} {{on the history of the}} tuberculin test and causes of non-specific reactions in cattle is given. The economic importance of the nonspecific reactor problem in South Africa is discussed. The cultural and biochemical characteristics and in some instances the virulence for laboratory animals of the 42 strains used in the investigation are given. The strains used were typical of the species they represented in these characteristics, except for the scotochromogen Hg 3. Details are given of the preparation of PPD sensitins from one strain of M. hovis, three strains of M. kansasii, two strains of M. fortuitum, two strains of M. phlei, two strains of M. smegmatis, six M. avium and avian-like strains, two strains of scotochromogenic mycobacteria, and six strains of unclassified mycobacteria probably belonging to a single species. The allergenic characteristics of the 42 strains of Mycobacteria and the twenty four sensitins were studied in guinea pigs. Specificity differences of the sensitins and sensitivity profiles of the strains are given. The sensitivity caused by various species of mycobacteria was found to be species specific, although varying degrees of cross sensitivity do occur between different species. Guine 1 pigs and cattle sensitized by all the species investigated except M. bovus is were more sensitive to avian PPD than to bovine PPD. It was shown that the specificity of the sensitivity caused by different species of mycobacteria is similar in calves and guinea pigs. Multiple comparative tests in naturally sensitized <b>non-specific</b> <b>reactor</b> cattle showed most of these animals to be more sensitive to avian tuberculin than to any of the other sensitins used in the investigation. The sensitivity profiles in these animals were similar to sensitivity profiles in guinea pigs sensitized by M. avium. This indicates that the most common cause of non-specific reactors in these herd was M. avium or avian-like mycobacteria. Field trials with Onderstepoort PPD tuberculins showed the comparative test to be more accurate than a test with bovine tuberculin alone in differentiating nonspecific reactors and tuberculous animals. The simultaneous injection of via and bovine tuberculin did not influence the sensitivity to the latter. Results are given of investigations in two herds where both non-specific reactors and tuberculous animals occurred. Non-specific reactions were more common in young and tuberculosis more common in older cattle. The most suitable interpretation standards for the comparative test and the test with bovine tuberculin alone were investigated. Suggested interpretation keys are given.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the specificity of}} the γ-interferon test for bovine tuberculosis (TB) in 1557 cattle in 30 paratuberculosis-free and officially certified TB-free dairy herds, located in three provinces of the Lombardy Region in Northern Italy. The TB-free status of the herds under examination was further confirmed by the tuberculin skin test, by an antibody assay and by post mortem examination of animals culled from the herds during the study period. The specificity of the γ-interferon tests after a single test and a double sampling scheme were 88. 8 % and 95. 4 %, respectively. After a single test, 11. 7 % of dubious reactors were also detected, while most cattle (47. 4 %) were shown to be avian reactors, probably due to contamination from infected birds and/or forage. There was strong evidence that the specificity of the test {{could be related to}} the animals’ interaction with environmental mycobacteria and/or ageing. To reduce the percentage of <b>non-specific</b> bovine <b>reactors</b> under alleged TB-free conditions, test procedures might involve the use of more specific antigens and/or different reaction thresholds...|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study {{was performed to}} assess the epidemiological status of bovine tuberculosis {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2013. The state was divided into seven regions, and a preset number of herds was randomly sampled in each region. From each farm, female cattle aged 24 months or older were randomly sampled and subjected to the comparative cervical tuberculin test (CCTT). Animals with inconclusive test results were re-tested with the same diagnostic procedure after a minimum interval of 60 days. A total of 31 ? 832 animals were tested from 2 ? 182 farms. An epidemiological questionnaire was administered in the farms to identify risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis. Prevalence in the state was estimated at 4. 25 % (95 % CI: 3. 36 % – 5. 15 %) for herds and at 0. 56 % (95 % CI: 0. 46 % – 0. 66 %) for animals. Data on herd prevalence for bovine tuberculosis for each stratum showed the highest prevalences at region Sul e Sudoeste (stratum 5) and region Central (stratum 3) which were significantly different from the lowest prevalences found at regions Noroeste, Norte e Nordeste (stratum 1) and region Leste (stratum 2). The highest animal prevalences observed for the region Sul e Sudoeste (stratum 5), region Zona da Mata (stratum 4) and region Central (stratum 3) were significantly different from the lowest ones at region Triângulo Mineiro (stratum 7), region Noroeste, Norte, e Nordeste (stratum 1) and region Leste (stratum 2). The presence of bovine tuberculosis was associated with animal purchase from cattle traders (OR?=? 2. 59 [95 % CI: 1. 28 – 5. 20]), higher yield intensive dairy (OR?=? 7. 55 [95 % CI: 1. 89 % – 30. 09 %]) and non-intensive dairy production (OR?=? 3. 58 [95 % CI: 1. 06 % – 12. 04 %]), as well as with herds with 30 or more cows (OR?=? 1. 97 [95 % CI: 1. 02 – 3. 80]). <b>Non-specific</b> <b>reactors</b> to the CCTT were found in 95. 07 % (95 % CI: 94. 05 % - 96. 09 %) of the herds. Therefore, the state of Minas Gerais should implement surveillance systems for the detection and sanitation of infected herds, preferably incorporating risk-based surveillance elements, considering {{the results of the present}} study...|$|R
40|$|The herd {{incidence}} of confirmed Mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle in the south-west of England has been approximately ten {{times that of}} the remainder of England and Wales; this greater incidence has been attributed to infection from badgers. The incidence of herds with only non-visible lesioned tuberculin test reactors, from which M. bovis was not isolated, has also remained higher in the south-west region. The incidences of these latter unconfirmed incidents were compared in parishes in the south-west region in which M. bovis in cattle had been confirmed, and those where M. bovis had not been confirmed, for the period 1979 - 83. This analysis was carried out both for those parishes in which herds had been subjected to annual tuberculin testing and for those subjected to biennial tuberculin testing. The incidence of unconfirmed incidents was significantly higher in parishes in which confirmed incidents had occurred, and this difference was found in both the annual and biennially tested parishes. The relative risks for the incidence of unconfirmed incidents in annually and biennially tested parishes were 1. 89 and 2. 56, respectively. The incidence of unconfirmed incidents in biennially tested parishes was lower than in annually tested parishes. The incidence of <b>non-specific</b> tuberculin test <b>reactor</b> herds was estimated from tuberculin test results in the eastern region of England during a period when tuberculosis was not confirmed in cattle. A comparison of this incidence and that of unconfirmed incidents in the south-west region suggests that approximately 70 % of the unconfirmed incidents in the south-west were related to exposure to M. bovis. The results of the analyses indicate that unconfirmed incidents cannot be completely ignored in epidemiological analyses and studies of bovine tuberculosis in the problem areas of the south-west region of England...|$|R
