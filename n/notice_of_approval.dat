The Ephemerides is the earliest known astrological work from the Low Countries to carry an official <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> from the Roman Catholic Church. Gemma moved away from judicial astrology and renounced astrological predictions about political events, and seems to have gradually confined himself to predictions about astronomical phenomena and meteorological astrology. His predictions for 1561, for example, provided detailed information on every lunar phase, and most planetary aspects and phases of fixed stars {{in relation to the}} sun, with a thoroughness that surpassed the predictions of his contemporaries. He remained committed to astrologic medicine, however, and believed that predictable atmospheric conditions, extending to astral conjunctions, generated disease.|$|E

The NOP comment period is no shorter than 30 days. After preparation of the draft EIR, a <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Completion (NOC) must be submitted to the Office of Planning and Research which includes project location, location of review copies, and public comment review period information. The lead agency must provide public <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the draft EIR {{at the same time}} it issues the NOC.

The contents of a final EIR are specified in §15132 of the CEQA guidelines, but responses to draft EIR comments are the focus of the document. The lead agency then certifies the final EIR and issues its findings. Should significant and unavoidable impacts remain after mitigation, a Statement of Overriding Considerations must be prepared. Finally, the lead agency may decide whether or how to approve or carry out the project at which time a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> determination (NOD) must be filed within five days <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> Appeal periods and litigation avenues remain after the NOD.|$|R
