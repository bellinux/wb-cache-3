5|$|On November8, {{nearly two}} months after the {{dissipation}} of Typhoon Nabi, President George W. Bush declared a major disaster declaration for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>islands.</b> The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings, pay for debris removal, and other emergency services. Federal funding was also made available on a cost-sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters. The government ultimately provided $1,046,074.03 to the commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|In early July, {{widespread}} {{showers and}} thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became {{associated with the}} TUTT and quickly organized. By July11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320km (200mi) east of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands.</b> The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a cold-core low.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina has two {{official}} mottos, both {{of which}} are in Latin. Kentucky, North Dakota, and Vermont also have two mottos, one in Latin and the other in English. All other states and territories have only one motto, except Guam and the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands,</b> which do not have any mottos. English and Latin are the most-used languages for state mottos, each used by 25 states and territories. Seven states and territories use another language, of which each language is only used once. Eight states and two territories have their mottos on their state quarter; thirty-eight states and four territories have their mottos on their state seals.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Pongsona {{produced}} {{strong wind}} gusts peaking at 278km/h (173mph 1-min), which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1,300houses. With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, {{there were no}} fatalities directly related to Pongsona, although there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700million (2002 USD, $ USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota {{and elsewhere in the}} <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands,</b> {{and as a result of}} its impact the name was retired.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War broke out, the East Asia Squadron {{consisted}} of Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Emden, Nürnberg, and Leipzig. At the time, Nürnberg was {{returning from the}} west coast of the United States, where Leipzig had just replaced her, and Emden was still in Tsingtao. On 6 August 1914, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, the supply ship Titania, and the Japanese collier Fukoku Maru were still in Ponape. Von Spee had issued orders to recall the light cruisers, which had been dispersed on cruises around the Pacific. Nürnberg joined von Spee that day, after which Spee moved his ships to Pagan Island in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands,</b> a German possession in the central Pacific.|$|E

5|$|By September15, shelters {{were opened}} {{throughout}} Tinian and Saipan at local schools, most schools and all governmental buildings {{were closed and}} residents rushed to board up their homes. The American Red Cross had also mobilized on the islands by this time. Some private schools were open during the morning but let out early to allow students {{to return to their}} families before the typhoon's arrival. On Saipan, 179 residents sought refuge in shelters by the afternoon of September15, by which time heavy rain had begun falling. Only one flight was delayed by the typhoon across all the islands. The youth basketball league in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands</b> canceled their games for the time Choi-wan passed through the islands. At the height of the storm, a total of 270 residents sought refuge in shelters on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the cyclone, schools, businesses, and public transit were closed on Guam. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed approximately 15 representatives to the island to mitigate the response time {{in the wake of}} the storm. Eight schools were opened as shelters, and more than 1,000 residents sought refuge during the height of the storm. Additional shelters were opened on the islands of Rota, Tinian, and Saipan in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands</b> (CNMI), and nearly 200 people sought cover there. Airports and seaports between the three islands were shut down, causing flights to be canceled. Earlier in 2015, the Guam Weather Forecast Office created a Facebook page to help inform residents about typhoons; during Dolphin, the page received over 425,000views.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1997, President Bill Clinton {{declared}} Guam {{a federal}} disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance. One week later, a disaster declaration was ordered for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands.</b> Ultimately, FEMA received 14,770Individual Assistance Applications from residents on Guam. In turn, FEMA provided the residents with over $27million in assistance (1997USD, $39million 2015USD). The entire island of Guam was left without power after Paka. Water and sewage systems on Guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon. With {{the usage of}} power generators, most areas of the island had water pumping capabilities {{within a few days}} after the typhoon. The Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport was partially reopened to daytime flights a day after the typhoon, and by a week after the passage of Paka the airport was fully re-opened.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye (Cleptornis marchei) is {{a species}} of bird in the white-eye family Zosteropidae. It is the only species within the genus Cleptornis. The golden white-eye was once {{considered}} to be a honeyeater in the family Meliphagidae and although it is now known to be a white-eye, its position within that family is still uncertain. The species is restricted to the islands of Saipan and Aguijan in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands,</b> where it is sympatric (shares its range) and competes with the related bridled white-eye. The golden white-eye has golden plumage and a pale eye-ring. It feeds on insects, fruit, and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups. The bird is monogamous and lays two eggs in a small cup nest.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gordon, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Goring, was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage and loss {{of life in the}} Philippines and Southern China in July 1989. Originating from a single cumulonimbus cloud on July9, Gordon developed into a tropical depression near the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands</b> and quickly intensified as it tracked west-southwestward. On July13, the storm attained typhoon status and subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification. By July15, the storm attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). After striking the northern Philippines, Gordon moved through the South China Sea and slowly weakened. On July18, the storm made landfall in southern China and was last noted the following day as it dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Helen was {{the most}} {{destructive}} tropical cyclone to strike Japan during the 1972 Pacific typhoon season. Originating from a tropical disturbance on September11 near the <b>Northern</b> <b>Mariana</b> <b>Islands,</b> Helen gradually intensified as it moved northwestward. By September14, it reached typhoon strength and soon turned northeast towards Japan. Accelerating due to a trough over the East China Sea, Helen rapidly approached the country and made landfall near Cape Kushimoto as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, a weakened Helen emerged into the Sea of Japan. After merging with an upper-level low, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19 and was last noted two days later after moving through southern Hokkaido.|$|E
