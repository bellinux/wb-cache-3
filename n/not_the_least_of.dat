There were numerous difficulties to overcome, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was devising a means of detonating the lenses with the required speed. Robert F. Christy's solid core design was chosen as the most likely design to succeed.|$|E
5|$|These {{expenses}} {{were not}} the sole cause of the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which Kalākaua was forced to sign, but representative of a pattern of excessive spending and grand schemes, under the helm of Walter Murray Gibson, that did lead to it. Gibson was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs for two non-consecutive terms, on May 20, 1882, and again on October 13, 1886. He became Minister of the Interior and Prime Minister of Hawaii on June 30, 1886. Gibson encouraged and approved the King's excessive expenditures, and {{is thought to have}} been the driving force behind some of them, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was the $100,000 purchase of a state steamboat for travel to the Samoan Islands as part of Kalākaua's plan to form a Polynesian Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and {{has been used to}} show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began the}} {{following}} April, with Kurosawa in high spirits. Shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> {{which was the}} firing of the original lead actor, Shintaro Katsu—creator of the very popular Zatoichi character—due to an incident in which the actor insisted, against the director's wishes, on videotaping his own performance. (He was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first of two consecutive leading roles in a Kurosawa movie.) The film was completed {{only a few weeks}} behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980. It quickly became a massive hit in Japan. The film was also a critical and box office success abroad, winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May, though some critics, then and now, have faulted the film for its alleged coldness. Kurosawa spent {{much of the rest of}} the year in Europe and America promoting Kagemusha, collecting awards and accolades, and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as storyboards for the film.|$|E

Speculation was that management was unhappy with how much they were paying him, and were trying to run him out of town. While not public, there was a series of disturbing occurrences behind the scenes that reinforce that speculation.|$|E

25|$|Piezoelectric {{speakers}} {{can have}} extended high frequency output, {{and this is}} useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, sonar applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of underwater microphones).

25|$|After {{the release}} of Wintersun, the band found {{permanent}} members to perform shows and promote the album, although a keyboardist would never be found. In 2006, Wintersun began work on their second and third albums, Time I and Time II, which were initially intended to be released as a single album. Recording began in May of that year, but the albums would be the recipient of years-long delays for a multitude of reasons, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was the complexity of each song's mix.|$|E
25|$|The drummers and {{the rhythms}} they played served as accompaniment for dance bands, which played ragtime and various dances, with jazz coming later. It was common in these bands {{to have two}} drummers, one playing snare drum, the other bass. Eventually, however, due to various factors (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which being the {{financial}} motivation), the number of drummers was reduced to one, and this created {{the need for a}} percussionist to play multiple instruments, hence the drum set. The first drum sets also began with military drums, though various other accessories were added later {{in order to create a}} larger range of sounds, and also for novelty appeal.|$|E

25|$|The Ms. Ludwig XV 13, also titled Fior di Battaglia, is {{currently}} in the holdings of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, CA. Its prologue, format, illustrations, and text are all {{very similar to the}} Ms. M.383, though it's largely free of silver enamel. The text takes the form of descriptive paragraphs set in poor Italian verse, which are nevertheless fairly clear and informative. Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which is the vastly different order of the information. This is the longest and most comprehensive of the four manuscripts of Fior di Battaglia. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Getty version'.|$|E
25|$|In November 1657 Henry {{himself was}} made lord-deputy; but before {{this time he}} had refused a gift of {{property}} worth £1500 a year, basing his refusal {{on the grounds of}} the poverty of the country, a poverty which was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> his troubles. In 1657 he advised his father not to accept the office of king, although in 1654 he had supported a motion to this effect; and after the dissolution of Cromwell's second parliament in February 1658 he showed his anxiety that the protector should act in a moderate and constitutional manner. After Oliver's death Henry hailed with delight the succession of his brother Richard to the office of protector, but although he was now appointed lieutenant and governor-general of Ireland, it was only with great reluctance that he remained in that country.|$|E
25|$|On {{his arrival}} in Sydney, Blacket possessed a small library of {{architectural}} books, and he kept abreast of the latest trends by subscribing to journals. Although {{there were a number}} of buildings with Gothic details in the colony at the time, in particular the existing south transept of the new cathedral, these structures had strongly Classical elements beneath their medieval detailing. Blacket was the first architect in Australia who truly understood the principles of the Gothic style and who could design a church that would satisfy the august societies of Oxford and Cambridge. Since it was the wish of so many colonials, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> whom was the Bishop, to assuage their homesickness by at least attending a church that reminded them of one in Cornwall, Yorkshire or East Anglia, Edmund Blacket was to become a very popular man.|$|E

25|$|Godwin {{augmented}} {{the influence}} of Political Justice {{with the publication of}} a novel that proved equally popular, Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams. This {{tells the story of a}} servant who finds out a dark secret about Falkland, his aristocratic master, and is forced to flee because of his knowledge. Caleb Williams is essentially the first thriller: Godwin wryly remarked that some readers were consuming in a night what took him over a year to write. <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> its merits is a portrait of the justice system of England and Wales at the time and a prescient picture of domestic espionage. His literary method, as he described it in the introduction to the novel, also proved influential: Godwin began with the conclusion of Caleb being chased through Britain, and developed the plot backwards. Dickens and Poe both commented on Godwin's ingenuity in doing this.|$|E
25|$|Wager of law was a {{possible}} defense, {{at least in}} certain cases of detinue sur trover. Wager of law was a complicated medieval legal procedure which was used when other forms of proof were lacking. It involved the bringing forth of witnesses who would swear under oath, to God that the facts alleged in the writ or bill of complaint were true. Lacking such witnesses, the action would fail. This was locked into the old methods of proof, which were in turn, tied to the old forms of action. The records show a certain hardening of the courts toward this defense in the mid-fourteenth century. Wager of law was not used in debt on a covenant. Wager of law was abolished by statute in 1833. Prosser describes trover and wager of law in this way: Trover, as it developed, had certain definite procedural advantages over the older forms of action, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> which was that it avoided wager of law, a form of licensed perjury which made detinue singularly unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one single time. The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times {{during the course of}} the last two centuries, showing that for a long time the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time necessary for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could not be said that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern ideas as to efficient management. The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the Church had been reformed by the Constitution Sapienti Consilio, of 29 June 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood in the way of a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that Pius X was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.|$|E
