5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>normal</b> <b>flight</b> controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of <b>normal</b> <b>flight,</b> tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to <b>normal</b> <b>flight</b> controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFlight data {{recorded}} by Quick Access Recorder (QAR) is gradually {{used to analyze}} pilot's operations quality, especially for the QAR exceedances. In this paper, we use the values of flight parameters to construct the state-space of pilots’ operations. A flight {{is seen as a}} point in it. Basing on the distributions of <b>normal</b> <b>flights</b> and flights triggering an exceedance, risk analysis is carried out to divide this state-space into dangerous and safety regions. A multi-objective programming is established to analyze the safety risk in pilot's operations and we use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the boundaries of regions-of-interest. The feasibility of this method is validated through experiments with real flight data...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in <b>normal</b> <b>flight,</b> commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1964, the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron (TES) {{was formed}} at RAF West Raynham, staffed by a diverse mix of {{military}} test pilots from Britain, the United States and West Germany. The personnel comprising the squadron were highly experienced pilots; prior to flying the Kestrel, each received a week's ground training at Bristol's in-house facility and a week's ground instruction at Dunsford {{prior to a}} three-hour flight conversion instructed by Bill Bedford. The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the suitability of V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop <b>normal</b> <b>flight</b> operating procedures, perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night flight operations, and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's flight envelope.|$|E

A fourth searchlight was mounted to the starboard side of the carrier’s island on a projecting sponson.|$|E
25|$|The E.1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, thick section, constant chord wings of quite high aspect ratio (8.45). The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In <b>normal</b> <b>flight</b> the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.|$|E
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in <b>normal</b> <b>flight</b> at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{passenger}} airliner {{is essentially}} a flying robot, with two humans to manage it. The autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, <b>normal</b> <b>flight,</b> and even landing. Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions. Some can even fire on targets under command. UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, {{without the need for}} a command from a human. Other flying robots include cruise missiles, the Entomopter, and the Epson micro helicopter robot. Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, propelled by paddles, and guided by sonar.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary {{actuating}} devices during <b>normal</b> <b>flight</b> mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E

50|$|The SIM-XI was a {{monoplane}} with {{a single}} carbureted 150 hp Siemens (Bram) Sh14a, engine. The plane was of mostly wooden structure, with an elliptical cross-section of fuselage made entirely of wood covered with plywood, and wooddn wings covered with cloth, with rounded ends. On each side, the wings were supported {{by a pair of}} inclined struts attached to the fuselage. The aircraft had two fuel tanks, one located at the junction of the wings, the other in the fuselage. The fuselage tank was filled for aerobatics, and the wing tank was filled for <b>normal</b> <b>flights.</b> Both tanks were filled during flights when it was needed to travel greater distances. The landing gear was fixed, completely made of steel tubes, which were strong enough for the plane to be able to land on rugged terrain.|$|R

50|$|A perhaps unusual {{use of a}} pair of {{motorcycle}} chains is in the Harrier Jump Jet, where a {{chain drive}} from an air motor is used to rotate the movable engine nozzles, allowing them to be pointed downwards for hovering flight, or to the rear for <b>normal</b> forward <b>flight,</b> a system known as Thrust vectoring.|$|R
500|$|When the {{aircraft}} was reasonably {{close to the}} target, a light on the contact altimeter came on to indicate the bomb-release point, usually at a minimum height of [...] The pilot released the bomb and initiated the automatic pull-out mechanism by depressing a knob on the control column. An elongated U-shaped crutch located under the fuselage swung the bomb {{out of the way}} of the propeller, and {{the aircraft}} automatically began a 6 g pullout. Once the nose was above the horizon, dive brakes were retracted, the throttle was opened, and the propeller was set to climb. The pilot regained control and resumed <b>normal</b> <b>flight.</b> The coolant flaps had to be reopened quickly to prevent overheating. The automatic pull-out was not liked by all pilots. Helmut Mahlke later said that he and his unit disconnected the system because it allowed the enemy to predict the Ju 87's recovery pattern and height, making it easier for ground defences to hit an aircraft.|$|E
