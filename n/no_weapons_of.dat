25|$|Although Talent {{was not in}} Congress at {{the time}} of the 2002 vote authorizing the war in Iraq, he stated in October 2006 that he would have voted for the war knowing that Iraq had <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction. Talent did not support a {{timetable}} for troop withdrawal from Iraq until American troops are able to train up an Iraqi army capable of maintaining security within the country.|$|E

"She deplored {{the terror}} inflicted by our smart bombs on {{missions}} way afar[...] [...] [...] We know {{now there were}} <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction over there. But Coretta knew, and we knew, that there are weapons of misdirection right down here. Millions without health insurance. Poverty abounds. For war, billions more, but no more for the poor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Butler, Scott Ritter's boss {{under the}} United Nations in Iraq, said that Ritter [...] "wasn't prescient" [...] in his {{predictions}} about WMDs, saying, [...] "When {{he was the}} 'Alpha Dog' inspector, then by God, there were more weapons there, {{and we had to}} go find themâ€”a contention for which he had inadequate evidence. When he became a peacenik, then it was all complete B.S., start to finish, and there were <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction. And that also was a contention for which he had inadequate evidence." ...|$|E

60|$|One {{party of}} Turks at last made {{a rush to}} the hut where Lancey sat with the old woman. There was <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> any sort in the hut, and as Lancey's arms {{had been taken from}} him when he was captured, he deemed it the wisest policy to sit still.|$|R
60|$|If the puma was undecided, {{so was the}} youth. If {{he leaped}} to the ground again he was certain the beast would follow him, {{and he had no}} desire to face the painter at such close quarters, {{especially}} as he had <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> any kind with him, unless the jack-knife in his pocket might be brought into play.|$|R
2500|$|The Iraq war was {{expensive}} {{and continues to}} be a severe drain on U.S. finances. Bacevich thinks the U.S. has a tendency to resort to military means to try to solve diplomatic problems. The U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was a costly, decade-long military engagement which ended in a military victory but strategic defeat due to the public's loss of support for the war, {{due in large part to}} media sensation. The dollar cost was $111 billion, or $698 billion in 2009 dollars. Similarly, the second Iraq war was viewed by many [...] as being a mistake, since there were <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction found, the war ended in December 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2003, the U.S. invades Iraq {{and the war}} {{appears to}} be a success, and Bush gives his [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech on an {{aircraft}} carrier. When it becomes clear that there are <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction within Iraq, Bush learns that the responsibility for finding them had been relegated far down the chain of command. Bush discovers that Saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that Bush was bluffing. Bush is asked in a White House press conference what mistakes he made as President, a question that leaves him flustered and speechless. That night, Bush has a nightmare in which his father accuses him of ruining his family's legacy, which the elder Bush claims was intended for Jeb. Bush dreams of himself [...] playing center field at a baseball game. Bush attempts to catch a pop fly, but it disappears.|$|E
2500|$|Testifying {{before the}} Iraq Inquiry on 29 January 2010, Blair said Saddam was a [...] "monster and I believe he {{threatened}} {{not just the}} region but the world." [...] Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had [...] "changed dramatically" [...] after the 11 September attacks. Blair denied {{that he would have}} supported the invasion of Iraq even if he had thought Saddam had <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction. He said he believed the world was safer {{as a result of the}} invasion. He said there was [...] "no real difference between wanting regime change and wanting Iraq to disarm: regime change was US policy because Iraq was in breach of its UN obligations." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Blair apologised for his [...] "mistakes" [...] over Iraq War and admitted there were [...] "elements of truth" [...] to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS. The Chilcot Inquiry report of 2016 gave a damning assessment of Blair's role in the Iraq War, though the former prime minister again refused to apologise for his decision to back the US-led invasion.|$|E
60|$|The doctor's son was {{the only}} person capable, just then, of using a gun, and having <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> his own he grabbed Snap's and blazed away. Whether he hit a snake or not he could not tell. There was a hissing and {{rustling}} among the torn away vines, and when the smoke of the discharge cleared away the snakes were no longer to be seen.|$|R
6000|$|Somewhere above me, deep in {{the tangle}} of the summer wilderness, Mooween stood {{watching}} his back track, eyes, ears, and nose alert to discover what the creature was who dared frighten {{him out of his}} noonday bath. It would be senseless to attempt to surprise him now; besides, I had <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> any kind.--"To-morrow, about this time, I shall be coming back; then look out, Mooween," [...] I thought as I marked the place and stole away to my canoe.|$|R
60|$|Another time I {{was perched}} up in a lodged tree, some twenty {{feet from the}} ground, {{watching}} a big bait of fish which I had put in an open spot for anything that might choose {{to come and get}} it. I was hoping for a bear, and so climbed above the ground that he might not get my scent should he come from leeward. It was early autumn, and my intentions were wholly peaceable. I had <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> any kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the idea}} is rather creepy; but {{they say that the}} Ashantis always shoot high--the effect of the {{enormous}} charges they put into their muskets--so that the harm done bears no proportion, whatever, to the noise. I expect our Maxims will come in very useful for clearing out the bush; and I doubt if the Ashantis will be able to stand for a moment, against our bayonets, as they have <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> the sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He lost {{patience}} altogether at this, an' sprang {{at me like}} a tiger. But I {{was ready}} for him. We had a regular set-to then an' there. By good luck there was <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> any kind in the room, not even a table knife, for I'd had to pawn a'most everything to pay my rent, and the clasp-knife I'd eat my breakfast with was in my pocket. But we was both handy with our fists. We kep' at it for about half an hour. Smashed all the furniture, an' would have smashed the winders too, {{but there was only}} one, an' it was a skylight. In the middle of it the door was burst open, an' in rushed half a dozen bobbies, who {{put a stop to it}} at once.|$|E
60|$|Yet another picture. Again I beheld {{the banks}} of Sihor; but on them fair cities bloomed like flowers. In and out their gates went men and women, passing to and fro from wide, well-tilled lands. But I saw no guards or armies, and <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> war. All was wisdom, prosperity, and peace. And while I wondered, a glorious Figure, clad in raiment that shone as flame, came from the gates of a shrine, {{and the sound of}} music went before and {{followed}} after him. He mounted an ivory throne which was set in a market-place facing the water: and as the sun sank called in all the multitudes to prayer. With one voice they prayed, bending in adoration. And I understood that herein was shown the reign of the Gods on earth, which was long before the days of Menes.|$|E
60|$|And {{the secret}} of this was that Susy Blake possessed much of an {{unconscious}} influence called loving-kindness. <b>No</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> the spiritual armoury is equal to this. In {{the hands of a}} man it is tremendous. In those of a pretty girl it is irresistible. By means of it she brought the fiercest little arabs of the slums to listen to the story of Jesus and His love. She afterwards asked God, the Holy Spirit, to water the good seed sown, and the result was success.|$|R
5000|$|A man who {{supposedly}} made a {{deal with}} God, the real deal, the being who said [...] "let there be light" [...] and so there was light. As long as he walks the path <b>of</b> God then <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> the earth, or men could hurt him. But if he loses his faith for even a moment he will lose his powers and become only a man. He {{is one of the most}} powerful major players in the Nightside and is the only being who has come close to killing Razor Eddie.|$|R

60|$|If {{there were}} more of faith than of {{rational}} conclusion in this opinion of the old Puritan, there was no external evidence to contradict it. While {{the examination of the}} boy {{was going on in the}} dwelling, a keen scrutiny had taken place in the out-buildings, and in the adjacent fields. Those engaged in this duty soon returned, to say that not the smallest trace of an ambush was visible about the place; and as the captive himself had <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> hostility, even Ruth began to hope that the mysterious conceptions of her father on the subject were not entirely delusive. The captive was now fed, and old Mark was on the point of making a proper beginning in the task he had so gladly assumed, by an up-offering of thanks, when Whittal Ring broke rudely into the room, and disturbed the solemnity of his preparations, by a sudden and boisterous outcry.|$|E
6000|$|The costume {{of these}} wanderers, like their small possessions, was varied. All wore white duck {{trousers}} and blue Guernsey or cotton shirts with sou'-westers or straw hats, but the coats and cravats differed. Larry wore a rough pilot-cloth coat, and, being eccentric on the point, a scarlet cotton neckerchief. Old Peter wore a blue jacket {{with a black}} tie, loosely fastened, sailor fashion, round his exposed throat. Muggins wore the dirty canvas jacket {{in which he had}} been engaged in scraping down the masts of the Rover when he left her. Will Osten happened to have on a dark blue cloth shooting-coat and a white straw hat, which was fortunate, for, being in reality the leader of the party, it was well that his costume should accord with that responsible and dignified position. They had <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> any kind, so their first care was to supply themselves with stout cudgels, which each cut in proportion to his notions of the uses and capacities of such implements--that of Larry O'Hale being, of course, a genuine shillelah, while the weapon cut by Muggins was a close imitation of the club of Hercules, or of that used by the giant who was acquainted with the celebrated giant-killer named Jack! ...|$|E
60|$|And I may as {{well here}} declare, also, {{that there could be}} no more virtuous woman than the General's wife. Her {{marriage}} vow was to her paramount to all other vows and bonds whatever. The General's honour was quite safe when he sent her off to Rome by herself; and he no doubt knew that it was so. Illi robur et aes triplex, of which I believe <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> any assailant could get the better. But, nevertheless, we used to fancy that she had no repugnance to impropriety in other women,--to what the world generally calls impropriety. Invincibly attached herself to the marriage tie, she would constantly speak of it as by no means necessarily binding on others; and, virtuous herself as any griffin of propriety, she constantly patronised, at any rate, the theory of infidelity in her neighbours. She was very eager in denouncing the prejudices of the English world, declaring that she had found existence among them to be no longer possible for herself. She was hot against the stern unforgiveness of British matrons, and equally eager in reprobating the stiff conventionalities of a religion in which she said that none of its votaries had faith, though they all allowed themselves to be enslaved.|$|E
6000|$|... "But--but <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> short <b>of</b> {{a cannon}} will carry so far--at least with accuracy," [...] exclaimed Lawrence in surprise, {{for at the}} time of which we write breech-loaders and the {{long-range}} <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> precision had not been introduced in those regions. Indeed, the armies of South America, and of Europe also, still slew each other with the familiar Brown Bess and the clumsy flint-lock at that time.|$|R

60|$|Among {{the first}} to leave the church was the pastor. The thought of his child having been left in the house unprotected, filled him with an agony of fear. He sought <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> war, but darted unarmed {{straight}} into {{the midst of the}} savage host that stood between him and the object of his affection. His rush was so impetuous, that he fairly overturned several of his opponents by dashing against them. The numbers that surrounded him, however, soon arrested his progress; but he had pressed so close in amongst them, that they were actually too closely packed, for a few seconds, {{to be able to use}} their heavy clubs and long spears with effect.|$|R

25|$|Blix's {{statements}} about the Iraq WMD program came to contradict {{the claims of the}} George W.

In an interview on BBC 1 on 8 February 2004, Blix accused the US and British governments of dramatizing the threat <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction in Iraq, in order to strengthen the case for the 2003 war against the government of Saddam Hussein. Ultimately, <b>no</b> stockpiles <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction were ever found.|$|R
5000|$|Hassan Mohammed Amin was an Iraqi general under Saddam Hussein's government.

60|$|As I slowly {{recalled}} my collegiate {{studies and}} paleontological readings in Bowen's textbooks, I realized that I had looked upon {{nothing less than}} a diplodocus of the Upper Jurassic; but how infinitely different was the true, live thing from the crude restorations of Hatcher and Holland! I had had the idea that the diplodocus was a land-animal, but evidently it is partially amphibious. I have seen several since my first encounter, and in each case the creature took to the sea for concealment {{as soon as it was}} disturbed. With the exception of its gigantic tail, it has <b>no</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> defense; but with this appendage it can lash so terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cave-bear, stunned and broken.
