25|$|Hydrogen sulfide– Often {{produced}} by yeast during fermentation {{because of a}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the must. This {{can be done by}} a reduction of sulfates or sulfites available in the must or by the decomposition of dead yeast cells by other yeast that releases sulfur-containing amino acids that are further broken down by the yeast. The latter often happens with wines that sit in contact with their lees {{for long periods of time}} between rackings. In the presence of alcohol, hydrogen sulfide can react with ethanol to form ethyl mercaptans and disulfides that contribute to off aromas and wine faults. Some commercial yeast strains, such as Montrachet 522 are known to produce higher levels of hydrogen sulfides than other strains, particularly if the must has some nutrient deficiencies.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deficiencies</b> {{in plants}} is general {{chlorosis}} of the leaves, {{which is when}} leaves turn pale green, and leaves cup upwards quite severely in deficient plants. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>deficiencies</b> also cause leaves to remain small, and drop prematurely, resulting in less photosynthesis occurring in the plant, and fewer, smaller tubers can form for harvest. Research done by Yara International has shown {{that there is a}} direct correlation between tuber size and yield, and the amount of plant-available nitrogen in the soil. This makes it crucial that the fields have enough nitrogen in the soil to grow a prosperous crop. However, excess nitrogen in the soil can also be harmful to potato production, influencing how well the roots are able to develop, and delays can occur in tuber initiation during the tuberization stage of potato growth.|$|R

Although phosphorus control has frequently been implemented to reduce eutrophication, several lines of evidence indicate that nitrogen {{also needs to}} be controlled in some situations. Whole-lake experiments, and a correlation analysis of N, P, and chlorophyll in 1268 US lakes all indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus together produce larger algal blooms than do addition of each nutrient alone. Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria may alleviate <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in some cases, but ecological constraints on this process, coupled with high levels of denitrification, can lead to co-limitation by both nutrients. Although a phosphorus-only explanation for algal blooms has persisted for decades, this misinterpretation has impeded efforts to understand how nitrogen and phosphorus can both influence algal communities. Nutrient controls at watershed scales are further complicated because controlling only one nutrient in upstream areas results in export of the other damaging nutrient downstream to coastal areas.

In this study, the effect of ammonium supplementation of a synthetic medium over a wide range of nitrogen values on the production of volatile and non-volatile compounds by two high-nitrogen-demand wine fermentation strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined. To facilitate this investigation, a simplified chemically defined medium that resembles the nutrient composition of grape juice was used. Analysis of variance revealed that ammonium supplementation had significant effects on the concentration of residual sugar, L-malic acid, acetic acid and glycerol but not the ethanol concentration. While choice of yeast strain significantly affected half of the aroma compounds measured, nitrogen concentrations affected 23 compounds, including medium-chain alcohols and fatty acids and their esters.

40|$|Background: An {{adaptive}} mechanism in plant roots is initiated {{in the event}} of <b>nitrogen</b> and potassium <b>deficiency,</b> and it facilitates the active uptake of these elements in order to ensure plant growth and survival in stress conditions. Signaling and transduction of signals in response to changing nitrogen and potassium concentrations is a complex process, affected by interactions between various gene expression products, and often subjected to modifications. Results: In order to identify genotypic differences between phenotypes of two populations of recombinant inbred rye lines (153 / 79 - 1 x Ot 1 - 3 and Ot 0 - 6 x Ot 1 - 3) in response to nutrition stress caused by <b>nitrogen</b> and potassium <b>deficiency</b> at the seedling stage, bulk segregant analysis was utilized. Identification of genotypic differences between and within pooled DNA samples involved 424 RAPD, 120 ISSR primers and 50 combinations of R-ISSR. Identified markers were sequenced and converted to SCAR, attributing to them unique ESTs annotations, and chromosomal ones to selected localizations. Significant relationships with the examined trait were described for nine and eight RAPD markers, four and five ISSR, one and three R-ISSR markers for population 153 / 79 - 1 x Ot 1 - 3 and Ot 0 - 6 x Ot 1 - 3, respectively. Sequences identified for the rye genome were characterized by a uniqueness and a similarity to the sequence of aquaporin PIP 1, a gene encoding protein related to the function of the transcription factor in plant response to iron deficiency and the putative ethylene-responsive transcription factor, cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HvHKT 1 transporter, as well as HCBT proteins.

40|$|Abstract: The {{flexible}} {{regulation of}} feeding behaviour and nutrient metabolism {{is a prerequisite}} for consumers to grow and survive under variable food conditions. Thus, it is essential to understand the ecological trade-offs that restrict regulatory mechanisms in consumers to evaluate the consequences of nutrient limitations for trophic interactions. Here, we assessed behavioural and physiological adjustments to nutrient deficiencies in copepods and examined whether energy limitation, food digestibility or co-limitation with a second nutrient restricted compensatory mechanisms. A combination of 13 C-labelling and compound-specific stable isotope measurements revealed that copepods compensated <b>nitrogen</b> <b>deficiencies</b> by raising retention efficiencies of amino acids (AA). The costs of higher retention efficiencies were reflected in the doubling of structural fatty acids (FA), probably required for morphological adaptations of the gut. A depletion of highly unsaturated FA in storage lipids and their selective retention suggested that these FA became co-limiting and restricted a further increase in AA retention efficiencies. Copepods feeding on phosphorus-limited algae showed a marked increase in ingestion rates but were not fully able to compensate dietary deficiencies. The increase in ingestion rates was thereby not restricted by higher foraging costs because energy storage in copepods increased. Instead, thicker cell walls of nutrient-limited algae indicated that algal digestion resistance restricted the extent of surplus feeding. The strongly nutrient-specific response of copepods had large implications for recycling rates, growth efficiencies and the potential top-down control at the plant–animal interface. Compensatory mechanisms to mitigate nutrient deficiencies are therefore an essential aspect of trophic interactions and have the potential to alter the structure of food web...|$|R
