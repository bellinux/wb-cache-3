25|$|The Biography of Early Australia dismisses Macarthur's {{complaints}} as {{ridiculous and}} quotes Evatt {{as saying that}} legally Macarthur was guilty of two out of the three charges brought against him including sedition. Both consider that Bligh was wholly justified in his actions {{because he was the}} legitimate authority. However, imprisoning people and threatening to do the same to the court when they failed to yield to the will of said authority would seem to be legally problematic. Duffy states that had Johnston arrived when summoned on 25 January the Rum Rebellion probably would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

50|$|The nation's {{recognition}} of the Bears' accomplishment was overshadowed by STS 51-L two days later, an event which caused the cancellation of the Bears' post-Super Bowl White House visit. Jim McMahon drew controversy after Super Bowl XXXI by wearing a Bears jersey to the Green Bay Packers' visit following their championship, owing to his first official visit <b>never</b> <b>having</b> <b>happened</b> at the time.

25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E

He felt that the Wesley storyline was clichéd, and that having two {{unconnected}} storylines would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in The Original Series. Handlen gave the episode a grade of C.|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{during the}} {{remainder}} of the nineteenth century, Metternich was heavily criticised, decried as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from [...] "developing along normal liberal and constitutional lines". Had Metternich not stood in the way of [...] "progress", Austria might have reformed, dealt better with its problems of nationality, and the First World War might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> Instead, Metternich chose to fight an overwhelmingly fruitless war against the forces of liberalism and nationalism. Heavy censorship was just one of a range of repressive instruments of state available to him that also included a large spy network. Metternich opposed electoral reform, criticising Britain’s 1832 Reform Bill. In short, he locked himself into an embittered battle against [...] "the prevailing mood of his age".|$|E
50|$|When Charles Edward Stuart {{landed in}} Scotland in August 1745 he {{was met by}} the Lochiel, 19th Clan Chief, who pledged his Clan's full support. The Jacobite rising of 1745 might <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> if Lochiel <b>had</b> not come out with his clan. The Clan Cameron fought as Jacobites at the Battle of Prestonpans (1745), Battle of Falkirk (1746), and on the {{frontline}} at the Battle of Culloden (6 April 1746). After the Battle of Culloden, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, also known as Gentle Lochiel, took refuge in France, where he died in October 1748.|$|R

The {{events leading up to}} and of [...] "The Empty House" [...] are told from Moran's point of view.

(See: K Foundation Burn a Million Quid). In an interview with Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo, Gimpo admitted to harbouring guilt about the million pounds burning; that if he'd burnt Whiteread's £40,000 the million pounds burning would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> [...] "I should have burnt it. I had petrol all over the £40,000... We were due to wait until eleven o'clock until she came out, but {{we were told to}} wait another two minutes... Rachel Whiteread came running out. She just grabbed the money and dragged it over the fence." [...] Carl Freedman also wished they'd burnt Whiteread's money. [...] "It would have been brilliant....

You see when {{he had found the}} heads of those trout on the bank he knew right away that some one else had been fishing, and that was why he couldn't catch any; but it didn't seem possible that little Billy Mink could have eaten all those trout, and Farmer Brown's boy didn't once think of Little Joe Otter, and so he was very, very much puzzled.|$|R

He has no concept of innocent until proved guilty and thinks it's acceptable to turn up to a swingers' evening with a prostitute he's just busted. He's racist, disablist and homophobic, and he calls his only female detective Flash Knickers. (And he means it as a compliment.)

[...] While complimenting Moore's [...] "elegant" [...] poetry, Bunting [...] "saw with pain, and still deplores the fact, that in these new Irish melodies, the work of the poet was accounted of so paramount an interest, that the proper order of song writing was in many instances inverted, and, instead of the words being adapted to the tune, the tune was too often adapted to the words, a solecism which could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had the reputation of the writer not been so great as at once to carry the tunes he deigned to make use of altogether out of their old sphere among the simple and tradition – loving people of the country – with whom, in truth, many of the new melodies, to this day, are hardly suspected to be themselves." ...|$|E
