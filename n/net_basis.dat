2500|$|As to the {{financial}} cost of participation, fraternity leaders note {{that the vast majority}} of Greek students work their way through school. In fact, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life claims that the average cost burden for fraternity chapter membership adds 3% to a student budget, and may indeed be less costly on a <b>net</b> <b>basis</b> when factoring reduced summer rents and lower live-in costs versus dorms and private apartments. A 2016 Interfraternity Council study noted that the average cost of living in a fraternity is 35% lower than the average cost of an on-campus apartment, and 19% lower than the average dorm. [...] Services will vary, and some fraternities or sororities may be more expensive than others, as determined by the students themselves. Services offered will vary by chapter. Additional scholarship funding is often available, sometimes covering far more than the cost of membership. Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average quality and quantity of near-campus housing and has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from [...] "in line with" [...] or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.|$|E

On each day participants will very likely {{have more than one}} trade to settle—in practice, major banks will have hundreds or thousands of trades each day. Each day prior to settlement, CLS calculates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral <b>netted</b> <b>basis.</b> The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all payment instructions is reduced, allowing each Settlement Member to transfer only the net amount of its payment obligations in each currency, rather than the total amount of each trade to be settled.

The rapid internationalisation of production {{in the last two}} decades has meant that gross trade flows are increasingly unrepresentative of the value added flows. This fact has important implications for the estimation of the gravity equation. We present empirical evidence that the standard gravity equation performs poorly by some measures when it is applied to bilateral flows where parts and components trade is important. We also provide a simple theoretical foundation for a modified gravity equation that is suited to explaining trade where international supply chains are important. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the overall {{financial}} performance and value implications of recent mergers and acquisitions in the Greek banking system. The operating performance (OP) methodology is based on accounting data and observes the pre- and post-merger financial performance of banks. The event study approach utilizes stock returns of acquiring and target banks around the announcement date of the merger to determine the presence of abnormal returns. Consistent with the international literature, OP results do not provide much evidence of performance gains resulting from bank mergers. Nevertheless, merged banks seem to outperform the group of non-merging banks. The event study approach indicates that mergers create value on a <b>net</b> aggregate <b>basis...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The white-headed {{capuchin}} {{is regarded}} as [...] "least concern" [...] from a conservation standpoint by IUCN. However, its numbers {{are affected by the}} fact that it is sometimes captured for the pet trade. [...] Its status can also be harmed by deforestation.

[...] The white-headed capuchin can adapt to forest fragmentation better than other species due to its ability to live in a wide variety of forest types and exploit a wide variety of food sources. [...] The white-headed capuchin is important to its ecosystems as a seed and pollen disperser. [...] It also impacts the ecosystem by eating insects that act as pests to certain trees, by pruning certain trees, such as Gustavia superba and Bursera simaruba, causing them generate more branches and possibly additional fruit, and by accelerating germination of certain seeds when they pass through the capuchin's digestive tract. [...] In addition, the white-headed capuchin sometimes kills Acacia collinsii plants when it rips through the plant's branches to get to resident ant colonies.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2016, The New York Times {{published}} {{some tax}} documents from 1995. These documents indicate that Trump might have evaded paying taxes on {{as much as}} 916 million dollars in income at one time. Trump likely gave some of his creditors shares of his failing businesses to avoid taxes on {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars he was given in debt relief, which is illegal. Legal scholar Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California believes Trump forged tax documents. Trump claimed on his tax returns that he lost money, but did not recognize it in the form of canceled debts. He likely avoided paying 425 million dollars in taxes, says Steven M. Rosenthal, an attorney at the Tax Policy Center. Rosenthal claims he [...] "borrowed other people's money and spent it in spectacular fashion." [...] Trump might have performed a stock-for-debt swap. This would have allowed Trump to avoid paying income taxes for at least 18 years. An audit of Trump's tax returns for 2002 through 2008 was [...] "closed administratively by agreement with the I.R.S. without assessment or payment, on a <b>net</b> <b>basis,</b> of any deficiency." [...] Tax attorneys believe the government may have reduced what Trump was able to claim as a loss without requiring him to pay any additional taxes. It is unknown whether the I.R.S. challenged Trump's use of the swaps because he has not released his tax returns. Trump's lawyers advised against Trump using the equity for debt swap, as they believed it to be potentially illegal.|$|E
5000|$|Keynes's {{followers}} {{assert that}} his predictions of disaster were borne {{out when the}} German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923, and again {{by the collapse of}} the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of the Second World War. However the historian Ruth Henig claims that [...] "most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out". Only a small fraction of reparations were ever paid. In fact, the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919-33, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so that, on a <b>net</b> <b>basis,</b> Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan. Schuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and actually supported the hyperinflation on political grounds. Nevertheless, The Economic Consequences of the Peace gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment - it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.|$|E

40|$|Should {{incurred}} {{claims and}} earned premiums {{used in the}} calculation of Medical Loss Ratio for rebate calculations be on a <b>net</b> of reinsurance <b>basis?</b> Proposed Resolution: Yes, incurred claims and earned premiums should be on a <b>net</b> of reinsurance <b>basis,</b> {{as reported in the}} Income Statement {{that is part of the}} quarterly financial statutory reports. For example, where a company has entered an assumption reinsurance transaction to transfer 100 % of the premiums and claims for certain policies to a second company, the second company should report the assumed premiums and claims as part of its MLR and rebate calculations. Exceptions: Incurred claims and earned premiums should be adjusted to remove the impact of any quota-share reinsurance that covers a percentage smaller than 100 % of the claims obligations, because quota-share reinsurance can be used to “game the system ” by blending a low MLR from one company with a high MLR from a second company in order to avoid paying rebates based on the low MLR. Neither assumed excess reinsurance sold to an insurer nor stop-loss insurance sold to a self-funded employee welfare plan should enter into the MLR calculation, to the extent that the claim threshold is high enough t...|$|R
