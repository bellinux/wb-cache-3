5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> evidence that prices were affected.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E

5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

25|$|Keshevan and Berrios {{were the}} first authors to {{identify}} classes of musical hallucinations. These classes consisted of hearing loss, coarse brain disease (i.e. tumors), epileptic disorder, stroke, and psychiatric disorder. Although <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> analyses were performed, the authors stated that deafness was the most strongly related factor in musical hallucinations {{and that there was}} a female predominance, which could entail a genetic component.|$|E

25|$|A 2004 {{study by}} the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) of attitudes among police {{officers}} in the Johannesburg area found that 87% of respondents believed that most undocumented immigrants in Johannesburg are involved in crime, despite there being <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> evidence to substantiate the perception. Such views combined with the vulnerability of illegal aliens led to abuse, including violence and extortion, some analysts argued.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon, like zolpidem, zopiclone, or eszopiclone, are all {{specific}} agonists at the benzodiazepine GABAA α1 sub-receptor site. It also modulates the GABAA sub-sites, α2 and α3, to {{a lesser}} degree. It has <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> significance as an anticonvulsant. However, as a pyrazolopyrimidine, zaleplon {{has served as a}} novel chemical platform from which new anxiolytics will hopefully arise. Much like zolpidem, as an imidazopyridine and also a full agonist at the GABAA α1 sub-receptor site, has been reviewed considerably with some novel contributions. See also: alpidem.|$|E
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>statistical</b> {{correlation}} {{has been}} done with population growth, though the latter has been cited generally in connection with library usage. Also {{there has been some}} records of membership numbers in and of themselves, as well as a proportion of the total population. So, for example, in 1971 there were 8,752 members of a borough population of 15,825. That this meant over half the population were members was duly noted. However, by 1992 the population had increased to 31,860, while membership had only risen to 13,162. By 2003 there were 150 new registrations a month.|$|E

25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} belief in the United States that red cars are stopped for {{speeding}} more often than other color cars. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not {{the color of their}} cars. The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed that the number of speeding tickets given to drivers of red cars was about the same as the proportion of red cars on the road in the community.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> {{evidence}} Admiral King {{stripped the}} Atlantic Fleet {{to fill the}} gaps in the Pacific nor is the evidence the US Navy had neglected the preparation for anti-submarine warfare or ignored the learning from WWI, the Neutrality Patrols or the early Battle of the Atlantic. The attack on Pearl Harbor caught the US Navy {{in the early stages}} of operationalization. One can praise the US Navy for its ability to implement convoys so quickly with a bevy of essentially “green” crews, new vessels and new aircraft coming “on line.” If the war had started six months later the Germans would have been facing a very different US Navy.|$|E

25|$|Pliego Carrasco {{criticizes the}} Alianza's filings {{by stating that}} they were based only on {{individual}} situations rather than a widespread study, that the information was based almost invariably on newspaper clippings, and that they only studied 26 districts. For his own study, Pliego Carrasco contrasted the growth in votes from the 2000 to the 2006 election for all parties. In all cases, the Alianza increased substantially more than the PAN, which even lost votes in the two categories of lowest marginalization. His conclusion {{is that there was}} no evidence that the PAN benefited from the expenditures. He found <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> correlation between expenditures and the winning candidate. He derived similar conclusions for the other four programs. His conclusion is that the vote distribution does not support the hypothesis that social programs were used wholesale to influence the vote.|$|E
25|$|According to {{systematic}} review, {{in heart}} failure with preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone {{did not improve}} patient outcomes. This {{is based on the}} TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the p-value of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had <b>no</b> <b>statistical</b> significance. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone. More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of canrenone (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from Russia lacked detectable residues of canrenone. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} TOPCAT trial results in Russia don't reflect actual clinical experience with spironolactone in patients with preserved ejection fraction. The TOPCAT study results are now considered to have been invalidated. The study's prime investigator and other prominent research cardiologists are now advising physicians treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to consider prescribing spironolactone pending outcome of two multicenter trials of newer medications.|$|E

40|$|Ordinal (i. e., ordered) {{classifiers}} {{are used}} to make judgments that we make on a regular basis, both at work and at home. Perhaps surprisingly, {{there have been no}} comprehensive studies in the scientific literature comparing the various ordinal classifiers. This paper compares the accuracy of five ordinal and three non-ordinal classifiers on a benchmark of fifteen real-world datasets. The results show that the ordinal classifiers that were tested had <b>no</b> meaningful <b>statistical</b> advantage over the corresponding non-ordinal classifiers. Furthermore, the ordinal classifiers that guaranteed monotonic classifications showed <b>no</b> meaningful <b>statistical</b> advantage over a majority-based classifier.
