500|$|American Recordings was {{partially}} absorbed by Columbia Records in early 1998. [...] Though the arrangement preserved the American label, The Black Crowes transferred to Columbia after privately expressing {{their desire to}} disassociate themselves from American Recordings founder Rick Rubin. [...] Despite working under a larger label, the band felt they had more freedom and support under Columbia; Chris remarked, [...] "At American, I <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a record company did.

500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he had said, what he had meant to say, what he is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} other {{producers}} usually {{a majority of the}} track was already done {{by the time he got}} to the recording studio, but with West, the process was more creative in nature. Pusha described the recording process with West as a [...] "roller coast" [...] and stated that he <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to expect while working with the producer. Upon hearing the production of the song, Pusha-T commented that it was so good it persuaded him to write a particularly inspired verse. On the production of [...] "So Appalled", he said [...] "it's Kanye, the beat brings the ghost out of you." [...] The rapper described his verse as [...] "self-explanatory" [...] and stated that it was one of his favorite of his career. Pusha T called his verse [...] "his personal favorite" [...] and that the track was originally supposed to be just him and Kanye. When the song was finished, Pusha-T was so impressed with the track that he argued with West to include it on his album, stating that the song was so good it didn't matter whether or not it had leaked. He commented; ...|$|E

500|$|Brissey's lowest grade, a [...] "B−", went to [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". Though {{she enjoyed}} the a cappella cover, Brissey found it incongruous in context, opining that Glee best {{performances}} are those {{linked to the}} storylines, allowing viewers to invest in their message. Several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying the song itself, including Mullins, Futterman and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson. Tucker felt that it had [...] "more snap and vigour" [...] than the final number, but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion, writing that it impacted negatively on the episode's momentum. Fallon gave the track an entirely positive review, suggesting {{that it should have}} been the episode's opening number and lauding it as [...] "surprising, oozing with charm, and actually kind of joyous." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France embraced the [...] "completely random and bizarre" [...] song choice, writing that it reminded her of the first season, [...] "when [...] <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to expect and [...] was often happily surprised." [...] Reiter too reviewed it favorably, calling it the best performance of the show. She appreciated the focus on facial expressions during the performance, in contrast to the elaborate costuming which she felt distracted from other numbers.|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} Columbia, many music critics {{considered}} that Smith {{lost much of}} the quality that was found in her earlier records with RCA Victor. When reviewing her compilation from her years at Columbia titled Connie Smith Sings Her Hits (1997), Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that Smith lost much of the [...] "grain" [...] in her voice. Jurek went on to write, [...] "It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record; the tunes were carefully chosen it's true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style." [...] In 1974 Smith released the singles [...] "I <b>Never</b> <b>Knew</b> (<b>What</b> That Song Meant Before)" [...] and [...] "I've Got My Baby on My Mind", which both reached No.13 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. In 1975, she released her second gospel album with the label, entitled Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel, which was {{a tribute to the}} gospel material that Hank Williams recorded. That year, she also released a cover of Williams' secular [...] "Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)" [...] as a single. In 1976, Smith released two cover versions of previously-made pop hits by The Everly Brothers as singles: [...] "(Till) I Kissed You" [...] and [...] "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)". After releasing two more studio albums in 1976, Smith parted ways with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was all about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death.

Once they took control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced women with uncovered heads, including the cabin crew members, to cover their heads. Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets to cover their heads. An elderly Algerian man told the TF1 network that the hijackers [...] "had a kind of art in their terror.

[...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California.

Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day.

2500|$|At 1:00p.m. CST, Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead after all activity had ceased and after Huber had administered Extreme Unction. Personnel at Parkland Hospital Trauma Room #1, who treated the President, observed that the president's condition was [...] "moribund", meaning he had no chance of survival upon arrival at the hospital. [...] "We never had any hope of saving his life," [...] Dr. Perry said. [...] "I am absolutely sure he <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> hit him," [...] said Dr. Tom Shires, Parkland's chief of surgery. The Very Reverend Oscar L. Huber, the priest who administered the last rites to the president, told The New York Times {{that the president was}} already dead upon the priest's arrival at the hospital. Huber had to draw back a sheet covering the President's face so that the last rites could be given.

2500|$|Perhaps it was Garrick's acting, {{the most}} showy of his careers, {{that brought him}} the most adulation. Garrick was not a large man, only {{standing}} 5'4", and his voice is not described as particularly loud. From his first performance, Garrick departed from the bombastic style that had been popular, choosing instead a more relaxed, naturalistic style that his biographer Alan Kendall states [...] "would probably seem quite normal to us today, but it was new and strange for his day." [...] Certainly this new style brought acclaim: Alexander Pope stated, [...] "he was afraid the young man would be spoiled, for he would have no competitor." [...] Garrick quotes George Lyttelton as complimenting him by saying, [...] "He told me he <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> acting was till I appeared."

The Midnight Express lost the AWA Southern tag team title to Bobby Eaton and Sweet Brown Sugar before returning to SECW in the spring of 1982. Upon their return to Southeastern Championship Wrestling the Midnight Express quickly regained the Southeastern Tag Team title from Robert Fuller and Jimmy Golden on September 27, 1982. The Express then became involved in a feud with the Mongolian Stomper and his storyline son “Mongolian Stomper Jr.”, with whom they traded the Southeastern title. The Midnight Express's next challengers were [...] "Dizzy Ed" [...] Hogan and local workhorse Ken Lucas. The two team repeatedly traded the title until the Midnight Express, repeatedly using their 3-on-2 advantage to regain the titles, finally reclaimed the championship by the end of July 1983. The Midnight Express's final feud in the SECW was with the local heroes Jimmy Golden and Robert Fuller who managed to drive the group out of SECW. After dropping the Southeastern Tag Team titles to Brad and Scott Armstrong, Austin, Condrey and Rose went their separate ways.|$|E
