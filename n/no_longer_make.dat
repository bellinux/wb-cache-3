5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the First Opium War in 1842, Britain and China {{signed the}} Treaty of Nanking, which {{effectively}} overthrew the original mercantilist system and forced open the ports of Guangzhou, Xiamen ("Amoy"), Fuzhou ("Foochow"), Ningbo ("Ningpo"), and Shanghai to British trading. Seeing that Britain could easily eliminate foreign competition in China with its new privileges and considerable trading prowess, Americans found the need to reestablish their diplomatic relations and commercial equality in China. For the previous fifty-nine years, Americans had been interacting with China merely through their business transactions, without government-to-government communication. As a result, the administration of President John Tyler sent the commissioner Caleb Cushing to negotiate a treaty in which America would receive the same privileges as Britain. Cushing, in the Treaty of Wanghsia in 1844, not only achieved this goal but also won the right of extraterritoriality, which meant that Americans accused of crimes in China were to be tried by American courts only. This treaty was monumental in that it laid the foundation for a more extensive and regulated American trade with China; American ships would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> the sporadic—and somewhat reckless—voyages to China so characteristic of the Old China trade.|$|E
25|$|From 1881 to 1882, some 30 Jewish {{families}} left Sana'a {{and several}} nearby settlements, {{and made the}} long trek by foot and by sea to Jerusalem, where most had settled in Silwan. This wave was followed by other Jews from central Yemen, who continued to move into British-ruled Palestine until 1914. The majority of these groups would later move into Jerusalem proper and Jaffa. Rabbi Avraham Al-Naddaf, who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1891, described in his autobiography the hardships the Yemenite Jewish community faced in their new country, {{where there were no}} hostelries to accommodate wayfarers and new immigrants. On the other hand, he writes that the Sephardi kollelim (seminaries) had taken under their auspices the Yemenite Jews from the moment they stepped foot in Jerusalem. Later, however, the Yemenites would come to feel discriminated against by the Sephardic community, who compelled them to <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> use of their own soft, pliable matzah, but to buy from them only the hard cracker-like matzah made weeks in advance prior to Passover. He also mentions that the Yemenite community would pay the prescribed tax to the public coffers; yet, they were not being allotted an equal share or subsidy as had been given to the Sephardic Jews. By 1910, the Yemenites had broken away from the Sephardic seminaries.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 the NCAA {{changed the}} game by {{canceling}} a rule that was in place since World War II, a team could <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> multiple substitutions and have specific players for each position, only one substitution could be made per play. Up to this change Pappy's approach was to use highly specialized players for key positions, which no longer became possible after the change. With the rule was withdrawn Cal went from 7–3 to 4–4–2. The 1953 season is partially associated with a recruiting scandal involving star freshman quarterback Ronnie Knox. In order to have Knox enroll at the university, the California football booster club promised him that Knox's step father to be hired as a scout, his high school coach would be hired as an assistant coach, and that Knox himself would be given a job writing for a local newspaper and also be paid $500 per year by the booster club. Knox enrolled at Cal but California's administration found out and made sure that the benefits would not be provided. Following investigation by both administration and the PCC conference, {{it was found that}} Waldorf was not directly involved in the scandal. The team did not have a winning season after 1953 and Pappy retired {{at the end of the}} 1956 season when Cal went 3–7. During the late 50's NCAA kept changing its rules and by 1964 it again allowed unlimited substitutions.|$|E

500|$|The {{breaking}} {{of the power of}} Rome proceeded little by little. In 1532, Cromwell brought before Parliament the Supplication Against the Ordinaries, which listed nine grievances against the Church, including abuses of power and Convocation's independent legislative power. Finally, on 10 May, the King demanded of Convocation that the Church renounce all authority to make laws. On 15 May, the Submission of the Clergy was subscribed, which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church so that it could <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> canon law without royal licence—i.e., without the King's permission—thus emasculating it as a law-making body. (The Parliament subsequently passed this in 1534 and again in 1536.) The day after this, More resigned as Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister. (Cromwell never became Chancellor. His power came—and was lost—through his informal relations with Henry.) ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that Anderson was {{constantly}} playing [...] "a mother who's always crying, shouting or looking miserable" [...] in the episode. They wrote that the episode's [...] "characters <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> sense" [...] and that the plot has [...] "been so required to dance through the little conspiracy hoops that there's no consistency any more." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the idea to suggest that Mulder died in the episode, {{due to the fact}} that Carter announced Duchovny would return for the season finale. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticised the plot of the episode, saying that it [...] "throws up many elements that we've seen the series do better elsewhere...in the hope that something will stick".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{includes}} a gag in which Quagmire rapes Marge Simpson, {{and the two}} later {{end up in the}} Simpson family's house, where Quagmire kills the family by shooting them. The network executives believed the joke was [...] "personal" [...] and told MacFarlane that he could not do a gag with The Simpsons. MacFarlane responded, saying that they had made fun of Family Guy several times, to which the executives replied that they wanted to [...] "end the feud". MacFarlane, however, claimed that there was no feud and told them: [...] "You are afraid of [...] James L. Brooks. [...] And that's why we can't do it." [...] Fox eventually cut the gag, which left the episode without a joke {{at the end of the}} first act. Brooks and Al Jean were reportedly very upset with the gag, and because of it, Fox told both the Family Guy and The Simpsons staff that they could <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> fun of one another. However, the gag was included on the DVD set and broadcasts on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It also aired on Global in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Leaves are {{structures}} specialised for photosynthesis and {{are arranged}} {{on the tree}} {{in such a way}} as to maximise their exposure to light without shading each other. They are an important investment by the tree and may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>make</b> new chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the blades become apparent. Synthesis in the leaf of a plant hormone called auxin also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves annually, such as at the start of the dry season. Many deciduous trees flower before the new leaves emerge. A few trees do not have true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance such as Phylloclades [...] modified stem structures [...] as seen in the genus Phyllocladus.|$|E
