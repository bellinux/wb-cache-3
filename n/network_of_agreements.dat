50|$|The United States' {{relationship}} with the Arab World prior to the Second World War was limited. Moreover, in comparison to European powers such as Britain and France which had managed to colonize {{almost all of the}} Arab World after defeating the Ottoman Empire in 1918, the United States was popular and respected among the Arabs, for having brought modern medicine, and setting up educational institutions in several Arab nations. The US had also provided the Arab World with highly skilled petroleum engineers. Thus, there were some connections which were made between the United States and the Arab World, before the Second World War. Other examples of corporations between the US and the Arab World are the Red Line Agreement signed in 1928 and the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement signed in 1944. Both of these agreements were legally binding and reflected an American interest in control of Arab and Middle Eastern energy resources, namely oil, and moreover reflected an American security imperative to prevent the (re)emergence of a powerful regional rival. The Red Line Agreement had been part of a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> made in the 1920s to restrict supply of petroleum and ensure that the major American companies...could control oil prices on world markets.

40|$|Introduction: {{the purpose}} of the {{creation}} of the Regional Reference Center on Drugs and Associated Vulnerabilities of Ceilândia College/University of Brasília was born from the recognition of drug abuse as a major public health problem in Brazil. This importance is reinforced when focus is placed on specific regions of Brazil, such as the Midwest, where this and other vulnerabilities have become even more obvious and, therefore, most in need for actions aimed at addressing these difficulties. Objectives: to empower workers of the network of attention to drug users in the municipalities of Águas Lindas de Goiás, Valparaíso de Goiás, Luziânia and Brazlândia. Methods: mapping of territories, creation and consolidation of the network of pacts with leaders and health services. The courses were organized according to the crash course model, role-play and supervisions and local discussions. Evaluation was divided into two phases: prior to and after the course. Results: it was possible to realize that the strategies employed suited several group demands and the methodology has been extremely favorable, as it has allowed the group to show active participation, bringing the debate close to the reality of the services. The project team was strengthened, becoming a permanent group, creating several Regional Reference Center developments. Conclusion: this experience has demonstrated the crucial importance of the mapping of the territory, the creation of a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements,</b> the intersectoral approach, and the constant dialogue for the effectiveness of a proposal for continuing education...|$|E
40|$|The European {{aerospace}} industry has an extensive experience of collaborative development. This {{began in the}} mid to late 1950 s with co-production of the US F- 104 and Hawk missile, as well as the NATO-sponsored Fiat G- 91 and Bregeut Atlantic. Collaboration came of age with the Franco-German Transall military transport, the Anglo-French Concorde and Jaguar fighter programmes launched in the early 1960 s. These were followed by the Airbus and Tornado, several missile and helicopter joint ventures and the beginnings of a European space programme. The initial experience of collaboration was neither easy nor harmonious, with national and corporate rivalries, disputes over work shares and project leadership, and problems stemming from fluctuating political support, providing a continuous backdrop to development. By the 1970 s, however, collaboration was accepted as a routine strategy for European aerospace programmes and some of the early problems had been eased by the experience of successfully working together. Practice, and some expensive lessons, had also led to the evolution of more efficient and equitable forms of managing international projects. In particular, the emergence of trans-national project-based consortia such as Panavia (Tornado) and Airbus Industrie, was viewed as a major advance in international programme management. In the case of civil programmes, the growth of industry-led rather than government-inspired collaboration was regarded as an even more significant improvement. Overall, the result of European collaboration up to the late 1980 s was to bind European firms in a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> and joining projects, but which did not at the same time entail the surrender of national control over aerospace...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{when and}} how international institutions promote cooperation. We introduce two concepts, institutional standing and institutional embeddedness, and show that both are essential to understanding the main commercial agreement of the postwar period. To see how GATT influences trade, we (1) consider all parties with legal standing, not simply the subset of formal members, and (2) model the effects of GATT, conditional on the <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreements</b> in which GATT is embedded. The concepts of standing and embeddedness could prove useful for studying many other institutions {{within and outside the}} area of trade. 1 Membership has its Privileges: Understanding the Effects of GATT and the WTO on World Trade When and how do international institutions promote cooperation? Few questions are as fundamental to international relations or as salient for world leaders. Due to the contributions of Keohane (1982) and others, we now have sophisticated theories about the emergence and effects of international institutions, but empirical research has not proceeded apace. As Frieden and Martin (2002 : 146) point out, “theoretical work on international institutions has far outstripped {{the quantity and quality of}} empirical work. ” At the moment, we cannot be sure that prominent institutions are performing according to theory, nor can we say which institutions are living up their own mandates. The gap between theory and evidence appears even in analyses of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the most cited example of a successful international institution. 1 Membership in GATT has expanded dramatically since the founding in 1947, and international trade has grown in tandem. Many observers assumed these trends were linked and praised the General Agreement for transforming world commerce (e. g. Bagwell and Staiger 2002; Bhagwat...|$|E

The clan elders are tasked with negotiating and mediating a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> reciprocal <b>agreements</b> with neighbouring people which gives the clan access to water points and pastures during drought or conflict-related emergencies. But clan survival also depends upon the ability to defend the clan's resources and the willingness to take water points and pastures by force if the situation requires or if the neighbouring people cannot defend themselves.
