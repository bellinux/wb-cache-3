25|$|In January 1988 CTC's {{programming}} {{began to}} more closely emulate that of Network Ten. Nine's Today Show, which CTC had broadcast on weekday mornings for nearly six years, {{was replaced with}} Ten's Good Morning Australia, while National Nine Morning News gave way to Ten Eyewitness <b>News</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning.</b>|$|E
25|$|ABC took {{an episode}} of The Morning Exchange and {{used it as a}} pilot episode. After very {{positive}} reviews for the pilot, the format replaced AM America in November 1975 as Good Morning America. The first host of the new program was David Hartman, featuring Nancy Dussault as his co-host. Dussault was replaced in 1977 by Sandy Hill. For the first seven years, weather forecasts were presented by John Coleman, former chief meteorologist for ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV in Chicago, who would leave GMA in 1982 to start The Weather Channel with Landmark Communications CEO Frank Batten. Dave Murray (now chief meteorologist at KTVI in St. Louis) provided the forecasts for both Good Morning America and ABC's early morning news program ABC <b>News</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> from 1983 to 1986. In August 1986, he was replaced by Spencer Christian, who worked at WABC-TV in New York City and served as fill-in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray whenever they were away on vacation or assignment.|$|E

"Thinking {{you might}} have {{forgotten}} the <b>news</b> brought <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> from below, sir, I have taken the liberty to order the detachment under arms," [...] said the lieutenant, very coolly, cutting down with his sheathed saber the mullein tops that grew within his reach.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian {{declaration}} of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: [...] "War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna." [...] Asquith {{wrote in a letter}} to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that:"Russia is trying to drag us in. The <b>news</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> is that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people think that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one. Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years." [...] In order to stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.|$|E
2500|$|Channel 8's {{approach}} to news {{during this period}} was characterized by an aggressive, all-out commitment to get the story and to present it in graphic, visual detail. The station was rewarded {{with some of the}} highest ratings of any local station in a major media market. A standard practice was to have each reporter cover only one beat, such as Dallas City Hall or the Dallas County Commission, making the reporter an expert on the subject that he or she was covering. Former news director H. Martin [...] "Marty" [...] Haag is credited with leading the station's news department to ratings dominance and national prominence, as well as convincing the Dallas Morning News ownership to allow much greater spending on news at WFAA than ever seen before, far surpassing the budgets of other local rival stations. Haag was honored with a special Lifetime Achievement George Foster Peabody Award shortly before his death in 2004. The station resumed a local morning newscast in 1987, when it launched the initially 60-minute traditional news program News 8 Daybreak (which evolved out of local news inserts that it aired during World <b>News</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning).</b> WFAA pioneered community outreach in 1977 with the [...] "Wednesday's Child" [...] series of feature segments, which profiled children in need of an adoptive family and was descended from a feature segment on News 8 Etc.; the current iteration was initially conducted by John Criswell during his stint as co-host of the retooled AM, before becoming a weekly feature on WFAA's 10:00p.m. newscast in September 1980. In 1994, the station began conducting town hall meetings all over North Texas through its Family First (F1) initiative, which remains {{a significant part of the}} station's commitment to community service.|$|E
2500|$|During the station's {{first decade}} with CBS, newscasts were added and dropped from KTVT's schedule. Channel 11 would first expand news {{programming}} with {{the debut of}} half-hour weekday newscasts at noon and 5:00p.m. in February 1996. In January 1999, it added a 6:30p.m. newscast on weeknights {{as a replacement for}} Hard Copy (which had been airing on KTVT since September 1997, when the program moved to the station from KDFW); the newscast was later replaced in September 2000 by Hollywood Squares (which had previously aired on WFAA from the revival series' September 1998 premiere until June 2000). Concurrent with the discontinuance of Hard Copy following its cancellation, the station debuted an hour-long 4:00p.m. newscast on September 11 of that year; after the program's initial cancellation in September 2002, KTVT restored that newscast in January 2004 (later reducing it to a half-hour broadcast in September 2005, before expanding it to an hour once more on January 11, 2010). The noon newscast returned in September 2005, but was subsequently cancelled the following month after it moved Jeopardy! from its previous 4:30p.m. timeslot to 11:00a.m. (KTVT would eventually restore a midday news program, with the debut of a half-hour 11:00a.m. newscast on August 12, 2013, which replaced Jeopardy! after the game show was moved to KTXA). In September 2006, due to budget cuts imposed by CBS Corporation, KTVT discontinued its morning newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays, making it the only [...] "Big Four" [...] network station in the Dallas-Fort Worth market that did not have a weekend morning newscast for the next eight years until KTVT launched hour-long weekend editions of CBS 11 <b>News</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> on both days on September 20, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The Queen {{said she}} was [...] "utterly shocked" [...] and her [...] "thoughts were with all those affected". Her son and heir to the New Zealand throne, The Prince of Wales, also said to New Zealand's governor-general and prime minister: [...] "My wife and I were horrified when we heard the <b>news</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning...</b> The scale of the {{destruction}} all but defies belief when we can appreciate only too well how difficult {{it must have been}} struggling {{to come to terms with}} last year's horror ...

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{there is}} a certain {{futility}} about the custom. You, for whom the sun is rising, don't heed the warning, and we others in the shadow know our day is done. I do not think I am a sentimentalist, but the <b>news</b> we got <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> proves the Latin motto true. Then it is hardly possible we shall have tea outside again, and we cannot tell if all will gather round the table when summer comes back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My son, sir, is a fool! A good-for-nothing fool! Oh, I {{have heard}} of this affair, a vulgar tavern brawl, the fifth in which his name has been {{involved}} and besmirched.

"Either my good friend, guide, and patron, {{has heard}} worse <b>news</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> than he cares to tell us, or {{he must have}} {{stumbled}} over my tattered jerkin and leathern hose, and acquired, by contact, the whole mass of stupidity which I threw off last night with those most dolorous garments. Cheer up, my dear Colonel Albert, if your affectionate page may presume to say so--you are in company with those whose society, dear to strangers, must be doubly so to you. Oddsfish, man, cheer up!

6000|$|... 'So be it!' {{cried the}} King, with the {{reckless}} air {{of one who}} accepts a plan, {{not because it is}} the best, but because he feels that all are equally hopeless. 'What think you, gentlemen?' he added, with a bitter smile. 'I have heard <b>news</b> from London <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> that my uncle has clapped two hundred merchants and others who are suspected of being true to their creed into the Tower and the Fleet. He will have one half of the nation mounting guard over the other half ere long.' ...|$|R

Several of my acquaintances have consented to let their children go out a little way into the country, to see him come in; and, as for the blacks, you know, it is just as well to give them permission to be of the party, as half of them would otherwise go without asking it." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} {{the same day}} that Honduras would not send a replacement to the Miss World pageant as a sign of respect for Alvarado.

We are devastated by this terrible loss of two young women, who were so full of life.

We war only against the government, and to obtain our rights. Already our demands have been drawn up, and unless these are granted we will not be content. These are what we ask: first, the total abolition of slavery for ourselves and our children for ever; second, the reduction of the rent of good land to 4d. the acre; third, the full liberty of buying and selling like other men in fairs and markets; fourth, a general pardon for all past offences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it is well that your mother should come over," [...] the burgomaster said; [...] "for a man who has had the greater part of his leg taken off cannot be {{expected}} to get round quickly. Besides, after what you told us last night about the misfortune that has befallen her family, it were best that she should be busied about her husband, and so have little time to brood over the matter. As to hospitality, it would be strange indeed if we should not do all that we could for a brave man who has been injured in fighting our common enemy. Send word to your mother that she will be as welcome as he is, and that we shall be ready in all respects to arrange whatever she may think most convenient and comfortable. And now you had best sit down and have your meal with us. As soon as it is over I will go down with you to the wharf, and will do what I can to hasten the sailing of your ship. I don't think," [...] he went on, when they had taken their seats at table, [...] "that there is much chance of her meeting another Spaniard on her way out to sea, for we have <b>news</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that some ships of the beggars have been seen cruising off the entrance, and the Spaniards will be getting under shelter of their batteries at Amsterdam. I hear they are expecting a fleet from Spain to arrive soon to aid in their operations against our ports. However, I have little fear that they will do much by sea against us. I would we could hold our own as well on the land as we can on the water." ...|$|E

We are {{returning}} to Budapesth, and, Prince Ughtred, there is a revolver {{in the pocket of}} your coat also, not for use but for show. We must not be led into a disturbance with any one. Mind, it is the policy of every one to detain us if once the object of our journey is known. In Germany we shall not be safe, in Austria every moment will be perilous. But once across the frontier nothing will avail. I had <b>news</b> from Theos <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The people are on fire for your coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ronald, I {{will tell}} you a piece of <b>news</b> I heard <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> The young Chevalier left Paris {{secretly}} five days ago, and I have received certain private information <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that he has gone to Nantes, {{and that he is}} on the point of sailing for Scotland on his own account. I am told that this plan of his is known to but five or six persons. If you get safely through this business mount and ride thither at all speed. They are more likely to pursue you towards the frontier or the northern ports, and will not think you have made for Nantes. If you get there before the prince has sailed, present yourself to him and join his expedition. The king will be furious at first, both at the loss of his favourite and the breaking of the edicts; but he must come round. The gentlemen here with the duke are all honourable men, and were, I could see, shocked at the insult which the duke passed on you. Therefore I can rely upon them to join me in representing the matter in its true light to the king. Before you return, the matter will have blown over, {{and it may be that}} the removal of your father's most powerful enemy may facilitate an arrangement. In any case, my dear boy, you can rely upon the marshal and myself to look after your interests." ...|$|R
