40|$|The {{potential}} effects of climatic changes on natural risks are widely discussed. But {{the formulation of}} strategies for adapting risk management practice to climate changes requires knowledge of the related risks for people and economic values. The main goals of this work were (1) {{the development of a}} method for analysing and comparing risks induced by different <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> types, (2) highlighting the most relevant <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> processes and related damages, (3) the development of an information system for the monitoring of the temporal development of <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> risk and (4) the visualisation of the resulting information for the wider public. A comparative exposure analysis provides the basis for pointing out the hot spots of <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> risks in the province of Carinthia, Austria. An analysis of flood risks in all municipalities provides the basis for setting the priorities in the planning of flood protection measures. The methods form the basis for a monitoring system that periodically observes the temporal development of <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> risks. This makes it possible firstly to identify situations in which <b>natural</b> <b>hazard</b> risks are rising and secondly to differentiate between the most relevant factors responsible for the increasing risks. The factors that most influence the natural risks could be made evident...|$|R

5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to <b>natural</b> <b>hazards</b> such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies {{on one of the most}} active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of technology {{by the human}} race has allowed the greater exploitation {{of natural resources and}} has helped to alleviate some of the risk from <b>natural</b> <b>hazards.</b> In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood. Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and <b>natural</b> <b>hazards,</b> the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E

In response to these challenges, the insurance industry has started to develop adaptation strategies and measures to adjust data collection, catastrophe modelling and risk analysis despite the limitations of these strategies and difficulties arising from the requirement of considering a significant number of partners and systems...|$|R
5|$|Persia at {{the time}} was divided into British and Russian spheres of influence, with a neutral zone in between. Germany {{exercised}} influence over the central parts of the country through their consulate in Isfahan. The local populace and the clergy, opposed to Russian and British semi-colonial designs on Persia, offered support to the mission. Niedermayer and von Hentig's groups reconnoitred Isfahan until the end of June. The Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, was already receiving reports of pro-German sympathies among Persian and Afghan tribes. Details of the progress of the expedition were being keenly sought by British intelligence. By now, British and Russian columns close to the Afghan border, including the Seistan Force, were hunting for the expedition. If the expedition was to reach Afghanistan, it would have to outwit and outrun its pursuers over thousands of miles in the extreme heat and <b>natural</b> <b>hazards</b> of the Persian desert, while evading brigands and ambushes.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main <b>natural</b> <b>hazards</b> for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

25|$|Israel has a {{large number}} of {{environmental}} concerns ranging from <b>natural</b> <b>hazards</b> to man-made issues both resulting from ancient times to modern development. <b>Natural</b> <b>hazards</b> facing the country include sandstorms which sometimes occur during spring in the desert south, droughts which are usually concentrated in summer months, flash floods which create great danger in the deserts due to their lack of notice, and regular earthquakes, most of which are small, although there is a constant risk due to Israel's location along the Jordan Rift Valley. Current environmental concerns include the lack of arable land and natural fresh water resources. Whilst measures have been taken to irrigate and grow in the desert, the amount of water needed here poses issues. Desertification is also a risk possible on the desert fringe, whilst air pollution from industrial and vehicle emissions and groundwater pollution from industrial and domestic waste are also issues facing the country. Furthermore, the effects of the use of chemical fertilizers, and pesticides are issues facing the country.|$|E
