25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} accepted methods of making CNT films {{involves the use}} of <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants,</b> such as Triton X-100 and sodium lauryl sulfate, which improves their dispersibility in aqueous solution. These suspensions can then be membrane filtered under positive or negative pressure to yield uniform films. The van der Waals force's interaction between the nanotube surface and the surfactant can often be mechanically strong and quite stable and therefore there are no assurances that all the surfactant is removed from the CNT film after formation. Washing with methanol, an effective solvent in the removal of Triton X, was found to cause cracking and deformation of the film. It has also been found that Triton X can lead to cell lysis and in turn tissue inflammatory responses even at low concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Stichlmair {{developed}} electroextraction at the University of Essen in Germany in 1987 as {{an improvement}} on liquid-liquid extraction in an electric field. [...] Electric fields {{are applied to}} enhance the demixing of a sample in a two-phase system. [...] However, as current flows through the system, the resulting convective mixing disrupts separation. [...] Electroextraction corrects for this. [...] Two or three liquid phases that are electrically conductive and immiscible with one another are kept between electrodes, and upon addition of an electric field, charged particles travel from one phase to another separating anions and cations. [...] A two-phase system brings anions into one phase and cations into the other. [...] A three phase system extracts anions and cations into the two outer phases while leaving uncharged particles in the middle phase. [...] Convective mixing is restricted to each phase and does not travel between phases. [...] A diagram is given in figure 1. [...] Organic phases that are used typically have small amounts of water added {{in order to be}} conductive. [...] Other possible phases include mixtures of water and highly polymerized substances, or water with <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants.</b> [...] Electroextraction has also influenced the development of similar electrophoretic separation techniques involving a membrane between the two-phase systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} {{deals with a}} {{preliminary}} evaluation of <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles as ocular vehicles for cyclopentolate. The vesicles were obtained by sonication of equimolar mixtures (either 75 or 15 mM) of polysorbate 20 and cholesterol. <b>Non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicle vehicles containing cyclopentolate (0. 5 or 1. 0 % w/v) and buffered at two pH values (7. 4 and 5. 5) as well as appropriate reference solutions were tested for cyclopentolate permeation through rabbit corneas in vitro, and for mydriatic activity in rabbits. In the in vitro study, the pH 5. 5 <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicle formations (independent of the molar concentration of components) promoted transcorneal permeation of cyclopentolate {{with respect to a}} reference buffer solution, while the opposite effect was observed at pH 7. 4.

The contrasting results observed in vitro and in vivo, together with the observed low encapsulation capacity for cyclopentolate of the vesicle formulations, led the authors to formulate the provisional hypothesis that <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles may promote absorption of cyclopentolate by preferentially modifying the permeability characteristics of the conjunctival and scleral membranes...|$|R

The thin layer evaporation method followed by sonication was used to prepare small <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles containing beclomethasone dipropionate. Light scattering experiments showed that beclomethasone dipropionate-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles were larger than unloaded ones and showed a significant (P < 0. 001) decrease of the zeta potential. The morphological analysis, by freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy, showed the maintenance of a vesicular structure {{in the presence of the}} drug. The colloidal and storage stability were evaluated by Turbiscan Lab (R) Expert, which evidenced the good stability of BDP-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles, thus showing no significant variations of mean size and no colloidal phase segregation. Primary human lung fibroblast (HLF) cells were used for in vitro investigation of vesicle tolerability, carrier-cell interaction, intracellular drug uptake and drug-loaded vesicle anti-inflammatory activity. The investigated NSVs did not show a significant cytotoxic activity at all incubation times for concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 1 mu M. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed vesicular carrier localization at the level of the cytoplasm compartment, where the glucocorticoid receptor (target site) is localized. BDP-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles elicited a significant improvement of the HLF intracellular uptake of the drug with respect to the free drug solution, drug/surfactant mixtures and empty vesicles used as references. The treatment of HLF cells with BDP-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles determined a noticeable increase of the drug anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the secretion of both constitutive and interleukin- 1 beta-stimulated nerve growth factor (as inflammatory index) of 68 % and 85 %, respectively.

50|$|An {{application}} of the additional stability a polyelectrolyte multi-layer will grant a colloid {{is the creation of}} a solid coating for a liquid core. While polyelectrolyte layers are generally adsorbed onto solid substrates, they may also be adsorbed to liquid substrates such as oil in water emulsions or colloids. This process has much potential, but is rife with difficulty. Since colloids are generally stabilized by surfactants, and often ionic surfactants, the adsorption of a multi-layer that is similarly charged to the surfactant causes problems due to the electrostatic repulsion between the polyelectrolyte and the surfactant.
