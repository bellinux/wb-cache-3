5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits {{the fact that his}} son, Bradd Arseneau, was <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5|$|Non-use of {{seat belts}} is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> seat belts. The fine in Montana for <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

Paul Martin wore new work boots he {{received}} as a gift from Chrétien for his first budget, in 1994, but did <b>not</b> <b>wear</b> new footwear with subsequent budgets. John Manley did <b>not</b> <b>wear</b> new shoes for the one budget he tabled, in 2003. His successor, Ralph Goodale, released two budgets in 2004 and 2005, and wore new shoes both times.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the safer}} eastern channel and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E

5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by the Taliban {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the Sharia. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|News of McCabe’s {{death was}} made public while Australia and England were playing in the Fifth Test at The Oval. After the death was {{announced}} over the public address system, the crowd spontaneously stood up and took off their hats, and did the players, and they observed a self-initiated moment of silence. However, McCabe’s friend and former teammate Fingleton, now a journalist, criticised the Australian team for <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> black armbands.|$|E
5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways. Drivers are often drunk and <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> seat belts. Speeding is common. Deer, elk and moose crossing the highway {{add to the}} risk compared to urban highways. In {{the event of an}} accident in a remote area, injured victims may not receive emergency medical care in time to save their lives.|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E

5|$|During his midget season, Crosby {{appeared}} on the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada telecast. He has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant verbal abuse from parents {{on and off the}} ice. Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, he took to <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> his jersey between tournament games while he waited to play so {{that he would not be}} recognized. Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season. In 57 games with the Sabres, he recorded 72 goals and 162 points, leading the team to a U18 AAA national championship.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus {{published}} Species Plantarum, {{the work}} {{which is now}} internationally accepted {{as the starting point}} of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753. The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year. The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> the order's insignia.|$|E
5|$|Potty then scolds Patchy for his unsanitary {{environment}} (such as keeping {{ground beef}} {{in an old}} boot, having rats in the kitchen, not washing his hands after using the bathroom and <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> a hair net). Fed up with Potty's criticisms, Patchy starts throwing patties at Potty, but they keep missing, and one eventually hits Mr. Pirateson, the Owner of Poop Deck. Patchy then tells the viewers to watch {{the rest of the}} SpongeBob episode while he watches Potty get fired, just as Mr. Pirateson forcefully shouts for Patchy to get in his office.|$|E

50|$|Even as {{it gained}} popularity, the corset was <b>not</b> <b>worn</b> by everyone. Mary, Queen of Scots, for example, did <b>not</b> <b>wear</b> a corset. During {{the reign of}} Louis XV of France and again during the French Revolution, the corset went out of style, as the fashions were simpler.|$|R
5000|$|The great {{difference}} between your correspondent ‘STAYLACE' and myself seems to be, {{that she was}} encased in corsets at an early age, and thus became gradually accustomed to tight-lacing, while I did <b>not</b> <b>wear</b> them till I went to school, at fourteen, and I did <b>not</b> <b>wear</b> them voluntarily.|$|R
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body and he was <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him {{and took him to}} the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car because he was <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems {{later in the year}} led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

5|$|Formerly, men <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, three Predators {{consisting}} of Scar, Celtic and Chopper arrive and kill all the humans on the surface. They {{make their way}} down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure. The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Alexa and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Alexa and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him <b>not</b> <b>wearing</b> his mask.|$|E
