5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought {{adjoining}} land {{to increase the}} estate and protect it from rapidly approaching <b>new</b> <b>developments.</b> These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for <b>new</b> <b>developments,</b> and Worcester proved no exception. By {{the end of the century}} the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century. Only a few tracts of wall survived, often concealed behind other buildings and new constructions.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, Mälzel {{took the}} Turk {{on a tour}} of the United Kingdom. There were several <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> in the act, such as {{allowing}} the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually {{two stories}} with {{functional}} shops {{on the ground}} floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions.

5|$|The High Street retains various {{independent}} shops, {{including a}} cobbler and a butcher, but {{is seen as}} in need of improvement. Walsall Council's regeneration programme includes extensive redevelopment of the High Street; the council's view is that retail investment should be focussed on the existing shopping area rather than encouraging <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> outside this area as, based on consultants' studies, the council believes that the town could not support large-scale retail development. Specific development opportunities within {{the vicinity of the}} High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.|$|E
5|$|The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, collectively {{known as}} Light Pacifics or informally as Spam Cans, are air-smoothed 4-6-2 Pacific steam {{locomotives}} {{designed for the}} Southern Railway by its Chief Mechanical Engineer Oliver Bulleid. Incorporating a number of <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> in British steam locomotive technology, they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process, and to use steel fireboxes, which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post-war economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and {{a focus on the}} development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> in technology and educational research.|$|E

5|$|The ruins {{were left}} {{undisturbed}} until Manchester expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution {{in the late}} 18th century. Most of the fort was levelled {{to make way for}} <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> such as the construction of the Rochdale Canal and the Great Northern Railway. The site is now part of the Castlefield Urban Heritage Park that includes renovated warehouses. A section of the fort's wall along with its gatehouse, granaries, and other ancillary buildings from the vicus have been reconstructed and are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Controversy has {{continued}} {{in recent years}} with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for}} the new Bath Bus Station. This was part of the Southgate redevelopment begun in 2007 in which the central 1960s shopping precinct, bus station, and multi-story carpark were demolished and replaced with a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO has asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also says that Bath must do more to attract world-class architecture to any <b>new</b> <b>developments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked <b>new</b> <b>developments.</b> He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital {{was closed}} {{by the state}} of Oregon, and the site was then {{proposed}} as a location for what became the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which opened in 2001 at a different site {{to the north of the}} old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically the effect on property values, Larry Eaton began erecting school buses on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital are, as of 2009, under development as Villebois, a primarily residential complex. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city's history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> to the city. A new water treatment plant on the Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.|$|E
5|$|To {{link the}} <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> around Battersea Power Station to Battersea Park, in 2004 a new curved {{footbridge}} was built beneath {{the southern end}} of Chelsea Bridge. The footbridge was built offsite in four sections, transported by road to the King George V Dock where it was assembled, and the completed structure floated down the river and hoisted into position. It is planned that once the riverfront in the area has been opened to the public, following the completion of the rebuilding of Battersea Power Station into a commercial development, the new bridge will form part of the Thames Path. The new bridge curves out from the bank, overhanging the river bank by , and cost £600,000 to build.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} section of the Jubilee line was planned in the 1970s, {{the second phase of the}} project was {{intended}} to continue the line eastwards from the terminus at Charing Cross to the City of London, Woolwich and Thamesmead. Westminster station would not have been on this planned route, but the need to provide transport infrastructure for the redevelopment of the London Docklands in east and south-east London led to a redirection of the route to run via Westminster to connect Waterloo and London Bridge stations with the <b>new</b> <b>developments.</b> For the Jubilee Line Extension, the buildings around the station were demolished and the sub-surface station was completely reconstructed together with the erection of a parliamentary office building, Portcullis House, which sits above the station. Both projects were designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners.|$|E
