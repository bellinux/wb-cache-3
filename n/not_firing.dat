25|$|However, {{the way the}} {{invasion}} progressed rendered the capture of the Beaufort unnecessary. Capture would have been necessary had the IDF decided to cross the Litani River via the al-Khardali Bridge, just below the fortress. But since the IDF instead {{decided to use the}} Akiye Bridge, located much further to the west, the Israelis could have proceeded to Nabatiye unaffected by the Beaufort. Since the PLO troops stationed in and around the castle were <b>not</b> <b>firing</b> at Israeli settlements when the war began, there was no urgent need to neutralize them. The General Staff issued a command to postpone the operation, but the command failed to reach the Sayeret.|$|E

500|$|The game {{features}} bullet hell gameplay elements, {{providing the}} player {{with a small}} hit box and swarms of particles to evade. Most of the bullets come in patternless waves {{with the exception of}} bosses which feature more structured patterns. The player may choose from three different ships each with a different speed setting, and may also choose from three different weapons: spread gun, homing laser, and bubble cannon. Each weapon behaves differently, so the player must utilize different strategies with them. The player is also equipped with a sword and shield. The sword and main weapon can be used to destroy the enemies and some bullets, and can also deflect items. This deflection mechanic allows the player to [...] "juggle" [...] items and power-ups until they are desired. When <b>not</b> <b>firing,</b> a shield is automatically deployed which can deflect some bullets. A combo bar, which determines the score multiplier, can be increased by either using the shield to harvest energy from bullets or enemies, or using the ABSNET shield, a weapon which eliminates all minor enemies and bullets on the screen. In order to use the ABSNET shield, the player must fill a gauge by gathering blue items which drop from destroyed enemies.|$|E
500|$|In {{the form}} of an {{extensive}} series of callbacks, Larkin returned to the studio on several different occasions over the next few months. While the audience of studio executives and filmmakers continued to increase, the amount of actresses competing for the role gradually decreased accordingly as the audition process neared completion. Larkin's final audition lasted a total of four hours, during which she read through the entire script for the first time. The animators were also provided with an opportunity to animate to Larkin's voice for the first time. The actress was finally cast several months later, by which time she had nearly forgotten she had ever auditioned. Six months into recording, however, Larkin was forced to re-audition for the role by Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, who felt that the actress' voice lacked the authority required to voice a princess. However, Clements and Musker disagreed with him, and managed to trick Katzenberg into <b>not</b> <b>firing</b> Larkin by staging a fake recording session during which they had the actress speak lower and slower in Katzenberg's presence, only to have her return to her natural voice thereafter. Larkin recorded only one scene alongside her co-stars Williams and Scott Weinger, voice of Aladdin. Apart from some rough, unfinished storyboards and drawings, Larkin did not see much of her character until the film was finally screened at the Museum of Modern Art.|$|E
500|$|Each chapter {{begins with}} an aerial battle, {{consisting}} of a five-minute on rails shooter segment, with Pit being guided along a predetermined path. During these stages, the player moves Pit with the Circle Pad, aims with either the 3DS' stylus or face buttons, and fires with the L button. <b>Not</b> <b>firing</b> for a time allows the player to fire a powerful Charge Shot, which kills several enemies at once. Once on the ground, players have more control over Pit as he traverses through the level: Pit can either shoot enemies from a distance or attack them up close with melee attacks, while also performing various moves to dodge enemy attacks. These areas also featured more open spaces, and hidden areas unlocked when playing on certain difficulties. The main controls are carried over from aerial segments, but their assigned actions alter slightly. When an enemy strikes Pit, his health bar is depleted. This can be replenished with items scattered throughout levels. If sufficiently damaged, the health bar vanishes and Crisis Mode is activated: this will either end naturally or can be ended by fully replenishing health with a [...] "Drink of the Gods" [...] item. If Pit is defeated, the player is given the option of continuing, but an amount of Hearts are lost from the Fiend's Cauldron and the difficulty is lowered. Completing a level without dying grants additional rewards. In ground-based levels, Pit can also take control of various vehicles for short stretches, gaining special attacks unique to each vehicle type. Each stage ends in a ground-based boss battle. Pit {{has the ability to}} sprint during ground-based gameplay, but sprinting for too long uses up his stamina and leaves him vulnerable to attack.|$|E

2500|$|At 9 April 1940, eight Norwegian {{soldiers}} {{lost their}} lives in the battle against German aircraft and warships during the invasion of Norway in Operation Weserübung at Odderøya Fortress. [...] The fortress returned the cannon fire from the German warships and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers. [...] The attack against Kristiansand and Arendal consisted of the light cruiser Karlsruhe, three torpedo boats, and seven smaller vessels, one mothership, and around 1,000 soldiers. Three times between 5:00 and 7:00 in the morning, the German forces tried to penetrate and to put troops ashore, but whenever they chose to turn because of shelling from Odderøya. [...] One of the grenades from Karlsruhe missed the fortress. [...] By accident this grenade hit the upper part of Kristiansand Cathedral's church tower. In addition to the grenade hits at the fortress, a bombshell led to an explosion at the ammunition depot. At ten o'clock in the morning, the commander at the cruiser decided to break through whatever the resistance would be.
