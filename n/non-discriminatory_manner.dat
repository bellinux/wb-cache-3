50|$|Canada {{is one of}} {{the largest}} owners of fresh water and has for years been engaged in a legal dispute over its {{possession}} of the resource. In 1990 an American company named Sunbelt was invited by the government of British Columbia to invest in a water exporting operation. Due to setbacks, the contract never matured and Sunbelt sued the government of British Columbia for failing to meet its obligations. After years of battle the Canadian government declared in 1999 that water in its fresh state as those found in rivers and lakes contains no economic value, and is therefore outside the obligations of its trade agreement. In addition, the government cited article XI of GATT (G). This article allows for the conservation of a natural resource as long as the action taken by the government is done in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner.</b> Sunbelt however, disagreed with the applicability of this clause and claimed that Canada’s actions are in direct violation of several international trade agreements. Particularly, Sunbelt addressed Article XI of GATT which forbids a member nation from imposing measures other than taxes, levies and other charges on the export of its good. Likewise, Sunbelt argued that the water located in British Columbia belonged to US companies just as much as it belongs to Canadian companies. This argument is based on Article 11 of NAFTA known as the investment chapter. Once water is extracted from its natural state for whatever reason that same right must be given to foreign investors. Sunbelt argues that Canadian companies had such extractions in the past and therefore opened the door for foreign investors to come in and do likewise.|$|E

The film represents homosexuality in an ostensibly <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner,</b> but undermines this potential through a range of cultural prejudices and conventionalized conservative cinematic techniques.

Therefore, uberPop benefits from the protection against undue trade restrictions provided by this directive, as well as by Article 56 TFEU.

40|$|Severe and {{morbid obesity}} are {{associated}} with highly elevated risks of adverse health outcomes and the prevalence of severe obesity is increasing globally. To date, disaster literature has not considered severe and morbid obesity as a specific vulnerability, despite reports of people being left behind during disasters because of their body size, shape or weight. The complex causes of obesity {{are associated with}} the social determinants of health and one’s potential vulnerability to disasters. The absence of appropriate considerations may lead to people being exposed to disproportionate and potentially avoidable risk. The intersection of the social determinants of health, disaster vulnerability, severe and morbid obesity is explored. Previously identified vulnerable groups are also represented in severe and morbid obesity data. This poses the prospect for ‘triple jeopardy’ compounding the social determinants of health, disaster vulnerability and considerations with and for people with morbid obesity.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} the compatibility {{of various}} regulatory mechanisms {{provided by the}} new Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) {{with the requirements of}} WTO law, in particular those included in the TBT and TRIPS Agreements. After introducing basic provisions of the directive and summarizing the concerns raised by some WTO Members during meetings of the TBT Committee and the TRIPS Council, the article discusses in more detail the merits of those claims. It finds that concerns expressed by the WTO Members are generally overstated, as most TPD provisions, except for the temporal menthol exception, are WTO-compatible. The article also notes that significance of its conclusions goes beyond the specific context of the EU measure. The TPD introduces many progressive regulatory solutions which, although not being entirely original, are still at the forefront of contemporary tobacco control policies and will be adopted in the future in other jurisdictions. On that basis, the article concludes that WTO law, while imposing certain standards, generally does not stand against genuine tobacco control policies that are adopted in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginnings}} of the 1980 ’s Chile liberalized the entry of auctioneers and partially the auction fees. The reform, though, kept two restrictions for judicial auctions only: i) new maximum fees, and ii) the obligation for judges to assign auctions in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> among the different registered auctioneers. Competition policy concerns were severely reduced since freedom of entry, and maximum legal fees were considered enough disciplinary mechanism to avoid monopolistic inefficiencies. Using a sample of 680 and 1300 judicial and private auctions respectively, we find that Courts assign the judicial auctions in a discretional manner, and that the assigned auctioneers charge fees which are substantially higher than those permitted by law. We test the hypothesis that the judicial auctions ’ design has additional costs and, consistent with the predictions of a simple model, that it is more likely for Courts to appoint the less efficient auctioneers. We conclude also that, as the model predicts, the net price received by creditors and debtors in judicial auctions are about 18 % to 33 % below those possible to obtain in private auctions, where freedom of entry and freedom to set prices exists...|$|E
40|$|International {{commerce}} facilitates abusive {{child labor}} when {{it offers a}} market for the goods produced through such practices. International trade sanctions are thus a logical avenue for confronting abusive child labor, by eliminating the commercial opportunities for such goods. However, {{it is not clear}} that domestic child labor sanctions would survive legal challenge under WTO law as currently interpreted. For international trade law to serve as a viable strategy for change, there must first be a clear theoretical and doctrinal case for the WTO-consistency of domestic child labor-based sanctions. In this chapter, we present this case, using the U. S. section 307 forced labor statute as an example. Relying on existing case law of GATT panels and the WTO Appellate Body, we demonstrate how a child labor sanction can be held consistent with the exceptions in GATT Article XX for measures protecting public morals, and measures protecting human life and health, provided it is implemented in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner.</b> By offering a strategy for guiding domestic trade sanctions through a WTO challenge, we suggest how the full power of international trade can be deployed in the service of vulnerable children, enabling WTO members to act affirmatively against child labor practices...|$|E
40|$|Following {{years of}} silence, the WTO Appellate Body (AB) issued almost {{simultaneously}} three reports dealing with issues coming {{under the aegis}} of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT).

Some progress has been made and some clarifications have been introduced, but overall the AB has yet to come to grips with a coherent approach regarding the understanding of the TBT Agreement. The main argument in this paper is that the AB, in designing its test for consistency with the TBT Agreement, did not do any different than it would have done had no TBT Agreement existed. It is, nevertheless, response to the question ‘what has the TBT added to the pre-existing legislative arsenal’ that should point to the elements that must be included in developing a test of consistency against which disputes coming {{under the aegis of}} the TBT Agreement should be discussed. The suggested approach consists of a two-tier test whereby Panels would first inquire into the innate characteristics of a measure coming {{under the aegis of the}} TBT Agreement, before asking the question whether it has also been applied in <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Nurses are {{challenged}} to thoughtfully analyze {{the balance of}} professional responsibility and risk, including moral obligation and options, in particular situations {{in order to preserve}} the ethical mandates of the profession. Nursing creates a relationship of trust between nurse and patient, with special duties for the nurse, including the responsibility to care for patients. The nurse has a moral obligation or duty to patients and is not at liberty to abandon patients in need of nursing care. ANA Position: The American Nurses Association (ANA) believes that nurses are obligated to care for patients in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner,</b> with respect for all individuals. The ANA also recognizes there may be limits to the personal risk of harm nurses can be expected to accept as an ethical duty. History/Previous Position Statements: Historically, nurses have given care to those in need, even at risk to their own health, life, or limb. Indeed, the suggested Code of 1926 proclaims “the most precious possession of this profession is the ideal of service, extending even to the sacrifice of life itself [...] . ” (Committee on Ethical Standards, 1926). Nursing history is replete with examples of nurses who have knowingly incurred great risk in order to care for those in need of nursing or to contribute to the advancement of health science. Contemporary nurses, too, knowingly place themselves at risk when providing care in war-torn areas, places of poverty and poor sanitation, and situations of natural or human-made disaster. Nurses also encounter personal risk when providing care to patients with known and unknown, communicable or infectious diseases, as well as in other dangerous situations...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides, {{among other}} things, that “everyone {{has the right}} to an {{adequate}} standard of living…including the right to housing. ” 1 This has been defined by the first Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as, “the right of every woman, man, youth and child to gain and sustain a safe and secure home and community in which to live in peace and dignity. ” 2 As with other Economic and Social Rights International Law requires the progressive realization of the right, to the maximum of the country’s available resources, in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner.</b> Sadly, in many countries in the world, Kenya included, the gap between housing rights rhetoric and realization is extremely broad. A recent report on the right to housing under international law, prepared by the UN, opens by stating that the right to housing is a ‘fundamental human right’, and that it has been recognized by “over 100 constitutions”. 3 The reality however remains that despite this constitutional recognition and the central place of this right within the global legal system; well over a billion people are not adequately housed. Millions around the world live in life or health threatening conditions, in overcrowded slums and informal settlements, or in other conditions which do not uphold their human rights and their dignity. Further millions are forcibly evicted, or threatened with forced eviction, from their homes every year. 4 This begs the question, what is the value of recognition? Does it translate into actual justiciability for those whose rights are violated? And perhaps more importantly, how are these rights to be adjudicated, especially in developing countries like Kenya where governments neither have the resources nor the ability to provide housing for huge proportions of their populations who live in crippling poverty...|$|E
40|$|Establishment {{in foreign}} {{countries}} can be achieved through a subsidiary company or a permanent establishment. Profit of a subsidiary company is normally taxed {{in accordance with the}} law of the country of where it is established, since a subsidiary company constitutes a separate legal entity. A permanent establishment on the other hand is not a separate legal entity, therefore profit in a permanent establishment is usually added on to the company’s total profit and taxed in accordance with the law of the country of where the company is established. Establishing business activities {{in foreign countries}} do normally not create problems, unless the business is carried on in a low tax jurisdiction. If that is the case, unlimited opportunities are created for companies to circumvent domestic taxation by transferring profit to the low tax jurisdiction, which in turn decreases the domestic tax base. In Sweden this kind of circumvention is precluded by chapter 39 a ITA, in the meaning that a shareholder in a foreign company can be tax liable of low taxed profit in a foreign. The question that arises is whether chapter 39 a ITA infringes on freedom of establishment. The outcome in the analysis {{is that there is a}} likeliness that chapter 39 a ITA constitutes a restriction on the freedom of establishment. The escape provided in article 52 TFEU cannot justify the measure. Nor is it likely that the measure can be justified by the rule of reason. In the light of the assessment done in the analysis, it can be concluded that the chapter 39 a ITA is applied in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner,</b> satisfies a mandatory requirement (prevention of tax avoidance) and is regarded as appropriate in securing the achievement of the objectives. But there is a potential risk that measure will fail in the proportionality test...|$|E

The organisation comprises Travellers, Roma {{and members of the}} majority population working in partnership {{to address the needs of}} Travellers and Roma, who as minority ethnic groups experience exclusion and marginalisation. Travellers and Roma are among the most marginalised groups in Irish society and along with other marginalised groups have been disproportionately impacted by austerity measures. In this context, Pavee Point’s priority for the next budget is ensuring adequate incomes of the poorest individuals and families, along with the availability of high quality, intercultural public services. This entails the application of equality, anti-racist and human rights principles to budget decision-making. Given the role that the community sector plays in supporting marginalised groups, this budget should also support and invest in community sector initiatives that support Roma and Traveller inclusion. Pavee Point acknowledges the serious financial situation in which Ireland finds itself and the obligations that Ireland has to the EU/ECB/IMF. It is clear that tough budgetary decisions will have to be taken. In this context, we welcome the restatement of the commitment to protect the most vulnerable in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The Public Service Regulations (PSR) 2001, Part VIII, {{introduced}} a performance management and development {{model for the}} South African Public Service. This model's main aim is to manage performance in a consultative, supportive and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> {{in order to enhance}} organisational efficiency and effectiveness, accountability for the use of resources and the achievement of results. It is necessary for the public sector institutions to have performance management systems in place in order to measure the overall performance of the institutions. Such systems should also assist to identify skills gaps or training needs amongst employees. A comprehensive Performance Management System (PMS) should be linked with the human resource development within institutions in order to close the skills gaps by sending employees for training. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the main perceptions of employees and to determine their level of awareness regarding the PMS and its implementation. To reach this primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were considered as relevant. These include exploring the principles, theories and models of Performance Management; identifying the typical elements that should be included in a comprehensive Performance Management System; analysing the statutory and regulatory guidelines pertaining to the development and implementation of a PMS in the South African Public Service; identifying typical challenges that responsible managers in the Office of the Premier experience in the implementation of the PMS; and developing guidelines and recommendations for a more effective implementation of the PMS to enhance best practice and statutory compliance as well as to overcome typical challenges currently experienced with its implementation. The research was conducted at the Office of the Premier in the Limpopo Province. It comprised of a literature study and an empirical survey using a questionnaire to obtain information from selected staff members and managers. Respondents were tested on their perceptions regarding the implementation of the PMS in the Office of the Premier. The findings demonstrated that the existence of performance management system does not guarantee automatic perfection in performance. The merit is how effective an institution can apply performance management in combination with an entire set of functional policies, systems and instruments to improve its impact on service delivery.

40|$|M. Development and Management, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) {{is powered}} by the Public Service Regulations Government Notice No R 441 of 25 May 2001 (as amended) chapter 1, Regulation VIII, Section A, that {{outlines}} the principles of managing performance stating that Departments shall manage performance in a consultative, supportive and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> {{in order to enhance}} organizational efficiency and effectiveness, accountability for the use of resources and the achievement of results. It is witnessed through personal observation and personalized interviews with some of the employees that supervisors and managers of the delegated units within the GDE does not take initiative to guide, inform and aware their subordinates regarding the availability of services benefits within the organization. It is furthermore related to the challenge regarding lack of training and informative sessions within the organization. In order to improve these challenges, the hypothesis for the study was formulated as 'the effective service benefits may improve employee performance at Gauteng Department of Education'. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with respondents from senior management, employees and officials. This included qualitative questionnaires to obtain their opinion on the impact of the service benefits for enhanced employee performance at GDE. The convenient sampling was utilized to approach target population in order to obtain responses. The findings explored that the GDE needs to facilitate information sessions guiding the employees at lower management levels regarding the job description and job specification requirements of the top and middle management levels. The information regarding the tasks and responsibilities associated with the position/rank are linked with remuneration packages and service benefits. The GDE furthermore needs to inform employees that the service benefits are equally considered at different levels of management horizontally. The service benefits differ at different levels of management on vertical basis based on job requirements in the organization. The study concludes that the GDE needs to understand that there are implications of salary levels to employees' performance at the workplace. Employees who are not financially secured and satisfied with service benefits are concerned regarding the cost of living. This concern may have negative impact on employees' motivation and morale to reflect better productivity in the organization. It is recommended to further explore the possibility of establishing a macroanalytical correlation between 'service benefits of employees' and 'organizational efficiency' for improved delivery of services.

Language barriers, which thus appear, could present us a life challenge {{to live with}} others or just {{an important part of}} an identity that can cause us to be often disqualified from the society and labelled as “different”. When speaking about the role of a children linguistic discrimination in a kindergarten, we think about qualified professionals, kindergarten teachers and kindergarten teacher assistants that have an important and responsible role in the linguistic discrimination identification as well as a task to educate in a positive manner future democratic individuals that are able to listen to other human beings, their rights and needs, the latter confirmed also by the research results. In the empirical part of the study I tried to investigate throughout a questionnaire linguistic expressions of discriminatory discourse in kindergarten or to assess how the discrimination is manifested in child's speech. I used the qualitative research design, based on a descriptive, non experimental, causal method. A study involved 296 participants, among them were 228 kindergarten teachers and 68 kindergarten teacher assistants. The study confirms: that kindergarten teachers and kindergarten teacher assistants recognize children linguistic discrimination in kindergarten mainly through conversation with children, that children linguistic discrimination is expressed due to lack of communication experience with peers and last but not least, among discriminatory factors affecting children’s verbal expression mostly or most frequently underlined are language, national and ethnic origin. Any discriminatory action breaches human dignity, human values and rights. Acting in a <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> is important for us, our children, family and society in general. It is important to know that the discrimination exists and we can tackle it, only if we are able to recognize and note it. Every individual is a part of a society which is comprised of diversities among us. Therefore, we all are important and we all deserve to be treated with respect, regardless of who and what we are. Qualified professionals in kindergarten should be a clear example for children and {{they should be able to}} show them and teach them how to appreciate themselves, their beliefs and values as well as values and personalities of others. It is my belief, that the preschool period is crucial for the development of non-discriminatory action, because preschool age children will someday become responsible citizens of our society, and thus a reflection of our education and our attitude. ...|$|E

The {{manner in which}} governments, {{national}} and international organisations and the media report on the HIV epidemic in situations of conflict, post-conflict and reconstruction can have unintended and negative consequences for those affected populations. The media in particular has a huge influence on how the world observes and reacts to the HIV epidemic among conflict-affected and displaced populations. Discussion Three case studies focused on Sudan, Uganda and Guinea describe what the media reported and why the reports were incomplete, misleading or incorrect. The exploration of possible ways {{to ensure that the}} media do not unwittingly inflame delicate and complicated situations of HIV among conflict-affected and displaced populations is then undertaken using epidemiological and journalistic principles. The discussion is divided into four sections: 1) Avoid stigmatising statements and ensure a balanced view; 2) Avoid accurate but misleading statements; 3) Avoid inaccurate statements by clearly stating sources and verifying their credibility; and 4) Do not repeat data and conclusions from other news sources without checking their accuracy. The aim of this manuscript is to stimulate awareness and debate among persons and organisations working on HIV/AIDS as well as the media in order to improve dialogue and ultimately to reduce stigma and discrimination amongst an already vulnerable group – conflict-affected and displaced persons. Summary The media and humanitarian organisations have published misleading and inaccurate HIV data and statements on conflict-affected and displaced populations in Sudan, Uganda and Guinea. Given the unique characteristics of the HIV epidemic and conflict-affected and displaced populations, the media have a special obligation to report in a balanced and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>manner</b> that may go beyond the accepted standards of journalism. The media may wish to have the HIV data and their interpretation reviewed by technical experts before going to press. Specific training for reporters and editors regarding ethical issues and basic epidemiological methods may help them to better understand the complexity of the situation and report more accurately; similar training for media watch groups and human rights organisations may improve the monitoring of such situations and possibly reduce misreporting and subsequent discrimination. More rigorous HIV biological and behavioural surveillance should be undertaken in situations of conflict and displacement and humanitarian guidelines should be integrated with guidance on media relations and reporting responsibilities of humanitarian agencies. Finally, humanitarian agencies must ensure the data they release are sound and that any biases are clearly stated. Improved communication with the media will help to ensure more accurate reporting and interpretation. </p...|$|E
