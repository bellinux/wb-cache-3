These fans are driven by electric motors deriving power from twin generators driven by turboshaft engines. Turboelectric distributed hybrid propulsion has the potential to dramatically increase the propulsive efficiency of aircraft. The noise and exhaust emission estimates presented here are generated using NASA's conceptual design systems analysis tools with several key modifications to accommodate this unconventional architecture.

40|$|As {{we look to}} the future, {{increasingly}} stringent civilian aviation noise regulations {{will require}} the design and manufacture of extremely quiet commercial aircraft. Also, the large fan diameters of modern engines with increasingly higher bypass ratios pose significant packaging and aircraft installation challenges. One design approach that addresses both of these challenges is to mount the engines above the wing. In addition to allowing the performance trend towards large diameters and high bypass ratio cycles to continue, this approach allows the wing to shield much of the engine noise from people on the ground. The Propulsion Systems Analysis Office at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field conducted independent analytical research to estimate the noise reduction potential of mounting advanced turbofan engines above the wing. <b>Certification</b> <b>noise</b> predictions were made for a notional long-haul commercial quadjet transport.

40|$|The current {{fleet of}} large {{commercial}} aircraft has successfully achieved FAA <b>noise</b> <b>certifications</b> because of, in part, the successful application of uniform passive duct liner treatments to control engine system noise. One goal of NASA's engine system noise reduction {{program is to}} develop technologies to improve the sound absorbing properties of duct liner treatments so that they remain effective in modern turbo fan engines. One such technology being studied is checkerboard or periodic axially and circumferentially segmented liners. A preliminary assessment of the potential of this technology was conducted by applying uncertainties associated with manufacturing, installation, source structure, and tonal frequency to a liner developed using deterministic design methods and generating a measure of improvement {{with respect to a}} uniform liner subjected to the same uncertainties. Deterministic design and analysis of the candidate checkerboard liner showed that it obtains a 1. 5 dB per duct aspect ratio improvement in liner attenuation over a similarly designed uniform liner. When uncertainties in liner impedances, source structure, and frequency are considered, the performance of the checkerboard liner drops off dramatically. The final results of this paper show that the candidate checkerboard liner has a less than 25 percent chance of outperforming the uniform liner when moderate levels of uncertainty are considered. It {{is important to note that}} this study did not include the effects of mean flow on liner performance and, more important to note, that as a gradient based optimization process was used to design the checkerboard liner, it is almost certain that a global optimal design was not found for the candidate checkerboard liner.

In particular, noise levels (including noise from the cab horn), vibration, and excessive cab-temperatures in hot weather have brought serious complaints. The cab is not isolated from the main frame, causing engine noise to be the dominant background noise; notwithstanding the implications for safety (audibility of warning signals etc.), {{and the potential for}} hearing damage in the long term, the conditions drivers face led to threats of industrial action in the UK in 2007, and an agreement for increased pay for drivers using this type of locomotive (in Norway).

40|$|The Counter-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR) concept, though {{promising}} {{a much better}} propulsive efficiency than future turbofans, still presents challenges regarding installation on aircraft, <b>noise</b> and <b>certification.</b> Thus, industries and research centers want to develop methodologies for the prediction of performance, aerodynamic loads and acoustics that should be adapted {{to each of the}} design phases. One of the major requirements for moderate-cost methodologies is the accuracy in the prediction of in-plane loads, as they are a major concern in terms of structural sizing, vibrations and fatigue, as well as aircraft stability and balancing. This paper gives a physical insight into CROR in-plane loads thanks to several simulations in HOST, a comprehensive code for the aeromechanic simulation of helicopters based on the lifting-line theory. It shows first some of the main contributors to the phase lag of these in-plane loads. Then, to improve these predictions, an unsteady curved lifting-line theory has been implemented in HOST code. Previous works have addressed the prediction of in-plane loads for the case of a single propeller in high-speed conditions and in incidence. In this paper, the unsteady curved lifting-line methodology is assessed by comparing CFD URANS computations and HOST simulations for the case of a CROR in high-speed conditions and in incidence. Propulsive performance, in-plane loads and blade loadings are compared and discussed. Furthermore, the paper focuses on the understanding of the aerodynamic mechanisms behind the physics of in-plane loads.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of fuel cost escalation and increased stringent engine emission regulations, interest in counter-rotating open rotor engines (CRORs) has been renewed. R&D efforts are currently ongoing to develop the technologies required to ensure the appropriate levels of structural integrity, noise, vibrations and reliability. The assessment {{of the impact of}} the main low pressure preliminary design and control parameters of CRORs on mission fuel burn, <b>certification</b> <b>noise</b> and emissions is necessary to identify optimum design regions. These assessments aid the development process when compromises need to be performed as {{a consequence}} of design, operational or regulatory constraints. These assessments are not possible with the state-of-the-art aero-engine preliminary design simulation tools. Novel 0 -D performance models for counter-rotating propellers (CRPs) and differential planetary gearboxes, as well as 1 -D and 0 -D performance models for counter-rotating turbines (CRTs) were developed and verified using available data. These models were used to create 0 -D pusher geared (GOR) and direct drive (DDOR) open rotor engine performance simulation modules allowing the independent definition of the design and operation of each of the two counter-rotating parts of the CRP and CRT. A multi-disciplinary preliminary design simulation framework was built using the novel engine performance modules together with dedicated CROR aircraft performance, engine geometry and weight, gaseous emissions and <b>certification</b> <b>noise</b> simulation modules. Design space exploration and trade-off studies were performed and minimum fuel burn design regions were identified for both the pusher GOR and DDOR. A 160 PAX aircraft flying a business mission of 500 NM was chosen for these studies. Based on the assumptions made, the main conclusions of these studies are as follows. · Fuel burn reductions of ~ 1 - 2 % are possible through optimised propeller control · The propeller diameter for minimum mission fuel burn lies between 4. 26 and 4. 7 m · The design nozzle pressure ratio for minimum mission fuel burn lies between 1. 55 and 1. 6 · CRPs with 13 or 14 blades per propeller provide minimum mission fuel burn · Increasing spacing between the propellers reduces noise significantly (~ 6 EPNdB for each certification point) with a relatively small fuel burn penalty (~ 0. 3 - 0. 5 %) · Relative to unclipped designs, 20 % clipped CRPs reduce flyover noise by at least 2. 5 EPNdB and approach noise by at least 4. 5 EPNdB. The corresponding fuel burn penalty is ~ 2 % for a GOR and ~ 3. 5 % for a DDOR. · Sideline and flyover noise can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the CRP and appropriately controlling CRP rotational speeds. Approach noise can be reduced by either reducing the diameters or the rotational speeds of the propellers. · The rotational speed of the forward propeller for minimum noise is higher than that for minimum mission fuel burn for all the studied CROR designs. · Regardless of clipping, reducing the rotational speed of the rear propeller relative to the forward propeller reduces noise and, to a certain limit, also mission fuel burn. (further reductions in rotational speed would have an adverse effect on fuel burn) · An increase in the number of blades results in an increase in <b>certification</b> <b>noise.</b> The main recommendations for further work are as follows. · Integrating the 1 -D CRT model with the 0 -D DDOR performance model in order to assess the impact of different CRT design criteria at engine and mission levels · Developing preliminary design methods to account for changes in aircraft weight and aerodynamics due to changes in engine design and required cabin noise treatment...|$|R
