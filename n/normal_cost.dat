25|$|Also {{known as}} distressed or expired stock, distressed {{inventory}} is inventory whose {{potential to be}} sold at a <b>normal</b> <b>cost</b> has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products which have reached their expiry date, or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing which is out of fashion, music which is no longer popular and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment which is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it, along with products which use that type of equipment e.g. VHS format equipment and videos.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method to}} convert the <b>normal</b> <b>costs</b> and actuarial liabilities published by {{state and local government}} retirement systems for their defined benefit pension plans to measures consistent with national income accounting principles. It also standardizes the measures using a common discount rate. The method is applied to data for the years 2000 to 2006 to generate a set of national and state estimates of employer <b>normal</b> <b>costs</b> and liabilities which are then used to improve the estimates of compensation and property income in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Using a 6 % discount rate, our estimated liability of state and local government retirement systems is about 4 % lower than the published liability for 2006 and our estimate of <b>normal</b> <b>costs</b> is about 48 % higher. Adopting these estimates would add $ 105 billion (or about 1. 0 %) to personal income in 2006. Revisions to state estimates of personal income would range from a 0. 7 % reduction in West Virginia to a 2. 3 % increase in New Jersey. ...|$|R
2500|$|Most of the {{smuggling}} of Tamil {{people to}} western countries {{was carried out}} by LTTE. It had largely benefited from this.

2500|$|In the New Testament, {{the gospels}} {{refer to the}} denarius as a day's wage for a common laborer (Matthew 20:2, John [...] 12:5). In the Book of Revelation, during the Third Seal: Black Horse, a choinix (or quart) of wheat and three quarts of barley were each valued at one denarius. Bible scholar Robert H. Mounce says {{the price of the}} wheat and barley as {{described}} in the vision appears to be ten to twelve times their <b>normal</b> <b>cost</b> in ancient times. Revelation describes a condition where basic goods are sold at greatly inflated prices. Thus, the black horse rider depicts times of deep scarcity or famine but not of starvation. The English word [...] "quart" [...] translates choinix. Apparently, a choinix of wheat was the daily ration of one adult. Thus, in the conditions pictured by Revelation 6 the normal income for a working-class family would buy enough food for only one person. The less costly barley would feed three people for one day's wages.|$|E
6000|$|If {{one dollar}} covers {{the expense of}} making one spade, then when a [...] spade, by virtue of a sudden demand, rises in value to one dollar [...] and ten cents, the {{manufacturers}} get an extra profit of ten cents. [...] This could not long remain so, because other capital would enter [...] this industry, and so increase the supply that one spade would [...] sell for only one dollar; then all would receive the average [...] profit. If, owing to a cessation of demand for spades, the price [...] fell to ninety cents, then the manufacturers would lose ten cents [...] on each one made and sold. Thereupon they would cease to do a [...] losing business, capital would be withdrawn, and spades would not [...] be made until the supply was suited to the necessary expense of [...] making them (one dollar). In this way, whenever there is a [...] departure of the value from the <b>normal</b> <b>cost,</b> there is set in [...] motion ipso facto a series of forces which automatically [...] restores the value to that cost. So here again we see the nature [...] of an economic law: the value may not often correspond exactly [...] with cost of production, {{but there is a}} tendency in all values [...] to conform to that cost, and this tendency they irresistibly obey.

50|$|In the United States, the IFP {{designation}} {{is given}} by both state and federal courts {{to someone who is}} without the funds to pursue the <b>normal</b> <b>costs</b> of a lawsuit or a criminal defense.

50|$|Variable {{costs are}} costs that change in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. Variable costs are also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also be considered <b>normal</b> <b>costs.</b> Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct costs, however, are costs that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing overhead costs are variable costs that are indirect costs, not direct costs. Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R
