Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of these cut outs is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish {{destroyed}} all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs. Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These cut outs are also <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as those made for ritual, with changes made {{in order to keep the}} ritual aspect separate.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{hostilities}} {{between the}} North and South, {{the majority of}} European maritime powers had declared the practice of privateering to be illegal by the Declaration of Paris (1856). According to the treaty, privateers of signatory nations were strictly illegal and if caught they could be seized by the ships of any other signatory nation and tried in that nation's courts. However, they were <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as pirates. Privateers enjoyed limited legal status {{if they did not}} murder and if they behaved generally according to the laws of their sponsoring non-signatory government. Thus acting, they were not subject to the death penalty as if they were rogue buccaneers. True piracy was a crime everywhere and the death penalty for piracy was accepted worldwide. In 1856, the United States had declined to ratify the Declaration, or Treaty, of Paris in order to preserve the rights of a smaller fledgling nation against the larger maritime powers of the day. Now Lincoln wanted exactly the same protection against privateers as the European powers did in 1856, which the United States had denied. As a non-signatory of the Treaty, Lincoln could have legally raised a call for privateers himself, but he had much to lose by engaging in the practice because it could have stirred the wrath of the greatest maritime powers on earth, Great Britain, France and Spain, whom he wished instead would join in condemnation of the Confederacy as an illegal government. The Confederate States had little to lose and much to gain if they could neutralize the United States Navy and force the world to see them as a respectable world power. Surely, they believed, recognition of Southern sovereignty would follow.|$|E

500|$|As {{the serial}} progressed, Pauline contends with {{a plethora of}} family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, {{attracting}} 19million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: [...] "To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment." [...] The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles {{to come to terms}} with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: [...] "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New England Barn was {{the most}} common style of barn built in most of the 19th century in rural New England and {{variants}} are found throughout the United States. This style barn superseded the ”three-bay barn” in several important ways. The most obvious difference is the location of the barn doors on the gable-end(s) rather than the sidewall(s). The New England and three bay barns were used similarly as multipurpose farm buildings (housing animals, crop storage and other uses all in one building) but the New England barns are typically larger and have a basement. Culturally the New England Barn represents a shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming thus are larger and show significant changes in American building methods and technologies. Most were used as dairy barns but some housed teams of oxen which are generally called teamster barns. Sometimes these barns are simply called “gable fronted” and “gable fronted bank barns” [...] but these terms are also used for barns other than the New England style barn such as in Maryland [...] and Virginia which is <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style as found in New England.
