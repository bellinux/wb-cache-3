40|$|Much {{has been}} written about volunteers who offer <b>nursing</b> <b>aid</b> during times of {{conflict}} or natural disaster both before and since Florence Nightingale's high profile mission in the Crimean war. Adventure and travel, religious conviction, national pride and a desire to care for the wounded are cited as motivators. Military nursing is now well established, the lack of immediate threat of war or invasion removes any perception of necessity to volunteer and the secularisation of health care minimises the presence of religion as a factor. Furthermore women can travel and seek adventure without further justification than the pleasure of doing so. This research grew out of curiosity to understand in what ways nurses, who volunteered for humanitarian work {{at the close of the}} 20 th century, were similar to those who did so 100 years earlier. Following ethical approval oral histories were recorded with 7 nurses, who happen to be female, who worked for Médecins Sans Frontières during the 1990 s and early 2000 s. Médecins Sans Frontières was chosen as it espouses a strongly secular and international philosophy. Their histories illuminate the ways in which they came to work for Médecins Sans Frontières, locating their experiences within their life story and identity as nurses and women. Drawing on extracts from the oral history accounts, this paper will explore the extent to which motivations have remained constant over time, and the way in which their ordinary and extraordinary experiences coexist...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionAggressive {{behaviours}} of brain-injured persons put in difficulty care-work and are {{a source}} of uncertainty in the therapeutic relationship. These behavioural disorders are inherent to brain injuries, to the person and to the context (Eames, 1988). The contextualisation of the therapeutic relationship (Morin & Apostolidis, 2002) allows us to consider the role of psychosocial prebuilts whose caregivers use to structure and contain critical situations by directing their actions. ObjectiveThis study seeks to highlight the role of social representations (Jodelet, 1989) of <b>nurse</b> <b>aids</b> about brain-injured person in the adjustments made by these caregivers to build and maintain a quality therapeutic relationship in a context of uncertainty. MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with <b>nurse</b> <b>aids</b> (n= 23, 22 females, average age 37. 5 years, average length of service 8. 5 years) working in the host institution on the long time. The interviews were the subject of a thematic content analysis (Flick, 2014). ResultsThe content analysis shows that <b>nurse</b> <b>aids</b> perceive brain-injured persons with various disorders, multiple and changing. Caregivers have an organization of sequelae profiles incorporating a specific profile: the “frontals”. The contents of these representations can explain the aggressive behaviour according to the personality of the brain-injured person, brain injury, cognitive impairments and the characteristics identified of its sequelae profile. This common knowledge allows caregivers to determine the status of “consciousness” of the person about his aggressive behaviour. The analysis shows that caregivers use specific care practices according to that state of “consciousness”. These practices are oriented on the person, the environment or the caregiver himself. DiscussionIn this context of care for brain-injured persons, caregivers explain aggressive behaviours by drawing on common theories and aetiologies allowing them to put meaning to care situations, adapt and ensure relational work. Training on and by the representations of caregivers can contribute to better care of brain-injured patients...|$|R
