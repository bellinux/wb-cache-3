5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E

5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} young, Sam breaks into the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn called the police before she knew that the boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease and the boys are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that they can become explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E

25|$|In January 1836, Maria Isabella {{served as}} a godmother to her {{grandson}} Francisco, Duke of Calabria. In March that same year, the Prince of Capua contracted a morganatic marriage.

Ferdinand II did not forgive his runaway brother: Capua went into permanent exile in England, and Maria Isabella <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Espada {{lost his}} bid for re-election, but was later elected to {{represent}} the South Bronx in the State Senate again, even {{as he continued to}} maintain residence in Mamaroneck. He claimed a co-op apartment in Bedford Park as his district residence. Several residents of the Bronx co-op said they <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> there. The Bronx County District Attorney opened an investigation, and the resulting media attention forced Espada to move into his vacant Bronx apartment.|$|E

I never counted the leaps of the swordfish. I <b>never</b> clearly <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> after that first leap. He seemed only a gleam in flying spray. Still, I did not make any mistakes.|$|R
25|$|Eddy Merckx {{dominated}} world {{racing in}} both classics and stage races but couldn't win the Ronde. By 1969 {{he had not}} only frustration to contend with but rising resentment of other riders unhappy that he won so many races. He attacked early and half the field <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again. The other half was reduced with each successive attack until he got clear alone. The chase was furious but ineffective and Merckx won by more than {{five and a half}} minutes over Felice Gimondi and more than eight minutes on the rest. The Ronde remained an unhappy race for him; it was another six years before he won again.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. He {{told them he}} was working on getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job and that he was researching cave diving with an eye toward getting that certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14–15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. They <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E

Not unless being born of a mother who scarcely knew him, of a father who <b>never</b> even <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> and being brought up among white men and wild beasts less cruel than they were, could make him one!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{days were}} uneventful because, while {{always looking for}} Jim Cleve, she <b>never</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> Several times she heard his name mentioned. He was here and there--at Beard's off in the mountains. But he {{did not come to}} Kells's cabin, which fact, Joan gathered, had made Kells anxious. He did not want to lose Cleve. Joan peered from her covert in the evenings, and watched for Jim, and grew weary of the loud talk and laughter, the {{gambling}} and smoking and drinking. When there seemed no more chance of Cleve's coming, then Joan went to bed.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the fall}} of the Manchu dynasty in 1912, several {{competitive}} forces battled to gain control of China. During the ensuing years, the Kiangyin Mission was regularly confronted with periods of turmoil prompted by the beginnings of the Republic of China, the dangerous warlord years, the resentment over many real and imagined oppressions by the West, the early years of Communism, the rising threat of Japan, and finally, the Sino-Japanese War itself. A fellow missionary later reflected on Moffett, “The strains and the stresses of the years cannot be fully understood or appreciated by any except those who experienced them. In all that time, I <b>never</b> once <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> lose his poise or seem to be confused.” ...|$|R
500|$|Kim Novak, {{who worked}} on Hitchcock's 1957 Vertigo, disputed Hedren's (and the film's) view of the director. Novak told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I feel bad about all the stuff people are saying about him now, {{that he was a}} weird character. I did not find him to be weird at all. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody." [...] Louise Latham, who played Hedren's mother in Marnie, {{dismissed}} claims of Hitchcock's predatory nature in Broadcast magazine: [...] "I find some of the allegations hard to believe...I wasn't aware of her being hassled on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
500|$|A {{contributor}} to Bentley's Miscellany wrote in 1846: [...] "To those who <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> description is fruitless; {{to those who}} have, no praise comes up to their appreciation of him. We therefore shake our heads and say 'Ah! You should have seen Grimaldi!'" [...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." [...] The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant {{the end of a}} genre: [...] "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mark {{was smoking}} his cigar {{outside the door}} of his house when he saw a man, a stranger, {{approaching}} him. Suddenly he ceased to be visible! Mark, who had long desired to see a ghost, rushed into his house to record the phenomenon. There, seated on a chair in the hall, was the very man, who had come on some business. As Mark's negro footman acts, when the bell is rung, on the principle, [...] "Perhaps they won't persevere," [...] his master is wholly unable to account for the disappearance of the visitor, whom he <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> passing <b>him</b> or waiting at his door--except on the theory of an unconscious nap. Now, a disappearance is quite as mystical as an appearance, and much less common.|$|R
60|$|This {{must be a}} brief note. Belding is waiting, and I used up most of {{the time}} writing to Mercedes. I like Belding. He was not unknown to me, though I <b>never</b> met or <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> before. You'll be {{interested}} to learn that he's the unadulterated article, the real Western goods. I've heard of some of his stunts, and they made my hair curl. Dick, your luck is staggering. The way Belding spoke of you was great. But you deserve it, old man.|$|R
5000|$|Gaston {{was very}} fond of hunting, but was not without a taste for art and literature. Several {{beautiful}} manuscripts are in existence which were executed by his orders, and he himself wrote a treatise on hunting, the Livre de chasse,http://medieval.library.nd.edu/facsimiles/daylife/chasse.html known in English as The Hunting Book. Froissart, who gives a graphic description of his court and his manner of life at Orthez in Béarn, speaks enthusiastically of Gaston, saying: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> one like <b>him</b> of personage, nor of so fair form, nor so well made, and again, in everything he was so perfect that he cannot be praised too much".|$|R
500|$|By autumn 1974, Drake's weekly {{retainer}} from Island had ceased, and {{his illness}} meant {{he remained in}} contact {{with only a few}} close friends. He had tried {{to stay in touch with}} Sophia Ryde, whom he had first met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as [...] "the nearest thing" [...] to a girlfriend in his life, but she now prefers the description [...] "best (girl) friend". In a 2005 interview, Ryde revealed that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: [...] "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again." [...] As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.|$|E

In October, Abdulmutallab told his father via text message saying {{that he did not want}} to attend business school in Dubai, and wanted instead to study Islamic law and Arabic in Yemen. When his father refused to pay for it, Abdulmutallab said he was [...] "already getting everything for free". He text-messaged his father, saying [...] "I've found a new religion, the real Islam", [...] "You should just forget about me, I'm never coming back", and [...] "Forgive me for any wrongdoing, I am no longer your child". The family was last in contact with their son in October 2009.|$|E
500|$|The most {{detailed}} account of Pitman's final fate in the war came from Robert G. Carter. In November 1862, Pitman was captured near Warrenton Junction on the march toward Fredericksburg, Virginia, during the weeks prior to the Battle of Fredericksburg. He had fallen behind the group because his feet had blistered and swollen due to the tightness of [...] "a pair of thin, high-heeled and narrow soled boots" [...] he had purchased. One of his comrades temporarily stayed behind to care for him but later decided {{to move on with}} the rest of the camp for fear of disciplinary consequences of falling out without authority. He was urged to move on, but without much success. Pitman's last words to his comrade were, [...] "I will be in camp by night, good by." [...] His fellow soldiers <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again and considered him missing. Shortly after he was left, a band of Confederate guerrillas under Colonel John S. Mosby captured the weary and defenseless soldier without a struggle. The inscription on his tombstone differs slightly from Carter's account, stating he was captured by J. E. B. Stuart's cavalry instead.|$|E

That vehicle was passing along a {{diverging}} way at a distance of many miles from where he rode. Still he sped onwards, till Tony showed signs of breaking down; and then Jim gathered from inquiries he made that he had come the wrong way. It burst upon his mind that the dairyman, still ignorant of the truth, had misinformed him. Heavier in his heart than words can describe he turned Tony's drooping head, and resolved to drag his way home.|$|R

Now, this our poor fellow citizen, Oliver Proudfute, having been active in spreading these reports, as indeed his element lay in such gossipred, some words passed betwixt him and me on the subject; and, as I think, he left me with the purpose of visiting Henry Smith, for he broke off from the morrice dancers, promising, as it seems, to meet them, as your honour has said, at the sign of the Griffin, in order to conclude the evening.
