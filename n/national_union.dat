5|$|Bruce's {{popularity}} as {{a speaker}} for government recruitment efforts also {{earned him the}} attention of the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal Nationalist Party. As Sir William Irvine had recently resigned from parliament to become Chief Justice of Victoria, there was to be a by-election for his seat of Flinders in 1918, which the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> asked Bruce to stand for. The Nationalist preselection for the seat attracted many candidates, and Sir Edward Mitchell, one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection {{with the help of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Union.</b> A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister William Watt prevented the newly formed Country Party from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from Dandenong out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.|$|E

5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} the Lithuanian <b>National</b> <b>Union,</b> invited the Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of the Lithuanian <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E

5|$|Continued {{problems}} with the food supply, coupled the unpopularity {{of some of the}} government's measures, led to widespread press criticism of the Pierlot government. Strikes across the country in February 1945 further destabilised the government. On 7 February 1945, Pierlot publicly defended the actions of the government in parliament, but failed to make a significant impression. The government fell in February, and was replaced by a new, short-lived <b>national</b> <b>union</b> government under Achille Van Acker while the polemic surrounding the possible dismissal or restatement of Leopold III were considered.|$|E
5|$|Dmowski was {{a deputy}} to the 1919 Legislative Sejm, but he {{attended}} {{only a single}} session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from a lung infection, in Algeria. He reorganized endecja into a new party, Popular <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> (Związek Ludowo-Narodowy). During the Polish-Soviet War {{he was a member}} of the Council of National Defense and a vocal critic of Piłsudski's policies. In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, if somewhat smaller, from what became known as the Dmowski's Line.|$|E

Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of planned liberalism, prioritising cash crops and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.|$|E

However, Scargill had refused to hold a ballot on the strike, having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). This led to the strike being declared illegal.|$|E
