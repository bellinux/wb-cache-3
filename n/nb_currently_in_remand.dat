40|$|This article {{describes}} three studies on {{several aspects of}} police custody in The Netherlands. The first study shows {{that the quality of}} accommodation, facilities, interaction and differential treatment are substandard in Dutch police stations, but dependent of the organisational size, degree of specialisation of the custodial task and extensiveness of duty-prescriptions and registration. Detention circumstances in police stations are worse than <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> centres. The second study reveals high prevalence rates of symptoms of depression and somatisation (SCL- 90) among police custody detainees. Police custody detainees' symptom levels are higher than those in a jail population and a male general population. The third study addresses the prevalence rates of suicides and other deaths in Dutch police custody in the period 1983 - 1993 and shows that the mortality rate, suicide rate and deadly poisoning rate are higher than those <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> centres and the general population. The findings of the three studies demonstrate that police custody is an area of concern. ¬© 2001, MCB UP Limite...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the case of}} a simulation study of the Swedish Prison and Probation system regarded as a queuing system. The situation in Swedish prisons today is not acceptable with a utilisation over 100 per cent. The short-term solution of the problem has been to overcrowd the prisons. The purpose of this work is to describe the relations between waiting time <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> prison, the official number of cells in prisons and the degree of differentiation regarding to the expected torrent of criminals. Differentiation is the attempt to keep different categories of clients apart during their prison time. The degree of differentiation is defined as the number of defined categories used for client placement. The conclusions from this study is that there are not enough number of prison cell available. The situation for male inmates/clients is more critical than for female clients. The results from the study suggest {{that there needs to be}} approximately 11, 000 prison cells in total to meet the unofficial recommendation of a maximum of seven days <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> prison...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years {{situation}} with Tuberculosis (TB) in prison system in Russia has been worsened {{as well as}} in the whole country. High TB rates in prison system reflect not only bad conditions there, but also the economical situation in the country and the health of whole population. In the beginning of 21 st century, the prisons became a mirror of political, socio-economical, and demographical changes in Russia. There is a wide gap between people living in cities and suburbs in income, level of education, and social status. Alcohol and narcotic drugs increase the number of unemployed and homeless people and raise the number of teenagers and adolescents living outside parental control. This, in turn, promotes the growth of crime in the country. According to the WHO, a tuberculosis case is defined as a patient with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis or clinically diagnosed with TB. In the prison system in St. Petersburg the first and quick method for early TB diagnosis is the chest x-ray. It is an obligatory procedure for all newly arrived people. The diagnosis of TB could then be confirmed by smear sputum examinations. Treatment for tuberculosis is also mandatory in prison system, using 3 - 4 anti-tuberculosis drugs and regular follow-up by chest x-ray control. Our studies in St. Petersburg were undertaken to analyse the epidemiology of tuberculosis <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> prisons from 2000 and to estimate risk factors which contribute to TB development during incarceration. Knowledge of the risk factors for TB development helps identify people at risk and guides prevention. Analysis of epidemiological situation <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> prisons can create prophylactic measure or could be premise for new order for TB control in country. Risk of getting TB is increasing during the first 2 years of being <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> prison (SIZO). Therefore, if according to new Federal order (2002), prisoners will be held <b>in</b> <b>remand</b> prison for no more than 6 months, the number of new TB cases will be essentially minimized. This will in turn reduce the impact of non-clinical TB infection and its transmission among prisoners. On one hand, the prisoners, who left SIZO, may contract disease (TB) later, in colony; hence the total number of people who has developed TB in Prison system will remain the same. On the other hand, since conditions of detentions in colony are essentially better one may expect the decrease of total number of people developed TB during the incarceratio...|$|R
