40|$|Abstract—Depletion of <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>source</b> {{of energy}} (fossil fuels like petroleum, coal and natural gas) many {{researchers}} {{are looking forward}} to find an alternative source of renewable energy. One such alternative to diesel fuel is biodiesel. Biodiesel can be defined as fuel comprising of mono alkyl ester of long chain of fatty acid derived from vegetable oil or animal fat. So, there is an increasing interest in India to search for suitable alternative fuels that are environmental friendly. Environmental concerns and limited amount of petroleum resources have caused interests in the development of alternative fuels for internal combustion (I. C.) engines. As an alternative, biodegradable, renewable and sulphur free biodiesel is receiving increasing attention. The use of biodiesel is rapidly expanding around the world, making it imperative to fully understand the impacts of biodiesel on the diesel engine combustion process and pollutan...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{a hybrid}} energy system {{consisting}} of renewable sources of energy, {{there should be some}} storage facility or backup generation to maintain continuity of supply to the load when renewable source alone is not sufficient. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present one of such generating system that is capable of acting as a backup generator. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of a microturbine generation (MTG) system, the <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>source</b> of energy suitable for isolated as well as grid-connected operation. The system comprises of a permanent magnet synchronous generator driven by a microturbine. A brief description of the overall system is given and mathematical models for the microturbine and permanent magnet synchronous generator are presented. The developed models are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink.

Another one is humic substances that are also produced intensively from lignite coal which is a <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>source</b> [4]. This indicates the importance of searching and studying new bio-effectors extracted from sustainable sources. New candidates could be agro-food residues and by-products because they may contain bioactive compounds like proteins, sugars and lipids, and specific aromatic and aliphatic compounds. In addition, they are low-cost and abundant materials. Therefore, valorization of agro-food processing residues is receiving increased attention and interest [5]. New green extraction technologies like green extraction by using nonhazardous solvents aside from minimizing energy consumption {{are one of the}} main purposes that attract attention today [6]. The design of green and nonconventional extraction methods is currently a hot research topic in the multidisciplinary area of applied chemistry, biology, and technology.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{internal}} combustion engines are the essential parts {{of transportation and}} mechanized agricultural system. So the consumption of diesel and petroleum has been upsurged. As petroleum is a <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>source</b> and recent surge in petroleum prices have regenerated interest in bio-fuels. It has shown that biodiesel-fueled engines produce less CO, unburned HC and smoke emissions compared to diesel fuel, but higher NOx emissions. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is an efficient technique to reduce NOx emission as it lowers the flame temperature in the combustion chamber. The objective of this work is to reduce NOx emission from jatropha biodiesel fueled CI engine. A twin-cylinder, water cooled, constant speed direct injection diesel engine was used for this experiment. The content of HC, NOx, CO and smoke in the exhaust gas were measured to estimate the emissions. Application of EGR with biodiesel resulted in reductions in NOx emissions without any significant upsurge in smoke emissions.

40|$|Alternative {{sources of}} low-grade energy are {{becoming}} more important as the costs of energy from nonrenewable resources rise. Agricultural biomass is a <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>source</b> of low-grade energy {{that could be used}} as a heat source, replacing propane fuel for crop drying and space heating. Fuel oil, electricity, and natural gas usage could also be reduced by supplemental heating with biomass-fired heat units. A project supported by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation was undertaken by the Southern Agricultural Research Center (SARC) and the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Montana State University to investigate the feasibility of using agricultural residue from crops raised in Montana to dry perishable grains. The project consisted of construction and testing of a commercially available biomass-fired corn dryer. A direct-fired incinerator-type biomass furnace was constructed, operated, and performance evaluated to determine overall heat conversion efficiency and economics of operation.

A key result of our analytical model is that TGCs may be an imprecise instrument for regulating the generation of green electricity. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the combination of TGCs with a system of tradable emission permits may yield outcomes contrary to the intended purpose.

Moreover, provinces also obtained {{the authority}} to explore and develop both renewable and <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>sources</b> of energy as well as manage facilities (and sites) responsible for generating electricity.

40|$|The use of {{lignocellulosic}} biomass {{has been}} postulated {{as a potential}} pathway toward diminishing global dependence on <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>sources</b> of chemicals and fuels. Before a specific feedstock can be selected for biochemical conversion into biofuels and bio-based chemicals, it must first be characterized to evaluate the chemical composition of the cell walls. Polysaccharides, specifically cellulose and hemicellulose, are often {{the focal point of}} these appraisals, since these constituents are the dominant substrates converted into monomeric sugars like glucose and xylose. These monosaccharides can be transformed, using microorganisms like yeast, into substances such as ethanol. Plant species containing abundant polysaccharides are highly desirable, as higher quantities of sugars should translate into larger end-product yields. Given the vast pool of potential feedstocks, qualitative and quantitative analytical methods are needed to assess cell wall polysaccharides. Many of these tools, such as wet chemical and chromatographic techniques, have been ubiquitously used for some time. Shortcomings in these analyses, however, prevent their usage in screening large sample sets for quintessential, high-yield, fuel-producing traits.

In this chapter, the factors aff ecting sustainable soil use will be elaborated. This is defi ned as factors that: • maintain or improve soil biological, chemical, and physical properties; • maintain an input:output (harvest) ratio greater than one for all macronutrients; • use nutrient inputs, preferably but not exclusively from renewable rather than <b>nonrenewable</b> <b>sources</b> that seek to complement natural nutrient cycling; and • permit the system to recover from the disturbances caused by cultivation and harvest (adapted after Schaller 1993). To address and apply these themes, the attention of this chapter rests predominately on the situation in sub-Saharan Africa. There are good reasons for this geographical focus. In the twentieth century, the green revolution in Asia demonstrated that dramatic yield increases are possible in the poorer tropical regions, achieved by combining fertilizer inputs, better agronomy, improved pest management, soil water management and crop varieties (Huang et al. 2002). These, coupled with development of rural infrastructure, have sustained input supply lines and marketing and value chains.
