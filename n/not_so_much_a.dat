5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|Bradman was on 89 {{and heading}} towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time {{courtesy}} of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times {{so far in the}} Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 {{at the end of the}} third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.|$|E
5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, Chandler focused his {{attacks on the}} Combs {{administration}} rather than the inexperienced Breathitt. A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had {{voted in favor of}} declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried {{all but one of the}} state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.|$|E

25|$|There is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> protest song {{trend in}} France, but rather of a {{permanent}} background of criticism and contestation, and individuals who personify it.

25|$|Critics also {{dispute the}} claim that Centering Prayer is in the {{tradition}} of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative prayer is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates. They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer.|$|E

25|$|In The Rise of American Civilization (1927), Charles and Mary Beard {{argue that}} slavery was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> social or {{cultural}} institution {{as an economic}} one (a labor system).

25|$|His main work in {{this area}} is {{translation}} of Shakespeare's sonnets (1948). This translation has enjoyed great success over the years. Some Shakespeare sonnets in Marshak's translation have been set to music (in classical style by Dmitry Kabalevsky, in pop style by Tikhon Khrennikov, Mikael Tariverdiev, Alla Pugacheva and others, even in rock style — Kruiz). His translations are considered classics in Russia.

25|$|TRW {{suggested}} building three bases with thirty missiles each, {{and estimated}} {{that one of}} the three bases would survive an all-out counterforce attack. To ensure that 600 warheads would survive, each missile would have to carry about 20 warheads. These studies led to the Missile, Experimental, or MX, project, which started in 1971. The design rapidly firmed up, emerging with ten-warheads on more missiles in order to raise the survivors to 1,000 warheads. But the basing became <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> specific concept as a catch-all program for every possible concept, from railway deployments, to underground racetracks, to mobile systems. A review of the options written in the mid-1970s ran into hundreds of pages.|$|E
25|$|Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, {{contended that}} Lindbergh was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> {{supporter}} of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one. Lindbergh's receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh's views were commonplace in the United States in the pre–World War II era. Lindbergh's support for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments {{of a number of}} American people.|$|E
