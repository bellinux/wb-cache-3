At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe.

As Herman of Carinthia wrote {{in one of his}} translations of a history of al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise – the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.|$|E

500|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of Enterprise in early May, Saratoga became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific. Task Force 14, as her group was now known, was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser [...] on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier [...] on 17 May. At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-8. Ramsey's force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on New Georgia and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers. The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided {{to take advantage of}} each carrier's strengths. He ordered that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as Victorious had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than Saratoga; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self-defense and escort duties. Fortunately, Ramsey <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports. Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. Victorious sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for Saratoga.|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E

40|$|Summary Popular parlance {{suggests}} that 'you learn more from your failures than from your successes'. However, {{when it comes}} to failed innovations in organizations, we find that the proverb is not always true. We suggest that instead, failure may often lead to innovation trauma, an inability to commit to new innovations due to severe disappointment from previous innovation failures. We discuss innovation trauma in the context of Sun Ray, the thin-client computing innovation that came out of Sun Labs at Sun Microsystems. Sun Ray was too closely associated with an earlier, highly publicized failure called JavaStation, and <b>never</b> really <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to prove its mettle. We suggest overcoming innovation trauma is a critical but underappreciated aspect of innovation management in companies such as Sun Microsystems that depend on continuous innovation for their competitiveness. Thus the concept has significance beyond this particular case study in that it points to the role emotions play in innovation failure and to the need for managers to mediate such potentially traumatic experiences in order to sustain innovation after serious failures.

50|$|Murphy was {{selected}} 14th {{overall in the}} 2001 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors. After starting slowly, he showed promise {{toward the end of}} the season. He realized this promise in his second pro season, averaging a double-double - 11.7 pts and 10.2 boards - and finishing second in Most Improved Player voting. He also started the Rookie Challenge as the Sophomores' power forward. However, his three-point shooting that was a huge part of his college success was nearly absent, as he only attempted 14 three-pointers during the year, making five.
