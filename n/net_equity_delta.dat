40|$|It is {{twenty-one years}} since South Africa’s {{democracy}} {{and the majority of}} South African households can still be classified as poor, despite the various interventions by Government to reduce poverty and inequality. The measurement used to determine the financial status of a household at a given point in time is its <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> in accordance with its Statement of Financial Position, calculated as its assets owned less liabilities owed. This study aimed to identify the selected significant factors that affect a South African household’s <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value. In order to achieve the aim of this study, a heuristic model consisting of two components was developed. The first component considered which assets and liabilities should be included in determining a household’s <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> and how these assets and liabilities should be valued. The second component identified the selected factors that influence a household’s <b>net</b> <b>equity.</b> The heuristic model was applied to the empirical data using three phases. Firstly, the <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value was calculated for each household. This was followed by an analysis of the selected factors that significantly influence household <b>net</b> <b>equity.</b> The last phase was performed to determine the effect of the identified selected factors in explaining the difference between households that have above average <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> values and those having below average values. The results of the study indicated that 11 selected factors significantly influence the <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value in the South African household’s Statement of Financial Position. Seven of those factors significantly explain between 28, 3 percent and 38, 1 percent of the differences in the <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value of a household when comparing the households with above average <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value with those with below average values. This is useful information for policy makers in identifying the selected factors that will most significantly increase the <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value of a household with a <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> value below the South African average.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The U. S. farm {{sector has}} {{undergone}} dramatic structural change {{during the past}} fifty years, a chief result being {{that the number of}} large farms has increased relative to the number of small farms. Numerous agricultural policies have been instituted, with the partial objective of preserving the family farm. At the same time, {{a number of studies have}} attempted to ascertain the contribution of various forces, including farm programs, toward the observed changes in average farm size. These studies have tended to concentrate on aggregate effects, ignoring farm-level and dynamic effects of program and nonprogram factors on farm growth. The present study overcomes such limitations by utilizing a farm-level dynamic growth model which links consumption, production, and investment decisions. Steady-state comparative static and local comparative dynamic analysis of the dynamic model solutions indicate qualitative effects of program and nonprogram factors on farm growth. Simulation of quantitative effects are conducted on econometric estimates of the dynamic model solutions, using Kansas wheat farm data. Empirical results show that set-aside-percentage-type instruments (required and voluntary set-aside percentages) induce longrun <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> increases in small farms and longrun <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> decreases in large farms. In both size classes, set-aside instruments increase longrun land holdings, the increases being greater in larger than in smaller farms. After considering effects on rented land, the effect of set-aside-type instruments on overall scale of operation is negligible. Payment-rate-type instruments (per-acre deficiency, voluntary and paid diversion payment rates) increase longrun <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> and consumption in both small and large farms. They lead to longrun land ownership increases in small farms and decreases in large farms. However, they lead also to increases in rented land, the increase being greater in larger than in smaller farms. Net effect on scale of operation is nonsignificant. Finally, nonprogram factors affect growth also. Technical change increases <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> and landholding in large farms more than in small farms. In both large and small farms, increases in prices of land's substitutes, lead to <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> increases, whereas increases in prices of complements reduce <b>net</b> <b>equity.</b> In the longrun, output price increases encourage consumption and reduce <b>net</b> <b>equity...</b>|$|R

Moreover, we show that <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> and <b>net</b> debt issuance are positively correlated and both are procyclical for small firms. For large firms <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> issuance is neither cyclical nor correlated with debt issuance. We extend the existing business cycle models with agency costs in two ways.

In our model, aggregate shocks are propagated as in the model without equity issuance, but {{in contrast to the}} standard model they are also magnified and the default rate is countercyclical.

Dynamic panel models using General Methods of Moments techniques are estimated from an unbalanced sample of firms across the major industrialized economies as well as China and India from 1998 to 2008. Results from the full cross-country panel sample found a significant and positive association between R&D expenditures and sales, <b>net</b> <b>equity</b> issuance and lagged real GDP; a negative association was found with the capital to labor ratio. Macroeconomic growth had a positive impact on R&D expenses in each country but was statistically significant only for firms located in Germany, Great Britain, and the US.

From the start of the financial crisis (third quarter of 2007) to its peak (first quarter of 2009), both large and investment-grade non-financial firms show no evidence of suffering from an exceptional systemic credit contraction. Instead of decreasing their cash holdings as would be expected with a temporarily impaired credit supply, these firms increase their cash holdings sharply (by 17. 8 % in the case of investment-grade firms) after the fall of Lehman. Though small and unrated firms have exceptionally low net debt issuance {{at the peak of the}} crisis, their net debt issuance in the first year of the crisis is no different from the last year of the credit boom.
