500|$|Television {{critics were}} {{polarized}} with [...] "Elementary School Musical". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C+' grade. Although he expressed satisfaction towards {{many aspects of}} the episode, such as the character development of Lisa Simpson, VanDerWerff criticized the songs performed in the episode. In response to the appearance of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of the Flight of the Conchords, he stated: [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> the writers wrote new songs for the two guys in Flight of the Conchords to sing [...] but the songs they sang were pretty weak." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was critical of the guest appearances of Michele, Riley, and Monteith, and stated: [...] "Bringing in the Glee kids to sing a take on [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] that was, frankly, awful mostly just felt like an attempt to have guest stars in nothing parts so they could be promoted. In contrast, Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt that the [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] was an enjoyable start to the twenty-second season of the series, and retorted that the appearances of Clement and McKenzie was the highlight of the episode. Similarly, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic wrote, [...] "We actually loved Bret and Jemaine doing what they do best last night: playing characterized versions of themselves. [...] Unlike the Glee kids, our favorite duo from New Zealand were given decent songs and some pretty great lines." [...] Hochberger gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{with his}} {{interest}} in the song, Medley had his doubts because of its length that was then unusually long for a pop song. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he recalled, [...] "We had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> it would be a hit. It was too slow, too long, and {{right in the middle of}} The Beatles and the British Invasion." [...] The song ran for nearly four minutes when released. This was too long by contemporary AM radio standards, as the radio stations then rarely played songs longer than three minutes because longer songs meant that fewer ads could be placed between song sets. Spector however refused to cut it shorter. Following a suggestion by Larry Levine, Spector had [...] "3:05" [...] printed on the label, instead of the track's actual running time of 3:45. He also added a false ending which made the recording more dramatic, and would also trick radio deejays into thinking it was a shorter song.|$|E

2500|$|Leffe was {{overlooked}} by an abbey and a factory and as Infantry Regiment 178 (IR 178) and Infantry Regiment 103 (IR 103) advanced into the area, {{they thought that}} civilians fired on {{them as well as}} the French from Bouvignes on the west bank. Three civilians were shot at the riverbank where they had fled from the soldiers, who later admitted that they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>if</b> the victims had taken up arms. The 3rd Company of IR 178 was ordered to clear Leffe of francs-tireurs, who had supposedly fired at the Germans from a saw-mill. Infantry Regiment 108 (IR 108) and Infantry Regiment 182 (IR 182), accompanied by artillery moved along rue Saint Jacques into the town just north of the bridge, where they were fired on by the French. The Germans killed male civilians during the day and at [...] were shot by IR 108 in the rue des Tanneries. The German troops barricaded streets with furniture and soldiers from IR 182 captured a man on suspicion of firing at them, although he was unarmed and tied him to a barricade as a human shield. When German artillery mistakenly bombarded the force, the man was shot before the Germans withdrew.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{review of}} {{the first six months}} of 2010 in British soap operas, Ruth Deller from lowculture.co.uk wrote about Leon, [...] "As someone who didn't watch E20 and {{therefore}} has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what backstory, <b>if</b> any, these characters had, Leon is probably the worst of the new gang – no family on the square, no distinctive personality, no plotline beyond impregnating Lucy Beale.

[...] A writer for The Northern Echo wondered if Leon, along with Fatboy and Zsa Zsa, brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters. In May 2010, Attwater received a nomination in the [...] "Best Soap Newcomer" [...] category at the 14th TVChoice Awards for his portrayal of Leon.|$|R

40|$|What is {{a multivariate}} spline? C. de BoorAbstract. The various {{concepts}} {{and ideas that}} have contributed to univariate spline theory are considered {{with a view to}} finding a suitable definition of a multivariate spline. In this way, an overview of the existing more or less complete univariate spline theory is given along with a survey of some of the high points of the current research in multivariate splines. My very first paper dealt with multivariate (well, bivariate) splines and I was then quite certain of what a multivariate spline, i. e., a spline function of many variables, might be. Now, many years and several answers later, I am not so sure any more and therefore consider the question worth a forty-minute talk. It is a worthwhile question since univariate splines have been phenomenally successful and one would wish to have available a similarly useful tool for the approximation of functions of several variables. This raises the question of just which features of the univariate spline to generalize. My talk will therefore be in part a survey of the more or less complete univariate spline theory with the aim of deciding which parts to take along into the multivariate context. But before embarking on that discussion, I {{want to point out that}} there is available one way of generalization that is specifically designed to require no thought, <b>no</b> new <b>idea</b> (<b>if</b> this construction is satisfactory for you, I have nothing further to tell you). This is the tensor product construct. Here one takes one’s favorite univariate spline class $ and fashion from it spline...|$|R
