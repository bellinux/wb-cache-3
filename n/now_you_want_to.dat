Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E
2500|$|Though Maywood {{officials}} {{stopped short}} of filing for bankruptcy or even giving up the city's municipal status, the city still faces a serious problem with a huge deficit. The city did keep a few employees as independent contractors when they outsourced most city functions to Bell and police duties to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In September 2010, the troubled nearby city of Bell agreed to cancel the contract to handle the day-to-day operations of neighboring Maywood. Maywood has been overrun with political crises — from recalls to a city clerk {{accused of trying to}} contract a hit man to kill Councilman Aguirre. In early 2006, a newly elected Aguirre called Maywood a [...] "sanctuary city" [...] for illegal immigrants, stating: [...] "I think we needed to amplify the debate by saying that no human being is illegal. These people are here ... making your clothes, shining your shoes and taking care of your kids. And <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> develop this hypocritical policy?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are a horse-thief, {{and stole}} {{one of my}} father's animals last year. <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> steal my deer, but you shall not do it. Dan, he's got to give it up, hasn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|EDGAR. What is it <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> <b>You</b> {{said just}} <b>now</b> <b>you</b> hoped he'd make concessions. <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> back him in not making them. This {{is n't a}} game, Enid! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, {{perhaps you}} may know me, ladies and gentlemen," [...] says Mr. Bucket in a {{confidential}} voice. [...] "I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective, I am; and this," [...] producing {{the tip of his}} convenient little staff from his breast-pocket, [...] "is my authority. <b>Now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. Well! You do see him, and mind you, it ain't every one as is admitted to that honour. Your name, old gentleman, is Smallweed; that's what your name is; I know it well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How? Yes. <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know. After having insulted me {{in return}} for my {{kindness}} in coming to you, you ask me questions. If I tell you how, no doubt you will insult me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary. I quite fancy I'm {{talking like}} a {{business}} man. <b>Now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> realize on those cattle before the winter takes the flesh off them, and extinguish the bank loan with what you get for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite right, quite right, my dear sir,' {{said the}} doctor, mentally noting that Blenkinsopp minor was familiarly known as Guy, not Cyril; 'we're {{delighted to see}} you. And <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know all about our two young friends, don't you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far away to {{the south}} of Africa," [...] {{answered}} Harold. [...] "You know that you can never go back to your own land <b>now,</b> unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be again enslaved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} had a month of it; and I'm having <b>now,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know," [...] Strether continued, [...] "enough to last {{me for the rest of}} my days." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I like that!" [...] cried she. [...] "He's come {{to fetch}} me, Davy." [...] That {{was the first}} time in months her laugh had sounded natural. [...] "I heerd you fetched one gal acrost the mountains, and <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fetch another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't! I {{never meant}} it. Oh dear! I {{never meant to}} be worried about {{troublesome}} things like this till I had got older, and learnt a great deal more; and <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> upset it all. It is very—-very disagreeable." ...|$|E

60|$|JAGO. Don't {{let him go}} up? That's free speech, that is. [He goes up.] I ain't {{got much}} to say to you.

6000|$|... "No. You don't," [...] {{said the}} master, curtly. Bare feet shuffled, disapproving voices murmured all round; {{he went on}} {{as if he had}} not heard:--"You have been skulking nearly all the passage and <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come out.

6000|$|... "You {{may come}} {{and live with}} me again," [...] said Almayer, coldly. [...] "After all, Lingard--whom I call my father and respect as such--left you under my care. You pleased {{yourself}} by going away. Very good. <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come back. Be it so. I am no friend of yours. I act for Captain Lingard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{coming along}} this path if I like," [...] I said. [...] "See? It's a public path--just as {{this used to}} be public land.
