[...] Electrodes are placed over the quadriceps muscles and peroneal nerves bilaterally.

The user controls the <b>neuroprosthesis</b> with two pushbuttons attached to the left and right handles of a walking frame, or on canes or crutches. When the <b>neuroprosthesis</b> is turned on, both quadriceps muscles are stimulated to provide a standing posture. An alternative approach to Kralj techniques is the FES system for walking developed using the Compex Motion <b>neuroprosthesis.</b> Compex Motion <b>neuroprosthesis</b> for walking is an eight to sixteen channel surface FES system used to restore voluntary walking in stroke and spinal cord injury individuals. This system does not apply peroneal nerve stimulation to enable locomotion. Instead, it activates all relevant lower limb muscles in a sequence similar to the one that brain uses to enable locomotion. The hybrid assistive systems (HAS) and the RGO walking neuroprostheses are devices that also apply active and passive braces, respectively. The braces were introduced to provide additional stability during standing and walking. A major limitation of neuroprostheses for walking that are based on surface stimulation is that the hip flexors cannot be stimulated directly. Therefore, hip flexion during walking must come from voluntary effort, which is often absent in paraplegia, or from the flexor withdrawal reflex. Implanted systems have the advantage of being able to stimulate the hip flexors, and therefore, to provide better muscle selectivity and potentially better gait patterns. Hybrid systems with exoskeleton have been also proposed to solve this problem. These technologies {{have been found to be}} successful and promising, but at the present time these FES systems are mostly used for exercise purposes and seldom as an alternative to wheelchair mobility.|$|E

40|$|SummaryNeuroplasticity {{may play}} a {{critical}} role in developing robust, naturally controlled <b>neuroprostheses.</b> This learning, however, is sensitive to system changes such as the neural activity used for control. The ultimate utility of neuroplasticity in real-world <b>neuroprostheses</b> is thus unclear. Adaptive decoding methods hold promise for improving neuroprosthetic performance in nonstationary systems. Here, we explore the use of decoder adaptation to shape neuroplasticity in two scenarios relevant for real-world neuroprostheses: nonstationary recordings of neural activity and changes in control context. Nonhuman primates learned to control a cursor to perform a reaching task using semistationary neural activity in two contexts: with and without simultaneous arm movements. Decoder adaptation was used to improve initial performance and compensate for changes in neural recordings. We show that beneficial neuroplasticity can occur alongside decoder adaptation, yielding performance improvements, skill retention, and resistance to interference from native motor networks. These results highlight the utility of neuroplasticity for real-world <b>neuroprostheses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous works {{exploring}} {{the challenges of}} ensuring information security for neuroprosthetic devices and their users have typically built on the traditional InfoSec concept of the “CIA Triad” of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, we argue that the CIA Triad provides an increasingly inadequate foundation for envisioning information security for <b>neuroprostheses,</b> insofar as it presumes that (1) any computational systems to be secured are merely instruments for expressing their human users' agency, and (2) computing devices are conceptually and practically separable from their users. Drawing on contemporary philosophy of technology and philosophical and critical posthumanist analysis, we contend that futuristic <b>neuroprostheses</b> could conceivably violate these basic InfoSec presumptions, insofar as (1) they may alter or supplant their users' biological agency rather than simply supporting it, and (2) they may structurally and functionally fuse with their users to create qualitatively novel “posthumanized” human-machine systems that cannot be secured {{as though they were}} conventional computing devices.

40|$|Upper limb tremor is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} movement disorder and, unfortunately, it is not effectively managed in {{a large proportion of}} the patients. <b>Neuroprostheses</b> that stimulate the sensorimotor pathways are one of the most promising alternatives although they are still under development. To enrich the interpretation of data recorded during long-term tremor monitoring and to increase the intelligence of tremor suppression <b>neuroprostheses</b> we need to be aware of the context. Context awareness is a major challenge for <b>neuroprostheses</b> and would allow these devices to react more quickly and appropriately to the changing demands of the user and/or task. Traditionally kinematic features are used to extract context information, with most recently the use of joint angles as highly potential features. In this paper we present two algorithms that enable the robust extraction of joint angle and related features to enable long-term continuous monitoring of tremor with context awareness. First, we describe a novel relative sensor placement identification technique based on orientation data. We focus on relative rather than absolute sensor location, because in many medical applications magnetic and inertial measurement units (MIMU) are used in a chain stretching over adjacent segments, or are always placed on a fixed set of locations. Subsequently we demonstrate how tremor parameters can be extracted from orientation data using an adaptive estimation algorithm. Relative sensor location was detected with an accuracy of 94. 12 % for the 4 MIMU configuration, and 100 % for the 3 MIMU configurations. Kinematic tracking error values with an average deviation of 8 % demonstrate our ability to estimate tremor from orientation data.

40|$|Abstract—The adult {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is capable of considerable plasticity, both in health and disease. After spinal neurotrauma, the degrees and extent of neuroplasticity and recovery depend on multiple factors, including the level and extent of injury, postinjury medical and surgical care, and rehabilitative interventions.

Since standard physiotherapies and substitutive solutions only provide a limited degree of restoration of the lost motor behavior in these individuals, novel brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been sought. To develop BCI systems for stroke and SCI individuals, a high-performance electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCI system was developed and tested under several conditions. This system utilized data-driven decoding methodologies to obtain real-time control of several external devices. The external devices that were integrated and tested with this BCI system include a hand orthosis for stroke individuals with hand weakness, a noninvasive functional electrical stimulation (FES) system {{for the treatment of}} post-stroke foot drop, a virtual reality training environment to assess attempted or kinesthetic motor imagery of walking control strategies, a robotic gait orthosis mounted on a treadmill for ambulation training after SCI, and a noninvasive FES device for overground walking for those with paraplegia due to SCI. The BCI systems directed towards the treatment of stroke individuals focused on elementary motor behaviors common in chronic stroke individuals: foot drop and hand weakness (i. e. grasping and extension of the hand). On the other hand, the BCI systems for SCI individuals focused on ambulation after paraplegia. Finally, all systems were tested in both able-bodied individuals and those with stroke or SCI to assess the performance, safety, and applicability of these devices. All BCI systems allowed individuals to control the external devices purposefully in real time. Furthermore, the BCI driven neurorehabilitative therapies and <b>neuroprostheses</b> presented here allowed for stroke and SCI individuals to obtain real-time control of the desired motor behavior using intuitive control strategies after only minimal training, and individuals were able to maintain this high level of control after several days to months.
