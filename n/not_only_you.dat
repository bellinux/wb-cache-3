[...] "A" [...] Pros get the equivalent of National Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. [...] "AA" [...] Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for the best 10 of your finishes will go toward your national rankings. For example, if you participate in 13 national events, your best 10 will be considered and your worst three disregarded. You must meet this qualification on the national level to wear National numbers one though ten on your number plate the following year.|$|E
2500|$|In Leonard Maltin's annual [...] "TV Movies" [...] ratings book, {{the film}} {{receives}} only two-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars, with the critique, [...] "Expensive remake of The Wages of Fear never really catches hold despite a few astounding scenes." [...] In Leslie Halliwell's Halliwell's Film Guide, the evaluation is even more harsh, and the author found the film [...] "truly insulting", going {{as far as to}} say: [...] "Why anyone would want to spend 20 million dollars on a remake of The Wages of Fear, do it badly, and give it a misleading title is anybody's guess. The result is dire." [...] Andrew Sarris in his July 18, 1977, review for The Village Voice summarized the film as [...] "a visual and aural textbook on everything that is wrong with current movies," [...] as well as stating that the movie reset Friedkin's status to the beginning of his career, and compared him unfavourably to Clouzot, John Huston and David Lean, declaring that [...] "he has not come close to matching their craftsmanship." [...] Robert C. Cumbow in the September 1977 issue of Movietone News also panned the film, criticizing camera placement as [...] "faulty", which in his opinion led to substandard exposition. Moreover, he also deemed the film's editing [...] "ridiculous" [...] and thought Sorcerer lacked character involvement. John Marlowe of The Miami News assessed the movie's dialogues unfavourably, stating that [...] "Sorcerer's dialog is kept to such a minimum that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> don't feel for these four losers, but you never really get to know them." [...] He also considered the film's mixture of realist and surrealist moments as [...] "pain in the mind". Peter Biskind described the film as [...] "self-consciously arty and pretentious [...] fatally trapped between America and Europe, commerce and art," [...] claiming the end result represented [...] "the worst of both worlds", as well as noting that the audience of the time was strikingly different from the one that adored The French Connection. Films Illustrated summarized Sorcerer as an inferior sequel, [...] "below the usual par", in spite of the involvement of reputable lead actor Scheider and a [...] "topnotch director", Friedkin. In the August 1997 issue of The Progressive, Kenneth Turan praised the movie's narrative set-up; however, he thought that in spite of it, it was impossible to attach oneself to the characters. He concluded the review by saying that with [...] "films like this, feeling is everything." [...] Gene Siskel claimed that the characters [...] "seem to be a little cold", as well as expressing an opinion that the special effects overpowered the protagonists.|$|E
