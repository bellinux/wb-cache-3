The major objective of each production company is to produce added value, and this is possible if they have like ultimate goal, the reduction of waste. Quality Cost are describe in the specific literature as an iceberg, that containing a conglomeration of waste, and we can see only a little part of it. Usually what we can see are a part of <b>Non</b> <b>Quality</b> cost as rejection parts and the customer returns or official claims. This is the reason we start our analysis with this variables that are the most important component of <b>Non</b> <b>Quality</b> Cost. Because the decrease of <b>Non</b> <b>Quality</b> Cost is proportional with the increasing of Quality Cost, we chose to exanimate the influence of introduction Statistical Control in production– Categories of cost of Conformance (Prevention Cost), in <b>Non</b> <b>Quality</b> Cost. The above study was performed in manufacturing aluminum components during nineteen months. The collected data was then analyzed with a descriptive statistics in order to see the relation between the quality and <b>non</b> <b>quality</b> costs. Results are showing that the <b>Non</b> <b>Quality</b> Cost can be improve if we introduce in production the Statistical Control, that's the reason we propose to plan in advance this quality tools for all the process of production...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates {{integrated}} models joining <b>Non</b> <b>Quality</b> {{effect and}} preventive maintenance (PM) policy. We consider a single machine subject to random failure rate and producing progressive deteriorating products. A preventive maintenance (PM) strategy with minimal repair is applied with non negligible durations of maintenance tasks. This study consists in developing analytical models {{in order to}} determine the optimal integrated maintenance plan taking into account the impact of non-conforming products. Two strategies are developed. The first strategy consists on selling products at a discount price due to the loss of quality caused by the machine degradation. The aim of this strategy is to determine the optimal number of batches produced N* before applying each preventive maintenance action maximizing the total profit (PT) per time unit. For the second strategy, we propose a rework activity for deteriorated products in order to improve their quality condition to be sold at the best price Pmax. For this second approach, our objective is to determine the number of batches sold after a reworking task N 1 and the number of batches sold at a discount price N 2. A mathematical model is developed to find simultaneously the optimal value of the two decision variables N 1 * and N 2 * which maximize the total net profit (PNT) per time unit for a finite horizon H taking into account rework and setup costs. The preventive maintenance action will be undertaking after each N 1 +N 2 batches. Numerical examples are presented in order to illustrate proposed models and a sensitivity study is used to evaluate the influence of model parameters...|$|E
40|$|Presently, we {{are well}} aware that poor quality data is costing large amounts of money to {{corporations}} all over the world. Nevertheless, little research has been done about the way Organizations are dealing with data quality management and the strategies they are using. This work aims to find some answers to the following questions: which business drivers motivate the organizations to engage in a data quality management initiative?, how do they implement data quality management? and which objectives have been achieved, so far? Due to the kind of research questions involved, a decision was made to adopt the use of multiple exploratory case studies as research strategy [32]. The case studies were developed in a telecommunications company (MyTelecom), a public bank (PublicBank) and in the central bank (CentralBank) of one European Union Country. The results show that the main drivers to data quality (DQ) initiatives were the reduction in <b>non</b> <b>quality</b> costs, risk management, mergers, and the improvement of the company's image among its customers, those aspects being in line with literature [7, 8, 20]. The commercial corporations (MyTelecom and PublicBank) began their DQ projects with customer data, this being in accordance with literature [18], while CentralBank, which mainly works with analytical systems, began with data source metadata characterization and reuse. None of the organizations uses a formal DQ methodology, but they are using tools for data profiling, standardization and cleaning. PublicBank and CentralBank are working towards a Corporate Data Policy, aligned with their Business Policy, which is not the case of MyTelecom. The findings enabled us to prepare a first draft of a "Data Governance strategic impact grid", adapted from Nolan& MacFarlan IT Governance strategic impact grid [17], this framework needing further empirical support...|$|E

This study comes from the Essilor Portugal need to reduce the environmental impact and costs of a water consumption of the main processes for producing ophthalmic lenses, but also {{the need to improve}} the quality of the water process due the quality requirements. One of the processes of water treating with an increased use in industrial sector, particularly in processes that require water with very stringent quality characteristics, is reverse osmosis. This process, thanks to its numerous advantages, including the high capacity and effectiveness of treatment, occupying small areas, unnecessary regeneration and energy efficiency has proven to be an economically viable technology. The objectives of this study are based on the evaluation of the environmental and financial benefits due the implementation of water treatment and recirculation by reverse osmosis, in processes of manufacturing of ophthalmic lenses, and also the analysis and optimization of operating conditions. With this system, of water treatment and recirculation, there was a significant improvement in the quality of the water for cleaning of ophthalmic lenses in the coating process (the most demanding in terms of water quality) which serves to protect the surfaces of the lenses from knocks and scratches, giving them hardness and abrasion resistance. The water needs, to clean lenses in the coating process is crucial, to ensure the pre-cleaning of the lens surface before application of the coating and quality of the product, and after the treatment system implementation there were some improvements of the coating process quality service, in terms of <b>non</b> <b>quality</b> costs and process yield. From the analysis of the environmental benefits of the project, we can verifier that there is a reduction of consumption of resources and materials, which translate into a significant positive impact, combined with reduced consumption of water and energy. The present study showed that reverse osmosis is an technology treatment, economically and environmentally feasible for the specific conditions of the project in question, allowing rapid coverage of the initial investment, managing to generate a rate return much higher than the capital cost...|$|E

Resource-allocation models for best effort and guarantee access with preemption for best effort traffic and virtual partition with preemption for all classes are investigated. The analytical models, derived using a -dimensional Markov chain, are solved using preemption rules for these schemes.

So, selection of appropriate services has become an important task while processing the request. Initially, service selection is based on the matchmaking algorithm, but as there are number of identical and overlapping services for a single request, a mechanism needs to be defined to determine which services will participate in selection of the given request. Though ranking methodology considers the need of requestor, it does not consider other constraints like functional and <b>non</b> functional <b>qualities.</b> To meet these kinds of constraints, QoS based web service selection has been chosen.

Therefore, setting an upper bound {{for the number of}} streams (floors) that may be mixed is sine qua <b>non</b> for <b>quality</b> conferencing. The problem of setting an upper bound on the number of floors to support concurrent multi-party audio sessions is addressed. A conjecture based on conversational and qualitative analysis is proposed. A pseudo-measure termed `loudness number' used to manage the number of floors is briefly outlined. The implementation at a functional level on Windows systems has yielded satisfactory performance...|$|R
