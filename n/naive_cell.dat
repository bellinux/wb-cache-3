50|$|There is some {{evidence}} that T cells exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a lower signal threshold to activate T cells that have been previously activated. Ras activation is required for downstream effector functions of activated T cells. Triggering of the T cell receptor induces high levels of Ras activation, which results in higher levels of GTP-bound (active) Ras at the cell surface. Since higher levels of active Ras have accumulated at the cell surface in T cells that have been previously stimulated by strong engagement of the T cell receptor, weaker subsequent T cell receptor signals received shortly afterwards will deliver the same level of activation due to the presence of higher levels of already activated Ras as compared to a <b>naïve</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

Although both populations expressed similar levels of TCR and CD 8, on antigen stimulation in vitro memory T cells down-regulated their TCR faster and more extensively and secreted IFN-γ and IL- 2 faster than <b>naive</b> T <b>cells.</b> Memory cells were also larger, and when freshly isolated from mice they contained perforin and killed target cells without having to be restimulated. They further differed from <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> in requiring IL- 15 for proliferation and in having a greater tendency to undergo apoptosis in vitro. On antigen stimulation in vivo, however, they proliferated more rapidly than <b>naive</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings suggest that, unlike <b>naive</b> T <b>cells,</b> CD 8 memory T cells are intrinsically programmed to rapidly express their effector functions in vivo without having to undergo clonal expansion and differentiation...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> {{is dependent on}} thymic output, but in adults, the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> pool is primarily maintained by peripheral proliferation. <b>Naive</b> T <b>cells</b> have long been regarded as relatively quiescent cells; however, it was recently shown that IL- 8 production is a signatory effector function of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells,</b> at least in newborns. How this functional signature relates to <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> dynamics and aging is unknown. Using a cohort {{of children and adolescents}} who underwent neonatal thymectomy, we demonstrate that the naive CD 4 + T cell compartment in healthy humans is functionally heterogeneous and that this functional diversity is lost after neonatal thymectomy. Thymic tissue regeneration later in life resulted in functional restoration of the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> compartment, implicating the thymus as having functional regenerative capacity.

40|$|Objectives: The {{therapeutic}} {{goal for}} patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is clinical remission. This is best achieved by early diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic intervention. RA is associated with dysregulation of T-cell subsets (naïve, regulatory (Treg) and inflammation-related cells (IRC)) early in the disease. Our aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that T-cell subset quantification can predict the achievement of clinical remission with early treatment in RA. Methods: T-cell subsets were quantified in 108 drug-naïve, early RA patients commencing methotrexate (MTX) or MTX+antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and in 105 healthy controls (HC). The primary outcome assessed was remission (DAS 28 < 2. 6). A pilot study used frozen cells (38 patients and 35 HCs, see online supplementary material) and was validated with fresh blood (70 patients and 70 HCs). Results: Immune dysregulation in early RA was confirmed with an association between age and reduced naïve cells compared with HCs (p= 0. 006), a lower age-adjusted Treg and higher IRC frequency (p= 0. 001). Anticitrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) positivity was associated with lower naïve (p= 0. 031) and Treg frequencies (p= 0. 039). In 50 patients treated with MTX, ACPA/age-adjusted analysis demonstrated that higher <b>naïve</b> <b>cell</b> frequency (relative to HC) was associated with remission (OR 5. 90 (1. 66 to 20. 98), p= 0. 006, sensitivity/specificity 62 %/ 79 %, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) /Negative Predictive Value (NPV) 66 %/ 76 %). Remission with MTX+anti-TNF (n= 20) was not found to be associated with <b>naïve</b> <b>cell</b> frequency, and {{for patients with}} reduced naïve cells the remission rate increased from 24 % (MTX) to 42 % (MTX+anti-TNF). Conclusions: Baseline T-cell subset analysis has a value in predicting early RA remission with first therapy with MTX. Immunological analysis could be used in conjunction with clinical/serological features to predict response to MTX and help select the most appropriate therapy at disease presentation...|$|E
40|$|HIV/AIDS, {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} diseases continues to affect {{the lives of millions}} of individuals worldwide. This retrovirus targets CD 4 T-cell populations, the main driver of the immune system by using the chemokine co-receptor 5 (CCR 5). Despite the success of the highly active antiretroviral therapy in reconstituting the immune system, HIV infected individuals still suffer from low CD 4 T-cell counts. Recently, researchers were able to highlight the success of immunotherapy in restoring the CD 4 T-cell count. To further, investigate such importance, our collaborators at case Western University injected CCR 5 -down-modulated memory CD 4 T-cells into 9 chronically infected HIV patients. Using a linear transitions from the naive to the effector memory state, a non linear ordinary differential equation model was used to model the experiment. Various data fitting techniques in Matlab Stan and Monolix software were used to estimate the model parameters (proliferation, death, transition and birth rates) before and after the initiation of the treatment to study the change of the cell dynamics. Our fittings have indicated an increase in the memory stem and <b>naïve</b> <b>cell</b> lifespan post-clinical trial. Using sensitivity analysis, we showed that the <b>naïve</b> <b>cell</b> birth rate from the thymus lambda, the memory stem cell proliferation rate p_ST and the central memory cell death rate d_C {{played an important role in}} restoring the CD 4 T-cell count. A stochastic model for the CD 4 T-cells population was developed to examine if fluctuations from the stochastic simulation were able to capture the experimental data measurements. The findings of this study indicates the importance of looking further into how modified CD 4 T-cells are able to restore the T-cell counts which thereby decrease the HIV virus pool and help HIV patients to maintain a low level of the virus and most importantly a high level of T-cell count...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{have studied}} two key stages of CD 4 {{development}} {{that serve as}} important checkpoints in determining whether a response will occur, how big it will be, {{and how long it}} will last. The response of naive CD 4 cells is strictly regulated by the requirement for interaction of the potential precursor with an antigen-presenting cellexpressing multiple costimulatory molecules such as B 7 family and intercellular adhesion molecule-i. The extent of <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation is critically dependent on interleukin- 2, whose autocrine production is similarly regulated. We show that effector CD 4 cells can either die, expand, and/or generate memory. Antigen stimulation accelerates death or promotes expansion dependent on the presence of cytokines.

40|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} (DS) {{have low}} numbers of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> and abnormal thymus development and function. Because next to thymic production, peripheral proliferation greatly contributes to <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> generation in healthy children, {{we examined the}} cause of reduced <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> numbers in children with DS. Compared with aged matched controls, {{the total number of}} signal joint TCR excision circles (sjTREC) per ml blood was reduced in DS. Reduced frequencies and absolute numbers of protein tyrosine kinase 7 -positive recent thymic emigrants, but similar levels of <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> apoptosis and Ag-driven activation in DS, suggested that reduced thymic output and not increased peripheral loss of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> caused the reduced sjTREC numbers. We found no support for defective peripheral generation of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> in DS. In DS the <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> responded to IL- 7 and, based on Ki- 67 expression, had similar proliferation rates as in healthy controls. sjTREC content per naive CD 8 (+) T cells was not increased, but even decreased, pointing to increased survival or peripheral generation of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> in DS. In conclusion, we show in this study that reduced thymic output, but not reduced peripheral generation nor increased loss of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells,</b> results in the low <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> numbers found in D...|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} of <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> {{is believed to}} require signals from TCR-pMHC interactions and cytokines such as IL- 7. In contrast, signals that negatively impact <b>naïve</b> T <b>cell</b> survival are less understood. We conducted a forward genetic screening of mice and found a mutant mouse line with reduced number of <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> (T-Red mice). T-Red mice have a point mutation in the Kdelr 1 gene, and their <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> show enhanced integrated stress response (ISR), which eventually induces their apoptosis. Therefore, <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> require a KDEL receptor-mediated mechanism that efficiently relieves cellular stress for their survival in vivo. Interestingly, <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> expressing TCR with higher affinity/avidity to self-antigens survive in T-Red mice, suggesting the possible link between TCR-mediated survival and ISR-induced apoptosis.

Whether chronic immune activation is associated with atherosclerosis in otherwise healthy individuals remains underexplored. We hypothesized that activation of adaptive immune responses, as reflected by higher proportions of circulating CD 4 + memory cells and lower proportions of <b>naive</b> <b>cells,</b> {{would be associated with}} subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods and Findings: We examined cross-sectional relationships of circulating CD 4 + naive and memory T cells with biomarkers of inflammation, serologies, and subclinical atherosclerosis in 912 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Circulating CD 4 + <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> were higher in women than men and decreased with age (all p-values, 0. 0001). European-Americans had higher levels of <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> and lower levels of memory cells compared with African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans (all p-values # 0. 0005). Lower naive/higher memory cells were associated with interleukin- 6 levels. In multivariate models, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and H. Pylori titers were strongly associated with higher memory and lower <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> (all p-values, 0. 05). Higher memory cells were associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) level in the overall population [b-Coefficient (95 % confidence interval (CI)) = 0. 20 (0. 03, 0. 37) ].

40|$|SummaryT cell {{receptor}} (TCR) cross-reactivity between {{major histocompatibility complex}} II (MHCII) -binding self and foreign peptides could influence the naive CD 4 + T cell repertoire and autoimmunity. We found that nonamer peptides that bind to the same MHCII molecule only need to share five amino acids to cross-react on the same TCR. This property was biologically relevant because systemic expression of a self peptide reduced {{the size of a}} <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> population specific for a related foreign peptide by deletion of cells with cross-reactive TCRs. Reciprocally, an incompletely deleted naive T cell population specific for a tissue-restricted self peptide could be triggered by related microbial peptides to cause autoimmunity. Thus, TCR cross-reactivity between similar self and foreign peptides can reduce the size of certain foreign peptide-specific T cell populations and might allow T cell populations specific for tissue-restricted self peptides to cause autoimmunity after infection...|$|E
40|$|Although ligand-free, {{constitutive}} b 2 -adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling {{has been}} demonstrated in <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> lines and in transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac b 2 -AR, {{it is unclear whether}} the dominant cardiac b-AR subtype, b 1 -AR, shares the ability of spontaneous activation. In the present study, we expressed human b 1 - or b 2 -AR via recombinant adenoviral infection in ventricular myocytes isolated from b 1 b 2 -AR double knockout mice, creating pure b 1 -AR and b 2 -AR systems with variable receptor densities. A contractile response to a nonse-lective b-AR agonist, isoproterenol, was absent in double knockout mouse myocytes but was fully restored after adeno-viral b 1 -AR or adenoviral b 2 -AR infection.

40|$|SummaryA naive CD 4 + T cell {{population}} specific for a microbial peptide:major {{histocompatibility complex}} II ligand (p:MHCII) typically consists of about 100 cells, {{each with a}} different T cell receptor (TCR). Following infection, this population produces a consistent ratio of effector cells that activate microbicidal functions of macrophages or help B cells make antibodies. We studied the mechanism that underlies this division of labor by tracking the progeny of single naive T cells. Different naive cells produced distinct ratios of macrophage and B cell helpers but yielded the characteristic ratio when averaged together. The effector cell pattern produced by a given <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> correlated with the TCR-p:MHCII dwell time or the amount of p:MHCII. Thus, the consistent production of effector cell subsets by a polyclonal population of naive cells results from averaging the diverse behaviors of individual clones, which are instructed {{in part by the}} strength of TCR signaling...|$|E
40|$|In T cell-deficient conditions, <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> undergo {{spontaneous}} “homeostatic” proliferation {{in response}} to contact with self-MHC/peptide ligands. With the aid of an in vitro system, we show here that homeostatic proliferation is also cytokine-dependent. The cytokines IL- 4, IL- 7, and IL- 15 enhanced homeostatic proliferation of <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> in vitro. Of these cytokines, only IL- 7 {{was found to be}} critical; thus, <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> underwent homeostatic proliferation in IL- 4 − and IL- 15 − hosts but proliferated minimally in IL- 7 − hosts. In addition to homeostatic proliferation, the prolonged survival of <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> requires IL- 7. Thus, <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> disappeared gradually over a 1 -month period upon adoptive transfer into IL- 7 − hosts.

40|$|Following {{transfer}} into lymphopenic hosts, naive CD 8 T cells proliferate {{and acquire}} memory phenotype. Although the acquired phenotype is stable in recombination activating gene- 1 -deficient (RAG−/−) recipients, in sublethally irradiated mice naive CD 8 T cells of donor origin gradually accumulate. The <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been attributed}} to phenotypic reversion of homeostatic memory cells, implying instability of memory phenotype and restoration of the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> compartment by homeostasis-driven proliferation. We show here that (i) the accumulation of naive CD 8 T cells of donor origin only occurs in recipients that have been irradiated and have an intact thymus; (ii) the apparent reversion of memory to <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> actually results from de novo T cell development of hematopoietic stem cells, present in the donor spleen or lymph node cell populations, in the thymus of irradiated recipients; and (iii) the number of homeostatic memory cells generated in both RAG−/− and irradiated hosts reaches a plateau value and their phenotype is stably maintained even after retransfer into nonirradiated normal mice for 30 days. These findings demonstrate that homeostatic memory T cells do not revert to <b>naive</b> <b>cells.</b> After severe T cell depletion homeostasis-driven proliferation restores only the memory T cell compartment, whereas thymopoiesis is required for the reconstitution of the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> compartment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cells</b> <b>naïve</b> {{to stress}} can display {{the effects of}} stress, such as DNA damage and {{apoptosis}} when {{they are exposed to}} signals from stressed cells; this phenomenon is known as the bystander effect. We previously showed that bystander effects induced by ionising radiation are mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs). Bystander effect can also be induced by other types of stress, including heat shock, but it is unclear whether EVs are involved. Here we show that EVs released from heat shocked cells are also able to induce bystander damage in un-stressed populations. <b>Naïve</b> <b>cells</b> treated with media conditioned by heat shocked cells showed higher levels of DNA damage and apoptosis than cells treated with media from control <b>cells.</b> Treating <b>naïve</b> <b>cells</b> with EVs derived from media conditioned by heat shocked cells also induced a bystander effect when compared to control, with DNA damage and apoptosis increasing whilst the level of cell viability was reduced. We demonstrate that treatment of <b>naïve</b> <b>cells</b> with heat shocked cell-derived EVs leads to greater invasiveness in a trans-well matrigel assay. Finally, we show that <b>naïve</b> <b>cells</b> treated with EVs from heat-shocked cells are more likely to survive a subsequent heat shock, suggesting that these EVs mediate an adaptive response. We propose that EVs released following stress mediate an intercellular response that leads to apparent stress in neighbouring cells but also greater robustness {{in the face of a}} subsequent insult...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTo design {{successful}} vaccines {{for chronic}} diseases, {{an understanding of}} memory CD 8 + T cell responses to persistent antigen restimulation is critical. However, most studies comparing memory and <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> responses have been performed only in rapidly cleared acute infections. Herein, by comparing the responses of memory and naive CD 8 + T cells to acute and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, we show that memory cells dominated over naive cells and were protective when present in sufficient numbers to quickly reduce infection. In contrast, when infection was not rapidly reduced, because of high antigen load or persistence, memory cells were quickly lost, unlike naive cells. This loss of memory cells was due to a block in sustaining cell proliferation, selective regulation by the inhibitory receptor 2 B 4, and increased reliance on CD 4 + T cell help. Thus, emphasizing the importance of designing vaccines that elicit effective CD 4 + T cell help and rapidly control infection...|$|E
40|$|Our {{recent studies}} have shown that immune cell–produced {{complement}} provides costimulatory and survival signals to naive CD 4 + T cells. Whether these signals are similarly required during effector cell expansion and what molecular pathways link locally produced complement to T-cell survival were not clarified. To address this, we stimulated monoclonal and polyclonal T cells in vitro and in vivo with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) deficient in the complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF), and/or the complement component C 3. We found that T-cell expansion induced by DAF-deficient APCs was augmented with diminished T-cell apoptosis, whereas T-cell expansion induced by C 3 −/− APCs was reduced because of enhanced T-cell apoptosis. These effects were traced to locally produced C 5 a, which through binding to T cell–expressed C 5 aR, enhanced expression of Bcl- 2 and prevented Fas up-regulation. The results show that C 5 aR signal transduction in T cells is important to allow optimal T-cell expansion, as well as to maintain <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> viability, and does so by suppressing programmed cell death...|$|E

BSEs have traditionally been associated with radiation. Currently, this phenomenon is at a juncture where nuclear DNA damage is being debated as either essential or nonessential. If DNA damage is essential for the bystander signal (BSS) production then, this raises a number of questions about, radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cancer patients. This review presents a detailed analysis of the work done to investigate nuclear DNA damage versus exclusively cytoplasmic targeting with ionizing radiations and measurement of bystander end-points in naïve cells. The review also analyzes some of the research work done to investigate cell models that were developed specifically to study and track radiation-induced DNA damage to construct mutation spectra.

Indeed, we noted a dramatic decrease in the ability of aged mice to support survival and homeostatic proliferation of <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells.</b> The defect was not due to a reduction in IL- 7 expression, but from a combination of changes in the secondary lymphoid environment that impaired <b>naïve</b> T <b>cell</b> entry and access to key survival factors. We observed an age-related shift in the expression of homing chemokines and structural deterioration of the stromal network in T cell zones.

The full potential of this technology will be realized through development of approaches permitting regulated manipulation of endogenous gene expression with coordinated reexpression of exogenous transgenes.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the pSLIK platform was used to conditionally deplete the expression of the heterotrimeric G proteins G{alpha} 12 and G{alpha} 13 both singly and in combination, demonstrating the G{alpha} 13 dependence of serum response element-mediated transcription. In RAW 264. 7 macrophages, regulated knockdown of G{beta} 2 correlated with a reduced Ca 2 + response to C 5 a.

Here we report comprehensive profiling of cell surface proteins by flow cytometry in naive and primed human PSCs. Several naive-specific, but not primed-specific, proteins were also expressed by pluripotent cells in the human preimplantation embryo. The upregulation of naive-specific cell surface proteins during primed-to-naive resetting enabled the isolation and characterization of live naive cells and intermediate cell populations. This analysis revealed distinct transcriptional and X chromosome inactivation changes associated with the early and late stages of <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> formation.

During the evolution several such mechanisms were developed, of which one relies on a special C(control) protein, a short autoregulatory protein containing an HTH-domain. Given the extreme diversity among restriction-modification systems, one could expect that C-proteins had evolved into several groups that might differ in autoregulatory binding sites architecture. However, only a few C-proteins (and the corresponding binding sites) were known before this study. Bioinformatics studies applied to C-proteins and their binding sites were limited to groups of well-known C-proteins and lacked systematic analysis.

Interestingly, a second CCR 7 ligand, CCL 19, triggered T cell sticking in cremaster muscle venules, but failed to induce extravasation in air pouches. Immunohistochemistry studies implicate ectopic expression of CCL 21 as a mechanism for <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> traffic in human autoimmune diseases. Most blood vessels in tissue samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (85 10 %) and ulcerative colitis (66 1 %) expressed CCL 21, and many perivascular CD 45 RA <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> were found in these tissues, but not in psoriasis, where CCL 21 vessels were rare (17 1 %).

However, this subset is less responsive to signaling via T cell receptor/CD 3 (TcR/CD 3) complex than memory CD 4 + cells. For mitogenic activation of T cells, in addition to triggering of the TcR/CD 3 complex, costimulatory signals are required that can be generated by surface structures present on the antigen-presenting cells. We investigated here whether differences in responsiveness to TcR/CD 3 stimulation of <b>naive</b> and memory <b>cells</b> can be overcome by the costimulatory pathway B 7 /CD 28.

We found that memory cells generated from young CD 4 T cells responded well to antigen, even a year after generation, whereas memory cells derived from CD 4 T cells from aged mice responded poorly both ex vivo and in vivo. Memory cells generated from aged <b>naive</b> <b>cells</b> proliferate less, produce reduced levels of cytokines, and exhibit reduced cognate helper function, compared with memory cells generated by using young <b>naive</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicate that it is the age of the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> when it first encounters antigen, rather than the age when it reencounters antigen, that is critical for good memory CD 4 T cell function...|$|R
40|$|Georgios Pollakis 1 * Background: Although {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) {{has proven}} its success against HIV- 1, the long lifespan of infected cells and viral latency prevent eradication. In {{this study we}} analyzed the sensitivity to ART of HIV- 1 strains in naïve, central memory and effector memory CD 4 + lymphocyte subsets. Methods: From five patients cellular HIV- 1 infection levels were quantified before and after initiation of therapy (2 - 5 weeks). Through sequencing the C 2 V 3 region of the HIV- 1 gp 120 envelope, we studied the effect of short-term therapy on virus variants derived from naïve, central memory and effector memory CD 4 + lymphocyte subsets. Results: During short-term ART, HIV- 1 infection levels declined in all lymphocyte subsets {{but not as much}} as RNA levels in serum. Virus diversity in the naïve and central memory lymphocyte populations remained unchanged, whilst diversity decreased in serum and the effector memory lymphocytes. ART differentially affected the virus populations co-circulating in one individual harboring a dual HIV- 1 infection. Changes in V 3 charge were found in all individuals after ART initiation with increases within the effector memory subset and decreases found in the <b>naïve</b> <b>cell</b> population. Conclusions: During early ART virus diversity is affected mainly in the serum and effector memory cel...|$|E
40|$|Studies of T cell {{responses}} to tumors {{have focused on}} the draining lymph node (LN) as the site of activation. We examined the tumor mass as a potential site of activation after adoptive transfer of naive tumor-specific CD 8 T cells. Activated CD 8 T cells were present in tumors within 24 h of adoptive transfer and proliferation of these cells was also evident 4 – 5 d later in mice treated with FTY 720 to prevent infiltration of cells activated in LNs. To confirm that activation of these T cells occurred in the tumor and not the tumor-draining LNs, we used mice lacking LNs. Activated and proliferating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were evident in these mice 24 h and 4 d after <b>naive</b> <b>cell</b> transfer. T cells activated within tumors acquired effector function that was evident both ex vivo and in vivo. Both cross-presenting antigen presenting cells within the tumor and tumor cells directly presenting antigen activated these functional CD 8 effectors. We conclude that tumors support the infiltration, activation, and effector differentiation of naive CD 8 T cells, despite the presence of immunosuppressive mechanisms. Thus, targeting of T cell activation to tumors may present a tool in the development of cancer immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Is immunosenescence an {{intrinsic}} ageing process leading to dysregulation of immunity or an adaptive {{response of the}} individual to pathogen exposure? Age-associated differences in bone marrow immune cell output and thymic involution suggest the former. Accepted hallmarks of immunosenescence (decreased numbers and percentages of peripheral naïve T cells, especially CD 8 [*]+[*]cells, and accumulations of memory T cells, especially late-stage differentiated CD 8 + cells) suggest the latter, viewed as the result of depletion of the reservoir of naïve cells over time by contact with pathogens and their conversion to memory cells, the basis of adaptive immunity. Thymic involution beginning early in life limits the generation of naive cells such that the adult is believed to rely to a great extent on the <b>naïve</b> <b>cell</b> pool produced mostly before puberty. Thus, these hallmarks of immunosenescence would be markedly affected by the history of the individual´s exposure to pathogens. It would be predicted that in modern industrialized populations, the cumulative effects of antigenic “stressors” would be lower than in less hygienic societies, whereas intrinsic processes might be more similar in different populations. Identifying such stressors and taking steps to nullify their impact could therefore result in delayed immunosenescence and contribute significantly to improving public health. Here, I discuss some of the available data bearing on this prediction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Concomitant with an {{increased}} number of memory-type cells, the amount of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> steadily declines with age. Although the regulatory mechanisms behind this conversion are not fully understood, the suggestion is that both alterations in thymic output and homeostatic signals mold the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> pool. In this study, we identify a new subset of circulating CD 27 (high) CD 45 RA(high) CD 8 + T cells characterized by low IL- 7 Ralpha message and protein expression. Analysis of TCR repertoire and TCR excision circle content together with ex vivo recovery of IL- 7 Ralpha expression indicated that these cells should be placed into the <b>naive</b> T <b>cell</b> pool. Compared with conventional IL- 7 Ralpha(high) <b>naive</b> T <b>cells,</b> this subset displayed significantly lower levels of CD 28 {{and higher levels of}} HLA-DR. Proliferative responses to anti-CD 3 /CD 28 mAbs were indistinguishable from conventional <b>naive</b> T <b>cells,</b> but the responsiveness to IL- 7 was limited. Strikingly, IL- 7 Ralpha(low) <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> were particularly increased in circumstances of naive CD 8 + T cells shortage, as in the elderly, in patients early after hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, and in HIV-infected individuals. As common gamma chain cytokines induce rapid down-regulation of IL- 7 Ralpha, we propose that this new subset of <b>naive</b> T <b>cells</b> may encompass cells that have recently received homeostatic signal...|$|R
40|$|Memory T {{cells are}} thought to have several {{properties}} that distinguish them from their naïve precursors. They are found in parts of the body that rarely house <b>naïve</b> <b>cells,</b> they respond to antigen with faster proliferation and more rapid progression to effector function, they are less sensitive to the absence of their selecting major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and, above all, they are long lived. Here we show that this last property may not be universal. Some CD 4 + T cells that have surface proteins characteristic of memory cells have the same half-life in vivo as <b>naïve</b> <b>cells.</b> The description of these cells as memory cells therefore depends on our definition of the word ‘memory’...|$|R
40|$|In mice, recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) {{make up a}} {{large part}} of the <b>naïve</b> T <b>cell</b> pool and have been {{suggested}} to be a distinct short-lived pool. In humans, however, the life span and number of RTEs are unknown. Although (2) H(2) O labeling in young mice showed high thymic-dependent daily <b>naïve</b> T <b>cell</b> production, long term up- and down-labeling with (2) H(2) O in human adults revealed a low daily production of <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells.</b> Using mathematical modeling, we estimated human naïve CD 4 and CD 8 T cell half-lives of 4. 2 and 6. 5 years, respectively, whereas memory CD 4 and CD 8 T cells had half-lives of 0. 4 and 0. 7 year. The estimated half-life of recently produced <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> was much longer than these average half-lives. Thus, our data are incompatible with a substantial short-lived RTE population in human adults and suggest that the few <b>naïve</b> T <b>cells</b> that are newly produced are preferentially incorporated in the peripheral poo...|$|R
