5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} green mamba {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both <b>neurotoxins</b> and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E
5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent <b>neurotoxins</b> that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
40|$|Clostridium botulinum {{serotype}} A {{produces a}} <b>neurotoxin</b> {{composed of a}} 100 -kDa heavy chain and a 50 -kDa light chain linked by a disulfide bond. This <b>neurotoxin</b> {{is part of a}} ca. 900 -kDa complex, formed by noncovalent association with a single nontoxin, nonhemagglutinin subunit and a family of hemagglutinating proteins. Previous work has suggested, although never conclusively demonstrated, that <b>neurotoxin</b> alone cannot survive passage through the stomach and/or cannot be absorbed from the gut without the involvement of auxiliary proteins in the complex. Therefore, this study compared the relative absorption and toxicity of three preparations of <b>neurotoxin</b> in an in vivo mouse model. Equimolar amounts of serotype A complex with hemagglutinins, complex without hemagglutinins, and purified <b>neurotoxin</b> were surgically introduced into the stomach or into the small intestine. In some experiments, movement of <b>neurotoxin</b> from the site of administration was restricted by ligation of the pylorus. Comparison of relative toxicities demonstrated that at adequate doses, complex with hemagglutinins, complex without hemagglutinins, and pure <b>neurotoxin</b> can be absorbed from the stomach. The potency of <b>neurotoxin</b> in complex was greater than that of pure <b>neurotoxin,</b> but the magnitude of this difference diminished as the dosage of <b>neurotoxin</b> increased. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when complex with hemagglutinins, complex without hemagglutinins, and pure <b>neurotoxin</b> were placed directly into the intestine. This work establishes that pure botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> serotype A is toxic when administered orally. This means that pure <b>neurotoxin</b> does not require hemagglutinins or other auxiliary proteins for absorption from the gastrointestinal system into the general circulation...|$|R
40|$|The domain {{organization}} of the botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> serotype A was studied by using antibody mapping of 44 monoclonal single-chain variable fragments. The analysis was carried out on (i) the individual domains of botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> holotoxin (binding, translocation, and catalytic), (ii) botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> holotoxin, (iii) the botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> holotoxin in complex with the nontoxic portion, and (iv) botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> holotoxin and nontoxic portion of the complex recombined in vitro. All 44 antibodies mapped to individual domains of botulinum <b>neurotoxin.</b> Forty of the 44 single-chain variable fragments bound the botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> holotoxin relative to the isolated domains, suggesting that 4 epitopes are covered when the individual domains are in the holotoxin form. Only 20 of the antibodies showed a positive reaction to the toxin while in complex with the nontoxic portion. All of the covered epitopes were mapped to the binding domain of botulinum <b>neurotoxin,</b> which suggested that the binding domain is {{in direct contact with}} the nontoxic portion in the complex. Based on the antibody mapping to the different domains of the botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> holotoxin and the entire complex, a model of the botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> complex is proposed...|$|R

5|$|Many natural poisons act as <b>neurotoxins</b> {{that can}} cause {{paralysis}} leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|The venom {{is a mix}} of toxins, {{including}} <b>neurotoxins,</b> that paralyzes {{the prey}} so the anemone can move it to the mouth for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinotoxins are highly toxic to prey species of fish and crustaceans. However, Amphiprioninae (clownfish), small banded fish in various colours, are not affected by their host anemone's sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles. Several other species have similar adaptions and are also unaffected (see Symbiotic relationships). Most sea anemones are harmless to humans, but a few highly toxic species (notably Actinodendron arboreum, Phyllodiscus semoni and Stichodactyla spp.) have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal.|$|E

40|$|Blocking neurotransmission, botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> is {{the most}} {{poisonous}} biological substance known to mankind. Despite its infamy as the scourge of the food industry, the <b>neurotoxin</b> is increasingly used as a pharmaceutical to treat an expanding range of muscle disorders. Whilst <b>neurotoxin</b> expression by the spore-forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum appears tightly regulated, to date only positive regulatory elements, such as the alternative sigma factor BotR, have been implicated in this control. The identification of negative regulators {{has proven to be}} elusive. Here, we show that the two-component signal transduction system CBO 0787 /CBO 0786 negatively regulates botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> expression. Single insertional inactivation of cbo 0787 encoding a sensor histidine kinase, or of cbo 0786 encoding a response regulator, resulted in significantly elevated <b>neurotoxin</b> gene expression levels and increased <b>neurotoxin</b> production. Recombinant CBO 0786 regulator was shown to bind to the conserved - 10 site of the core promoters of the ha and ntnh-botA operons, which encode the toxin structural and accessory proteins. Increasing concentration of CBO 0786 inhibited BotR-directed transcription from the ha and ntnh-botA promoters, demonstrating direct transcriptional repression of the ha and ntnh-botA operons by CBO 0786. Thus, we propose that CBO 0786 represses <b>neurotoxin</b> gene expression by blocking BotR-directed transcription from the <b>neurotoxin</b> promoters. This is the first evidence of a negative regulator controlling botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> production. Understanding the <b>neurotoxin</b> regulatory mechanisms is a major target of the food and pharmaceutical industries alike...|$|R
5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving <b>neurotoxins</b> that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic <b>neurotoxins</b> (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins, calcicludine, and fasciculins. The average venom yield per bite is 80mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981), while Minton (1974) gives it a range of 60–95mg (dry weight). The subcutaneous LD50 is 1.3mg/kg. The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0.45mg/kg. Like all other mamba species, the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba bites. However, patients bitten by the eastern green mamba develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild haemostatic disturbances (Warrell DA; MacKay et al. 1966). The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from bites on the fingers {{or the use of}} a tight tourniquet. This species has caused bites to humans and many of the bites attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be quite high. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness, and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat, convulsions, rapid progression to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal. Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes, in as little as 30 minutes, have been recorded for this species.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> is {{commonly}} utilized in neurorehabilitation {{as a treatment}} for focal spasticity. Clinical experience has yielded observations of late motor recovery after intramuscular injection of botulinum <b>neurotoxin,</b> that are not readily explained by the classical mechanism of action of the <b>neurotoxin</b> in controlling spasticity. These findings have triggered speculation regarding a botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> mediated effect at the central level after peripheral intervention. Methods: A review of current literature reveals evidence of distant action after peripheral botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> injection in affected muscles, be it in other muscles, nerves, spinal cord or the cortex. Results: Plausible explanations for a centrally mediated late motor recovery after botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> injection include: (i) direct action of botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> at distant sites in the central nervous system, mediated by retrograde transport of the <b>neurotoxin</b> into the spinal cord, and (ii) cortical reorganization due to botulinum neurotoxin-induced decrease in peripheral sensory input at the local injection site. Conclusion: Additional research is required to further elucidate these hypotheses, as well as providing specific dosing specifications, patient selection criteria and the interplay with other therapeutic modalities necessary to promote late motor recovery...|$|R

However, it has lower binding affinity {{toward the}} human {{version of its}} major receptor, synaptotagmin II (h-Syt II), compared to mouse Syt II, because of a residue difference. Increasing the binding affinity to h-Syt II may improve botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> B's therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects. Here we utilized the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid method and carried out a saturation mutagenesis screen in the Syt II-binding pocket of botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> B. The screen identifies E 1191 as a key residue: replacing it with M/C/V/Q enhances botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> B binding to human synaptotagmin II.

25|$|By being {{hydrophobic}} and small, or inhibiting astrocyte function, some compounds including certain <b>neurotoxins</b> {{are able}} to penetrate into the brain and induce significant damage. In modern times, scientists and physicians have been presented {{with the challenge of}} identifying and treating <b>neurotoxins,</b> which has resulted in a growing interest in both neurotoxicology research and clinical studies. Though clinical neurotoxicology is largely a burgeoning field, extensive inroads {{have been made in the}} identification of many environmental <b>neurotoxins</b> leading to the classification of 750 to 1000 known potentially neurotoxic compounds. Due to the critical importance of finding <b>neurotoxins</b> in common environments, specific protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for testing and determining neurotoxic effects of compounds (USEPA 1998). Additionally, in vitro systems have increased in use as they provide significant improvements over the more common in vivo systems of the past. Examples of improvements include tractable, uniform environments, and the elimination of contaminating effects of systemic metabolism. In vitro systems, however, have presented problems as it has been difficult to properly replicate the complexities of the nervous system, such as the interactions between supporting astrocytes and neurons in creating the BBB. To even further complicate the process of determining <b>neurotoxins</b> when testing in-vitro, neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity may be difficult to distinguish as exposing neurons directly to compounds may not be possible in-vivo, as it is in-vitro. Additionally, the response of cells to chemicals may not accurately convey a distinction between <b>neurotoxins</b> and cytotoxins, as symptoms like oxidative stress or skeletal modifications may occur in response to either.|$|E

25|$|Though {{diverse in}} {{chemical}} properties and functions, <b>neurotoxins</b> share the common property that they act by some mechanism leading {{to either the}} disruption or destruction of necessary components within the nervous system. <b>Neurotoxins,</b> however, by their very design can be very useful {{in the field of}} neuroscience. As the nervous system in most organisms is both highly complex and necessary for survival, it has naturally become a target for attack by both predators and prey. As venomous organisms often use their <b>neurotoxins</b> to subdue a predator or prey very rapidly, toxins have evolved to become highly specific to their target channels such that the toxin does not readily bind other targets (see s). As such, <b>neurotoxins</b> provide an effective means by which certain elements of the nervous system may be accurately and efficiently targeted. An early example of neurotoxin based targeting used radiolabeled tetrodotoxin to assay sodium channels and obtain precise measurements about their concentration along nerve membranes. Likewise through isolation of certain channel activities, <b>neurotoxins</b> have provided the ability to improve the original Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron in which it was theorized that single generic sodium and potassium channels could account for most nervous tissue function. From this basic understanding, the use of common compounds such as tetrodotoxin, tetraethylammonium, and bungarotoxins have led to a much deeper understanding of the distinct ways in which individual neurons may behave.|$|E

Low pH-induced voltage gated channels were observed only with the heavy chain and not with the intact <b>neurotoxin.</b> In liposomes membrane channel activity, as monitored by calcein release, was observed with the intact <b>neurotoxin</b> as well as its two subunit chains. The heavy chain exhibited the highest Calcein release activity. The pH effect on the membrane channel formation by botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> was therefore, investigated to understand the molecular basis of membrane channel formation of heavy chain. The low pH induced significant conformational change in the botulinum <b>neurotoxin</b> heavy chain at the tertiary structure level, which could be responsible for triggering its insertion into membrane binding. The secondary structure of the light chain was dramatically changed, which could explain its interaction with membrane lipid as well as its likely passage through the membrane channel formed by the heavy chain. Low pH-induced changes in polypeptide folding were also analyzed by monitoring thermal unfolding of the heavy chain in different pH conditions. Thermal unfolding curves indicated the presence of oligomeric structure at low pH. Binding of the heavy chain with liposomes at either pH 7. 4 or 4. 0 introduced dramatic changes in the unfolding pattern, suggesting major structural alternation in the protein upon binding with membrane.
