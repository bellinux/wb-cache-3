40|$|Incomplete data {{presents}} {{a problem in}} both inferential and predictive modeling applications. Traditional methods such as complete case analysis and simple imputation tend to produce results that inadequately estimate standard errors and/or parameter estimates, particularly where missingness is not completely at random (MCAR). Modern methods for handling incomplete data, including maximum likelihood parameter estimation and multiple imputation methods, enable researchers to derive appropriate parameter estimates and inference from incomplete data when data are missing at random (MAR). However, {{for a variety of}} reasons, multiple imputation is not always practical, particularly with very large data sets or in applications where {{it is important to have}} only one working data set (such as public sector data). This paper illustrates the use of PROC MI, which provides maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the covariance matrix and mean vector using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Using simulations, a number of incomplete data handling methods and resulting parameter estimates, standard errors, and error rates in classification of a validation data set are compared and evaluated in the context of discriminant analysis. Additionally, the proper specification of an appropriate <b>nominal</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> for the analysis when the ML covariance matrix is used as input to the analysis is discussed. Results suggest that the covariance estimates from the EM algorithm produce results superior to other methods evaluated, particularly with an appropriately specified <b>nominal</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Suggestions for handling missingness in the context of predictive and inferential modeling applications are presented...|$|E
40|$|Most {{national}} health surveys {{do not permit}} precise measurement of the health of racial/ethnic subgroups that comprise < 1 per cent of the U. S. population. We identify three potentially promising sample design strategies for increasing the accuracy of {{national health}} estimates for a small target subgroup when used to supplement a small probability sample of that group and apply these strategies to American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Chinese using National Health Interview Survey data. These sample design strategies include (1) complete sampling of targets within households, (2) oversampling selected macrogeographic units, and (3) oversampling from an incomplete list frame. Stage (1) is promising for Chinese and AI/AN; (2) works for both groups, {{but it would be}} more cost-effective for AI/AN because of their greater residential concentration; (3) is somewhat effective for groups like Chinese with viable surname lists, but not for AI/AN. Both (2) and (3) efficiently improve measurement precision when the supplement is {{the same size as the}} existing core sample, with diminishing additional returns as the supplement grows relative to the core sample, especially for (3). To avoid large design effects, the oversampled geographic areas or lists must have good coverage of the target population. To reduce costs, oversampled geographic tracts and lists must consist primarily of targets. These techniques can be used simultaneously to substantially increase effective sample sizes (ESSs). For example, (1) and (2) in combination can be used to multiply the <b>nominal</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of AI/AN or Chinese by 8 and the ESS by 4. Copyright Â© 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies statistical {{properties and}} {{applications of the}} Markov switching models for economic time series in five separate papers. The two main statistical themes are (i) the task of choosing the number of states {{to use in the}} model, and (ii) inference on time-varying transition probabilities. Our empirical applications span a wide array of topics in international finance and macroeconomics. Specifically, we study the dynamics of nominal exchange rates, interest rates, the business cycle and currency crises. In the first paper, ?Exchange Rates and Markov Switching Dynamics (joint work with Yin-Wong Cheung), we develop a simulation procedure to construct a two-sided test for testing hypotheses regarding the number of states in an empirical data-set. We use the test to resolve conflicting results regarding the existence of Markov switching dynamics in three dollar-denominated exchange rates. Our test shows that some of the earlier data-sets were not informative enough to draw a conclusion upon, with the result of previous tests sometimes contradicting each other. In data spanning 1973 - 1998 and on the monthly and higher frequency, we do, however, find conclusive evidence of Markov switching dynamics. The second paper, ?Regime Switches in Swedish Interest Rates?, uses a similar simulation approach to arrive at the conclusion of three states in a set of weekly data on Swedish interbank offered interest rates. A short-lived and highly volatile states pin-point the repeated speculative attacks on the Swedish krona in the early 90 s. With the states in place, we are able to obtain conditional normality even in this extremely leptokurtic time-series. Furthermore, we show that the specification is quite apt at forecasting interest rate volatility, and the evidence in favor of the model versus a number of competing alternatives is strong for all the forecast horizons we have applied. Turning to the dynamics of Markov models with time-varying transitions probabilities, the third paper, ?Constructing Early-Warning Systems: A Modified Markov Switching Approach? sets out to investigate the relatively infrequent use of this intuitive extension to the original model. It is shown in a simple theoretical setting, and in several simulation exercises, that the maximum likelihood estimator overemphasizes the short-run effects of predictors of transition probabilities in modestly sized samples. This leads to extreme parameter estimates and projected transition probabilities with too abrupt behavior. We introduce a penalized estimator, which is able to reduce parameter estimates toward their true magnitudes, and also increases correlation between the projected and true transition probabilities, and offer some suggestions on how to choose the magnitude of the penalty. In an application to the U. S. business cycle, we show that the penalized estimator yields a more parsimonious model with better forecasting properties in the medium to long term compared to its non-penalized counterpart. In the fourth paper, ?Transition Variables in the Markov Switching Model: Some Small Sample Properties?, we offer a note of caution in terms of using time-varying transition probabilities. We argue that rather than the <b>nominal</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> as measured {{by the total number of}} observations in the time-series, the number of regime switches should be considered instead when making inference on variable significance in the transition equations. By simulation, it is shown that for many cases the likelihood ratio statistic is over-sized, leading to too many transition variables being deemed significant. The size-distortion is not only dependent upon the number of switches in the data, but also the degree of uncertainty inherent in it and the persistence in the regressed variable. We suggest a straightforward, but computationally intensive approach to obtaining statistics with proper size. Looking at a number of business cycle predictors, we show that their statistics must be adjusted by a considerable magnitude to reflect true confidence levels. For model specification, this consequently has marked effect. The last paper (which is joint work with Guillaume Arias), ?Regime Switching as an Alternative Early-Warning System of Currency Crises: An Application to South-East Asia? is devoted to inferring indicators predicting the on-set of the South-East Asian currency crises in 1997. We survey the current literature in the area, and based on this, derive a number of possible determinants of currency crises. In a framework based on the Markov switching model with time-varying transition probabilities, we evaluate these determinants and specify models for forecasting of oncoming crises in the medium to long term. We show that the model is quite efficient in describing the underlying data and that it possesses relatively good forecasting properties...|$|E

The variance of the noise {{is assumed to be}} imperfectly known, but some knowledge about a nominal value is presumed. We utilized slope as a unit to quantify the robustness for different signal strengths, <b>nominals,</b> and <b>sample</b> <b>sizes.</b> Following to this, a weighting method is applied to the slope range of interest, the so called tolerable range, as to analyze the likelihood of these extreme slopes to occur. A ratio of the first and last quarter section of the tolerable range have been taken in order to obtain the likelihood ratio for the low slopes to occur. We finalized our analysis by developing a method that quantifies confidence as a measure of robustness. Both weighted and non-weighted procedures were applied over the tolerable range, where the weighted procedure puts greater emphasis on values near the nominal. The quantitative analysis results show the detector to be non-robust and deliver poor performance for low signal-to-noise ratios. For moderate signal strengths, the detector performs rather well if the <b>nominal</b> and <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> are chosen wisely. The detector has great performance and robustness for high signal-to-noise ratios.

40|$|<b>Sample</b> <b>size</b> {{determination}} (SSD) is {{an important}} aspect of experimental design. In most comparative experiments, a decision about <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> must be made prior to data acquisition. This involves power analysis within a classical statistical framework. We are going to formulate required <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> determination within a Bayesian framework. Required <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is chosen to achieve a pre-specified model performance criterion. We also take <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> determination into a model selection environment. Here a <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is calculated to separate two different models. We also provide analytical results on the behavior of our <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> determination criteria when possible. ^ Determination of <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is an issue frequently faced by practitioners. Bayesian methods are ideally suited to this design aspect. First, information is usually available prior to experiment. It is better to incorporate this prior information into the study at design stage. In fact, the prior can play the role of a âwhat ifâ specification, allowing the designer to assess Bayesian learning as a function of <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> over a range of specifications. Second, it is sensible to average over the sample space since the sample has not yet been observed and the general principle of averaging over what is unknown applies. ^ Historically, <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> determination has been confined primarily to one and two sample problems. We are aiming to address the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> problem for more complicated modeling frameworks, e. g., the attractive hierarchical models which are the standard Bayesian environment. Simulation-based model fitting is customarily employed for inference under hierarchical models.

In this paper, a <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> determination procedure is extended to allow <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> re-estimation. In addition, a Bayesian predictive approach based on credible intervals is proposed to establish when re-estimation is appropriate in combination with a maximum available <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> as a realistic constraint. This approach is shown to provide stable estimates of the required <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> in the face of limited prior information and a maximum available <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> often encountered in RCTs in small populations. This is further illustrated using data from a realized randomized trial in the field of pediatrics...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess how}} often {{calculation}} of <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> {{were reported in}} leading ophthalmology journals. Study Design Retrospective literature survey. <b>Sample</b> <b>size</b> calculations should {{be a part of}} the methods and published report of diagnostic performance studies. Currently, they are not being reported in the ophthalmology literature. Results A total of 1698 articles were identified, of which 40 studies were on diagnostic accuracy. One study reported that <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was calculated before initiating the study. Another study reported consideration of <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> without calculation. The mean (SD) <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of all diagnostic studies was 172. 6 (218. 9). The median prevalence of the target condition was 50. 5 %. Conclusions <b>Sample</b> <b>size</b> calculations should {{be a part of the}} methods and published report of diagnostic performance studies. Currently, they are not being reported in the ophthalmology literature. Only a few studies consider <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> in their methods. Inadequate <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> in diagnostic accuracy studies may result in misleading estimates of test accuracy. An improvement over the current standards on the design and reporting of diagnostic studies is warranted...|$|R
40|$|One {{concern in}} the early stages of study {{planning}} and design is the minimum <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> needed to provide statistically credible results. This minimum <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is usually determined via the use of simple formulas, or equivalently, from tables. However, the more popular formulas involve large-sample approximations and hence may be too conservative. This article provides empirical evidence indicating that this conservatism is drastic for certain <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> formulas based on confidence interval width. Common <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> formulas that consider statistical power are also discussed; these are shown to perform quite well, even for small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> situation...|$|R
