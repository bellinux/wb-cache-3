40|$|The regime for {{the formal}} {{establishment}} of parent-child {{relationships in the}} province of Quebec was substantially modified in 2002 in order to achieve equality. Reforms to filiation – the legal bond connecting child and mother or child and father – in Quebec provided means for same-sex couples to adopt, for lesbian couples to conceive using donated sperm and clarified the filiation of children born of assisted procreation. This ‘successful’ reform in terms of equality left untouched an existing rule justified by women’s equality, namely, what the civil law calls the <b>absolute</b> <b>nullity</b> of surrogacy agreements. Surrogacy raises questions about what is left after an equality-driven reform. Since 2002, in line with the rise of sexless reproduction (i. e. reproduction disconnected theoretically and practically from sexuality), surrogacy has attracted much attention in Quebec. In 2014 the Court of Appeal rendered judgment in its first surrogacy case lower Quebec courts have rendered nine decisions, scholarly articles on the issue abound and the topic has been covered in various media. This article does not argue for or against surrogacy. Instead, it challenges conceptions and understandings about parentage, gender roles and sexuality using surrogacy as the principal locus of analysis. The exploration is discursive and metaphoric; it tackles the jurist’s imagination. It proposes a new narrative on an issue that has been extensively studied. Refraining from drawing any firm legal conclusions – the small pool of decisions available makes generalization hazardous – I want to speculate {{about the ways in which}} an uncertain legal norm – the <b>absolute</b> <b>nullity</b> of surrogacy agreements – makes space for problematic labels to enter legal reasoning. I show how the <b>absolute</b> <b>nullity</b> of surrogacy agreements in Quebec has led judges to ban the filiation of children born of surrogacy in certain situations and how it has forced judges to apply creative, albeit unpredictable, solutions. A central historic argument running through the text is that Quebec’s regime on filiation is a powerful device to control or hierarchize sexual behaviours and that surrogacy could be its new power tool...|$|R

She would not {{entertain}} the vanity that she was serving what is called the cause of woman, and she would not assume any duties or responsibilities toward it. She thought men were as good as women; at least one man had been no worse than one woman; and it was in no representative or exemplary character that she had chosen her course. At the same time that she held these sane opinions, she believed that she had put away the hopes with the pleasures that might once have taken her as a young girl. In regard to what had changed the current of her life, she mentally asserted her mere <b>nullity,</b> her <b>absolute</b> non-existence.

Thus, according to the dispositions of the Vienna Convention (1969) on the law of treaties between states, invalidity of states’ consent are: breach of the dispositions of the domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties; the error; the fraud; the corruption of a state representative; the coercion of a state representative; the coercion against a state. The invalidity of states’ consent are sanctioned both in the matter of the Public International Law as well as in the domestic civil law by <b>nullity,</b> either <b>absolute</b> (such as the coercion exercised on the state representative and the coercion against a state) or relative (such as the breach of the dispositions of the domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties, the error, the fraud or the corruption of a state representative). In certain cases, the dispositions of the domestic law are fully mirrored by the regulations of the Vienna Convention, as is the case of the fraud, but there are also cases – the breach of the dispositions of the domestic law of the state regarding the competence to sign treaties – where the Vienna Convention introduces a disposition which flagrantly contradicts the civil theory in the matter, the state being able to invoke itself the defect in its consent. At the same time, in the domestic civil law, the rule according to which no one can invoke his/her own turpitude is widely sanctioned. We conclude by showing that the manner of regulation of nullity taken over from the domestic civil law and transposed in the dispositions of the Vienna Convention fails to meet the exigencies and rigors of the definition of nullity.

60|$|Keeping {{these points}} in view, it is {{interesting}} to observe the different degrees and relations of the imagination, as accompanied with more or less feeling or desire of harmony, vigor of conception, or constancy of reference to truth. Of men of name, perhaps Claude is the best instance of a want of imagination, nearly total, borne out by painful but untaught study of nature, and much feeling for abstract beauty of form, with none whatever for harmony of expression. In Gaspar Poussin, we have the same want of imagination disguised by more masculine qualities of mind, and grander reachings after sympathy. Thus in the sacrifice of Isaac in our own gallery, the spirit of the composition is solemn and unbroken; {{it would have been a}} grand picture if the forms of the mass of foliage on the right, and of the clouds in the centre, had not been hopelessly unimaginative.

Some one owed the bank a debt; he was sued, and sought to avoid payment {{on the ground that}} the bank was unconstitutional. The case went to the Supreme Court, and therein it was decided that the bank was constitutional. The whole Democratic party revolted against that decision. General Jackson himself asserted that he, as President, would not be bound to hold a National Bank to be constitutional, even though the court had decided it to be so. He fell in precisely with the view of Mr. Jefferson, and acted upon it under his official oath, in vetoing a charter for a National Bank. The declaration that Congress does not possess this constitutional power to charter a bank has gone into the Democratic platform, at their National Conventions, and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their last Convention at Cincinnati. They have contended for that declaration, in the very teeth of the Supreme Court, for {{more than a quarter of}} a century. In fact, they have reduced the decision to an <b>absolute</b> <b>nullity.</b> That decision, I repeat, is repudiated in the Cincinnati platform; and still, as if to show that effrontery can go no further, Judge Douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which he denounces me for opposing the Dred Scott decision that he stands on the Cincinnati platform.|$|R

40|$|In Romania, in {{the last}} decade, a {{significant}} number of solutions favorable to consumers with foreign currency denominated loans were obtained in courts against the banks or non-bank financial institutions.

40|$|International {{judgments}} have {{a binding}} character {{as long as}} they meet certain requirements imposed by the rules governing both the procedure and the judge’s duties. In this regard, the validity of the judgment represents a sort of all-inclusive requirement. The book aims to provide an in-depth analysis of all rules and principles of international adjudication dealing with the grounds of invalidity, their functioning, their ascertainment as well as their implications upon both the judgment and the national measures enacting it. The introduction focuses on the concept of ‘invalidity’, in order to assess which general category in international law among (<b>absolute)</b> <b>nullity,</b> voidness or inexistence should encompass it. The author upholds the (<b>absolute)</b> <b>nullity</b> category, especially {{due to the lack of}} a permanent international body which might rule on annulment claims. Such a view, however, may not apply to specific systems providing States parties with a means of annulment. Chapter I deals with the shortcomings related to the exercise of jurisdiction. It mainly focuses on the excès de pouvoir, as a well-known ground of invalidity in arbitration. Chapter II examines the infringement of fundamental rules of procedure. After describing the general features of the error in procedendo, so as to distinguish between simple irregularity and invalidity, the chapter proceeds with a survey of: a) the incorrect application of the rules relating to the establishment and composition of judicial bodies; b) the consequences of the absence of a judge in case of collegial composition; c) the breach of equality principle; d) the infringements of the principles in the matter of evidence; c) the excès de pouvoir as to the so-called ‘inherent’ power. Chapter III deals with the ‘arbitrary use of the judicial function’. The main breaches taken into consideration concern independence and impartiality. The author includes errores in iudicando – as a particular facet of the excès de pouvoir – within the concept of ‘arbitrary use of the judicial function’ only insofar as they are essential and manifest. Chapter IV aims to determine the (judicial or non-judicial) ‘places’ where the invalidity may be ascertained. It has been divided into 5 sections. Section 1 refers to the States’ right to object the invalidity. On the one hand, it is indisputable that one State may claim invalidity but, on the other hand, that same State should not be entitled, as a matter of principle, to decide by itself the consequences of the invalidity claim on the judgment’s binding force. The invalidity claim will be certainly challenged by the successful litigant. Thereby a dispute concerning the existence of one or more grounds of invalidity arises: a dispute which is different from that “settled” by the judgment at stake. Section 2 sets out certain unilateral acts or agreements as well as acquiescence and estoppel leading to debar the invalidity claim. Section 3 aims to determine which judicial body may rule on disputes concerning the invalidity. As for the pre-judgment phase, the preliminary objections in matters of jurisdiction and the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle drew major attention. As regards the post-judgment phase, the analysis explores the concept of ‘supervisory jurisdiction’, giving some examples. Section 4 in turn scrutinizes other proceedings aimed at ‘reviewing’ or ‘reopening’ a judgment so as to verify whether they might involve a validity appraisal. Last but not least, Section 5 focuses on the ICJ’s judgment validity, by stressing how the relationship between validity and binding character does not vary in this regard. Chapter V, finally, deals briefly with the effects of invalidity upon the obligations stemming from the judgment as well as upon the national measures enforcing it...|$|R

In the first chapters the examination of validity and the effects of the legal transaction is done with the study of some aspects concerning the existence.

But, when both the plaintiff and the defendant were guilty of immorality, the repetition action should have been rejected based on the "in pari causa turpitudinis cessat repetitio" adage that represents a primitive appearance of the “nemo auditur propriam turpitudiniem alegans” rule. The rule fundament results even from its wording that allows us to see its moral nature that represents actually a refuse to act for the ones who want to use their embarrassing actions in front of the justice. In other words, we must notice the fact that the doctrine did not have a unitary position regarding the application of the rule and the opinions are shared because some authors accept with no reserves the application of the rule, while others declare to be against its application. Regarding the jurisprudence, if it is unitary when it affirms that the liberality by means of which we follow the start, the continuation or the restart of a concubinage relation has a purpose against the social cohabitation rules, and the sanction of a juridical act with such a cause is the <b>absolute</b> <b>nullity,</b> and this is not unitary anymore regarding its position against the ending of such an approach. In most of the cases, the courts are happy to find that the respective obligation has an illicit cause according to art. 968 of Civil Code without specifying if it is immoral or not, in order to make possible the application of the rule in the eventuality of promoting a returning action of the party who had received the liberality with such a cause. But, if we consider we are in the presence of an immoral convention, and the nemo auditor propriam turpitudiniem alegans rule becomes applicable, the return of the services is not possible anymore. Regarding this rule application, we must notice that its application is actually a civil sanction that consists in non-accepting the access to justice, by means of the returning action of the parties that are guilty of the immorality of their convention, that are thus lacked of the protection offered by the law, just because of the insecurity that could be produced by the non-acceptance of such a protection. Most of the cases where the nemo auditur propriam turpitudiniem alegans rule exists are circumscribed to the obligations that are born from a contract, and regard the repetition action or the returning one.

40|$|The {{doctorate}} thesis {{assigned to}} me {{deals with the}} problem of the effects of cancelling the tender procedure of a call for tenders on the contract stipulated in a judicial capacity {{in the course of the}} proceedings between the administration and the company, which turns out to have been unlawfully selected. As regards this question, the case law and legal theory have outlined solutions in terms of interpretation which are at two completely different ends of the spectrum (referring to the retractability, nullity and null and void agreement of the contract respectively) and which induces a set of questions regarding substantive and procedural law. The whole issue concerns the relations between the tender procedure and contract and the majority of the debate in fact centres on the nature (procedural or contractual) of the deed of adjudication. In order to correctly set out this research I therefore decided to dedicate the first part of the work to the problem of the nature of the deed of adjudication. In carrying out a similar survey, I deemed it necessary to take the steps from the traditional guidance that asserts the concurrence, in the tender procedure, of two deeds (even though they are formally separated in the procedure) : an investigation (declaratory) deed (administrative), whereby the final deed of the selection procedure of the contractor is finalised, which consists of verifying the best offer; and a private contractual deed, which contains the agreement declaration of the public administration with regard to the contract to be stipulated. I focused in particular on the normative grounds of this theory (in particular, on the principle of equivalence of the record of the adjudication for the contract sanctioned by art. 16, paragraph 4, of the R. D. no. 2440 / 1923 and on the scope of this provision); and thereby making use of the specifications provided by the case law over time and the contributions made by legal theory. I subsequently analysed the concept of the tender procedure solely in terms of an administrative act, sustained by a minor part of the legal theory and case law, but which was endorsed by the Italian Supervisory Authority for Public Works with the decision dated 2 October 2002, no. 24, as it stands it is based on an unconvincing interpretation of the regulations regarding public works and those which provide for the non-conclusive nature of the tender procedure. With regard to the problem in question, I was also able to observe how the new Public Contracts Law, approved with the Italian Legislative Decree 12 April 2006, no. 163, does not contribute towards clarifying the point. If in truth on the one hand, this appears to sanction the overcoming of the traditional planning, according to which the record of the adjudication is equivalent to the contract, expressly asserting, in art. 11, paragraph 7, that “the tender procedure is not equivalent to the acceptance of the offer,” on the other hand, the new law reproduces – in art. 11, paragraph 9 – provision (art. 109, paragraph 3, of the D. P. R. no. 554 / 99), which seems instead allow an interpretation to the contrary and therefore to confirm the traditional planning, according to which the record of the adjudication takes the place of the contract. As regards the results achieved at the end of the survey on the nature of the tender procedure, from this point of view I decided that the conclusions should be shared. This is where that case study orientation came from, which constitutes the specification of the traditional theory of the dual nature of the tender procedure. This differentiates from the deed of adjudication in terms of content in relation to the type of procedure followed and, in particular, excludes the contractual value of the tender procedure (and therefore sustains the need to proceed to a separate, subsequent stipulation) if the proceedings of the private negotiation and the competitive tender have been followed. After having examined the essential character and nature of the tender procedure, I focused on the specific topic of the doctorate thesis (the effects of cancelling the tender procedure on the stipulated mid-term contract), moving from a (critical) analysis of the main guidelines of civil case law and legal theory recorded on the topic. From this point of view, I examined, first of all, the traditional and oldest guidelines of ordinary civil law, which asserts that the contract stipulated on the basis on an unlawful tender procedure can be cancelled in accordance with art. 1441 of the Italian Civil Code (hereafter c. c.). It is believed that this retractability can only and exclusively be asserted by the public administration, the only body that can legitimately carry out the relative act in conformity to the cited art. 1441 c. c [...] From this perspective, I dedicated particular attention to the different reconstructive hypotheses that were elaborated regarding the theory of retractability concerning the contract (retractability due to the public administration’s inability negotiate, former art. 1425, first paragraph of the c. c.; retractability due to errors the agreement, former art. 1427 and foll. of the c. c.; retractability due to the public administration’s error in contractual validation). I then went on to examine the theory, also strongly represented in legal theory and foll. and case law, which brings back the condition of the tender contract stipulated based on a tender procedure cancelled in a judicial capacity with hypothetical <b>absolute</b> <b>nullity,</b> in accordance with art. 1418 of the c. c., concentrating especially on the theory of structural nullity due to a lack of agreement former art. 1418, paragraph 2, and 1325, no. 1, of the c. c. and on the nullity theory due to the violation of binding regulations former art. 1418, first paragraph of the c. c [...] After having examined the different positions taken in the civil sphere, I devoted my attention to studying the “giuspubblicistica” position on the relationship between cancellation and contract, also through the (critical) analysis of the most significant case law rulings on the topic. I paid special attention to the theory of the automatic null and void agreement, which asserts the inefficiency of the contract following the cancellation of the tender procedure on the presupposition of the existence of a link of necessary consequentiality between the public representation procedural sequence and the (subsequent) stipulation of the contract and the relative inefficiency that has occurred, according to which the inefficiency of the contract would not be produced automatically, but following the judicial initiative of the omitted contractor and notwithstanding the rights acquired by bona fide third parties, in application of art. 23, paragraph 2, and 25, paragraph 2 of the c. c [...] At the end of the close examination I analysed the advantages and limitation of the various reconstructions proposed, with special attention paid to the criticisms directed at these theories. With particular regard to the traditional theory of the retractability of the contract, I pointed out that on the one hand – reserving the validation to request the cancellation of the contract to the only subcontracting organisation – it seems to adequately satisfy the needs of certainty of the judicial relations, on the other hand this concept does not appear to guarantee the third party in the same way, which has obtained the cancellation of the contract documents, nullifying in such a way the protection achieved by the latter in an administrative judicial capacity. I also ascertained how the theory of retractability appears to be inspired by an ‘artificial’ distinction between the administrative selection stage of the contractor and the strictly contractual period of the issue (which is clarified when stipulating the contract). Indeed, as I was able to notice in specifically examining the problem of the nature of the tender procedure, it cannot be the case that the two stages cannot always be clearly separated, having considered that the tender procedure in some cases could also be regarded as a declaration of contractual agreement by the public administration as regards the contract to be stipulated and the subject with which to conclude the contract. For this reason it seems difficult to sustain that the cancellation of the tender procedure cannot ever weigh upon the efficiency of the negotiation, and that is to say regardless of an explicit ruling of cancellation of the contract by the ordinary court, as the supporters of the theory of retractability believe. As regards the theory of nullity of the contract, I pointed out how this has been criticised above all as the actual result of an original fault in the contract (which characterises the scheme of radical invalidity) is attributed to an event that has taken place (the cancellation of the tender procedure), with unacceptable consequences (on the level of certainty of the judicial relations), such as the exposure of the same contract to the verification of its office nullity, with any prescriptive limitations and by anyone concerned with them. Finally, as regards the recent reconstructions of administrative case law, substantially referring to the inefficiency of the contract, I was able to indicate how the same, although the interests in play have the merit of completely assessing, giving the right importance to protecting the rights of bona fide third parties, lead to results which are partly reassuring concerning the compatibility of this kind of reconstruction with the system coordinates. In conclusion, I was able to ascertain the deficiency of the various theories examined in explaining the problem of the effects of cancelling the tender procedure on the contract. This inadequacy seems to come mainly from the lack of consideration – by these theories – of the problem of the (procedural and/or contractual) nature of the tender procedure itself and the relations between the tender procedure and contract. I therefore attempted to identify a prospective solution suitable for resolving the problem of the relationship between the invalidity of the public tenders procedure and contract in light of the close examination of the various theories shown by the legal theory and case law (retractability; nullity; automatic null and void agreement; the relative inefficiency that has occurred), reaching a range of conclusions according to the legal, contractual or only procedural description, which we would like to attribute to the deed of adjudication. From this point of view I hypothesised that when the deed of adjudication also takes on contractual worth, the cancellation of the tender procedure causes the nullity of the stipulated mid-term contract, without the need for constitutive statements of its ceased effect, whereas in the cases in which the tender procedure, subject to cancellation, only holds procedural value, the contract must only be deemed as retractable. The combination of the surveys described so far lead to the drafting of three chapters of the doctorate thesis. The first of which is dedicated to the problem of the nature of the tender procedure. The second chapter concentrates on the analysis of the positions of the civil case law and legal theory as to the types of the stipulated mid-term contract. The third chapter focuses on the analysis of the theories of administrative case law and the identification of a prospective solution to the problem...|$|R
