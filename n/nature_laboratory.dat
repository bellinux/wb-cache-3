It includes critical assessments and a comparative analysis of the key developments, their evolution and failures, along with key misconceptions and outdated paradigms. The main emphasis is on conceptual and problematic aspects, physical phenomena, observations, misconceptions and unresolved issues rather than on conventional formalistic aspects, models, etc. Apart from the obvious fundamental importance of turbulent flows, this emphasis stems from the basic premise that without corresponding progress in fundamental aspects there is little chance for progress in applications such as drag reduction, mixing, control and modeling of turbulence. More generally, there is also a desperate need to grasp the physical fundamentals of the technological processes in which turbulence plays a central role...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} is a {{major threat}} confronting the world, and the rampant use of chemical fertilizers contributes largely to {{the deterioration of the}} environment through depletion of fossil fuels, generation of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and contamination of water resources. It leads to loss of soil fertility due to imbalanced use of fertilizers that has adversely impacted agricultural productivity and causes soil degradation. Now there is a growing realization that the adoption of ecological and sustainable farming practices can only reverse the declining trend in the global productivity and environment protection (Aveyard 1988, Wani and Lee 1992, Wani et al. 1995). On one hand tropical soils are deficient in all necessary plant nutrients {{and on the other hand}} large quantities of such nutrients contained in domestic wastes and agricultural byproducts are wasted.

40|$|Our present {{in-depth}} {{knowledge of}} the physiology and regulatory mechanisms of microorganisms has arisen from our ability to remove them from their natural, complex ecosystems into pure liquid cultures. These cultures are grown under optimized laboratory conditions and allow us to study microorganisms as individuals. However, microorganisms naturally grow in conditions that are far from optimal, which causes them to become organized into multicellular communities that are better protected against the harmful environment. Moreover, this multicellular existence allows individual cells to differentiate and acquire specific properties, such as forming resistant spores, which benefit the whole population. The relocation of natural microorganisms to the laboratory can result in their adaptation to these favourable conditions, which is accompanied by complex changes that include the repression of some protective mechanisms that are essential in <b>nature.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> microorganisms that have been cultured for long periods under optimized conditions might therefore differ markedly from those that exist in natural ecosystems...|$|E

30|$|Network {{analysis}} revealed that the snails of Parinacota form a lineage genetically distinct from Caquena and Colpa. The morphometric analysis of the shell showed that the Parinacota snails were larger than Caquena and Colpa, both in <b>nature</b> and <b>laboratory</b> conditions, {{but there was no}} evidence of difference in the shape of the shell when compared using multivariate analyses. The number of eggs per ovicapsule was the only life history trait that was significantly different between lineages, although this difference may be also attributed to size of the progenitor; the oviposition rate did not differ between lineages or localities, and the hatching size and growth rate differed only at the locality level, not lineages.|$|R
40|$|While {{studies of}} tri-trophic {{interactions}} have uncovered {{a variety of}} mechanisms influencing the dietary specialization of insect herbivores, such studies have neglected host-plant selection by generalists. Here, we report an initial investigation on how host-plant quality and a tachinid parasitoid interact to affect the survival and host-plant selection by a polyphagous herbivore. This herbivore, Grammia geneura(Strecker) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), is a food-mixing caterpillar that feeds preferentially on forbs. A previous study suggested that G. geneura might eat certain host species {{for reasons other than}} benefits of physiological utilization. We hypothesized that host-plant mediated defenses could act against parasitoids, the major mortality agents of late instar G. geneura. Field observations indicated that caterpillars sometimes survived an attack by the parasitoid Exorista mella Walker (Diptera: Tachinidae) in <b>nature.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> experiments showed that the survival of parasitized caterpillars increased on acceptable but nutritionally inferior host-plant species, indicating that anti-parasitoid defense may explain host-plant selection in this dietary generalist. We found no indication that host-plant selection changed according to the parasitism status of individual caterpillars...|$|E
40|$|Predicting and {{controlling}} infectious disease epidemics {{is a major}} challenge facing the management of agriculture, human and wildlife health. Co-evolutionarily derived patterns of local adaptation among pathogen populations {{have the potential to}} generate variation in disease epidemiology; however, studies of local adaptation in disease systems have mostly focused on interactions between competing pathogens or pathogens and their hosts. In nature, parasites and pathogens are also subject to attack by hyperparasitic natural enemies that can severely impact upon their infection dynamics. However, few studies have investigated whether this interaction varies across combinations of pathogen-hyperparasite strains, and whether this influences hyperparasite incidence in natural pathogen populations. Here, we test whether the association between a hyperparasitic fungus, Ampelomyces, and a single powdery mildew host, Podosphaera plantaginis, varies among genotype combinations, and whether this drives hyperparasite incidence in <b>nature.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> inoculation studies reveal that genotype, genotypexgenotype interactions and local adaptation affect hyperparasite infection. However, observations of a natural pathogen metapopulation reveal that spatial rather than genetic factors predict the risk of hyperparasite presence. Our results highlight how sensitive the outcome of biocontrol using hyperparasites is to selection of hyperparasite strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of air bubbles entrained by {{the action of}} wave breaking can strongly influence a number of physical processes including wave impact forces on coastal structures, sediment transport and the rate of air-sea gas transfer. Due to their complex <b>nature,</b> <b>laboratory</b> facilities are commonly used to examine the influence of breaking waves on such processes and the large majority of these experiments are made in small-scale flumes filled with freshwater. In experiments involving non-breaking and hence non-aerating waves, scale effects are often unimportant. However very few authors have commented on the effect of scale on air entrainment by breaking waves, and the information available (Chanson et al., 2002; Lamarre, 1993) is contradictory. It is also noted that many researchers including Haines & Johnson (1995) and Chanson et al. (2002) have suggested that there are considerable differences in the total volume and size distribution of bubbles entrained in freshwater and seawater. It is clear therefore that in order to correctly interpret the results of laboratory tests involving breaking waves, the influence of scale on the entrainment and subsequent evolution of bubble plumes generated by breaking waves, as well as the effect of water type on the size, concentration and distribution of entrained bubbles must be understood...|$|E
