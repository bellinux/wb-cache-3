Water governance in the Philippines, however, has become too complex with so many institutions involved, all with different hierarchical coverage, varied mandates and representing the interests of diverse constituencies.

50|$|The {{hydroelectric}} {{potential of}} the Bocas del Torro region was discovered in the 1970s. However, the first 70 hydroelectric power plants were built in 1998 after the privatization of Panama’s Institute of <b>Hydroelectric</b> <b>Resources</b> and Electrification (IRHE). For the approval of following hydroelectric projects the Panamanian government and private investors negotiated, in accordance with Law 127, with the indigenous representatives. Corruption, involuntary resettlement of the villages, and penetration of the local politics by the Panamanian government, however, led to the first protests against hydroelectric power plants and mining in the 90's.|$|R
5000|$|This {{suggestion}} {{was said to}} be revolutionary. There had never been a railway line of such length meant to handle mainline traffic that had been electrically operated. The only electric traction at this time was to be found on tramways and light, local railways, which used only direct current (DC) throughout. Only the tram-like Stubaitalbahn in Tyrol, built in 1904, was using alternating current (AC). Despite great opposition, Engelmann managed to implement his vision. So, the Mariazell Railway was electrified between 1907 and 1911, making use of the mountainous region's vast <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|R

Existing thermal power stations were expanded at Yallourn and Newport, with much bigger generators of 50 MW capacity used, much larger than the 15-25 MW units used pre-war. The <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>resources</b> at Eildon and Kiewa also saw continued development. The Richmond Power Station was also converted to oil firing, and smaller 'prefabricated' power stations were erected in Geelong and Ballarat.
