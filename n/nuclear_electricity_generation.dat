2500|$|High-level waste (HLW) is {{produced}} by nuclear reactors. The exact definition of HLW differs internationally. After a nuclear fuel rod serves one fuel cycle and {{is removed from the}} core, it is considered HLW. Fuel rods contain fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core. Spent fuel is highly radioactive and often hot. HLW accounts for over 95 percent of the total radioactivity produced in the process of <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation.</b> The amount of HLW worldwide is currently increasing by about 12,000 metric tons every year, which is the equivalent to about 100 double-decker buses or a two-story structure with a footprint the size of a basketball court. A 1000-MW nuclear power plant produces about 27 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (unreprocessed) every year. [...] In 2010, there was very roughly estimated to be stored some 250,000 tons of nuclear HLW, that does not include amounts that have escaped into the environment from accidents or tests. [...] Japan estimated to hold 17,000 tons of HLW in storage in 2015. [...] HLW have been shipped to other countries to be stored or reprocessed, and in some cases, shipped back as active fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The World Nuclear Association has {{reported}} that <b>nuclear</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999. Several previous international studies and assessments, suggested {{that as part of}} the portfolio of other low-carbon energy technologies, nuclear power will continue {{to play a role in}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, nuclear power usage is estimated to have prevented the atmospheric emission of 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent as of 2013. Public concerns about nuclear power include the fate of spent nuclear fuel, nuclear accidents, security risks, nuclear proliferation, and a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive. Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive fuel/"waste" [...] have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide. Although generally unaware of it, both of these glaring public concerns are greatly diminished by present passive safety designs, the experimentally proven, [...] "melt-down proof" [...] EBR-II, future molten salt reactors, and the use of conventional and more advanced fuel/"waste" [...] pyroprocessing, with the latter recycling or reprocessing not presently being commonplace as it is often considered to be cheaper to use a once-through nuclear fuel cycle in many countries, depending on the varying levels of intrinsic value given by a society in reducing the long-lived waste in their country, with France doing a considerable amount of reprocessing when compared to the US.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>generation</b> {{contributes}} some 35 {{per cent}} of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. So far, these emissions {{have not been}} taken into account when generation firms bid their availability into the National Electricity Market. Given the increasing emphasis on GHG emissions, change is required {{through the use of}} appropriate generation technologies and/or emissions trading or abatement. An Australian Emissions Trading Scheme is likely to start in 2010. Thus, the <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> sector will need to move from what has been an essentially private (i. e. production) cost structure to a social cost approach. This article focuses on appropriate technological choices (e. g. ‘cleaner coal’, gas, hydro, renewables and <b>nuclear)</b> in <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> that would help reduce the sector 2 ̆ 7 s GHG emissions. It suggests that: strategies based on appropriate technology selection can give a generation firm a competitive edge through time under market rules in the face of increasing environmental costs; with appropriate technological choices (and generation plant mix), a social cost-credit approach to <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> may ultimately lead to electricity costs that are not as markedly different from current private costs as the simple imposition of a carbon cost per tonne on the existing system would suggest; and while nuclear power may be a viable way of containing GHGs in <b>electricity</b> <b>generation,</b> this option remains controversial when social costs such as accidents and the handling of nuclear waste are considered...|$|R

25|$|A major {{export of}} the initial space {{settlement}} designs was anticipated to be large solar power satellites that would use wireless power transmission (phase-locked microwave beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space.
