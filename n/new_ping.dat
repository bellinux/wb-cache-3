5000|$|On June 24, 2015, the {{controversial}} update [...] "Team Orders" [...] was released. Most restrictions {{found in this}} update were later removed in Robocraft: Unleashed due to a heated response from the player community. A <b>new</b> <b>ping</b> system was added that allowed players to send messages to teammates on the map including: [...] "On My Way", [...] "Danger", and [...] "Go Here". The current Surrender Vote, Leaver Penalty, and Battle Stats Screen were first implemented in this update. This update also {{reduced the number of}} towers in Battle Arena mode from 4 to 3, to [...] "Give one team a constant advantage".|$|E
50|$|In 2010 a {{new rule}} {{governing}} grooves came into force for professional and high-level amateur competition. The change {{was made in}} order to decrease the amount of back spin that players were able to produce, particularly from the rough. However, due to a previous legal settlement with Ping following an earlier rule change in the early 1990s, their Eye 2 irons, which were otherwise non-conforming, were deemed legal. This led to a controversy {{in the early stages}} of the 2010 PGA Tour season when Phil Mickelson used these irons. While Mickelson's use of the irons was ruled legal, Ping decided to surrender its remaining rights under the now-20-year-old legal settlement, and the original Ping Eye 2 sets are now officially non-conforming. Ping continues to produce a set of wedges with this name and general shape, but these <b>new</b> <b>Ping</b> Eye 2 wedges have conforming face and groove designs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEulerian {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) grid-based {{models are}} widely used in air quality modeling. In such models, emissions are instantaneously diluted within the grid cells and, therefore, the near-source impacts of large point and line sources cannot be properly resolved. Plume-in-Grid models (PinG) use a subgrid-scale treatment to better represent local source contributions in an Eulerian grid-based simulation. PinG models already exist for point sources. However, modeling emissions from roadway traffic with point sources implies a very large computational burden. We present here a <b>new</b> <b>PinG</b> model that uses a Gaussian line source model, better suited than point sources to model roadway traffic emissions, embedded within an Eulerian model. The model is evaluated with a large dataset of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations over a 800 km road network. The PinG model leads to greater NO 2 concentrations and shows better performance than the Eulerian model...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlume-in-grid (PinG) models {{incorporating}} a host Eulerian model and a subgrid-scale model (usually a Gaussian plume or puff model) {{have been used}} for the simulations of stack emissions (e. g., fossil fuel-fired power plants and cement plants) for gaseous and particulate species such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM) and mercury (Hg). Here, we describe the extension of a PinG model to study the impact of an oil refinery where volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions can be important. The model is based on a reactive PinG model for ozone (O 3), which incorporates a three-dimensional (3 -D) Eulerian model and a Gaussian puff model. The model is extended to treat PM, with treatments of aerosol chemistry, particle size distribution, and the formation of secondary aerosols, which are consistent in both the 3 -D Eulerian host model and the Gaussian puff model. Furthermore, the PinG model is extended to include the treatment of volume sources to simulate fugitive VOC emissions. The <b>new</b> <b>PinG</b> model is evaluated over Greater Paris during July 2009. Model performance is satisfactory for O 3, PM 2. 5 and most PM 2. 5 components. Two industrial sources, a coal-fired power plant and an oil refinery, are simulated with the PinG model. The characteristics of the sources (stack height and diameter, exhaust temperature and velocity) govern the surface concentrations of primary pollutants (NOx, SO 2 and VOC). O 3 concentrations are impacted differently near the power plant than near the refinery, {{because of the presence of}} VOC emissions at the latter. The formation of sulfate is influenced by both the dispersion of SO 2 and the oxidant concentration; however, the former tends to dominate in the simulations presented here. The impact of PinG modeling on the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is small and results mostly from the effect of different oxidant concentrations on biogenic SOA formation. The investigation of the criteria for injecting plumes into the host model (fixed travel time and/or puff size) shows that a size-based criterion is recommended to treat the formation of secondary aerosols (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium), in particular, farther downwind of the sources (beyond about 15 km). The impacts of PinG modeling are less significant in a simulation with a coarse grid size (10 km) than with a fine grid size (2 km), because the concentrations of the species emitted from the PinG sources are relatively less important compared to background concentrations when injected into the host model with a coarser grid size...|$|E
