However, FIFA announced they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> so as complaints concerning the eligibility of players should have been submitted in writing to FIFA's headquarters in Singapore at the Youth Olympic Games no later than five days before the first match, that is, by 8 August. FIFA also said that its staff had met all footballers individually at the Olympic Village and had checked their passports against their dates of birth provided by their respective National Olympic Committees.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September, Johnsson {{posted a}} {{statement}} on the band's website about developing a rock metal opera, and that the band will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> any major tours or releasing studio albums. According to this, in 2013 the band was to play only at three minor summer festivals in Europe. In April 2013 this statement was reconsidered by Johnsson itself, and the Rock Opera Unveiled Tour was scheduled for December 2013 with 15 European gigs, to test the fans' acceptance of the new material. The main framework of these shows didn't only include excerpts from the future rock opera, but also the entire Vovin album due to its 15th anniversary.|$|E

Towards the end of the season, it was speculated that the Canucks would buyout the final year of Burrows' contract in favour of playing a younger player. In March 2016, he was reportedly told by Canucks coaching staff that [...] "younger players were a roster priority". However in the ensuing off-season, the Canucks instead bought out the contract of teammate Chris Higgins and stated they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> the same to Burrows.|$|E

However, in mid-2010, Dylan stated that they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> the film, in part because they [...] "outgrew" [...] the film. They became the new face of the children's yogurt, Dannon Danimals, in 2009; their endorsement deal was renewed in 2010. The twin brothers signed an endorsement deal with Nintendo DS in August 2010.|$|E

The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman.

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an [...] "A-" [...] rating and praised it in [...] "The romanticism has a {{personal}} dimension – for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light." [...] He also commented very positively on character of Edward, [...] "... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far." [...] Of Depp he wrote, [...] "Depp may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but {{what he does is}} tremulous and affecting."

[...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family.

[...] In another positive review, Allmusic's Marisa Brown stated [...] "... that's the magic and power of Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings: their ability to convey passion and pain, regret and celebration, found in the arrangements and the tail ends of notes, in the rhythms and phrasing, and it is exactly that which makes 100 Days, 100 Nights such and excellent release." ...|$|E

A biologist using a population model and applying known mathematics would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> applied mathematics, but rather using it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics.

There were many reactions to the decision, with most countries which already recognise Kosovo hailing the decision and saying it was [...] "unique" [...] and does not set a precedent; while many countries which do not recognise Kosovo said they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> so as the ruling could set a precedent of endorsing secession in other places.|$|E

A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors really {{need a lot of}} pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> a good job." [...] Kurtz has said that Lucas [...] "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors." ...|$|E

The current film is a 'reinvention' of James O'Barr's graphic novel for the 21st century. We're thrilled to have teamed with director Javier Gutiérrez and screenwriter Jesse Wigutow on this story, which remains true to the core of Eric Draven's plight for revenge. On the news of future remakes, however, O'Barr stated: [...] " [...] I don't have great expectations. I think the reality is, no matter who you get to star in it, or if you get Ridley Scott to direct it and spend 200 million dollars, you're still not gonna top what Brandon Lee and Alex Proyas did in that first ten million dollar movie."

[...] "It's influenced by the music our parents listened to: the Beach Boys, the Kinks, the Beatles," [...] says Ross. [...] "Our new songs are more like classic rock than modern rock.
