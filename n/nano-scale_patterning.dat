30|$|Recently, an antireflection (AR) {{property}} {{has been}} a great interest due to the demands for the enhanced performance in electronic devices such as solar cells and displays [1]. Especially, needs for AR property of plastic substrate have been increasing for the rapid growth of flexible electronic fields. Many research groups have already investigated various AR techniques such as single or multi-layer coating, surface texturization, and fabricating the periodic nanostructures [2]. AR nanostructure, so-called moth-eye structure, can efficiently reduce the light reflectance attributed to the gradual change in refractive index between the air and substrate by altering the volume fraction of structures, which in turn reduce Fresnel reflection [3]. There are many techniques available for fabricating AR nanostructure, such as electron beam lithography [4], thermal imprinting [5], hybrid nano-patterning lithography [6], dip pen nanolithography [7] and so on. However, these techniques still require high cost, complex process, and sophisticated equipments. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we employ the nanoimprint lithography (NIL) {{which is one of the}} most potential <b>nano-scale</b> <b>patterning</b> techniques with advantages of rapidness, low cost, and reproducibility. In NIL process, molds or stamps are normally produced using various materials, such as silicon, glass, and metal. However, it is difficult to prepare the periodically uniform nano-sized patterns on large area using molds from these materials. Therefore, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template can be good candidate for mold material due to the advantages of the facile large scale synthesis via electrochemical method and periodical nano-sized patterns with high aspect ratio [8].|$|E
40|$|Recent advancements in the {{semiconductor}} industry have been driven by the extreme downscaling of device dimensions enabled by innovative photolithography methods. However, such <b>nano-scale</b> <b>patterning</b> technologies are impractical for large-area electronics primarily due to extremely high cost and incompatibility with large-area processing. Therefore, alternative techniques that are simpler, more scalable and compatible with large-area manufacturing are required. This thesis explores the technological potential of two recently developed patterning techniques namely interlayer lithography (IL) and adhesion-lithography (a-Lith) for application {{in the field of}} large-area nano/electronics. The IL method relies on the use of a pre-patterned metal electrode that acts as the mask during back illumination of a photoresist layer followed by a conventional lift-off process step. On the other hand in the a-Lith approach, the surface energy of a patterned metal electrode is modified through the use of surface energy modifiers such as organic self-assembling monolayer (SAM). Following, a second metal is evaporated on the entire substrate. However, because of the present of the SAM, regions of metal- 2 overlapping with metal- 1 can easily be peeled off with the aid of an adhesive layer (e. g. sticky tape) leaving behind the two metal electrodes in close proximity to each other. Analysis of the resulting structures reveals that inter-electrode distances < 20 nm can easily be achieved. The method was then used to develop innovative process protocols for the fabrication of functional self-aligned gate (SAG) transistor architectures. Best performing devices exhibited charge carrier mobility in the range of 0. 5 - 1 cm 2 /Vs, high current on-off ratio (104), negligible operating hysteresis and excellent switching speed. Using the same a-Lith process protocol, low-voltage organic ferroelectric tunnel junction memory devices were also developed by combining the metal- 1 /metal- 2 nanogap electrodes with a ferroelectric copolymer deposited in-between them. Controllable ferroelectric tunnelling was observed enabling the devices’ conductivity to be programmed using low biases and hence been used as a non-volatile memory cell. The alternative and highly scalable patterning methods described in this thesis may one day play a significant role on how largearea electronics of the future would be manufactured. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work of Kneller & Hawig and Skomski & Coey some 20 years ago, {{the topic of}} exchange springs has received considerable attention. Exchange springs, systems where thin hard and soft magnetic layers are alternately arranged in multilayer stacks, provide great potential in improving {{the performance of a}} wide range of devices, from permanent hard magnets and microelectromechanical sensors and actuators, to magnetoresistive random access memory and permanent magnetic data storage. Artificial structuring on the nano-scale will be beneficial in improving the functionality of exchange spring systems in all of these areas. In this work, two distinctly different routes to nano-structuring in epitaxially grown rare earth – iron (REFe 2) films and exchange spring materials are described. Namely i) electron beam lithography and Ar+ ion milling to define three-dimensional nano-scale structures, and ii) ion implantation to directly alter the crystalline structure of the material at the atomic-scale. Nano-scale elements defined in REFe 2 exchange spring materials are presented, providing not only the first demonstration of nano-structuring in these materials, but also the successful implementation of electron beam lithography and Ar+ ion milling on these novel systems. <b>Nano-scale</b> <b>patterning</b> confirms the suitability of the REFe 2 exchange spring materials as excellent candidates for magnetic data storage media, since they remain relatively unaffected by nano-structuring, retaining their thermal stability and comparatively small coercivity. Ar+ ion implantation is shown to be effective at artificial structuring on the atomic-scale. In addition, energetic Ar+ ions have been successfully used to accurately control the easy and hard axes of magnetization within epitaxial YFe 2 and DyFe 2 films and a DyFe 2 / YFe 2 exchange spring multilayer. At a fluence of ~ 1017 Ar+ ions cm- 2, the magnetoelastic anisotropy (dominant at room temperature in the epitaxially grown films) is reduced to such an extent that the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy begins to dominate. Thus Ar+ ion implantation serves to alter the easy and hard axes of magnetization, rotating them through 90 °. Such behaviour is clearly evident in hysteresis loops obtained by both the magneto optical Kerr effect and vibrating sample magnetometry, and is further confirmed by micromagnetic modelling. The reduction in magnetoelastic anisotropy is attributed to energetic Ar+ ions causing RE atoms to relax to their unstrained lattice positions, thereby relieving the strain responsible for the magnetoelastic anisotropy. This interpretation is confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs) {{are a new}} class of structural materials and exhibit unique combinations of mechanical properties. As a result, their mechanical behavior has been an active area of scientific pursuit in the recent past and considerable emphasis has been paid to understand plastic deformation in them. It is now well accepted that shear transformation zones (STZs), aided by free volume, are the fundamental carriers of plasticity. At a microscopic level, deformation at low temperatures and high stresses tends to localize into shear bands. Most BMGs posses high fracture toughness despite high yield strengths and poor global ductility. However, the micro-mechanisms of fracture and fatigue in this new class of materials are not fully understood yet. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} provide insights into the fracture and fatigue response of amorphous alloys, which is important both from scientific and technological perspectives. The key questions we seek to answer through this study are the following. Do amorphous alloys undergo a ductile-brittle transition (DBT), and if so what are the reasons for it? What are the parameters that influence fatigue crack initiation in amorphous alloys and whether fatigue life can be improved by surface treatments? A related question is whether the BMGs are susceptible to deformation-induced crystallization (DIC). A Zr-based BMG, Zr 41. 2 Ti 13. 75 Cu 12. 5 Ni 10 Be 22. 5 was utilized to conduct this study. By comparing the fracture and fatigue behaviors in the as-cast and annealed states {annealing was carried out below the glass transition temperature (Tg) because of established embrittlement effects}, we seek to provide answers for the questions posed above. We begin by examining the influence of temperature on the toughness of BMGs. Impact toughness measurements show that the annealed samples, which are brittle at room temperature, recover the lost toughness beyond a critical temperature (TDB) and exhibit a sharp DBT. However, the hardness remains unaffected across the TDB. Fractography reveals <b>nano-scale</b> <b>patterning</b> and cleavage fracture in the brittle state, while the formation of thick vein-patterns and shear fracture are characteristics of the ductile state of the annealed samples. We explore various micro-mechanistic possibilities for explaining the features of this transition, including a critical Poisson’s ratio-toughness correlation. Next, to understand the origins of fatigue crack initiation, we study the un-notched fatigue response of as-cast and sub-Tg annealed Zr-based BMG specimens. Because of embrittlement and nano-crystallization at the crack initiation region, the annealed specimens exhibit a lower fatigue life than the as-cast specimens. Shot-peening of the as-cast specimens did not exhibit significant improvement in their fatigue performance because of competing effects between the compressive residual stress field (CRSF) and deformation-induced softening. To further investigate surface and repeated loading effects, the tribological response of the as-cast Zr-based BMG was compared with specimens annealed above and below the Tg. A good correlation between the hardness (increasing as a function of the annealing temperature) and wear rate was obtained. The formation and peeling of the oxide layer formed during testing was the primary wear mechanism in all the specimens. Lastly, crystallization was observed within the deformed region of the as-cast Zr-based BMG repeatedly scratched with a sharp diamond indenter. But, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) does not reveal any evidence of crystallization within the indents formed within an electron transparent film formed by laser deposition of the as-cast Zr-based BMG. Absence of crystallization in deformed regions obtained by designing critical experiments, which avoid artifacts generated during sample preparation, suggests that the occasional observation of DIC might be an exception rather than the rule in BMGs...|$|E

In this thesis, we help quantify the accuracy loss for an existing simulation package, simprint, which supports geometric abstractions and can simulate at the die level. To do this, we develop and study several comparison metrics. Our temporal submetric quantifies the error between two simulations at each timestep, while our spatial submetric quantifies the error at each spatial location. We subsequently use these metrics to study pattern abstraction by looking at how different types of patterns lead to different errors.

40|$|Micro-hot-embossing is an {{emerging}} technology with great potential to form micro- and <b>nano-scale</b> <b>patterns</b> into polymers with high throughput and low cost. Despite its rapid progress, {{there are still}} challenges when this technology is employed, as demolding stress is usually very high due to large friction and adhesive forces induced during the process. Surface forces are dominating parameters in micro- and nano-fabrication technologies because of a high surface-to-volume ratio of products. This work attempted to improve the surface properties of Si micro-molds by means of silicon- and nitrogen-doped diamond-like carbon (Si-N-DLC) coatings deposited by dc magnetron cosputtering on the molds. The bonding structure, surface roughness, surface energy, adhesive strength and tribological behavior of the coated samples were characterized with micro Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle measurement, microscratch test and ball-on-disk sliding tribological test, respectively. It was observed that the doping condition had a great effect {{on the performance of}} the coatings. The Si-N-DLC coating deposited with 5 × 10 − 6 m 3 min− 1 N 2 had lowest surface roughness and energy of about 1. 2 nm and 38. 2 × 10 − 3 N m− 1...|$|R

The domain images revealed by chemical etching have been visualized using optical, scanning electron and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in contact atomic force mode. SPM piezoresponse imaging mode allows us to investigate the domain structure under the sample surface. We classify the obtained quasi-regular domain structures and discuss the mechanism of their formation and self-maintained growth...|$|R
40|$|A high {{aspect ratio}} nano-aperture mask {{was used to}} perform sub-micrometre {{lithography}} with MeV ions. Such a mask can localise ion placement in ion machining or doping, including the fabrication of high aspect ratio structures from ion beam damaged regions by subsequent etching. Ion scattering and straggling is the main limiting factor for the transmission with respect to transmitted energy, lateral intensity and angular intensity distribution of the ions. These limits are investigated by a 3 D Monte Carlo modelling program based on the SRIM code; simulation of 1. 5 MeV He incident on nano-scale apertures of various diameters indicates that the masking is highly effective. The simulation results were tested by experiments on the transmission of 1. 5 MeV He ions through apertures that were machined using a focused ion beam of keV Ga ions in a 10 mu m thick Si-cantilever. Firstly, the aperture was {{placed in front of}} a 50 nm thick polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) coated photodiode and scanned by a microprobe. The photodiode gives an energy spectrum of the transmitted ions. Secondly, a <b>nano-scale</b> <b>pattern</b> was produced in an 800 nm thick PMMA sample by the step-and-repeat process, implementing a nanonics stage that facilitates precise three-dimensional orientation of the mask. The damaged PMMA was developed and the lateral distribution of ion impacts was imaged using non contact AFM...|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasInterrupted {{coarsening}} (IC) {{has recently}} been identified as an important feature for {{the dynamics of the}} typical length-scale in pattern-forming systems on surfaces. In practice, it can be beneficial to improve pattern ordering since it combines a certain degree of defect suppression with a limited increase in the typical pattern wavelength. However, little is known about its robustness with respect to changes in the preparation of the initial system for cases with potential applications. Working in the context of <b>nano-scale</b> <b>pattern</b> formation by ion-beam sputtering (IBS), we prove that IC properties do not depend on sample preparation. Specifically, interface dynamics under IBS is quantitatively compared on virgin amorphous and crystalline silicon surfaces, using 1 keV ArC ions at normal incidence where nanodot pattern formation is triggered by concurrent co-deposition of Fe atoms during processing. Atomic force microscopy shows that dot patterns with similar spatial order and dynamics are obtained in both cases, underscoring the key dynamical role of the amorphous surface layer produced by irradiation. Both systems have been quantitatively described by an effective interface equation. We employ a new procedure based on the linear growth of the initial surface correlations to accurately estimate the equation coefficients. Such a method improves the predictive power of the interface equation with respect to previous studies and leads to a better description of the experimental pattern and its dynamical features. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
