25|$|Modern {{disposable}} baby {{diapers and}} incontinence products have a layered construction, {{which allows the}} transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a <b>nonwoven</b> and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of <b>nonwoven</b> material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers wetness to the absorbent layer.|$|E
25|$|The circuitboard {{substrates}} {{are usually}} dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin), a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes <b>nonwoven,</b> glass fibers, sometimes even paper), {{and in some}} cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).|$|E
25|$|The {{reinforcement}} type defines {{two major}} classes of materials - woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, {{but the high}} dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at {{different areas of the}} weave pattern. <b>Nonwoven</b> reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to optimise the production of bioactive filtration <b>nonwovens</b> with Sanitized® T 99 - 19, containing quaternary ammonium salts, by evaluating different production technologies (melt-blowing, needle punching), methods of biocide incorporation (bath, spraying), biocide concentration, and conditioning. The antimicrobial activity of <b>nonwovens</b> was tested against different microorganisms, from culture collection and workplaces, using the method AATCC 100. It was shown that the biological efficiency of <b>nonwovens</b> rose when the concentration of Sanitized was increased from 0. 7 % to 2 %. Furthermore, higher biological activity was found in <b>nonwovens</b> subjected to a bath than in those which underwent spraying. The conditioning process did not significanty affect the antimicrobial activity of the <b>nonwovens</b> tested. As compared to melt-blown <b>nonwovens,</b> the needled variety were more efficient against both collection strains and those isolated from workplaces. Thus both types of <b>nonwovens</b> may be used for the production of bioactive halfmasks protecting the respiratory tract of workers exposed to microorganism...|$|R

25|$|Separation is the {{placement}} of a flexible geosynthetic material, like a porous geotextile, between dissimilar materials so that the integrity and functioning of both materials can remain intact or even be improved. Paved roads, unpaved roads, and railroad bases are common applications. Also, the use of thick <b>nonwoven</b> geotextiles for cushioning and protection of geomembranes is in this category. In addition, for most applications of geofoam and geocells, separation is the major function.|$|E
25|$|Separators have to {{physically}} {{separate the two}} electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and must be very porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use <b>nonwoven</b> porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.|$|E
25|$|Geogrids {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} segment within geosynthetics. Rather than being a woven, <b>nonwoven</b> or knitted textile fabric, geogrids are polymers formed into a very open, gridlike configuration, i.e., they have large apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Geogrids are (a) either stretched in one, two or three directions for improved physical properties, (b) made on weaving or knitting machinery by standard textile manufacturing methods, or (c) by laser or ultrasonically bonding rods or straps together. There are many specific application areas; however, geogrids function almost exclusively as reinforcement materials.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the formation temperature of <b>nonwovens</b> from bio-degradable aliphatic polyesters (trade name Bionolle) on their structure and mechanical properties. <b>Nonwovens</b> were produced by spun-bonded technique at a laboratory installa-tion at IBWCh, changing one of the process parameters i. e. the temperature of the polymer. Basic parameters of the polymer were evaluated {{in order to determine the}} spun-bonded process condition. Phase transition temperature- glass transition temperature (Tg),-melt-ing point (Tm) and mass flow index (MFI) were assessed. The effect of manufacturing condi-tions on the properties of the <b>nonwovens</b> obtained was identified on the basis of the analysis of their mechanical parameters, the sorption rate, crystallinity and compost biodegrada-tion rate.
