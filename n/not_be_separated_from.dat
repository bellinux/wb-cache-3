25|$|Joseph Kohlbeck {{from the}} Hercules Aerospace Company in Utah and Richard Levi-Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute {{examined}} some dirt particles from the Shroud surface. The dirt {{was found to}} be travertine aragonite limestone. Using a high-resolution microprobe, Levi-Setti and Kolbeck compared the spectra of samples taken from the Shroud with samples of limestone from ancient Jerusalem tombs.

25|$|When Henry III (last direct male from Claude of France) died, Brittany {{passed as}} part of the Crown to the next heir of France, Henry of Navarre, rather than to Claude's most senior heirs (either Henry II, Duke of Lorraine or Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia). While these nobles were {{technically}} Henry's heirs, there were problems with both claimants to the Ducal crown. The most important issue was that the crown, as a Sovereign Duke, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> that of the French Crown. Meanwhile, the French Crown and the Spanish Crown had been permanently separated beginning with the reign of Philip of Spain.|$|E

In 1898, Clawson was {{appointed}} to the church’s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second highest ecclesiastical body in the church, a position he held until his death in 1943. Clawson’s high profile life in Utah, and among Mormons generally, gave opportunity for commentators to look to the events in his life that may have shaped his faith in a God and his commitment to the church. He was regularly asked {{to tell the story of}} Standing’s death, and references were made to the event by church leaders in conferences of the church for decades.

25|$|Shelley {{promoted}} Keats {{as someone}} whose achievement could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned {{to endure the}} harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography {{and the lack of}} an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of separating the prefix of the infinitive mode from the verb, by {{the intervention of}} an adverb, is not unfrequent among uneducated persons… I am not conscious, that any rule has been heretofore given in relation to this point… The practice, however, of not separating the particle from its verb, is so general and uniform among good authors, and the exceptions are so rare, that the rule which I am about to propose will, I believe, prove to be as accurate as most rules, and may be found beneficial to inexperienced writers. It is this :—The particle, TO, which comes before the verb in the infinitive mode, must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> it by the intervention of an adverb or any other word or phrase; but the adverb should immediately precede the particle, or immediately follow the verb.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday survey in 1086 the tenant-in-chief of the manor was Archbishop Lanfranc, a stern and very capable man, rivalling the King himself in statesmanship, who had been {{appointed}} to the see of Canterbury in 1070 after the Conquest. He held it by frankalmoin. Domesday Book records that the manor was assessed at 30 hides and that there was land there for 14 ploughs. Of these the lord's demesne accounted for 16 hides and 2 ploughs. There were 32 villeins and 8 cottagers and they had 12 ploughs. There were also 4 slaves. These would be only the male heads of families (except for slaves who may have been counted as individuals) and the total has to be multiplied by an arbitrary figure (4 or 5 is usual) for an estimate of the total including women and children. We can therefore assume that the total population was something less than 200 in 1086. There was meadow for 4 plough teams and woodland sufficient for 300 pigs. The value was stated to be £16 in 1086 and also in {{the time of}} Edward the Confessor but only £5 immediately after the conquest in 1066. The entry concludes [...] "Asgar the Constable held this manor from Christ Church Canterbury before 1066 on condition that it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> the Church".|$|E

Boat 8 was the first lifeboat on the port side to be lowered. Ida Straus, wife of New York merchant Isidor Straus, was asked to join a group of people preparing to board but refused, saying, [...] "I will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> my husband. As we have lived, so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me and tucked me in as carefully as if we were going on a motor ride." [...] He wished her farewell and good luck, asking her to [...] "remember me to the folks back home."

The endogenous c-erbA 1 promoter is also a target for induction upon MVMp infection. Moreover, T 3 was found to up-modulate the level of cell sensitivity to parvovirus attack. These data suggest an interconnection between T 3 signalling and NS cytotoxic pathways...|$|R
