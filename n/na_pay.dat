40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} two dispositional factors, positive and negative affect (PA and <b>NA),</b> with multi-dimensional <b>pay</b> satisfaction. Among a sample of 194 full- and part-time mployees in two southern states, PA explained significant variance in pay satisfac-tion after controlling for actual salary levels, overall job satisfaction, and other individual characteristics. More importantly {{the data show that}} PA interacts with actual salary level in explaining certain dimen-sions of pay satisfaction. By contrast, results confirm the hypothesis that NA is unrelated to pay satisfaction. Implications f these results are discussed and directions for future research identified. Research on pay satisfaction has spanned ecades. It assumes even greater importance with changing work force demographics and increasing scarcity of human resources (Miceli & Lane, 1991). Despite extensive research, few stable predictors of pay satisfaction have been identified, perhaps because pay satisfac-tion research seldom explores personality or dispositional characteristics as poten-tial antecedents. According to Adler and Weiss (1988), personality research is sometimes held in low regard; this may explain the dearth of personality-related explorations in pay research. More recently, dispositional factors gained credibil-ity and visibility in the organizational literature (e. g., Arvey, Carter, & Buerkley, 1991; George, 1992). Some researchers now argue that dispositional factors may be equally as predictive of outcomes as are situational variables (House, Shane, & Herold, 1996). The time appears ripe for a systematic nvestigation of the disposi-G. Douglas Jenkins, Jr. is now deceased...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} virtual reading {{trip through the}} {{exposition}} Cartes postales du Québec d'antan, which is  part of the bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec. Based on the work Le Pays et la mémoire: pratiques et représentations de l’espace français chez Gilles Corrozet et Charles Estienne, de Chantal Liaroutzos, we conduct a research about the vulgarization and popularization of the historical knowledge in digital means. Our approach aims to get the study about a poetics of the space conducted by Liaroutzos, based on popular texts of the XVI century France, through a contemporary reading, carried out in electronic means, involving memory, patrimony, education and sources of historical information. It {{is an attempt to}} bring the history told in books, the ones from traditional collections in libraries, closer to the one presented in virtual means, especially concerning the didactic aspect of the teaching of History and the appropriations of what can be read on the Internet and the information sources.

Com base <b>na</b> obra Le <b>Pays</b> et la mémoire: pratiques et représentations de l’espace français chez Gilles Corrozet et Charles Estienne, de Chantal Liaroutzos, faz-se uma pesquisa sobre a vulgarização e popularização do saber histórico em meio digital. A abordagem visa a aproximar o estudo sobre uma poética do espaço realizada por Liaroutzos, desde textos populares da França, do Século XVI, com uma leitura contemporânea, realizada em meio eletrônico, envolvendo abordagens sobre memória, patrimônio, educação e fontes de informação histórica. Trata-se da tentativa de aproximar estudos históricos tradicionais daqueles que se apresentam em meio virtual, sobretudo no que se refere à questão didática do ensino da História, as apropriações do que é dado a ler na Internet e fontes de informação...|$|R
