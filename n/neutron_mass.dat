40|$|Abstract: In several {{previous}} publications {{the author}} has presented the theory that protons and neutrons and other baryons are the chromo-magnetic monopoles of Yang-Mills gauge theory and used that to deduce {{the up and down}} current quark masses with commensurately high precision from the tightly-known Q= 0 empirical electron <b>mass</b> and the <b>neutron</b> minus proton <b>mass</b> difference. This is then used as a springboard to closely fit a wide range of empirical nuclear binding and fusion energy data and to obtain the proton and <b>neutron</b> <b>masses</b> themselves within all experimental errors. This paper systematically pulls all of this together and a) establishes that this way of defining current quark masses constitutes a valid measurement scheme, b) lays out the empirical support for this theory via observed nuclear binding and fusion energies as well as the proton and <b>neutron</b> <b>masses</b> themselves, c) solidifies the interface used to connect the theory to these empirical results and uncovers a mixing between the up and down current quark masses, and d) presents clearly how and why the underlying theory is very conservative, being no more and no less than a deductive mathematical synthesis of Maxwell's classical theory with both the electric and magnetic field equations merged into one, Yang-Mills gauge theory, Dirac fermion theory, the Fermi-Dirac-Pauli Exclusion Principle, and to get from classica...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{analytical}} {{method of estimating}} the mass of a stellar iron core, just prior to core collapse, is described in this paper. The method employed depends, in part, upon {{an estimate of the}} true relativistic mass increase experienced by electrons within a highly compressed iron core, just prior to core collapse, and is significantly different from a more typical Chandrasekhar mass limit approach. This technique produced a maximum stellar iron core mass value of 2 : 69 1030 kg (1. 35 solar masses). This mass value is very near to the typical mass values found for neutron stars in a recent survey of actual <b>neutron</b> star <b>masses.</b> Although slightly lower and higher <b>neutron</b> star <b>masses</b> may also be found, lower <b>mass</b> <b>neutron</b> stars are believed to be formed as a result of enhanced iron core compression due to the weight of non-ferrous matter overlying the iron cores within large stars.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} method {{for determining the}} <b>mass</b> of <b>neutron</b> stars in eclipsing X-ray pulsar binaries and apply the method to six systems, namely Vela X- 1, 4 U 1538 - 52, SMC X- 1, LMC X- 4, Cen X- 3, and Her X- 1. In previous studies to determine <b>neutron</b> star <b>mass,</b> the X-ray eclipse duration has been approximated analytically by assuming the companion star is spherical with an effective Roche lobe radius. We use a numerical code based on Roche geometry with various optimizers to analyze the published data for these systems, which we supplement with new spectroscopic and photometric data for 4 U 1538 - 52. This allows us to model the eclipse duration more accurately and thus calculate an improved value for the <b>neutron</b> star <b>mass.</b> The derived <b>neutron</b> star <b>mass</b> also depends on the assumed Roche lobe filling factor beta of the companion star, where beta = 1 indicates a completely filled Roche lobe. In previous work a range of beta between 0. 9 and 1. 0 was usually adopted. We use optical ellipsoidal lightcurve data to constrain beta. We find <b>neutron</b> star <b>masses</b> of 1. 77 +/- 0. 08 M_{sun} for Vela X- 1, 0. 87 +/- 0. 07 M_{sun} for 4 U 1538 - 52 (eccentric orbit), 1. 00 +/- 0. 10 M_{sun} for 4 U 1538 - 52 (circular orbit), 1. 04 +/- 0. 09 M_{sun} for SMC X- 1, 1. 29 +/- 0. 05 M_{sun} for LMC X- 4, 1. 49 +/- 0. 08 M_{sun} for Cen X- 3, and 1. 07 +/- 0. 36 M_{sun} for Her X- 1.
