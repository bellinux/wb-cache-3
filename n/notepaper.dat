5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead {{he sat in his}} chair ripping sheets of <b>notepaper</b> into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
25|$|The Jerilderie Letter is 56 {{pages long}} and {{contains}} approximately 8000 words. It {{is written in}} the first person on <b>notepaper</b> 20.3 x 12.5cm in size. There is little punctuation and it is not grammatically correct, however it contains very few spelling mistakes.|$|E

The company prospered quickly by making paper bags for grocery stores and then {{branched}} out into printing items such as the tradesman's almanack, elaborate <b>notepapers</b> and bound ledgers.|$|R
50|$|As {{an artist}} Grigely {{has built up}} {{a body of work}} based on two subjects: “Conversations With the Hearing,” and {{archives}} and archiving practices. The conversations with the hearing consist of <b>notepapers</b> hearing people have written on in the course of conversing with Grigely. These papers are saved and archived and are used as the raw material for creating narrative art: the papers are pinned to the wall in deliberately placed juxtapositions as a way of drawing from the papers both a verbal narrative and a visually abstract one {{in the form of a}} grid. Grigely is sometimes considered a proponent of Relational Aesthetics; he was included in Nicolas Bourriaud’s show “Contacts” at Kunsthalle Fribourg in 2000 and “Touch: Relational Aesthetics in the 1990s” at the San Francisco Art Institute in 2002.|$|R
25|$|Findlay's {{handwritten}} {{letter of}} 1914 {{is kept in}} University College, Dublin and is viewable online. This letter — written on official <b>notepaper</b> by Minister Findlay at the British Legation in Oslo — offers to Christensen the sum of £5,000 plus immunity from prosecution and free passage to the United States in return {{for information leading to}} the capture of Roger Casement. That amount would be approximately £2,616,000 in 2014.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, the {{original}} handwritten lyrics {{for the song}} were nearly auctioned off at Christie's in London. The sheet of <b>notepaper</b> with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to £80,000 at the auction, which was scheduled for 30 April 2002. McCartney went to court to stop the auction, claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London home. Richard Morgan, representing Christie's, said McCartney had provided no evidence that he had ever owned {{the piece of paper}} on which the lyrics were written. The courts decided in McCartney's favour and prohibited the sale of the lyrics. They had been sent to Christie's for auction by Frenchman Florrent Tessier, who said he purchased the piece of paper at a street market stall in London for £10 in the early 1970s. In {{the original}} catalogue for the auction, Julian Lennon had written, [...] "It's very strange to think that someone has written a song about you. It still touches me." ...|$|E
500|$|Nursing {{during the}} war {{provided}} Olga and her sister Tatiana with exposure to experiences they had not previously had. The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital, women {{they would never have}} met if not for the war, and knew the names of their children and their family stories. On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how to buy anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store. Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month, and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and <b>notepaper.</b> They had also been shopping with their Aunt, Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana ...|$|E

[...] APTIS tickets used primary code 4599 in British Rail days; this changed to 7599 on post-privatisation [...] "RSP" [...] tickets.

2500|$|Wilson's Prime Minister's Resignation Honours {{included}} many businessmen and celebrities, {{along with his}} political supporters. His choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation, worsened by {{the suggestion that the}} first draft of the list had been written by his political secretary Marcia Williams on lavender <b>notepaper</b> (it became known as the [...] "Lavender List"). Roy Jenkins noted that Wilson's retirement [...] "was disfigured by his, at best, eccentric resignation honours list, which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen, several of whom were close neither to him nor to the Labour Party." [...] Some of those whom Wilson honoured included Lord Kagan, the inventor of Gannex, who was eventually imprisoned for fraud, and Sir Eric Miller, who later committed suicide while under police investigation for corruption.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Twain {{composed}} {{the story in}} pen on <b>notepaper</b> between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for Sotheby's books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, [...] "What you see is [...] attempt {{to move away from}} pure literary writing to dialect writing". For example, Twain revised the opening line of Huck Finn three times. He initially wrote, [...] "You will not know about me", which he changed to, [...] "You do not know about me", before settling on the final version, [...] "You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter." [...] The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.|$|E
2500|$|As of 22 July, Norris {{had secured}} {{the support of}} 15 of the 20 members of the Oireachtas {{required}} for a nomination. On 1 August, the Independent TDs John Halligan, Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle announced that they were withdrawing their support for Norris over the revelations of the Nawi plea. However, several other TDs re-iterated their support for Norris in his bid to become President. Maureen O'Sullivan, TD referred to a [...] "nasty campaign" [...] when expressing her continued support for Norris. Wicklow TD Stephen Donnelly said he believed it was wrong for Norris to have used Oireachtas headed <b>notepaper,</b> while Mick Wallace, TD said he believed Norris should not have sent the plea. Both Donnelly and Wallace also reaffirmed their support for Norris. Norris expressed his desire to continue his campaign for President. However, on 2 August, Norris announced {{at a press conference}} held at his home that he was withdrawing from the presidential race.|$|E
2500|$|In late July, it was {{revealed}} that Norris had written a letter in 1997 to an Israeli court asking clemency for his former partner Ezra Nawi, who had been convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy but was awaiting sentencing. Norris's letter, written on parliamentary <b>notepaper,</b> said that Nawi had been lured into a [...] "carefully prepared trap" [...] and had unwisely pleaded guilty to the charges. The story was publicised by a pro-Israel blogger John Connolly. Connolly stated that he had received a tip from [...] "someone in the trade union movement". A number of people resigned from Norris's campaign team. While Norris himself said he remained committed to his campaign, he admitted that it was now [...] "in serious trouble". It was claimed by some that these allegations, complete with Norris's subsequent defence of his comments on pederasty in ancient Greece would seriously damage his chances of securing a nomination. Norris refuted this, saying he still expected to receive a nomination, and the controversy did not affect his poll standings.|$|E
2500|$|According to James Mellaart, he {{encountered}} {{a young lady}} called Anna Papastrati on a train from Istanbul to Izmir and noticed that she was wearing an unusual armband. She is meant to have told him that this armband {{was part of a}} collection of antiquities, which was in the possession of her family. He therefore went to the house of Papastrati, who according to him was a young Greek lady and spoke good English with a slight American accent. There she showed him numerous pieces which were stylistically associated with the Yortan culture. The Yortan culture was one of the cultures which neighboured ancient Troy. Mellaart stayed several days in the house at Izmir, making sketches and notes. Photography of the pieces was forbidden, according to Mellaart. Papastrati promised to photograph the pieces herself at the next opportunity and send the photos to him. The items were said to have been found in shallow graves near the city of Dorak, south of the Sea of Marmara, during the Greco-Turkish War. Mellaart reported that he had seen photographs of the graves in which the Dorak treasure had been found and that there was a description of the discovery in Modern Greek, which he had also seen. Mellaart claimed that he left the house after a few days without correctly noting its location, although he noted a name and address (Anna Papastrati, 217 Kazim Direk Street, Izmir) on a piece of <b>notepaper.</b> No communication was received subsequently from Papastrati. Mellaart said that he did not make the discovery public at first because he was waiting for the photos and consent to publication. He claimed to have written to Izmir twice without receiving an answer.|$|E
6000|$|At {{ten o'clock}} the next morning, Hunterleys crossed the sunlit gardens towards the English bank, to receive what was, perhaps, the {{greatest}} shock of his life. A {{few minutes later}} he stood before the mahogany counter, his eyes fixed upon the half sheet of <b>notepaper</b> which the manager had laid before him. The words were few enough and simple enough, yet they constituted for him a message written in the very ink of tragedy. The <b>notepaper</b> was the <b>notepaper</b> of the Hotel de Paris, the date the night before, the words few and unmistakable: ...|$|E
60|$|I was puzzled. It {{was unusually}} thick, quite unlike {{ordinary}} <b>notepaper.</b> Suddenly an idea struck me.|$|E
60|$|He {{crushed the}} {{half-sheet}} of <b>notepaper</b> {{in his fingers}} and then dropped it into his pocket.|$|E
60|$|She {{passed him}} a letter. The <b>notepaper</b> {{was thick and}} expensive, and headed by a small coronet.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed it}} over the table to her. It was written on plain <b>notepaper,</b> in a peculiar, cramped handwriting.|$|E
60|$|The black drew a {{scrap of}} <b>notepaper</b> from under his belt and passed it over. Sheldon scanned it hurriedly.|$|E

60|$|She {{opened the}} half sheet of <b>notepaper</b> and glanced down it. It {{was written in}} a queer cramped handwriting--evidently disguised.|$|E
60|$|The King {{crossed the}} room and looked over Marie's shoulder. It was indeed his own <b>notepaper,</b> and the writing of those few words strangely resembled his.|$|E
60|$|The General was {{undoubtedly}} disturbed. He searched amongst the papers {{on his desk}} and brought out at last a flimsy half-sheet of <b>notepaper</b> which he studied carefully.|$|E
6000|$|The same evening my master's {{horse was}} ridden back by a messenger, who brought {{a scrap of}} <b>notepaper</b> with him {{addressed}} to me. It only contained these lines: ...|$|E

60|$|Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White {{far back}} in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy <b>notepaper</b> into her typewriter.|$|E
6000|$|Violet shrugged her {{shoulders}} ever so slightly. Her husband was already {{absorbed in the}} few lines hastily scrawled across the sheet of <b>notepaper</b> which he held in his hand: ...|$|E
6000|$|He puts a {{sheet of}} <b>notepaper</b> before his father, who takes it and [...] begins to con over the verses thereon, while JOHNNY looks {{carefully}} [...] at his nails.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Ravenor, {{without looking}} up, or even ceasing his writing, for I {{could hear the}} broad quill dashing away without a pause over the <b>notepaper.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} the key. He took it, opened the desk, searched amongst the little pile of papers, drew out the {{half-sheet}} of <b>notepaper,</b> {{and handed it to}} her.|$|E
