5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> was such that by the 1770s only {{a small minority of}} Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Historically Bournemouth has {{suffered}} from negative rates of <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011. This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving into the area, has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24. In England this age group accounts for only 7%.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with structural and content features of common-sense beliefs about causal processes in nature. It {{is an attempt to}} replicate findings reported by White (1992) using a different method, causal network analysis. Subjects judged the presence and direction of causal relations among a set of entities describing various human, plant and animal parameters. Structurally, the resultant network was linear. In terms of content, human parameters tended to be dominant overall, and plant parameters tended to dominate animal parameters. Both these results replicate White's findings. Results also showed a degree of antagonism between the human and <b>natural</b> worlds: human <b>increases</b> were judged to lead to natural decreases and vice versa; on the other hand, both <b>natural</b> <b>increases</b> and decreases lead to human <b>increases.</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>increases</b> lead to <b>natural</b> <b>increases</b> and <b>natural</b> decreases to natural decreases: {{there was no sign of}} the kind of interaction between increase and decrease that would be characteristic of a natural systems view...|$|R

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic rate of <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species {{is one that has}} high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E

As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into the}} countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the <b>natural</b> <b>increase</b> of the beasts under their care.

40|$|The {{effects of}} of {{lighting}} {{programs on the}} zootechnic performance and egg quality of semi-heavy laying hens were evaluated. Three light programs were tested: continuous lighting of 15 h (artificial+natural), intermittent lighting (two photophases of 15 s between the natural light) and <b>natural</b> <b>increased</b> lighting. 192 birds were used, accommodated in a shed divided into three environments {{in such a way}} that the lighting of any given one did not interfere with the others. The experimental period lasted 112 days, during which the zootechnic performance was evaluated through the egg production, feed intake, weight and mass of eggs. The quality of the eggs was valued through their specific gravity, weight and shell thickness, and Haugh unit measurement. The design was entirely randomized, with eight repetitions, and the averages of the treatments were compared by the SNK test (5 %). In the results of performance, the feed intake and egg weight were similar (P 0. 05) under the natural light program. The quality of the eggs was not altered (P< 0. 05) by any of the programs. It was concluded that the intermittent lighting program could be use in open sheds, maintaining the zootechnic performance of semi-heavy laying hens and without altering the quality of their eggs.
