40|$|Recently, {{research}} {{efforts have been}} directed toward medicinal plants and their extracts, as important sources of natural antioxidant. Lots of biologically active compounds {{are responsible for the}} antioxidant effects of yarrow - Achillea millefilium L. extracts. The aim of our study was to determine which of the process parameters of pressure enhanced solvent extraction of <b>Millefolii</b> <b>herba</b> is significant for its efficiency and weather there are interactions between the examined parameters. Compression time, decompression time and the number of cycles were identified as independent variables, while the content of total flavonoids, tannins and total polyphenols were selected as dependent variables. For obtaining the extract of M. herba, rich in antioxidative ingredients, compression time should be set on its higher level (2. 0 min), decompression time on its lower level (1. 30 min) and the number of cycles on its higher level (99).

30|$|Upper {{respiratory}} tract infections {{are a common}} occurrence in children. Such infections are {{a significant source of}} illness and pose a substantial economic burden on health services and society, in general [1]. Since most of these infections are of viral origin, usefulness of antibiotic therapy following recent guidelines on {{respiratory tract}} infections [2, 3] is not an option and overuse of antibiotic therapy must be avoided anyway. Plant-based medicines are a therapeutic option, especially because of their good tolerability. Since over 50  years now, the phytotherapeutic medicine, Tonsilgon® N (known as Imupret® N in some countries), is used worldwide to treat acute and recurrent infections of the respiratory tract [4]. Tonsilgon® N is an ethanolic-aqueous extract of seven medicinal plants, namely marshmallow root (Althaeae radix), chamomile flower (Matricariae flos), yarrow herb (<b>Millefolii</b> <b>herba),</b> oak bark (Quercus cortex), walnut leaves (Juglandis folium), horsetail herb (Equiseti herba), and dandelion herb (Taraxaci herba). These medicinal plants have established pharmacological effects including immune modulating, antiseptic, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties [4, 5].|$|R
40|$|Acute, subchronic {{and chronic}} {{effects of the}} P- 9801091 plant mixture extract at a dose of 20 mg/kg body mass were {{assessed}} in serum of healthy CBA/HZg mice at 24 hours, 7 days, 3 months and 6 months of treatment (experimental group), and compared with the values obtained {{in the control group}} of untreated healthy CBA/HZg mice. The P- 9801091 plant mixture extract is an antihyperglycemic preparation containing Myrtilli folium (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), Taraxaci radix (Taraxacum officinale Web.), Cichorii radix (Cichorium intybus L.), Juniperi fructus (Juniperus communis L.), Centaurii herba (Centaurium umbellatum Gilib.), Phaseoli fructus sine semine (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), <b>Millefolii</b> <b>herba</b> (Achillea millefolium L.), Mori folium (Morus nigra L.), Valerianae radix (Valeriana officinalis L.) and Urticae herba et radix (Urtica dioica L). Toxic effect of the P- 9801091 plant mixture extract was assessed by the following biochemical parameters: urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and cholesterol. Also, histopathological examination of the kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, testes and lungs was performed. Results of biochemical testing performed at specified time points generally showed no statistically significant differences from control values, with the only exception of the catalytic concentration of AST in the experimental group measured on day 7, which was significantly increased as compared with the control group (p< 0. 05). Pathohistological examination including characteristic organ and tissue structure, and parenchyma relationship to the adjacent blood vessels and connective tissue in the examined organs revealed no major pathologic changes...|$|R
