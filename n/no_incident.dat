5|$|The final {{decision}} was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul. Out of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting. Thereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised. The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would {{find it difficult to}} play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict. The second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country. In his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and <b>no</b> <b>incident</b> was ever recorded. He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win. With regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem. He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily. The next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.|$|E

25|$|Dancers {{have also}} taken their dances overseas. A dance on Moscow's Red Square {{provided}} <b>no</b> <b>incident,</b> but other square dancers {{have not been}} so lucky in other countries (similarly, Russians visiting cities in Manchuria have joined in the square dances). Two mainland Chinese women visiting Taipei decided to do their dance in the hotel lobby, attracting attention from guests there and causing friction with hotel management. A group dancing in Sunset Park, home {{of one of the}} earliest Chinatowns in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, made headlines in August 2014 when its leader was arrested for violating a city ordinance forbidding sounds over 45 decibels; the charge was later dropped.|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 2001, American Airlines Flight 587 {{crashed into}} the Belle Harbor {{neighborhood}} of Queens, killing all 260 people on board and five others on the ground. It was the second-deadliest aviation incident involving an Airbus A300, after Iran Air Flight 655 and the second-deadliest aviation incident to occur on U.S. soil, after American Airlines Flight 191. In terms of single-airplane crash incidents that were ruled accidental and not criminal, as of March 2014, <b>no</b> <b>incident</b> since then has surpassed that death toll, though before 2001 there had been deadlier incidents of this type. Although initially feared to be another act of terrorism, the crash was eventually found to {{have been caused by}} pilot error.|$|E
25|$|Bull and Fox {{captured}} Spillman with <b>no</b> <b>incident,</b> {{and placed}} him {{in the custody of}} several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw up their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on the table beside him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E

500|$|One night, {{following}} a duel with Messerschmitts in his Mosquito, {{he made an}} unauthorised detour over Bonn because it was Beethoven's birthplace {{and he was a}} lover of the classics. Despite his fame, Miller remained a humble man; when asked his favourite cricketing memory, he would recall <b>no</b> <b>incident</b> concerning himself, but [...] "a South Australian team-mate walking onto Lord's to a thunderous ovation a few weeks after his release from a POW camp". The cricket broadcaster, John Arlott said [...] "that for all the glamour that attached to Miller, he was staunch and unaffected as a friend".|$|E
500|$|On January 12, 2015, the University of Virginia {{reinstated}} the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity {{after the}} police investigation concluded that <b>no</b> <b>incident</b> had {{occurred at the}} fraternity. According to Charlottesville Police Capt. Gary Pleasants, Phi Kappa Psi has been cleared; [...] "We found no basis to believe that an incident occurred at that fraternity, so there's no reason to keep them suspended." [...] On March 23, 2015, police noted that Jackie refused to cooperate with law enforcement during the investigation. [...] Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo explained, [...] "We would've loved to have had Jackie come in ... {{and tell us what}} happened so we can obtain justice ... even if the facts were different." ...|$|E

[...] Crowd management presented a problem, prompting criticism and an apology from the Walkway organization, but ultimately <b>no</b> <b>incident</b> or injury.|$|E
2500|$|Investigators then {{focused on}} why the pilots decided to fly the plane direct to point Barru instead to point Siwa. Investigators {{considered}} the Situational Awareness {{and the process of}} the decision making to fly direct to Barru. It was revealed that one of the crew had done the same step before, and during the previous flight, <b>no</b> <b>incident</b> occurred. This might have caused one of the crew to trust the one that had done it before in the past to cut the route and make a direct flight to Barru. During its flight to point Barru, neither the pilot or the co-pilot discussed on the environmental condition ahead. The absence of discussion in regard to the conditions ahead, meant that the pilots had not properly considered the operational implications of flying the direct route, leading to a loss of situational awareness.|$|E
2500|$|<b>No</b> <b>incident</b> in Rundstedt's {{career has}} damaged his posthumous {{reputation}} {{as much as}} his involvement in this process. John Wheeler-Bennett wrote in 1967: [...] "To such a nadir of supine degradation had come the child of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and Moltke." [...] He called the Court [...] "the final farce of casuistry" [...] and accused the officer corps of washing its hands, Pilate-like, of their comrades. Rundstedt's biographer writes: [...] "This was something for which some Germans, while they were prepared to forgive him everything else, could and cannot excuse him." [...] Speidel, {{despite the fact that he}} was spared, was bitterly critical of Rundstedt after the war, when he became a senior officer in the new West German Army. Blumentritt, always loyal to his old Chef, complained in 1953: [...] "He has had to endure vindictiveness and jealousy even up to and after the hour of his death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hence one day, in Satya Yuga, Dakshin {{performed}} a grand yagna {{with a desire}} to take revenge on Lord Shiva. Dakshin was angry because his daughter Dakshayani also known as Sati had married the [...] "yogi" [...] Lord Shiva against his wish. Dakshin invited all the deities to the yagna except for Shiva and Gauri. The fact that she was not invited did not deter Gauri from attending the yagna. Wanting to visit her parents, relatives and childhood friends, Gauri sought to rationalize this omission. She reasoned within herself that her parents had neglected to make a formal invitation to them only because, as family, such formality was unnecessary; certainly, she needed no invitation to visit her own mother and would go anyway. She had expressed her desire to attend to Shiva who had tried his best to dissuade her from going. Shiva eventually allowed her to go escorted by [...] ganas and bid her provoke <b>no</b> <b>incident.</b>|$|E
