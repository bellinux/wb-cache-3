40|$|Friction stir linear welding (FSLW) uses a <b>non</b> <b>consumable</b> tool to {{generate}} frictional {{heat in the}} abutting surfaces. The welding parameters such as rotational speed, welding speed, axial force, tool tilt angle, etc., and tool pin profiles {{play a major role}} in deciding the joint properties. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the effect of four different tool pin profiles on mechanical properties of AA 6061 aluminum alloy. Four different profiles have been used to fabricate the butt joints by keeping constant process parameters of tool rotational speed 1200 RPM, welding speed 14 mm/min and an axial force 7 kN. Different heat treatment methods like annealing, normalizing and quenching have been applied on the joints and evaluation of the mechanical properties like tensile strength, percentage of elongation, hardness and microstructure in the friction stirring formation zone are evaluated. From this investigation, it is found that the hexagonal tool profile produces good tensile strength, percent of elongation in annealing and hardness in quenching process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding process gaining more {{applications}} in various industries due to better quality of the joint as it {{has no effect on}} parent metal. In FSW process a <b>non</b> <b>consumable</b> rotating welding tool is used to generate frictional heat between tool and abutting surface of work piece and plastic dissipation of energy to accomplish the weld. Being a solid state joining process, friction stir welding process offers various advantages like low distortion, absence of melt related defects, high joint strength etc. as compared to other conventional fusion welding techniques. Experiments were conducted on 6 mm thickness Aluminum AA 6351 -T 4, commercially available plates. These plates are joined by FSW along the rolling direction (longitudinal weld orientation) and across the rolling direction (transverse weld orientation). The hardness and tensile strength results of the weldments are presented. Results show superior mechanical properties for the joints with plates along the rolling direction as compared with the joints obtained by across the rolling direction...|$|E

The analyses were performed to assess the capability of the orbiter systems to support the proposed mission and to establish the various <b>non</b> propulsive <b>consumables</b> requirements.

40|$|For the {{effective}} {{applications of the}} welded materials they do not melt or recast. So there is an emerging process which improvise the product quality which is nothing Friction Stir Welding process. During the FSW process, the <b>non</b> <b>consumable</b> tool rotates to plunge and travels along the weld line to produce a high quality of joint. FSW process eliminates the fusion welding problems such as crack, porosity and solidification shrinkage. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the microstructure and mechanical properties of friction stir welded AA 6061 cast and wrought aluminium alloy joint. In FSW, the process parameters such as welding speed of 50 mm/min, rotational speed of 800 rpm and axial force of 8 kN was {{used to make the}} joint. Two samples were welded by keeping one sample of wrought alloy as an advancing side and cast alloy in retreating side and another sample of weld is produced by keeping the plate alternatively on both sides. The welded samples were characterized by using metallurgical microscopy and universal tensile testing machine. The changes in microstructures, micro hardness and tensile properties were discussed.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} several metal-boron phase diagrams {{is important to}} evaluation of higher order systems such as metal-silicon-boron ternaries. The refinement and reassessment of phase diagram data is a continuous work, thus the reevaluation of metal-boron systems provides the possibility to confirm previous data from an investigation using higher purity materials and better analytical techniques. This work presents results of rigorous microstructural characterization of as-cast hafnium-boron alloys which are significant to assess the liquid composition associated {{to most of the}} invariant reactions of this system. Alloys were prepared by arc melting high purity hafnium (minimum 99. 8 %) and boron (minimum 99. 5 %) slices under argon atmosphere in water-cooled copper crucible with <b>non</b> <b>consumable</b> tungsten electrode and titanium getter. The phases were identified by scanning electron microscopy, using back-scattered electron image mode and X-ray diffraction. In general, a good agreement was found between our data and those from the currently accepted Hafnium-Boron phase diagram. The phases identified are &# 945;HfSS and B-RhomSS, the intermediate compounds HfB and HfB 2 and the liquide L. The reactions are the eutectic L &# 8660; &# 945;HfSS + HfB and L &# 8660; HfB 2 + B-Rhom, the peritectic L + HfB 2 &# 8660; HfB and the congruent formation of HfB 2...|$|E
40|$|Friction stir welding(FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding technique, it uses a {{rotating}} tool to generate the necessary heat for the process. FSW is initially used to weld aluminium and its alloys because the defects like porosity, alloy segregation, hot cracking, hydrogen entrapment etc. are not encountered with this process those are mainly appeared in fusion welding processes [1]. Process uses a <b>non</b> <b>consumable</b> rotating tool which slides along with rotation on the faying surface of work-pieces to be weld. To obtain the desired strength, {{it is essential to}} have complete control over the relevant process parameters on which the quality of a weldment is based. The process was duly named friction stir welding (FSW), and TWI filed for world-wide patent protection in December of 1991 by TWI. TWI (The Welding Institute) is a world famous institute in the UK that specializes in materials joining technology. Many of the typical problems related to fusion welding of aluminium alloys can be avoided by using non conventional joining techniques. Since FSW is governed by two completely mechanical processes, i. e. mixing and forging, it is possible to join heterogeneous aluminium alloys without filler metal. Using specially designed tools and machines up to 75 mm of aluminium can be welded in a single pass. This paper describes a low-cost method of transforming a conventional milling machine into a simple FSW work station It is also a cleaner and more efficient process compared to conventional technique...|$|E
