The parity-check constraint is defined by the generator matrix (or generator polynomial) of a linear binary PC code, which can detect any type of dominant error events as well as error event combinations of the system.

We investigated return-to-zero (RZ) and nonreturn-to-zero (<b>NRZ)</b> modulation <b>formats</b> with amplitude and phase modulation. Consistent {{with earlier}} experiments, {{we find that}} the chirped return-to-zero (CRZ) modulation format has significant advantages over the <b>NRZ</b> modulation <b>format</b> in WDM systems. We elucidate the physical reasons for these advantages. We then discuss, in detail, the dy-namics of the CRZ systems, carefully distinguishing noise effects, single-channel nonlinear effects, and multichannel nonlinear effects. In this way, we provide a physical basis for understanding CRZ systems that should prove useful for future system design. In particular, {{we find that the}} pulse evolution is dominated by linear dispersion and that the spread in the eye diagrams is dominated by signal-spontaneous beat noise, just like in linear systems. However, we also find that symmetric dispersion compensation performs better than asymmetric dispersion compensation, due to the effects of nonlinearity. Additionally, we find that interchannel nonlinearities spread the eye diagrams without changing the dy-namical behavior. Thus, the system is quasilinear in the sense that its properties resemble those of linear systems, but nonlinearity plays an important role.
