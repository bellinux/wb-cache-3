500|$|As Lennon and Ono {{walked to}} a limousine, shared with the RKO Radio crew, they were {{approached}} by several people seeking autographs. Among them was Mark David Chapman. It was common for fans to wait outside the Dakota to meet Lennon and ask for his autograph. Chapman, a 25-year-old security guard from Honolulu, Hawaii, had previously travelled to New York to murder Lennon in October (before the release of Double Fantasy), but had {{changed his mind and}} returned home. Chapman silently handed Lennon a copy of Double Fantasy, and Lennon obliged with an autograph. After signing the album, Lennon asked, [...] "Is this all you want?"

Weiss, {{who was also}} a musician, <b>nodded</b> <b>in</b> recognition. An [...] "Off Limits" [...] sign was subsequently placed on the lawn to protect Strauss. The American oboist John de Lancie, who knew Strauss's orchestral writing for oboe thoroughly, was in the army unit, and asked Strauss to compose an oboe concerto. Initially dismissive of the idea, Strauss completed this late work, his Oboe Concerto, {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E

40|$|Head <b>nods</b> occur <b>in</b> {{virtually}} every face-to-face discussion. As {{part of the}} backchannel domain, {{they are not only}} used to express a ’yes’, but also to display interest or enhance communicative attention. Detecting head <b>nods</b> <b>in</b> natural interactions is a challenging task as head nods can be subtle, both in amplitude and duration. In this study, we make use of findings in psychology establishing that the dynamics of head gestures are conditioned on the person’s speaking status. We develop a multimodal method using audiobased self-context to detect head <b>nods</b> <b>in</b> natural settings. We demonstrate that our multimodal approach using the speaking status of the person under analysis significantly improved the detection rate over a visual-only approach...|$|R
