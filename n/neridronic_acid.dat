50|$|<b>Neridronic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN; the anion {{is called}} neridronate) is a bisphosphonate. In Italy {{it is used}} to treat Osteogenesis imperfecta and Paget's disease of bone.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} disorder causing low {{bone density}} and increased fragility. Bisphosphonates (BP) are a treatment of choice for OI. Few studies have investigated {{the long-term effects of}} BP in OI patients. Thus, aim of our study was to follow up adults affected by OI to evaluate changes in metabolic, clinical situation and safety of long-term <b>neridronic</b> <b>acid</b> therapy, BP authorized for OI treatment. Study design: Longitudinal observational study. Place and duration of the Study: Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of Medical Pathophysiology, Endocrinology and Nutrition. Year: 2004 - October 2010. Methodology: 68 patients underwent clinical examination, laboratory endocrine/ metabolic, pro-inflammatory cytokines screening, ECG at baseline and every 3 months and bone mineral density evaluation, by DEXA, once a year. Results: Skeletal evaluation showed a significant increase of BMD through follow up. Patients were evaluated for metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, which were unmodified by long-term therapy. Conclusion: Long-term <b>neridronic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment increases bone density, does not alter metabolic parameters indicating that this therapy can be considered safe and a valid therapeutic option for OI patients...|$|E
40|$|Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is an ultrarare {{autosomal}} dominant bone dysplasia. Cortical thickening of the diaphyses {{of the long}} bones with narrowing of the medullary cavity are associated with bone pain, waddling gait, muscular weakness, easy fatigability, and a marfanoid body habitus. There is no specific treatment for CED. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids are ineffective in improving bone lesions. A family with a mild to severe form of CED is described. Two patients received long-term bisphosphonate treatment: the 19 -year-old female proband was treated with zoledronic acid for 2. 2 years; the 4 -year-old male proband was treated with <b>neridronic</b> <b>acid</b> for 16 months and with zoledronic acid for an additional 18 months. In both probands, zoledronic acid treatment significantly improved the clinical symptoms, bone lesions, ambulation, and body habitus. Before treatment, both probands showed a marked increase in serum levels of osteocalcin, procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide, and cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen, reflecting an increased bone turnover. Bone marker levels returned to their normal values during treatment. Zoledronic acid treatment {{may be an important}} therapeutic option in patients with severe CED. Biochemical markers of bone turnover could be considered as surrogate indexes of CED activity...|$|E
