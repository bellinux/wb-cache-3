50|$|<b>Non-expert</b> <b>opinion</b> {{refers to}} the opinion given in {{restricted}} circumstances by laymen or persons who do not possess any expertise. These circumstances mainly concern matters of everyday life where a person {{may be expected to}} give opinions and which opinions may be safely acted upon by others.|$|E
50|$|Opinion {{evidence}} {{refers to}} {{evidence of what}} the witness thinks, believes, or infers in regard to facts, as distinguished from personal knowledge of the facts themselves. In common law jurisdictions the general rule is that a witness is supposed to testify {{as to what was}} observed and not to give an opinion on what was observed. However, there are two exceptions to this rule: expert evidence and <b>non-expert</b> <b>opinion</b> given by laymen which people in their daily lives reach without conscious ratiocination.|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, the {{perception}} of coastal disasters has become a vital subject to policy and decision makers concerned with coastal risk and resilience issues. Public opinion on coastal issues was considered as a critical feature in contemporary coastal zone management field as it drives the growth of efficient and effective coastal infrastructure management and resilience strategies. The current study intended at obtaining vision into {{the perception}} of coastal disasters and risk along the Welsh coast. Specified {{the significance of the}} industrial growth, existing infrastructure expansion on the Welsh coast, the qualitative survey (n= 86) considered the both experts and <b>non-experts</b> <b>opinions.</b> Results revealed that most of the public (non-subject experts) has a sound knowledge on coastal disasters, and it’s related issues but not on storm damage costs and other associated costs. Besides, major percent of people (subject experts) have an excellent knowledge on coastal disasters and vulnerability issues but not on the allocation of budget for construction of coastal defenses at national and regional and sub-regional levels. However, {{the majority of the people}} requests additional communication about the intensity of coastal disasters and risk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} how <b>non-experts</b> develop an <b>opinion</b> on climate change, {{and how those}} {{opinions}} could be changed by public discourse. I use Hubert Dreyfus’ account of skill acquisition to distinguish between experts and non-experts. I then {{use a combination of}} Walter Fisher’s narrative paradigm and the hermeneutics of Paul Ricœur to explore how <b>non-experts</b> form <b>opinions,</b> and how public narratives can provide a point of critique. In order to develop robust narratives, they must be financially realistic. I therefore consider the burgeoning field of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) analysis as a way of informing realistic public narratives. I identify a potential problem with this approach: the Western assumptions of ESG analysis might make for public narratives that are not convincing to a non-Western audience. I then demonstrate how elements of the Chinese tradition, the Confucian, Neo-Confucian, and Daoist schools, as presented by David Hall and Roger Ames, can provide alternative assumptions to ESG analysis so that the public narratives will be more culturally adaptable. This research contributes to the discipline by bringing disparate traditions together in a unique way, into a practical project with a view towards applications. I conclude by considering avenues for further research...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} element missing from open access repositories is a {{quantitative assessment of}} the hosted research items that will facilitate the process of selecting the most relevant and distinguished content. Common currently available metrics, such as number of visits and downloads, {{do not reflect the}} quality of a research product, which can only be assessed directly by peers offering their expert opinion together with quantitative ratings based on specific criteria. To address the aforementioned situation, the open peer review module, OPRM, can be installed to existing Dspace institutional or other repositories and offered as an overlay service. Digital research works hosted in these repositories could then be evaluated by an unlimited number of peers that would offer not only a qualitative assessment in the form of text, but also quantitative measures that will be used to build the work’s reputation. Importantly, this evaluation system will be open and transparent. By open we mean that the full text of the peer reviews will be publicly available along with the original research work. By transparent we mean that the identity of the reviewers will be disclosed to the authors and to the public. In our model, openness and transparency are two elemental aspects we consider necessary {{to address the issue of}} biased or <b>non-expert</b> <b>opinions,</b> which is inherent in the anonymous peer review model, characterized by the unaccountability of reviewers. Important to notice, OPRM includes a reviewer reputation system based on the assessment of reviews themselves by other peer reviewers. This allows a sophisticated scaling of the importance of each review on the overall assessment of a research work, based on the reputation of the reviewerOpenAIR...|$|R
40|$|For my seminar project, I {{chose to}} work with {{computer}} languages for representation of symbolic music. Specifically, I extended a format translation framework called pyScore, written by Michael Drottboom (Droettboom 2006). It is implemented in the Python programming language, and is modular in design. Previously, it translated between the GUIDO (Hoos et al. 1998) and MusicXML (Good 2001) formats, and also had output-only support for MIDI files. I {{became interested in the}} LilyPond music typesetting system (Nienhuys and Nieuwenhuizen 2003). Its output is high in quality, and it has extensive capabilities for flexible formatting of all kinds of music, from medieval, to classical, modern and contemporary scores. In my <b>non-expert</b> <b>opinion,</b> LilyPond's output seems of higher quality than the GUIDO NoteServer. I created a module which translates the internal GUIDO representation (a tree structure of Python objects) into an internal representation of the LilyPond input format, which is then dumped to a file which can be rendered to a PDF document or PNG image using LilyPond. In this way, it is possible to typeset GUIDO files using the LilyPond software. Currently it handles most of the GUIDO basic subset. ...|$|E
40|$|The UK {{government}} decided to introduce Income Tax in 1799. Later, tax avoidance schemes involved creation of Deeds of Convenant. It {{is a fact}} that crime is increasing but the number of people committing crime is not increasing because many crimes are repeated crimes committed by persons with habitual criminal behaviour, ie hard-core criminals. -/- For {{more than half a century}} now, there has been scientific evidence that genetics plays a key role in the origins of criminal behaviour. There are many ethical considerations thus raised which governments are reluctant to face and which, if faced, will cost a lot in financial terms to implement and to also dismantle the old entrenched systems -/- As the author states, genetics is considered in evidence only in federal United States; New Zealand and Australia and not in the United Kingdom, although the UK’s Criminal Justice Act 2003 does, in some circumstances, allow evidence from relatives about the defendant’s character, but this is not expert evidence but merely <b>non-expert</b> <b>opinion,</b> permitted in relation to the defendant’s bad character in circumstances as per s 101 CJA 2003. Note that in the US, the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 402 prevents the submission of irrelevant evidence. -/-...|$|E
40|$|Research {{productivity}} is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Technological innovations, {{a surge in}} available computing power, and {{the ease with which}} digital information is stored and communicated is helping researchers to cross experimentation boundaries, to increase data availability, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge. As a result, traditional research is being transformed into a dynamic and globally interconnected effort where ideas, tools and results can be made instantly accessible to the entire academic community. Institutional and multidisciplinary open access repositories {{play a crucial role in}} this emerging landscape by enabling immediate accessibility to all kinds of research output. One important element still missing from open access repositories, however, is a quantitative assessment of the hosted research items that will facilitate the process of selecting the most relevant and distinguished content. Common currently available metrics, such as number of visits and downloads, do not reflect the quality of a research work, which can only be assessed directly by peers offering their expert opinion together with quantitative ratings based on specific criteria. To address this issue we developed an Open Peer Review Module (OPRM) to be installed on existing open access repositories and offered as an overlay service. Any digital research work hosted in a compliant repository can then be evaluated by an unlimited number of peers who offer not only a qualitative assessment in the form of text, but also quantitative measures that are used to build the reputation of the research work and its authors. Crucially, this evaluation system is open and transparent. By open we mean that the full text of the peer reviews are publicly available along with the original research work. By transparent we mean that the identity of the reviewers is disclosed to the authors and to the public. In our model, openness and transparency are two elemental aspects we consider necessary to address the issue of biased or <b>non-expert</b> <b>opinions,</b> which is inherent in the anonymous peer review model, characterized by the unaccountability of reviewers. Importantly, our open peer review module includes a reviewer reputation system based on the assessment of reviews themselves by other peer reviewers. This allows a sophisticated scaling of the importance of each review on the overall assessment of a research work, based on the reputation of the reviewer. The implementation of a peer review layer on top of institutional repositories could have the potential to transform the current academic publication landscape by introducing new scholarly workflows where a research item can be openly evaluated by the world’s experts right at the institutional repository of its authors, before being submitted to an academic journal. This workflow challenges the current practices of peer review research evaluation. In most cases, journals, acting as brands in a competitive market, foster academic competition for a limited number of publication slots, instead of promoting open scholarship and collaboration. The integration of peer review in repositories will enable direct and transparent academic collaboration between authors and reviewers. In addition, the use of the OPRM will produce novel metrics directly reflecting the perceived quality of a research work by expert peers, contrary to current available altmetrics that only indirectly account for quality through usage statistics.
