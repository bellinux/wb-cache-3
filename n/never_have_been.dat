5|$|Elvis might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born, {{but someone}} else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E

5|$|Police {{determined}} {{that there were}} 32 clomethiazole pills in Moon's system. Six were digested, sufficient to cause his death; the other 26 were undigested when he died. Max Glatt, an authority on alcoholism, wrote in The Sunday Times that Moon should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given the drug. Moon was cremated on 13 September 1978 at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and his ashes were scattered in its Gardens of Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden could <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E

5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> part of the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) {{to the east of}} the site.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce {{during his}} {{long years of}} writing Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's {{constant}} financial support), {{there is a good}} possibility that his books might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France.|$|E

Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E

This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attempted.|$|E

If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is {{the business of the}} managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

Despite her complete unsuitability, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent, which would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> granted.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} the murder are sketchy. Carol was killed due to blunt trauma to her face by means of some instrument, alleged in court {{to have been an}} ice axe. She was then bound with rope, using complex knots, weighed down with rocks and lead pipes and thrown {{overboard}} from a boat on Coniston Water. The body landed on an underwater ledge where it was later found by amateur divers. Had it been dropped a few metres further from the shore, it would have sunk to the much deeper bottom and probably <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discovered.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom might <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ruled {{jointly by}} Alberht and Beonna. It is {{generally}} accepted that Alberht and the later Æthelberht II, who ruled East Anglia {{until his death}} in 794, are different kings, but the historian D. P. Kirby has identified them as being one person. According to Kirby, Beonna might have ascended the throne in around 758 and the issuing of his coins could indicate that East Anglia broke free of Mercian domination for a time, so linking Beonna's reign with the eventual disintegration of Mercian hegemony that occurred after Æthelbald's death.|$|E

Therefore, since Archer will <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> infected, he would have remained Captain and possibly prevented the chain of events that led to Earth's destruction.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product.

Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E
