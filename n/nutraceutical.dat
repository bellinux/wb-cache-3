40|$|<b>Nutraceuticals</b> are food {{components}} or {{active ingredients}} present in foods {{and used in}} therapy. This article analyzes {{the characteristics of the}} molecules with a lipid-lowering effect. The different <b>nutraceuticals</b> may have different mechanisms of action: inhibition of cholesterol synthesis primarily through action on the enzyme HMGCoA reductase (policosanol, polyphenols, garlic and, above all, red yeast rice), increase in LDL receptor activity (berberine), reduction intestinal cholesterol absorption (garlic, plant sterols, probiotics) and also the ability to interfere with bile metabolism (probiotics, guggul). Based on the different mechanisms of action, some <b>nutraceuticals</b> are then able to enhance the action of statins. <b>Nutraceuticals</b> are often used without relevant evidence: mechanisms of action are not clearly confirmed, most of clinical data derived from small, uncontrolled studies and finally, except for fermented red rice, there are no clinical trials which may document the relationship between these interventions and the reduction of clinical events. Therefore, among all <b>nutraceuticals,</b> it is necessary to extrapolate those having a really documentable efficacy. However these kinds of treatments are usually well-tolerated by patients. Overall subjects with a middle or low cardiovascular risk are the best indication of <b>nutraceuticals</b> but they may also be useful for patients experiencing side effects during classical therapies. Finally, in consideration of the additive effect of some <b>nutraceuticals,</b> a combination therapy with classical drugs may improve the achievement of clinical targets. Thus, <b>nutraceuticals</b> may be an helpful alternative hypolipidemic treatment and, if properly used, might represent a valid strategy of cardiovascular prevention...|$|R
40|$|The {{industry}} has made {{available in the}} market a series of substances (<b>nutraceuticals)</b> which intent would be to optimize the use of nutrients in some metabolic paths, influencing positively reproductive performance in animals. However, {{the response to the}} use of <b>nutraceuticals</b> varies according to the animal. As the organism is highly complex and in order to achieve a perfect activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, an ideal interaction in molecular basis is needed, where the <b>nutraceuticals</b> can have their direct action. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the function and research results using the main <b>nutraceuticals</b> (&# 946; carotene, vitamin A, L-carnitine, omegas 3, 6 and 9 and Gamma-oryzanol) on reproductive characteristics of bulls and stallions...|$|R

25|$|<b>Nutraceutical</b> Corporation, a {{supplement}} manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged {{the legality of}} the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. <b>Nutraceutical</b> Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nutraceuticals</b> play an {{important}} role in cardiovascular prevention in patients with dyslipidemia. Many scientific studies support the use of these substances alone or associated with other drugs in clinical practice. Specifically, monacolines, berberine, policosanol and gamma-oryzanol could significantly reduce cholesterolemia. However, there is still an insufficient number of studies demonstrating morbidity and mortality outcomes of <b>nutraceuticals,</b> nor are sufficient data regarding the use of <b>nutraceuticals</b> in different types of patients, on tolerability, safety, target population, modality and duration of use present in the literature...|$|R

25|$|The {{ruling was}} {{appealed to the}} U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page {{administrative}} record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. <b>Nutraceutical</b> Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloids containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the idea}} is controversial, some {{evidence}} suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents {{about the size of}} mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and <b>nutraceutical</b> supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.|$|E

Glibenclamide was used as positive control and normal saline was used as negative control. Serum glucose levels of normal and diabetic induced rats were estimated by Glucose Oxidase method using a kit, and it were 4. 33 ± 0. 43 mmol/L and 8. 27 ± 0. 45 mmol/L respectively. The alloxan induced diabetic rats were grouped into six, which were then treated with the four <b>nutraceuticals</b> and two controls. Treatment was given orally everyday for 28 days. Serum glucose level was analysed every 7 day intervals. It was observed that lowering of glucose level was significant (P = 0. 01) for every 7 day treatment period. All of the <b>nutraceuticals</b> reduced the serum glucose level nearly to the normal value within 28 days.

40|$|AbstractColon {{cancer is}} a world-wide health problem and the second-most {{dangerous}} type of cancer, affecting both men and women.
