5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception.

Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E

5|$|R. Gordon Wasson {{recounted the}} details of these deaths, <b>noting</b> <b>the</b> {{likelihood}} of Amanita poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness {{that led to his}} death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning (p.110). Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.|$|E

5|$|The {{theology}} of Huldrych Zwingli {{was based on}} the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired word of God and placing its authority higher than what he saw as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration <b>noting</b> <b>the</b> differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E
5|$|Through the Wilderness is a psychedelic-folk {{tribute to}} Madonna without {{adhering}} {{to any particular}} coherent sound. The cover songs were composed differently from the original versions by the performers; they changed the melody of the Madonna tracks by tweaking the lyrics and re-interpreting the actual meaning. Music critics both complimented and criticized the songs, <b>noting</b> <b>the</b> strength of Madonna's discography in the album's track list.|$|E

5|$|Villani was {{inspired}} to write his Cronica after attending the jubilee celebration in Rome in 1300 and <b>noting</b> <b>the</b> venerable history of that city.

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, <b>noting</b> <b>the</b> extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
