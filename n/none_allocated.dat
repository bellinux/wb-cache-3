The chieftains of the tribes then brought their offerings — 6 draught carts and 12 oxen — and God told Moses to accept them {{for use by the}} Levites {{in the service of the}} Tent of Meeting. He allocated two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites and the remaining four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites. <b>None</b> were <b>allocated</b> to the Kohathites, 'because the sacred objects they took care of had to be carried on their shoulders'.|$|R
40|$|The {{basic idea}} with virtual memory {{is to create}} an {{illusion}} of memory that is as large as a disk (in gigabytes) and as fast as memory (in nanoseconds). The key principle is locality of reference, which recognizes that a significant percentage of memory accesses in a running program are made to a subset of its pages. Or simply put, a running program only needs access to a portion of its virtual address space at a given time. With virtual memory, a logical (virtual) address translates to: – Main memory (small but fast), or – Paging device (large but slow), or – <b>None</b> (not <b>allocated,</b> not used, free. ...|$|R

40|$|Which {{operations}} university endowments should {{fund has}} remained a heated topic of debate {{over the past few}} decades. Scholars, policy makers, students, and their families try to understand where the best interest of higher education lies when it decides to allocate endowment income. Using a sample of institutions over time (1977 - 1996), my study provides insight on the different categories of use that endowment income supports through a first differences model. I will also examine how much tuition per student rises as endowment income rises. The results of this paper provide evidence to administrators and policy makers who are interested in the suitable roles of endowment spending for institutions. I find that all types of higher education institutions spend their endowment income on academic related causes, most notably faculty and research, while <b>none</b> is <b>allocated</b> toward student grant aid. In addition, I find a small but positive and significant relationship between endowment income and tuition and fees per student...|$|R

25|$|Currently, {{federal funds}} are {{allocated}} to organizations that provide shelter {{and services to}} homeless youth in the United States through two major programs: The Runaway Youth Act, first implemented in 1974 and reauthorized in 2003 as the Runaway, Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. According to the Center for American Progress, there are currently no mandates that these funds be provided to shelters that do not discriminate against LGBT youth, meaning some federal funding is provided towards organizations with explicitly anti-gay or anti-transgender stances, {{which can lead to}} denial of care or the sending of youth to sexual orientation conversion therapy. The government spends $4.2 billion annually on homeless assistance programs, but less than 5% of this funding ($195 million) is allocated for homeless children and youth. Only part of this goes to serve unaccompanied homeless youth, and <b>none</b> is specifically <b>allocated</b> to target the needs of LGBT homeless youth. There are currently no federal programs or policies designed to specifically meet the needs of or protect LGBT Homeless youth in the United States.|$|R
40|$|This work {{develops}} a profit maximizing cost allocation scheme for firms that allocate all costs to their various outputs {{and then use}} these costs to set prices, {{a process known as}} fully-distributed cost-based pricing. If the costs incurred by the firm are not easily traced to a particular output (for example, the electric bill for a shared manufacturing plant), the costs must be allocated. The demand for a given output is assumed to be a function of the price. Hence, the cost allocation scheme that is selected will affect both the price and the demand for the output. The allocation of common costs that maximizes the firm's overall profit under these conditions is identified. Frequently, the profit maximizing allocation <b>allocates</b> <b>none</b> of the untraceable common costs to {{one or more of the}} outputs. This allocation scheme stands in contrast to common practices of sharing costs equally or proportionally across outputs. Examples explore the implications of such a profit maximizing cost allocation on prices and demand in four scenarios: i) no constraints, ii) constraints on maximum allowable prices, iii) a change in market size, and iv) cost containment incentives. cost allocation, pricing, managerial accounting...|$|R
40|$|The Ministry of Health, through Decree No. 004 year 2003, has {{outlined}} that {{in order}} to strengthen health managementin decentralization era it needs health research and development in regional area. The study aims to conduct a situational analysis for obtaining base-line data of research and development at regional level to develop a facilitation model of health research and development at provincial and district level. It was an exploratory and case study in East Kalimantan Province, with the samples of Balitbangda, Dinas Kesehatan and Bappeda. The study has identified that at provincial level it has been founded a Balitbangda Provinsi, whereas at district level there have been founded just two Balitbangda, i. e. Balitbangda Kabupaten Kutai Kartanegara and Badan Arsip, Diklat dan Litbang Kola Samarinda. At Balitbangda Provinsi, there were very limited researchers, only 5 researchers and 2 candidates of researcher and out of them there was no health researcher. With an annual research budget about 800 million to 1. 4 billion rupiahs, there was no allocation for health research. Due to limited researchers, most of the research projects were contracted or working together with other institutions. In fact, a number of districts/municipalities have spent their budget on research projects; however <b>none</b> was <b>allocated</b> for health research. From FGD, it has been identified that Dinas Kesehatan kabupaten/kota demanded information (evidence) through research, like "surkesda", rapid surveys, and program evaluation. Nevertheless. there are not available of competence researchers, so more training is needed. In order to strengthen health research at provincial and district level, the study recommended (i) the improvement of researchers 2 ̆ 7 competence at Balitbangda, Bappeda, and Dinas Kesehatan Provinsi, as well as Balitbangda, Bappeda and Dinas Kesehatan kabupaten/kota with regard of research methodolgy, (ii) the facilitation and training of supporting competence for health research management, (iii) the focal point of health research is at Balitbangda for district/municipalities with Balitbangda, and (iv) for district/municipalities with no Balitbangda, the focal point of health research is at Dinas Kesehatan kabupaten/kota...|$|R
30|$|The {{commercial}} area {{used in this}} case study {{is located in the}} SoHo area in Lower Manhattan. Twenty-one commercial establishments were surveyed, to obtain employment and other data related to FSA at their businesses. The businesses were in the retail industry (NAICS 44) with 19 retail stores, the majority being clothing and accessories stores, and the remaining two belong to the food services sector (NAICS 72). In most cases, these are high-end stores where customer attention is a central element of their business strategy. Due to the extremely high land values, the amount of storage space is minimal or non-existent. In terms of parking supply for FSA, this case is significantly less encouraging as the businesses do not have off-street parking. On-street parking is the only option. In the area in front of the stores, the FSA parking supply (assuming an average vehicle size of 10  m) for commercial vehicles—which include FSA vehicles, and passenger vehicles with commercial license plates—is estimated to be 28 (<b>none</b> are exclusively <b>allocated</b> to freight deliveries). To consider the fact that drivers may be willing to park within a reasonable distance from the delivery location, the authors also estimated the parking supply for an area of one block away in all directions around the target study area in pane (b) of Fig. 1. The total number of on-street parking spots for all commercial vehicles is estimated to be 125, with another 12 spots allotted for exclusive use of delivery trucks from 7 / 8  am to 10  pm (137 in total). Obviously, these parking spots would also be used by other businesses nearby, not just by the ones in the target area.|$|R
40|$|The Road Ecology {{theme is}} new in Brazil and in Latin America in general. Few studies and {{scientific}} publications {{were made in}} this area with specific and replicable methodology. Underpasses were allocated on the highway SP- 225, {{in the year of}} 2008, according to previous studies of hotspots of roadkills made by IBAMA (Environmental Brazilian Institute), but none of them considered the influence of the landscape structure on the surrounding habitat. So, we aimed to analyze and understand which component of the landscape structure can influence the roadkills in a Brazilian highway and analyze if these underpasses was located in areas of hotspots roadkills. Medium and large mammals carcasses were collected by Centrovias (a private enterprise that managed the road) from May 2005 to June 2006 in 56 km stretch on the highway SP- 225 in the 110 city of Brotas, São Paulo, Brazil. Were created occurrences reports for each roadkilled animal containing: date, time, local on the highway (km + m), geographic coordinate and the specie affected. Forest-patch metrics (number of fragments, proportion of forest and size of the largest pacth) were extracted from a 2008 CBERS 2 B-CCD image using Fragstats (version 3. 3) to examine the best predictor to medium and large mammals roadkills. Following a visual classification three land cover classes were mapped (forest, non-forest and water) and 13 buffers zones with 5 km were selected around the highway SP- 225. An exploratory data analysis was conducted through the Pearson‟s correlation and 6 models (1 null model) were built to conduct a model selection procedure based on the AICc value. There were 48 medium and large mammals roadkills on the 56 stretch sampled between May 2005 and June 2006. The best model selected to predict medium and large mammals roadkills on the SP- 225, was the proportion of forest (wAICc = 0. 97) on the 5 km surrounding habitat. From 13 buffer zones analyzed, 4 presented the highest number of roadkills (mean = 21. 75, sd = 2. 21) and the highest proportion of forest (mean = 24. 17, sd = 2. 34), so the higher the proportion of forest, higher will be the number of roadkills. In two of these buffer zones were allocated an appropriate number of underpasses. In all the buffer zones we had roadkills occurrence, but in three of them <b>none</b> underpass was <b>allocated.</b> Despite {{the fact that there is}} a low number of roadkills in these buffers (range: 2 - 4) the presence of at least one underpass will be necessary to avoid these roadkills. The others buffers also had a low number of roadkills (range: 4 - 6) but there are almost the same number of underpasses allocated in the buffers zones with the higher number of roadkills. The number of roadkills is strictly related to the proportion of forest in the surrounding habitat, so we highlight the importance of the landscape structure to predict the occurrence of medium size and large bodied mammals roadkills and the use of this tool to allocate underpasses in future road ecology studies...|$|R
