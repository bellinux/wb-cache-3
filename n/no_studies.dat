5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|While <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> have {{established}} {{whether or not}} these ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

Most aviation and medical professionals do not believe any long-term health effects exist from fume events, and <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> have shown any danger to the public.

25|$|In the United States, ongoing {{direct use}} of nitric oxide use is only {{approved}} for neonates. In the adult ICU setting, inhaled ·NO can improve hypoxemia in acute lung injury, {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome, and severe pulmonary hypertension, although the effects are short-lived and there are <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> demonstrating improved clinical outcomes. It is used on an individualized basis in ICUs {{as an adjunct to}} other definitive therapies for reversible causes of hypoxemic respiratory distress.|$|E

There are different definitions of minimally invasive knee surgery, which may include a shorter incision length, retraction of the patella (kneecap) without eversion (rotating out), and specialized instruments. There are few randomized trials, but studies have found less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and shorter recovery. However, <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> have shown long-term benefits.|$|E

The correct sentence is: <b>No</b> <b>study</b> reported adjusted estimates in the miscarriage review, therefore results are presented individually. There is {{an error in}} the 13 th sentence of the Characteristics of Studies Included in the Miscarriage Review section of the Results. The correct sentence is: <b>No</b> <b>study</b> in the miscarriage review reported adjusting for potential confounders. There is an error in the last sentence of the Miscarriage subsection of the Heterogeneity Assessment in the Results. The correct sentence: Furthermore, <b>no</b> <b>study</b> adjusted for confounding. The third to last sentence in the first paragraph of the discussion should be removed. There is an error in the second sentence of the second paragraph in the Strengths and Limitations of the Review section of the Discussion. The correct sentence is: <b>No</b> <b>study</b> adjusted for confounders in the miscarriage review and so a meta-analysis was not performed as a result. There are errors in Table 5.

30|$|Although {{there is}} <b>no</b> {{corresponding}} <b>study,</b> {{it is generally}} agreed that the circuit should be rinsed with isotonic saline solution and that arterial and venous lines should be connected simultaneously to avoid volume depletion induced by rinsing. Heparinization of the rinsing fluid is debated because <b>no</b> <b>study</b> has tested its usefulness. In hemodialysis, {{it is not necessary}} to add heparin when rinsing the circuit. In hemofiltration, usual practice is to use 5000  IU of heparin in the second liter of fluid when rinsing the circuit so as to extend filter lifespan and increase adsorption capacity (<b>no</b> <b>study).</b> This approach, however, has not been validated by scientific evaluation.|$|R

25|$|The {{intervention}} of {{artists in the}} design process has been criticized by experts such as anthropologist Victoria Novelo, who claims {{that many of these}} artists “interfere” in the craft process by introducing ideas even though they have <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> in the cultural traditions behind these crafts. She also claims that many college-educated designers believe that with innovative designs, they can help the artisan get out of poverty, without knowing why the artisan is poor in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Despite these facts, {{studies show}} {{only a slight}} {{increase}} in immediate stressors among military brats whose parents serve in a combat zone, although <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> on the longer-term effects have ever been done. Boys and younger children do show the most risk when a parent is deployed, but rarely does this require clinical intervention. However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.|$|E
25|$|During {{this early}} stage of life they {{are very similar to}} Carangoides bartholomaei, and often form {{associations}} with floating pelagic Sargassum mats which provide the young fish with protection. Young fish often inhabit the shallow reef waters, but move offshore once they reach sexual maturity. Due to a lack of discernible otolith rings, <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> on the growth of the bar jack have been published. Males and females reach sexual maturity at different lengths; males at 25cm and females at 31cm.|$|E

25|$|<b>No</b> <b>studies</b> examine topical {{salicylic}} acid in pregnancy. Oral {{salicylic acid}} is {{not associated with}} an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|Crop milk is a thick cheesy substance, {{derived from}} {{squamous}} cells sloughed {{off from the}} crop of {{both male and female}} pigeons which promotes a high growth rate in squabs. There are <b>no</b> <b>studies</b> of the composition of crop milk specific to Ducula. However, in domestic pigeons (Columba livia), the crop milk is found to contain lipids, proteins and enzymes, and also facilitates the transfer of maternal antibodies to squabs, as in mammals. The hypertrophy of crop tissue and production of crop milk is determined by the hormone prolactin, as in mammals.|$|E
