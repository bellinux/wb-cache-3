5|$|To man his signals units, Simpson {{sought to}} obtain some 4,000 Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) personnel. Two special signal {{training}} battalions were activated to cater for them, and Simpson inspected the 2nd Signal Training Battalion (AWAS) at Ivanhoe Grammar School with Lieutenant Colonel Sybil Irving on 6 July 1942. By 1945, the Australian Corps of Signals numbered some 25,000 men and women. The large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> serving in Signals units caused friction between Irving and Simpson over what {{degree of control}} he exercised over them.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2015, a {{majority}} of seats in the Maryland Senate are held {{by members of the}} Democratic Party, with 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans, greater than a two-thirds majority. This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions {{was a central}} feature of the war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Industrialisation, {{urbanisation}} and the Disruption of 1843 all {{undermined the}} tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> with SCI {{giving birth}} and having healthy babies are increasing. Around {{a half to}} two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E

5|$|While women {{worked in}} coal mines {{elsewhere}} in Britain, {{either on the}} surface or underground, bal maidens worked only on the surface. It is likely that Cornish women had worked in metal mining since antiquity, but the first records of female mine workers date from the 13thcentury. After the Black Death in the 14thcentury, mining declined, and no records of female workers have been found from then until the late 17thcentury. Industrial improvements, the end of Crown control of metal mines, and rising demand for raw materials caused a boom in Cornish mining in the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. Increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and girls were recruited to the mines from about 1720, processing ore sent up by the male miners underground. The discovery of cheaper sources of copper in North Wales in the 1770s triggered a crash in the copper price, and many mines closed.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E

25|$|The {{glass ceiling}} metaphor {{has often been}} used to {{describe}} invisible barriers ("glass") through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them ("ceiling"). These barriers prevent large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce. Moreover, this effect prevents women from filling high-ranking positions and puts them at a disadvantage as potential candidates for advancement.|$|E
40|$|In Indonesia, women 2 ̆ 7 s participation, {{particularly}} in parliament, has been intensively discussed in 2002. The extensive discussions continued in 2003 {{especially after the}} enactment of General Election Law. The enactment of this law is significant since it contained a provision regarding thirty percent quota for women, a provision which never appeared in the previous legislation. This provision is intended to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the legislature. This {{is based on the}} fact that in Indonesia the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> is higher than that of men. The lack <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in parliament is perhaps one of the causes why issues about women rarely became a priority in government policy making. The significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in parliament could be a way to articulate women 2 ̆ 7 s interests in government policy making. This paper will specifically examine the implementation of ‘thirty percent quotas for women 2 ̆ 7 to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the Indonesian parliament. It argues that even though there is an effort to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in parliament through electoral quotas, such an effort is not sufficient to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in parliament. Electoral quotas may gain better result if it combines with the change of political culture and the change of government policy. In doing so, other actors such as political parties and the government should be involved. Political parties and the government should be more gender sensitive (women friendly) in policy making...|$|R
40|$|Original title: Monitor Talent naar de Top 2011 Almost 200 {{businesses}} and non-profit organisations in the Netherlands have signed the Talent to the Top Charter since 2008. The {{purpose of the}} Charter {{is to increase the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in senior positions. Signing up to the Charter is voluntary, but carries obligations. Organisations which sign the Charter formulate targets for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> they would like to have in senior management positions within a given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> years and which measures they intend to take to achieve those targets. Charter signatories must report to the Talent to the Top Monitoring Committee each year on the progress they have made in increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in (senior) management positions and the measures they have taken in this regard. This Talent to the Top Monitor 2011, which is published jointly by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP and the Talent to the Top Monitoring Committee, shows that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in senior positions in all Charter organisations together barely increased in 2011. On the other hand, more than half the Charter signatories did record an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in senior positions. Some signatories have already achieved their targets, while others have seen stagnation or even a reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> at the top level.
