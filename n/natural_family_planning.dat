5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine barriers to the utilization of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> services for men in Kisarawe District. The study was a cross sectional study involving a sample of 299 men aged 20 and older years residing in Kisarawe district. Multistage sampling technique was used to randomly pick eligible men. The barriers of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> method revealed by the results were spouse discussion regarding <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> issues, discussion on <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> issues with others people, men approval of the partners to use <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> method, traditional permission to control fertility, belief that children provide social security, belief that male status is improved by having many children, visiting of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> centers, distance to the <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> centers and level of knowledge on <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> services. Multiple regressions indicated that spouse discussion regarding <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> (OR = 2. 112, 95 %CI = 1. 065 - 4. 188) and approval of the <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> use (OR = 2. 921, 95 %CI = 1. 271 - 6. 711) were most consequential barriers.

40|$|Recognizing {{the health}} impact of timing and spacing pregnancies, the Sustainable Development Goals call for {{increased}} access to <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> globally. While faith-based organizations in Africa provide {{a significant proportion}} of health services, <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> service delivery has been limited. This evaluation seeks to assess the effectiveness of implementing a systems approach in strengthening the capacity of Christian Health Associations to provide <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> and increase uptake in their communities. From January 2014 to September 2015, the capacity of three Christian Health Associations in East Africa—Caritas Rwanda, Uganda Catholic Medical Bureau, and Uganda Protestant Medical Bureau—was strengthened with the aims of improving access to women with unmet need and harmonizing faith-based service delivery contributions with their national <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> programs. The key components of this systems approach to <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> included training, supervision, commodity availability, <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> promotion, data collection, and creating a supportive environment. Community-based provision of <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> including fertility awareness methods, was introduced across intervention sites for the first time. Five hundred forty-seven facility- and community-based providers were trained in <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> and 393, 964 people were reached with <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> information. Uptake of <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> grew substantially in Year 1 (12, 691) and Year 2 (19, 485) across all Christian Health Associations as compared to the baseline year (3, 551). Cumulatively, 32, 176 clients took up a method during the intervention, and 43 percent of clients received this service at the community level. According to a provider competency checklist, facility- and community-based providers were able to adequately counsel clients on new fertility awareness methods. Integration of Christian Health Associations into the national <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> strategy improved through participation in routine technical working group meetings, and the Ministries of Health in Rwanda and Uganda recognized them as credible <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> partners. Findings suggest that by strengthening capacity using a systems approach, Christian Health Associations can meaningfully contribute to national and international <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> goals.

Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (e.g., hysterectomy), {{if they are not}} specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), <b>Natural</b> <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.|$|E
