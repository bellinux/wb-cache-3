Since disk arrays consist of many disk drives and, hence, many disk arms, rather than one large drive with one disk arm, potential throughput can be increased, thus improving performance.

The analysis of complex biological samples produces {{large volumes of}} raw data. Data storage and recovery management pose substantial challenges to biomedical or proteomic facilities regarding backup and archiving concepts as well as hardware requirements. In this article we describe differences between the terms backup and archive with regard to manual and automatic approaches. We also introduce different storage concepts and technologies from transportable media to professional solutions such as redundant array of independent disks (RAID) systems, <b>network</b> <b>attached</b> <b>storages</b> (NAS) and storage area network (SAN). Moreover, we present a software solution, which we developed {{for the purpose of}} long-term preservation of large mass spectrometry raw data files on an object storage device (OSD) archiving system.

40|$|Abstract â€” Data {{sharing and}} file {{distributions}} {{are the two}} primary functions of <b>network</b> <b>attached</b> <b>storages.</b> Fibre Channel based Storage Area Networks (FC-SAN) has become a more popular solution for the enterprise storage requirements and provides high speed data transfer with high availability, scalability and reliable storage solutions. As SAN keeps and shares entire organizations critical information, it {{is considered to be}} more vulnerable to the attackers who gain a single point of access. In most of the data sharing operations among network users, uses encrypted data transfer with proper key management. Securing the SAN data with public key algorithm like RSA is the least less discussed topic and generating keys is a difficult task in distributed environment like Storage Area networks. SAN, considered to be a heterogeneous network, needs distributed key management for the scalability {{which is one of the}} important advantages of using SAN. This research paper explores the deployment of RSA algorithm with component based key generation without a key server. This paper also uses compression algorithm ALDC to compress the data during transmission for faster data transfer. The SAN performance was analyzed after the implementation RSA and ALDC algorithm in a customized testing SAN scenario and throughput analysis done for the effectiveness of cryptographic key management...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of computer network technology is currently growing exponentially {{along with the}} increasing users who make use of digital content in support of mobility. For that purpose, a provider requires a storage server which provides space for storing the digital content. <b>Network</b> <b>Attach</b> <b>Storage</b> (NAS) is a technology that is commonly used as a storage system. It considers to be cheap and easy for implementation. This is mainly {{because it can be}} implemented in the condition of minimal resources. On the other hand, this technology is mainly running on the open source operating system, like FreeNAS and NAS 4 Free This paper will discuss the performance comparison between FreeNAS and NAS 4 Free network operating system to analyze the main activity of the storage servers, i. e. data transfer, file maintenance, and the network infrastructure. In this testing process, we used windows based file sharing common internet file system (CIFS). Parameter that are involved in the analysis are delay/latency, throughput, CPU usage, memory usage, file copy, file classification, duplicate files detection and file delete on 11 different file sizes. Based on the experiment, it is concluded thats FreeNAS operating system in general shows better performance compared to the NAS 4 Free. However the NAS 4 Free requires higher CPU usage compared to the NAS 4 Free...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”The ever-growing {{gap between}} the {{computation}} and I/O {{is one of the}} fundamental challenges for future computing systems. This computation-I/O gap is even larger for modern large scale high-performance systems due to their state-of-the-art yet decades long architecture: the compute and storage resources form two cliques that are interconnected with shared networking infrastructure. This paper presents a distributed storage mid-dleware, called HyCache+, right on the compute nodes, which allows I/O to effectively leverage the high bi-section bandwidth of the high-speed interconnect of massively parallel high-end computing systems. HyCache+ provides the POSIX interface to end users with the memory-class I/O throughput and latency, and transparently swap the cached data with the existing slow-speed but high-capacity <b>networked</b> <b>attached</b> <b>storage.</b> HyCache+ has the potential to achieve both high performance and low-cost large capacity, the best of both worlds. To further improve the caching performance {{from the perspective of the}} global storage system, we propose a 2 -phase mechanism to cache the hot data for parallel applications, called 2 -Layer Scheduling (2 LS), which minimizes the file size to be transferred between compute nodes and heuristically replaces files in the cache. We deploy HyCache+ on the IBM BlueGene/P supercomputer, and observe two orders of magnitude faster I/O throughput than the default GPFS parallel file system. Furthermore, the proposed heuristic caching approach shows 29 X speedup over the traditional LRU algorithm.

40|$|Big Data is a data {{analysis}} methodology enabled by {{recent advances in}} technologies and architecture. However, big data entails a huge commitment of hardware and processing resources, making adoption costs of big data technology prohibitive to small and medium sized businesses. Cloud computing offers the promise of big data implementation to small and medium sized businesses. Big Data processing is performed through a programming paradigm known as MapReduce. Typically, implementation of the MapReduce paradigm requires <b>networked</b> <b>attached</b> <b>storage</b> and parallel processing. The computing needs of MapReduce programming are often beyond what small and medium sized business are able to commit. Cloud computing is on-demand network access to computing resources, provided by an outside entity. Common deployment models for cloud computing include {{platform as a service}} (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and hardware as a service (HaaS). The three types of cloud computing are the public cloud, the private cloud, and the hybrid cloud. A public cloud is the pay- as-you-go services. A private cloud is internal data center of a business not available to the general public but based on cloud structure. The hybrid cloud is a combination of the public cloud and private cloud. Three major reasons for small to medium sized businesses to use cloud computing for big data technology implementation are hardware cost reduction, processing cost reduction, and ability to test the value of big data. The major concerns regarding cloud computing are security and loss of control...|$|R
