2500|$|Plains bison, elk, cougar and {{red wolf}} left the region after European settlement. [...] Present day fauna include white tail deer, turkey, squirrel, rabbit, Virginia opossum, gray fox, coyote, skunk, raccoon, gopher, long-tailed weasel, mink, rat, chipmunk, frog, and <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo.</b> [...] Some migratory birds {{following}} the Mississippi Flyway spend {{part of the}} year in the vicinity.|$|E
2500|$|Systematic {{recording}} of dietary intake {{while living in}} the forest entirely off wild foods suggests that about 80% of the energy in the diet comes from meat, 10% from palm starch and hearts, 10% from insect larva and honey, and 1% from fruits. Total energy intake is approximately 2700 kcal per person daily, and males acquire about 84% of all calories consumed. Children do not produce significant amounts of food until they are fully adult. Despite the presence of over 500 species of edible vertebrate prey, only nine species of mammals provide more than 1% of the prey biomass actually harvested by Aché hunters. [...] Most important (in descending order) are <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo,</b> paca, South American tapir, capuchin monkey, white-lipped peccary, South American coati, red brocket, and tegu lizards.|$|E

6000|$|... "He lives {{down in the}} hot Southwest where Piggy the Peccary lives. His coat {{of shell}} is {{yellowish}} in color and is divided {{in the middle of}} his body into nine narrow bands or joints.

6000|$|So we rode back, {{along the}} Cocal and along that {{wonderful}} green glade, where I, staring at Noranteas in tree-tops, instead {{of at the}} ground beneath my horse's feet, {{had the pleasure of}} being swallowed up--my horse's hindquarters at least--in the very same slough which had engulfed M---'s mule three days before, and got a roll in much soft mud. Then up to ---'s camp, where we expected breakfast, not with greediness, though we had been nigh six hours in the saddle, but with curiosity. For he had promised to send out the hunters for all game that could be found, and give us a true forest meal; and we were curious to taste what lapo, quenco, guazupita-deer, and other strange meats might be like. Nay, some of us agreed, that if the hunters had but brought in a tender young red monkey, {282a} we would surely eat him too, if it were but to say that we had done it. [...] But the hunters had had no luck. They had brought in only a Pajui, {282b} an excellent game bird; an Ant-eater, {282c} and a great Cachicame, or <b>nine-banded</b> <b>Armadillo.</b> The ant-eater the foolish fellows had eaten themselves--I would have given them what they asked for his skeleton; but the Armadillo was cut up and hashed for us, and was eaten, to the last scrap, being about the best game I ever tasted. I fear he is a foul feeder at times, who by no means confines himself to roots, or even worms. If what I was told be true, there is but too much probability for Captain Mayne Reid's statement, that he will eat his way into the soft parts of a dead horse, and stay there until he has eaten his way out again. But, to do him justice, I never heard him accused, like the giant Armadillo {282d} of the Main, of digging dead bodies out of their graves, as he is doing in a very clever drawing in Mr. Wood's Homes without Hands. Be that as it may, the Armadillo, whatever he feeds on, has the power of transmuting it into most delicate and wholesome flesh.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the park consists of mixed oak and pecan woodlands. White-tailed deer, squirrels, rabbits, <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos,</b> and raccoons are numerous. There are occasional bobcat and wild turkey sightings. American alligators are {{also found in the}} park.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo</b> (Dasypus novemcinctus), {{also known}} as the long-nosed armadillo, is the best known and most widely {{distributed}} species. It has an average size of about 2-6 kg and is found throughout the southern United States, Central America, and South America. Within the United States, the <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo</b> currently inhabits Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Georgia. It is found in the Lesser Antilles, Tobago, Grenada and Trinidad. It can also be found in numerous islands of the Caribbean’s, where it is speculated to have arrived by trading ships. The <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo</b> is the only species that is increasing in range and number. [...] Within the species D. novemcinctus, there are six subspecies: novemcinctus, aequatorialis, fenestratus, hoplites, mexianae, and mexicanus.|$|E
50|$|The sooty mangabey {{can also}} {{contract}} leprosy, as can humans, the <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo,</b> the common chimpanzee, and the crab-eating macaque.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo</b> (Dasypus novemcinctus) is a {{distinctive}} animal {{that lives in}} this ecoregion. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is abundant.|$|E
50|$|If alarmed, <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos</b> can flee with {{surprising}} speed. Occasionally, a large predator {{may be able}} to ambush the armadillo before it can clear a distance, and breach the hard carapace with a well-placed bite or swipe. If the fleeing escape fails, the armadillo may quickly dig a shallow trench and lodge itself inside. Predators are rarely able to dislodge the animal once it has burrowed itself, and abandon their prey when they cannot breach the armadillo’s armor or grasp its tapered tail. Due to their softer carapaces, juvenile armadillos are more likely to fall victim to natural predation and their cautious behavior generally reflects this. Young <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos</b> tend to forage earlier in the day and are more wary of the approach of an unknown animal (including humans) than are adults. Their known natural predators include cougars (perhaps the leading predator), maned wolves, coyotes, black bears, red wolves, jaguars, alligators, bobcats, fruit bats, and large raptors. By far the leading predator of <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos</b> today is humans, as armadillos are locally harvested for their meat and shells and many thousands fall victim to auto accidents every year.|$|R
50|$|Fan-tailed warblers {{are known}} to engage in {{commensal}} feeding, wherein prey that has been roused or disturbed by the foraging or hunting of another animal is opportunistically captured. They have been observed following and foraging for prey near army ants, other passerines, and <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos.</b>|$|R
50|$|White-tailed {{deer are}} common {{throughout}} the park, as are raccoons, <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos,</b> and fox squirrels. Over 240 {{species of birds}} such as the pileated woodpecker, and Kentucky warbler have been recorded within the park's boundaries. Some of the birds often spotted include the prothonotary warbler, and red-shouldered hawk.|$|R

5000|$|The {{beautiful}} armadillo {{was large}} approximately 1.2 m long [...] It was {{about twice the}} size of the <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo.</b> The osteoderms of the shell and the limb bones of D. bellus are about two to {{two and a half times}} the extent of those of the living modern <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillo</b> D. novemcinctus. The small D. bellus overlapped in size with the D.novemcinctus. The body size of D. bellus decreased during the late Pleistocene, suggesting body size was variable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at the age}} of one year, and reproduce every year {{for the rest of their}} 12-to-15 year lifespans.

40|$|Four {{populations of}} <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos,</b> Dasypus novemcinctus, were {{investigated}} in the south-central United States {{in order to}} assess genetic variation in an isolated population (Electric Island, Lake Hamilton, Garland County, Arkansas); a semi-isolated population (Arkansas Post, Arkansas County, Arkansas), and two free ranging populations (southern Arkansas and central Texas). A 233 basepair sequence of the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA was sequenced in individuals from each population. Individuals and populations were compared to assess relatedness among populations and individuals. Higher sequence diversity was detected in the semi-isolated population, while lower sequence diversity was observed in the isolated and free ranging populations. Overall, all populations exhibited low genetic variation when compared to genetic variation for other mammals. The results support the hypothesis that rapid range expansion combined with the organism's unique reproductive strategies have promulgated low genetic variation in the North American populations of <b>nine-banded</b> <b>armadillos...</b>|$|R
