25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture.</b> A high <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E
25|$|With {{properly}} polished single-mode fibers, the emitted beam has {{an almost}} perfect Gaussian shape—even {{in the far}} field—if a good lens is used. The lens needs to {{be large enough to}} support the full <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> of the fiber, and must not introduce aberrations in the beam. Aspheric lenses are typically used.|$|E
30|$|We thus {{proved that}} the {{resolution}} 0.951 μm smaller than the pixel size of CCD (3.14 μm) was achieved by the proposed reconstruction techniques and coherent image processing in the computer, suggesting even higher resolutions by adopting greater <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures.</b>|$|R

We demonstrate {{how to make}} a properly selected polarization component to achieve a flat-top focus in high <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures</b> optical systems, hence achieving a potential goal of beam shaping. The results show that the values of the polarization angle 0 φ corresponding to different <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures</b> (NA) values for a flat-top focus and the polarization angle 0 φ increases on increasing NA for achieving a flat-top focal spot, but the flat-top focal pattern will become 0 φ-sensitive when NA is larger than 1. One will have to add a diffractive optical element to achieve a flat-top focal spot in NA larger than 1 system...|$|R

25|$|A {{return to}} {{extended}} generations of single exposure patterning {{would be possible}} with higher <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA) tools. An NA of 0.45 using 13.5nm wavelength could require retuning of a few percent. Increasing demagnification could avoid this retuning, but the reduced field size severely affects large patterns (one die per 26mm × 33mm field) such as the many-core multi-billion transistor 14nm Xeon chips. by requiring field stitching.|$|E
25|$|In simpler terms, {{there is}} a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber {{so that it will}} propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The sine of this maximum angle is the <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA {{requires}} less precision to splice and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. Single-mode fiber has a small NA.|$|E

Like the original DVD format, the data layer of an HD DVD is 0.6mm {{below the surface}} to physically protect the data layer from damage. The <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> of the optical pick-up head is 0.65, compared with 0.6 for DVD. All HD DVD players are backward compatible with DVD and CD.|$|E
50|$|The {{refractive}} {{index of the}} water (1.33) is closer to those of imaged materials or to {{the glass of the}} cover-slip, so more light will be collected/focused by this type of objective comparing to air-immersion ones, leading to a range of higher <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures</b> (NA).|$|R
30|$|Currently {{our system}} does not use an {{appropriate}} tube lens {{to be free of}} chromatic aberrations.

In the present paper, the effect of second- and fourth-order polarization aberrations on the image plane diffraction patterns are examined. The amplitude response matrix is calculated for optical systems with small <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures.</b> <b>Numerical</b> results are presented for optical systems with circular apertures for three of the aberration types...|$|R
25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are out of focus. This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power, typically oil immersion objectives with a high <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture.</b>|$|E

2500|$|An [...] (1064nm wavelength) is {{a common}} choice of laser for working with {{biological}} specimens. This is because such specimens (being mostly water) have a low absorption coefficient at this wavelength. A low absorption is advisable so as to minimise damage to the biological material, {{sometimes referred to as}} opticution. Perhaps the most important consideration in optical tweezer design is the choice of the objective. A stable trap requires that the gradient force, which is dependent upon the <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> (NA) of the objective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically have an NA between 1.2 and 1.4.|$|E

Like all matter, electrons have both wave and particle properties (as theorized by Louis-Victor de Broglie), and their wave-like properties mean that a beam of electrons can be made to behave like a beam of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of electrons is related to their kinetic energy via the de Broglie equation. An additional correction must be made to account for relativistic effects, as in a TEM an electron's velocity approaches the speed of light,c.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{decaying}} via stimulated emission, {{electrons in}} the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level. [...] Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of those will be emitted {{in a direction that}} falls within the <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber. [...] Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission. [...] The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified {{in the same manner as}} the signals, hence the term Amplified Spontaneous Emission. [...] ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance. [...] Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier's performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier.|$|E
