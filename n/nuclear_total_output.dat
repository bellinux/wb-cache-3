40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a concept of}} the parallel connection of {{a nuclear power plant}} fitted to provide heat for district heating application, with the CHP and heat plants existing in the supply region, in this case with the heating systems of Wejherowo and Gdynia. Presented variant proposes to add heat to a <b>nuclear</b> power plant’s <b>total</b> <b>output</b> by supplying heat exchangers with the steam from bleeders of low pressure (LP) turbine stage and from the crossover pipe between its high pressure (HP) and intermediate pressure (IP) stages. A detailed diagram of the EPR nuclear turbine system adapted to supply district heat is also presented. Also determined are the formulas for: electric power output of a nuclear CHP plant; electric power generated strictly in cogeneration, and the decrease in the electric power and energy resulting from the operation in cogeneration mode. Finally, the profitability (competitiveness) criteria for a nuclear power plant adapted to supply district heat in a selected heat supply region were proposed...|$|R
40|$|Market {{organization}} significantly affects <b>total</b> <b>output</b> {{and incentives}} for firms to invest. I compare {{three types of}} market organization. In a market with search and random matching, <b>total</b> <b>output</b> is excessive and there are incentives for inefficient underinvestment. In a market with a monopoly dealer, <b>total</b> <b>output</b> is insufficient and underinvestment also occurs. Competition between the search market and the dealer market improves incentives to invest, and competition between dealers yields efficient <b>total</b> <b>output</b> and investment. This suggests that additional entry of wholesalers and other interbusiness dealers should stimulate aggregate business investment. ...|$|R

After the stationary test of the time sequence, I conduct the regression analysis of the relationship between freight volume and the <b>total</b> <b>output</b> value of agriculture, and the relationship between passenger capacity and the <b>total</b> <b>output</b> value of agriculture. In addition, I conduct Granger causality test of the relationship between freight volume and passenger capacity, and the <b>total</b> <b>output</b> value of agriculture. The results show that the transportation of Zhejiang Province has promoted the development of agricultural economy prominently, and the development of agricultural economy plays indistinctive role in promoting the transportation volume in Zhejiang Province.
