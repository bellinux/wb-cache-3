25|$|In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. An other <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E

[...] While there, the family started construction of a new home called [...] "Eggleston", three miles (5km) east of town; the family's affectionate <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "Castle Dusty".

We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his work}} on the Rosetta stone, Young {{proceeded}} mathematically without identifying the language of the text. For example, comparing the number of times a word appeared in the Greek text with the Egyptian text, he was able to point out which glyphs spelled the word [...] "king", but he was unable to read the word. Using Åkerblad's decipherment of the demotic letters p and t, he realized that there were phonetic elements in the writing of the name Ptolemy. He correctly read the signs for p, t,m, i, and s, but rejected several other signs as [...] "inessential" [...] and misread others, {{due to the lack of}} a systematic approach. Young called the Demotic script [...] "enchorial", and resented Champollion's term [...] "demotic" [...] considering it bad form that he had invented a new <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> instead of using Young's. In order not to be superseded by the young Champollion, Young corresponded with Sacy, now no longer Champollion's mentor but his rival, who advised Young not to share his work with Champollion and described Champollion as a charlatan. Consequently, for several years Young kept key texts from Champollion and shared little of his data and notes.|$|E

I {{recorded}} a demo that was too long, so I just digitally sped it up to be the right length (which is the recording above). [...] was supposed to sound sort of... lame... like sort of… like a lame singer songwriter guy who’s into Dave Matthews but isn’t nearly as talented. That was, like, a thing in the early 2000s… a lot of people played this certain acoustic guitar style, but I don’t know the <b>name</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Maybe it has tinges of what was called [...] "Emo"? Or… what does Hoobastank sound like? Uhh, I don’t know. Who cares. I’m old now and I don’t remember anything. [...] In the end I didn’t want to sing the final version, so Pen did the singing in the show. He did more of a Blink 182 style thing. Blink 182? Is that right? ...|$|E

2500|$|Manetho was an Egyptian priest, {{living in}} the third century BC, who {{categorized}} the pharaohs of dynastic Egypt into 31 dynasties. Manetho’s schematic has its flaws; nevertheless, modern scholars conventionally follow his method of grouping. The Papyrus Prisse, a Middle Kingdom source, supports the fact that King Huni was indeed Sneferu’s predecessor. It states that [...] "the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Huni, came to the landing place (i.e., died), and the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sneferu, was raised up as a beneficent king in this entire land..." [...] Aside from Sneferu’s succession, we learn from this text that later generations considered {{him to be a}} [...] "beneficent" [...] ruler. This idea may stem from the etymology of the king’s <b>name,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> can be interpreted as the infinitive [...] "to make beautiful." [...] It is uncertain whether Huni was Sneferu’s father; however, the Cairo Annals Stone denotes that his mother may have been a woman named Meresankh.|$|E
