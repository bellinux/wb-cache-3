5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower <b>nominal</b> <b>power</b> output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, St. Laurent {{considered}} recommending {{the appointment}} of Howe as governor general. The governor general {{had always been a}} British peer; many nationalists wanted a Canadian to hold the post, and St. Laurent agreed with them. The governor general, The Viscount Alexander, was due to retire by 1953, by which time Howe would be 68. St. Laurent saw this as a way of allowing his friend and colleague to step away from politics for a quieter life. The minister was willing to take the post, but the position unexpectedly opened early when Alexander was appointed to the British Cabinet. Howe decided he still had work to do as a minister. He was also reluctant to exchange real power for the <b>nominal</b> <b>power</b> of the governor generalship. St. Laurent recommended {{the appointment of}} Canadian-born Vincent Massey, who was duly appointed by King George VI.|$|E

50|$|Gustaf VI Adolf's {{personal}} qualities made him popular among the Swedish people and, in turn, this popularity led to strong {{public opinion in}} favour of the retention of the monarchy. Gustaf VI Adolf's expertise and interest {{in a wide range}} of fields (architecture and botany being but two) made him respected, as did his informal and modest nature and his purposeful avoidance of pomp. While the monarchy had been de facto subordinate to the Riksdag and ministers since 1917, the king still nominally retained considerable reserve <b>powers.</b> Even these <b>nominal</b> <b>powers</b> were removed when Sweden's constitutional reform became complete in 1975, thus making Gustaf Adolf the last monarch to wield even <b>nominal</b> political <b>power.</b>|$|R

The spent rod is then placed in a cooling pond. The capacity of the refueling machine with the reactor at <b>nominal</b> <b>power</b> level is two fuel assemblies per day, with peak capacity of five per day.|$|E

25|$|While it officially {{remained}} part of {{the lands}} of the Prince-Bishopric of Basel, starting in the 13th century Biel began making alliances with neighboring nobles and cities. In 1279 it allied with Bern. This first alliance was followed in 1311 by an alliance with Fribourg, a 1334 alliance with Solothurn, 1342 with Murten and 1395 with La Neuveville. The alliance with Bern became an eternal alliance in 1352, as Bern itself joined the Old Swiss Confederacy. Contradictory obligations to the Bishop of Basel, Jean de Vienne, and to the Imperial City of Bern led to a war in 1367. During the war, Biel was burned and the Bishop's castle was destroyed. After the extinction of the Counts of Neuchâtel-Nidau in 1375 the Bishop's power around the lake began to wane. In 1388, Bern gained control of Nidau Castle {{and the town of}} Nidau. However, the Bishop retained <b>nominal</b> <b>power</b> and influence in Biel. The two competing powers struggled for power in Biel for over 400 years and prevented the town from becoming completely independent from either powerful neighbor.|$|E
25|$|After the Mongol {{conquest of}} Tibet in the 1240s, Tibet was {{incorporated}} into the Mongol Empire. After the enthronement of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty, Tibet was put under the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs or Xuanzheng Yuan, a government agency and top-level administrative department set up in Khanbaliq that supervised Buddhist monks in addition to managing the territory of Tibet. Besides modern-day Tibet Autonomous Region, it also governed a part of Sichuan, Qinghai and Kashmir. It was separate from the other provinces of the Yuan dynasty {{such as those of}} former Song dynasty of China, but still under the administrative rule of the Yuan. One of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen ('great administrator'), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing.
