50|$|The melting {{temperature}} of PLLA {{can be increased}} by 40-50 °C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60 °C to up to 190 °C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA (poly-D-lactide). PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 1:1 blend is used, but even at lower concentrations of 3-10% of PDLA, {{there is still a}} substantial improvement. In the latter case, PDLA acts as a <b>nucleating</b> <b>agent,</b> thereby increasing the crystallization rate. Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA.|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{very small}} {{quantities}} of organically modified layered silicate clay on the nucleation of polypropylene (PP), as an additive at ppm levels dosage was investigated, {{in combination with}} two of the most commercially exploited organic nucleating agents, one of which is a cyclic aromatic phosphinate salt and the other is bis(3, 4 -dimethylbenzylidene) sorbitol, each representing a separate class of nucleating molecules by itself. Substitution of a considerable fraction of either of these organic nucleating agents with organically modified inorganic nanoclay was seen to result in a unique synergy between the two in nucleating PP. Polarized light microscopy studies of these synergistic formulations with organoclay to <b>nucleating</b> <b>agent</b> ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 totaling 0. 2 weight percent in PP showed significant reduction in spherulite size from that of non-nucleated PP, and compared with the samples containing exclusive organic <b>nucleating</b> <b>agent</b> at similar loading. Differential scanning calorimetric studies provided evidence and insight into such synergistic behavior. Crystallization and supercooling temperatures for the synergistic formulations were comparable for those formulations containing only organic nucleating agents, indicating comparable nucleation efficiency, whereas organoclay alone, although showing some extent of nucleation, was clearly poorer in efficiency. Wide and small angle X-ray scattering studies further explained these observations. An increase in the gamma polytype fraction was seen in samples that contained both organoclay and <b>nucleating</b> <b>agent,</b> pointing to the role of organoclay as a gamma nucleator. Organoclay was found to be completely exfoliated in these synergistic formulations and was seen as well-dispersed, single platelets in the PP matrix.

30|$|In {{the last}} decade, using {{nanoparticles}} as <b>nucleating</b> <b>agents</b> is the widespread and leading method that researchers have adopted {{to control the}} supercooling degrees of water. The commonly used nanoparticles are metal and metal oxide, such as TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Cu, and CuO [3 – 6]. These nanoparticles are hydrophilic and can facilitate the formation of ice nuclei by decreasing the Gibbs free energy of nucleation. Other hydrophobic nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplatelets, have also been used as <b>nucleating</b> <b>agents</b> by some researchers [7 – 9]. The reduction of supercooling degree of water is attributed to the high specific surface areas of nanoparticles, which can provide more nucleation sites and increase the nucleation probability at high temperatures. According to the literature, different nanoparticles have different nucleation effects; moreover, nanoparticles with high specific areas can eliminate the supercooling of water, whereas those nanoparticles with hydrophilicity not. For example, adding {{a small amount of}} graphene nanoplatelets (0.02  wt.%) can eliminate the supercooling of water [8], whereas a reduction of only 70.9 % in supercooling degree can be achieved by using TiO 2 nanoparticles (1.0  wt.%) [4]. Thus, increasing the number of foreign nucleation sites can be a better method to control the supercooling of water, compared with improving the hydrophilicity of <b>nucleating</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R

The main goal {{of this study was}} to find out the factors influencing the β-crystal content in β-nucleated PP/polyamide 6 (PA 6) alloys and determine the best preparation conditions to obtain β-nucleated PP/PA 6 alloys rich in β-crystals. Results: The compounding methods had little influence on the crystallization temperature of both PP and PA 6. However, the melting characteristic and β-crystal content in β-nucleated PP/PA 6 alloys not only depended upon the compoundingmethods, but also on the temperature at which the <b>nucleating</b> <b>agent</b> was added.
