The rheological properties of industrial CMC were unmeasurable because of the vibrational and unsteady records when they were measured by the viscometer.

How they work is not completely understood. This study examines operation of a plain radial lip seal lubricated with grease and aims at developing a model that explains the lubrication and sealing behaviour of this type of seal. One existing hypothesis how the seals function is the Weissenberg effect hypothesis. The hypothesis state that the lubricant is exposed to extreme shear load, which will contribute to the pumping effect and the maintenance of the lubricated film. An investigation is therefore made to examine if the <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> characteristics of the grease prevents leakage. Comparison between <b>Newtonian</b> and <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> fluid calculated by using the finite element software program COMSOL Multiphysics has been performed. The results show that there are differences between <b>Newtonian</b> and <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> flow. The <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> characteristics contribute to a larger flow in the axial direction as compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid. This may contribute to a pumping effect and transportation of heat near the minimum film thickness.

Despite this fact all 1 D models use Newtonian viscosity rheological laws inside. We present a 1 D generalized time dependent <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> model of viscosity and we compare the numerical predictions to experimental data of blood rheology available into the literature. We explore two well documented shear stress protocols and {{we show that}} the proposed 1 D generalized <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> model computed over an arterial segment compares accurately, qualitative as well as quantitatively, the time dependence of the shear stress over the rheological blood data. We hope that 1 D generalized blood <b>non</b> <b>Newtonian</b> flow model inside of large numerical 1 D models will be useful to help even more {{the understanding of the}} global blood dynamics in micro and macro-circulatory networks. 1 Introduction One dimensional flow models is an useful option for computing blood circulation in complex networks either for micro or macrocirculation. One of the main reasons is their capability to furnish good predictions in terms of blood pressure and blood flow rate being costless in terms of time computing compared to the complexity and time consuming of 3 D approaches. We note that both the 1 D and the 3 D approaches are both derived from the same mass and momentum conservation principles. Although we know that alterations in blood viscosity impact the whole blood circulation, in the literature until now all proposed 1 D hemodynamic models for studying blood flow circulation are New-tonian: the viscosity is then considered constant.

Here, we present a model for squeeze flow of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids</b> on porous substrates where the flow in the gap is coupled to the fluid flow in the porous media. The competition of spreading and imbibition of liquid on a partially saturated porous substrate determines the force versus gap profile in both the squeeze (compression) and pull-off (tension) modes. The finite difference method was used to discretize the lubrication equation in the gap while boundary element method was employed to solve for flow in the porous substrate. The model predicts a lower magnitude of force for porous substrates in both compression and tension modes compared to that for impermeable substrates. Experiments on porous alumina substrates with <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids</b> show close agreement with the model predictions in both compression and tension modes when the gap is corrected for the obliqueness of the confining surfaces.

The electromagnetic flowmeter showed a slight deviation during transition, typically 1. The ultrasonic flowmeter showed very significant deviations during transition, typically 15.

40|$|Aerospace {{propulsion}} {{often involves}} the spray and combustion of liquids. When a liquid is sprayed, large drops form first, {{in a process}} known as primary atomization. Then, each drop breaks up into smaller droplets, in {{a process known as}} secondary atomization. This determines final drop sizes, which affect the liquid’s evaporation and mixing rates and ultimately influence combustor efficiency. Little has been published concerning the secondary atomization of visco-elastic non-Newtonian liquids, such as gels.
