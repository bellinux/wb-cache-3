It is a national responsibility to pay for the management of these.

25|$|Azad {{remained}} a close confidante, supporter and advisor to prime minister Nehru, and {{played an important}} role in framing national policies. Azad masterminded the creation of <b>national</b> <b>programmes</b> of school and college construction and spreading the enrolment of children and young adults into schools, to promote universal primary education. Elected to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, the Lok Sabha in 1952 and again in 1957, Azad supported Nehru's socialist economic and industrial policies, as well as the advancing social rights and economic opportunities for women and underprivileged Indians. In 1956, he served as president of the UNESCO General Conference held in Delhi. Azad spent the final years of his life focusing on writing his book India Wins Freedom, an exhaustive account of India's freedom struggle and its leaders, which was published in 1959.|$|E
25|$|All the idents were {{replaced}} on 8 November 1999 when Granada Television took the generic hearts idents. Granada Television kept the pointed G logo, made slightly thinner {{and placed in}} a box {{at the top of the}} screen. The dual branding of Granada Television and ITV lasted until 28 October 2002, when regional identities were dropped in favour of the new ITV1 channel brand. The celebrities ident package featured plain ITV1 idents for all <b>national</b> <b>programmes,</b> and Granada Television placed under the ITV1 logo for regional programmes. This practice continued until 16 January 2006, when no name was used, and Granada Productions was replaced with ITV Productions on programme end boards. The Granada Television logo continued on end boards until this date. The Granada name was used on announcements before local programming over a generic ITV1 ident until all non-news regional programming was scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|Though many {{scientists}} state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping ageing are achievable, {{there are still}} no international or <b>national</b> <b>programmes</b> focused on stopping ageing or on radical life extension.

2500|$|Despite these advances, {{there are}} certain skills to which humans will be better suited than {{machines}} {{for some time to}} come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the [...] "man-robot merger". Some European countries are including robotics in their <b>national</b> <b>programmes</b> and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity.

2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz per programme. The {{frequency reuse}} factor {{in most countries}} is approximately 15, meaning that {{only one out of}} 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with co-channel interference, i.e. cross-talk. [...] Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. [...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of <b>national</b> <b>programmes,</b> the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E

Launched in 2002, it {{provides an opportunity for}} the IT service industry to develop business models in the UK healthcare sector in which, historically, has seen low investment in IT services. Nearly four years onâ€”and under pressure from government and senior hospital managers to deliver working systemsâ€”the relationship between public sector organisations and private sector firms is once again under increasing scrutiny. All the IT systems are late and over-budget with vendors either leaving the programme or re-negotiating their contracts with Connecting for Health, the government agency which runs the <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> for Information (<b>National</b> <b>Programme).</b> In this study, we investigate the role of IT vendors in fulfilling the aims and objectives of the <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> in the context of market, business, managerial, and technical factors. Despite highly publicised large-scale IT outsourcing contracts, many IT vendors are unable to fulfil the rigid terms and conditions of their contracts. Our findings suggest the reasons are complex, but shortcomings in vendor capabilities, contractual terms and conditions, financial pressures and poor governance arrangements have led to slow progress and even resistance to the <b>National</b> <b>Programme...</b>|$|R
