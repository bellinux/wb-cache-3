Perhaps most significantly, Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> on science and technology research.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanists such as Poggio Bracciolini {{sought out}} in Europe's monastic {{libraries}} the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of Antiquity, while the Fall of Constantinople (1453) generated {{a wave of}} émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It is in their <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.|$|E

5|$|Retrospective reviews {{remembered the}} game for its bright and {{impressive}} graphics. Kameo was included in Rare Replay, an August 2015 compilation of 30 Rare titles for the Xbox One, alongside documentary-style videos about the game's development and its planned sequel. The latter was canceled {{after a few months}} of production due to both poor sales of the original and Microsoft's <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> on games for its Kinect peripheral.|$|E

The commercial success of the ZX80 made a follow-up product inevitable. The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November 1980, reflecting its <b>new</b> <b>focus,</b> and became Sinclair Research in March 1981.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Australian {{government}} had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards. The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role, with the new government's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia's global security interests. In line with this <b>new</b> <b>focus,</b> the ADF's force structure changed {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An {{example of the}} ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E
5|$|Alfred died December 4, 1875, {{and left}} Edward with an {{inheritance}} {{of nearly a}} quarter of a million dollars. Alfred's death was a blow to Cope; his father was a constant confidant. The same year marked a suspension of much of Cope's field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous years. His chief publication of the time, The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West, was a collection of 303pages and 54illustration plates. The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and Kansas. Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year-round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays. Cope's studies of marine reptiles of Kansas closed in 1876, opening a <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> on terrestrial reptiles. The same year, Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 Pine Street in Philadelphia. He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils. Cope's expeditions took him across Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. His initial journey into the Clarendon beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas. Cope's papers on the region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions. In 1877, he purchased half the rights to the American Naturalist to publish the papers he produced at a rate so high, Marsh questioned their dating.|$|E

5|$|Arkwright had a {{reputation}} as a paternalistic employer who was concerned for the well-being of his employees and their families. A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200children. By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often. After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath. The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the Willersley Estate. Societies and clubs were created in Cromford. The religious affairs of the community were of less interest to Arkwright, and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church; his father had envisaged it as a private chapel for the Arkwright family at Willersley Castle. The family's attempts to make Cromford self-sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840. This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{withdrawal}} from Vietnam brought {{to an end}} the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's <b>new</b> <b>focus</b> was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR {{took the lead in}} developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR. In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north Irian Jaya with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, {{as well as a number}} of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders. Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military counter-terrorism response force, for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982. In addition to being able to respond to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR counter-terrorism unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms together with clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch. In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, {{the park}} hired {{cultural}} resource specialists and conducted an archeological inventory of existing structures, the Survey of Rural Mountain Settlement.

25|$|Another {{innovation}} from post-revolutionary Russia was a {{new type}} of public building: the workers' club and the Palace of Culture.
