His early threats of awful vengeance to be wreaked upon the mate and skipper had subsided with the rough but sensible advice of his messmates. The mate, for his part, gave no indication of harboring the assault that Billy had made upon him other than to assign the most dangerous or disagreeable duties of the ship to the mucker whenever {{it was possible to}} do so; but the result of this was to hasten Billy's <b>nautical</b> <b>education,</b> and keep him in excellent physical trim.|$|E

40|$|The ‘shunning of outsiders’ can be {{considered}} as a discreet case of social segregation, particularly when it occurs as a parallel outcome of an educational process taking place {{within the context of a}} vocational educational institution. Cultural affinity, as both a prerequisite and a final product of a target-oriented educational endeavour, presents the advantage of facilitating the circulation and sharing of information and of offering mutually shared codes for the decoding and understanding of the full meaning contained in the transmitted information in education. Nonetheless, as this research in the Merchant Marine Academy of Greece indicates, social segregation can be acknowledged as a consequence of an official admonition to ‘educational improvement’ in the field of maritime education. The findings of this research suggest that the reproduction of the Greek <b>nautical</b> ethos through <b>education</b> and practical training corresponds to the reproduction of social conformity within a cultural model of behavior...|$|R

It was built in 1852 for <b>nautical</b> and private <b>education</b> of boys and for descendants of town founder Tristram Coffin by Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin. The school closed in 1898 and Elizabeth Coffin reopened the school for students of both genders in 1903. It taught males woodworking, mechanical drawing, plumbing and metalworking; Females were taught basketry, cooking, and sewing. Until Coffin taught basketmaking, baskets were traditionally made by boys and retired sea-faring men on Nantucket. Her students included women from the Goldenrod Literary and Debating Society which was established in 1895 for girls. Coffin reopened the school during a period when the whaling industry, which had been the economic backbone of the island, had ended. The trades helped to create new opportunities for men and women. Coffin School has Elizabeth Coffin's paintings on display.|$|R
40|$|Feedback is a {{tool that}} can be used to give {{students}} the confirmation of their accomplishments, helping them to increase understanding of the results of a performance and to alert students if change is required for future performance. Other studies and reports regarding clinical practice in education has shown that students feel that feedback has good impact on learning and positive effects such as enhanced self-confidence. Onboard training forms a major part of the education at the four-year <b>nautical</b> science <b>education</b> in Kalmar, in four years, one year is spent on board ships. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to find out how students at the four-year nautical science program in Kalmar felt that they receive feedback after completing on board training and how they wish that such feedback would be given. Six students were interviewed, three from grade one and three from grade three. The interviews were directed to an open form with a low degree of standardization. The results showed that all respondents felt they would prefer feedback from the school, even though all of them felt they had received good feedback on board the ships. The students would like to be given feedback by mentoring from other students during training, group discussions after on board training or short individual meetings between representative from the school and the student after completing on board training. All of the respondents felt that feedback is important to be able to learn from on board training and to know how to prepare for the next on board training. The study also revealed that students at the four-year nautical science program would like to gain more confirmation of what they are supposed to perform and if good results are obtained after completing on board training. ...|$|R
