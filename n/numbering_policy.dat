5000|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the Interstate Highway System {{was developed in}} 1957 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The association's present <b>numbering</b> <b>policy</b> dates back to August 10, 1973. Within the continental United States, primary Interstates—also called main line Interstates or two-digit Interstates—are assigned numbers less than 100.In the {{numbering scheme}} for the primary routes, east-west highways are assigned even numbers and north-south highways are assigned odd numbers. Odd route numbers increase from west to east, and even-numbered routes increase from south to north (to avoid confusion with the U.S. Highways, which increase {{from east to west}} and north to south), though there are exceptions to both principles in several locations. This numbering system usually holds true even if the local direction of the route does not match the compass directions. For example, I-94 between Chicago and Milwaukee runs primarily north-south, but bears an east-west designation to match its overall orientation, with the [...] "east" [...] label matching the local southward routing, and so on. In some cases the deviation can be drastic; for example, I-64 runs almost exactly the wrong way in the Hampton Roads region, where sections that once were labeled [...] "east" [...] running almost due west have had these labels removed due to confusion in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. While in many cases, this is due to relatively short deviations, compared to the overall routing of the highway, it is not always the case. For example, I-26 is labeled east-west as its number suggests, but it carries a more generally north-south routing. Some states, such as Michigan on I-69 have chosen to violate the numbering conventions by signing the route to match its local orientation rather than the normal convention. Numbers divisible by five are intended to be major arteries among the primary routes, carrying traffic long distances. Major north-south arterial Interstates increase in number from I-5 between Canada and Mexico along the West Coast to I‑95 between Canada and Miami, Florida along the East Coast; the exception is I-45, which does not leave the state of Texas, running from Galveston to Dallas. Major west-east arterial Interstates increase in number from I-10 between Santa Monica, California, and Jacksonville, Florida, to I-90 between Seattle, Washington, and Boston, Massachusetts, with two exceptions. The exception is I-30, which is shorter unlike the other major east-west interstates, running from Fort Worth, Texas to Little Rock, Arkansas. There is no I-50 and I-60, as routes with those numbers would likely pass through states that currently have U.S. Highways with the same numbers, which is not normally allowed under highway administration guidelines.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{there may}} be many policy {{inconsistencies}} in a large access control policy set. Thus the following issues should be considered: (1) A large <b>number</b> of <b>policy</b> inconsistencies are possible, {{but many of them}} {{may be the result of}} a small <b>number</b> of <b>policies</b> that apply to aggregates. The key is to figure out the minimum <b>number</b> of <b>policies</b> that are responsible for the policy inconsistencies. (2) Once all the inconsistencies are known, we must determine the appropriate resolutions with little effort to resolve them, and estimate their impact on the policies. Like traditional policy conflict resolution, the theoretical resolution of policy inconsistencies is basically the same: remove some policies in the policy set. The primary difficulty is to determine which policies should be removed, and the resolution addresses the inconsistency most effectively.|$|R
