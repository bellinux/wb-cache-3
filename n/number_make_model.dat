50|$|To {{show that}} a vehicle is {{registered}} in Australia, a sticker must be displayed in the lower left corner of either the rear left window or windscreen in annual colors on a 6-year cycle: blue, red, purple, brown, green and orange. This sticker is issued to the registered {{owner of the vehicle}} upon payment of the next year's registration fee, and shows the expiry date of the registration. They are color-coded for easy recognition of the year of expiry. The sticker shows the plate number, Vehicle Identification <b>Number,</b> <b>make,</b> <b>model,</b> and color of the vehicle, along with other such information. This acts as an anti-theft device, because transplanting the plates from one car to another will be in contrast to the details on the sticker.|$|E

Here, the electromagnetic perturbation due to the wind turbines is addressed by a method hybridising parabolic wave equation and physical optics. The VOR receiver is considered such that the overall method gives an estimation of the VOR error.

If {{the number of}} formed cells had not been allowed to be changed in each period, three cells should have been formed. This could have totally led to forming nine cells in three periods and enforced forming cell cost as equal as 3 × 3 × 20, 000 = 180, 000. Therefore, the OFV would have been increased up to 452, 261 (i.e., (452, 261 − 392, 261) / 392, 261 = 15 %). To conclude, forming cells in changeable <b>numbers</b> <b>makes</b> the <b>model</b> enable to reduce the forming cell costs and the OFV.|$|R

Therefore, the Wehrmacht's inventory of passenger cars was unsatisfactory in a number of respects when the open re-armament began in 1935. On the one hand, the existing vehicles' cross-country mobility and durability were not up to military requirements. On the other, their maintenance and parts supply were highly complex due to the large <b>number</b> of different <b>makes,</b> <b>models,</b> and often even model generations.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a CDO {{valuation}} model {{without having to}} assume conditional independence. In the valuation of CDO tranches, {{it is critical to}} model multiple default correlations and to derive the appropriate loss function. Conditional independence is usually assumed to derive CDO loss function due to its simplicity. However, except for common shock, meaningful correlated shocks are ignored in this assumption. Although models assuming conditional dependence attempt to improve on this matter, the <b>number</b> of parameters <b>makes</b> <b>model</b> calibration very challenging. We propose to use a discrete model with common shock for the derivation of CDO loss function, assuming conditional dependence. By grouping firms with equal credit ratings, the number of model parameters can be reduced...|$|R
50|$|Specialization is {{used when}} a base object class (type) {{contains}} {{or can be}} subcategorized into a more specific subclass. When this can be done, the subclass derived from the base class inherits {{the properties of the}} more general base or parent class. This mechanism is used to share or reuse properties between the general data component and its specialization. For example, a vehicle type (or class) is identified as a data component with properties of vehicle identification <b>number</b> (VIN), <b>make,</b> and <b>model.</b> Truck type (or class) is a specialization of vehicle and thus inherits the vehicle's properties but also has its own characteristic properties, such as truck bed length. Specialization is time independent and is generally used only when the base class and subclass always exist.|$|R

40|$|Households {{will play}} an {{important}} role in saving electricity in the future. Behavioural aspects in using white goods and other electric appliances are important as are the reasons for buying new white goods and a number of other appliances for cooking and washing. In a Swedish study three important aspects of energy use in households, Washing/drying Laundry, Cooking and Eating, and Information and Entertainment were analysed. These areas include activities performed almost daily in households. In the study, the <b>number,</b> <b>make</b> and <b>model</b> of all electric appliances were recorded, as was the way they were used and by which family members. Some white goods for washing and cooking were very old, but were candidates for replacement only in young households. Electricity use, behaviour, buying and replacement and number of machines differed between young and old households, with number of persons in the household and between families living in apartments and those living in houses. Scenarios on the electricity savings potential of combining behaviour and replacement strategy for white goods were calculated for the three areas of electricity use, and discussed in relation to the need for policy instruments to bring about changes in behaviour or in replacement strategy for old appliances...|$|R
40|$|In {{large-scale}} model-based development, developers periodically need {{to combine}} collections of interrelated models. These models may capture different {{features of a}} system, describe alternative perspectives on a single feature, or express ways in which different features alter one another’s structure or behaviour. We refer {{to the process of}} combining a set of interrelated models as model fusion. A <b>number</b> of factors <b>make</b> <b>model</b> fusion complicated. Models may overlap, in that they refer to the same concepts, but these concepts may be presented differently in each model, and the models may contradict one another. Models may describe independent system components, but the components may interact, potentially causing undesirable side effects. Finally, models may cross-cut, modifying one another in ways that violate their syntactic or semantic properties. In this thesis, we study three instances of the fusion problem for behavioural models, motivated by real-world applications. The first problem is combining partial models of a single feature with the goal of creating a more complete description of that feature. The second problem is maintenance of variant specifications of individual features. The goa...|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries now assemble {{most of the}} final products they use, but they still need to import most inputs. To escape this dependence, {{developing countries}} are focusing on ways to make more intermediate inputs domestically. But very expensive dies, moulds and castings patterns are required to make most rubber, glass, plastic or metallic components used as intermediate inputs. On the other hand, the machinery and equipment used together with the dies, moulds and patterns can make a wide range to products but are often underutilized. So, often only the dies, moulds, or patterns are needed to begin the production of various components. But, to protect their financial interests, multinational corporations (MNCs) often will not allow a developing country to use these key pieces of equipment without a comprehensive transfer of technology agreement. Hence, often either the developing countries remain import dependent for the components or cannot compete internationally due to their small domestic markets and {{the high cost of}} the dies, moulds and patterns, and hence high per-unit production costs. So, the costs for DMPs must be lowered to economically enable LDCs to deepen import substitution for currently imported intermediate components. These costs might be lowered by: (1) better negotiation with MNCs; (2) joint South-South purchase of DMPs; (3) aid supported guarantees to encourage firms to lend DMPs to LDCs (4) decreasing the <b>number</b> of <b>makes,</b> <b>models,</b> and designs for products; and, (5) improving and subsidizing the facilities to make DMPs locally. However, to implement these programmes, third world governments would need to perceive their objectives clearly and firmly confront the resistance from internal and external vested interests which benefit from the LCDs' continuing import dependenc...|$|R

5000|$|The 1972 Camaro {{suffered}} {{two major}} setbacks. The UAW strike at a GM assembly plant in Norwood disrupted production for 174 days, and 1,100 incomplete Camaros {{had to be}} scrapped {{because they could not}} meet 1973 federal bumper safety standards. Some at GM seriously considered dropping the Camaro and Firebird altogether, particularly while the corporation was under pressure to adapt its vast <b>number</b> of <b>makes</b> and <b>models</b> to difficult new regulations for emissions, safety, and fuel economy. Others pointed out the fiercely loyal followings the cars enjoyed and were convinced the models remained viable. The latter group eventually convinced those in favor of dropping the F-cars to reconsider, and Chevrolet would go on to produce 68,656 Camaros in 1972. Only 970 SS 396s were produced in 1972, and this was the last year for the SS 396 and SS 350 models. This year the badges changed from [...] "Z/28" [...] to [...] "Z28". Horsepower ratings continued to drop, not only due to lower compression and tighter emissions controls but, beginning with the 1972 model year, a switch from gross (on dynamometer) to net ratings based on an engine in an actual vehicle with all accessories installed. With that, the 350 ci LT1 dropped from 330 gross horsepower in 1971 to 255 net horsepower for 1972 and the big-block 396/402 was now rated at 240 net horsepower compared to 300 gross horses in 1971.|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering and Bloch School of Management. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 This dissertation proposes a flexible and intelligent decision support tool for scheduling and resource allocation of construction projects. A hybrid Fuzzy-Bayesian scheduling network {{and a new}} optimization model and solution approach {{have been developed to}} assess the combinatory effect of different risk factors on scheduling and optimize the time-cost tradeoff. Developed decision support tool employs interval-valued fuzzy numbers and Bayesian networks to dynamically quantify uncertainty and predict project performance during its make span. Using interval-valued fuzzy <b>numbers</b> <b>makes</b> the <b>model</b> more flexible and intelligent comparing to conventional fuzzy risk assessment models through incorporating the decision makers` confidence degree. The linguistic assessments of experts regarding the likelihood and severity of increase or decrease in task duration and cost when influenced by different risk factors are used to generate a set of duration and cost prior-probability distributions. A learning dynamic Bayesian scheduling network is developed to probabilistically combine the prior-probability distributions with initial activity duration estimates and update them as new evidence in form of actual activity data feed into the network. This model also predicts project performance at any point of time during its execution. Optimization model explicitly considers variation of time-cost tradeoff relationship during project execution and complex payment terms to maximize the project net present value (NPV). A sequential solution approach is proposed to combine a procedure for updating time-cost tradeoff data, and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) methods to obtain optimal project crashing and scheduling solutions that is adaptive to the current project status and crew productivity. Capability of proposed model in quantifying uncertainty at initial phases of project where project performance data are scarce, learning from data and predicting project performance, considering financial aspects of scheduling through optimal resource allocation and providing useful and clear advice to managers are advantages of developed decision support tool over already existing approaches.
