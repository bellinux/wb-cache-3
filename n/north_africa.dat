5|$|By 681 {{the armies}} of the Umayyad Caliphate had {{expanded}} from their original homeland of Arabia to conquer <b>North</b> <b>Africa,</b> the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The Berbers of <b>North</b> <b>Africa,</b> called Moors by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim <b>North</b> <b>Africa</b> and Christian Hispania and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into {{civil war in the}} 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.|$|E
5|$|Following the Hijra in AD 622 (also {{sometimes}} spelled Hegira), the Arabian horse {{spread across}} the known world of the time, and became recognized as a distinct, named breed.

By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and <b>North</b> <b>Africa,</b> by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula by 720.

5|$|Kesselring {{strove to}} organise and protect supply convoys {{in order to}} get the German-Italian Panzer Army the {{resources}} it needed. He succeeded in establishing local air superiority and neutralising Malta, which provided a base from which British aircraft and submarines could interdict Axis convoys headed for <b>North</b> <b>Africa.</b> Without the vital supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in <b>North</b> <b>Africa</b> could not conduct operations. Through various expedients, Kesselring managed to deliver an increased flow of supplies to Generaloberst Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in Libya. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around Gazala, while Kesselring planned Operation Herkules, an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the 185 Airborne Division Folgore and Ramcke Parachute Brigade. Kesselring hoped to thereby secure the Axis line of communication with <b>North</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E
