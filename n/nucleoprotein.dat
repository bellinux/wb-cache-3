5|$|In December 2008, {{research}} by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin linked {{the presence of}} three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a <b>nucleoprotein</b> derived from 1918 flu samples {{to the ability of}} the flu virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.|$|E
5|$|Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the {{catalytic}} {{component of}} the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus, and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a <b>nucleoprotein</b> called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time. Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing <b>nucleoprotein</b> cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
50|$|Through crystallographic methods, the {{specific}} spatial structure and biological functions of many <b>nucleoproteins</b> are understood. The structures of many viral <b>nucleoproteins</b> have been determined, {{including those of}} influenza, rabies, Ebola, Bunyamwera, Schmallenberg, Hazara, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Lassa. Important techniques for detecting the structures of <b>nucleoproteins</b> include X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy.|$|R
50|$|The most {{widespread}} deoxyribonucleoproteins are nucleosomes, {{in which}} the component is nuclear DNA. The proteins combined with DNA are histones and protamines; the resulting <b>nucleoproteins</b> are located in chromosomes. Thus, the entire chromosome, i.e. chromatin in eukaryotes consists of such <b>nucleoproteins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cystamine {{has been}} shown tointeract with DNA and {{reversibly}} bind to it. Furthermore, cystamine is also able to bind to <b>nucleoproteins.</b> The nucleic acids that form from binding to DNA are more stable then unbound nucleic acids. Binding of cystamine to <b>nucleoproteins</b> makes them precipitate. The disulphides than binds to DNA and precipitate <b>nucleoproteins</b> have an analogous interaction like cadaverine and spermidine with DNA. The affinity of cystamine to DNA {{plays a role in}} the toxicity and radioprotecting properties of cystamine.|$|R
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded <b>nucleoprotein</b> complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
25|$|CTL {{responses}} can {{be enhanced}} by co-inoculation with co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 or B7-2 for DNA vaccines against influenza <b>nucleoprotein,</b> or GM-CSF for DNA vaccines against the murine malaria model P. yoelii. Co-inoculation with plasmids encoding co-stimulatory molecules IL-12 and TCA3 were shown to increase CTL activity against HIV-1 and influenza <b>nucleoprotein</b> antigens.|$|E
25|$|The genome encodes 7–9 proteins, {{including}} the trimeric RNA polymerase enzyme (PA, PB1, PB2) and the structural proteins <b>nucleoprotein</b> (NP), which binds the viral genome; matrix protein (M1), which lines the envelope; and an envelope glycoprotein (GP), which {{acts as the}} virus receptor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nucleoproteins</b> can be {{extracted}} and {{isolated from the}} nuclei of animal and plant tissues by the same procedure, somewhat modified, that is effective in preparing the nucleoprotamines of sperm (1, 2). In this paper the preparation of nuclear <b>nucleoproteins</b> from animal and plant tissues and from bacterial cells is described and some results of an investigation of these substances are given. <b>Nucleoproteins</b> are also present in the cytoplasm of animal and plant tissues. It {{is an important step}} in the isolation of <b>nucleoproteins</b> to separate those occurring in the nucleus from those of the cytoplasm. This can be accomplished in two ways: by chemical procedures of fractionation and by methods in which well formed nuclei or chromosomes are isolated from the cytoplasm before extraction is begun. These two methods of preparation have in practice much in common. Although many bacteria may not have distinctly formed nuclei, they do have both the <b>nucleoproteins</b> found in the nuclei and those found in the cytoplasm of cells in which the distinction between nucleus and cytoplasm can be made morphologically. In this paper th...|$|R
40|$|Human autoantibodies, from {{commercial}} positive control sera to ANA or ENA test (ImmunoConcepts Sacramento, CA USA), such as anti-DNP, anti- nucleolar, anti-mithocondrial, anti-RNP, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, {{were used to}} immunostain Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes and meristematic cells of Allium cepa. <b>Nucleoproteins,</b> nucleolus and mitochondrials were specifically stained using indirect immunofluorescence procedures and analyzed by conventional and confocal microscopy. Western blot analysis demonstrated common epitopes in animal and plant <b>nucleoproteins</b> extracts. This study indicates that autoantigens are widely distribute in nature than previously thought, suggesting that also <b>nucleoproteins</b> from plant tissues could be considered possible immunogens associated with systemic connective tissue diseases or, on the other hand, {{could be used as}} alternative substrates for their detection. The authors debate on possible fields of research in the future...|$|R
50|$|<b>Nucleo{{proteins}}</b> are any {{proteins that}} are structurally associated with nucleic acids, either DNA or RNA. Typical nucleoproteines include ribosomes, nucleosomes, and viral nucleocapsid proteins.|$|R
25|$|The T-DNA must be {{cut out of}} the {{circular}} plasmid. A VirD1/D2 complex nicks the DNA at the left and right border sequences. The VirD2 protein is covalently attached to the 5' end. VirD2 contains a motif that leads to the <b>nucleoprotein</b> complex being targeted to the type IV secretion system (T4SS).|$|E
25|$|As in all orthomyxoviruses, {{the largest}} three {{segments}} (1–3) encode the three subunits of the RNA polymerase. In thogotoviruses, segment 4 encodes the glycoprotein and segment 5 the <b>nucleoprotein.</b> The messenger RNA (mRNA) from segment 6 can be spliced to encode the matrix protein or unspliced to encode ML, which has 38 additional amino acids at its C-terminus. No product {{has yet been}} identified for the seventh segment, observed in DHOV.|$|E
25|$|A puzzling {{feature of}} the {{documented}} loss of tolerance seen in spontaneous human autoimmunity {{is that it is}} almost entirely restricted to the autoantibody responses produced by B lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance by T cells has been extremely hard to demonstrate, and where there is evidence for an abnormal T cell response it is usually not to the antigen recognised by autoantibodies. Thus, in rheumatoid arthritis there are autoantibodies to IgG Fc but apparently no corresponding T cell response. In systemic lupus there are autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot evoke a T cell response, and limited evidence for T cell responses implicates <b>nucleoprotein</b> antigens. In Celiac disease there are autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase but the T cell response is to the foreign protein gliadin. This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases (with probable exceptions including type I diabetes) based on a loss of B cell tolerance which makes use of normal T cell responses to foreign antigens in a variety of aberrant ways.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{addition}} to monoclonal immunoglobulin. {{two kinds of}} <b>nucleoproteins.</b> NP 1 and NP 2, were isolated from the supernatants of hybridoma cultures {{set up in a}} protein-free medium. As shown by SDS-electrophoresis the two <b>nucleoproteins</b> shared a set or proteins (apparent Mr 11000 to 15000). and differed in the DNA moiety (∼ 150 bp in NP 1. ∼ 350 bp in NP 2). The amino acid composition of the protein moiety confirmed the nucleosomal origin of NP 1 and NP 2. The findings support the view that in hybridoma cultures the cells undergo death by apoptosis, i. e. a programmed process characterized by initial fragmentation of chromatin...|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} way, the genomes of negative-strand RNA viruses never exist as free RNA molecule. The ribonucleoproteins protect their genomes from RNase. <b>Nucleoproteins</b> {{are often the}} major antigens for viruses because they have strain-specific and group-specific {{antigenic}} determinants.|$|R
25|$|The mononegavirus {{life cycle}} begins with virion {{attachment}} to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant {{release of the}} virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. Mononegavirus RdRps bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the <b>nucleoprotein,</b> whose concentration in the cell determines when the RdRp switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near {{the inside of the}} cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Their {{life cycle}} {{is thought to}} begin with a virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral envelope glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the <b>nucleoprotein,</b> whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E
500|$|The RPA protein, {{which has}} high {{affinity}} for single-stranded DNA, then binds the 3' overhangs. [...] With {{the help of}} several other proteins that mediate the process, the Rad51 protein (and Dmc1, in meiosis) then forms a filament of nucleic acid and protein on the single strand of DNA coated with RPA. [...] This <b>nucleoprotein</b> filament then begins searching for DNA sequences {{similar to that of}} the 3' overhang. [...] After finding such a sequence, the single-stranded <b>nucleoprotein</b> filament moves into (invades) the similar or identical recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] In cells that divide through mitosis, the recipient DNA duplex is generally a sister chromatid, which is identical to the damaged DNA molecule and provides a template for repair. [...] In meiosis, however, the recipient DNA tends to be from a similar but not necessarily identical homologous chromosome. [...] A displacement loop (D-loop) is formed during strand invasion between the invading 3' overhang strand and the homologous chromosome. After strand invasion, a DNA polymerase extends the end of the invading 3' strand by synthesizing new DNA. [...] This changes the D-loop to a cross-shaped structure known as a Holliday junction. Following this, more DNA synthesis occurs on the invading strand (i.e., one of the original 3' overhangs), effectively restoring the strand on the homologous chromosome that was displaced during strand invasion.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out, {{by means of}} {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis, of the <b>nucleoproteins</b> of spermatozoa from infertile, oligospermic patients affected by partial idiopathic spermatidic arrest. Results in a normal group of men, in agreement with previous reports, showed the presence of protamines in mature spermatozoa. Data relative to <b>nucleoproteins</b> in "spermatozoa" from the infertile patients showed that, in these cells, no protamines were detectable, but histones exclusively. These findings suggest that in our patients a maturational defect of spermatogenesis exists both at the meiotic level (a DNA content double that of spermatozoa) and during spermatidic maturation (no substitution of histones by protamines). Therefore, the nuclear maturation of these terminal germ cells is that typical of that of primary spermatocytes...|$|R

25|$|Lipoprotein {{membranes}} enclose the nucleocapsids; <b>nucleoproteins</b> {{of different}} size classes with a loop at each end; the arrangement within the virion is uncertain. The ribonuclear proteins are filamentous {{and fall in}} the range of 50 to 130nm long and 9 to 15nm in diameter. They have a helical symmetry.|$|R
500|$|Upon encountering a Chi site, the {{activity}} of the RecBCD enzyme changes drastically. DNA unwinding pauses for a few seconds and then resumes at roughly half the initial speed. [...] This is likely because the slower RecB helicase unwinds the DNA after Chi, rather than the faster RecD helicase, which unwinds the DNA before Chi. [...] Recognition of the Chi site also changes the RecBCD enzyme so that it cuts the DNA strand with Chi and begins loading multiple RecA proteins onto the single-stranded DNA with the newly generated 3' end. [...] The resulting RecA-coated <b>nucleoprotein</b> filament then searches out similar sequences of DNA on a homologous chromosome. The search process induces stretching of the DNA duplex, which enhances homology recognition (a mechanism termed conformational proofreading [...] ). [...] Upon finding such a sequence, the single-stranded <b>nucleoprotein</b> filament moves into the homologous recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] The invading 3' overhang causes one of the strands of the recipient DNA duplex to be displaced, to form a D-loop. [...] If the D-loop is cut, another swapping of strands forms a cross-shaped structure called a Holliday junction. [...] Resolution of the Holliday junction by some combination of RuvABC or RecG can produce two recombinant DNA molecules with reciprocal genetic types, if the two interacting DNA molecules differ genetically. [...] Alternatively, the invading 3’ end near Chi can prime DNA synthesis and form a replication fork. [...] This type of resolution produces only one type of recombinant (non-reciprocal).|$|E
500|$|Bacteria {{appear to}} use the RecF pathway of {{homologous}} recombination to repair single-strand gaps in DNA. When the RecBCD pathway is inactivated by mutations and additional mutations inactivate the SbcCD and ExoI nucleases, the RecF pathway can also repair DNA double-strand breaks. [...] In the RecF pathway the RecQ helicase unwinds the DNA and the RecJ nuclease degrades the strand with a 5' end, leaving the strand with the 3' end intact. RecA protein binds to this strand and is either aided by the RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins or stabilized by them. The RecA <b>nucleoprotein</b> filament then searches for a homologous DNA and exchanges places with the identical or nearly identical strand in the homologous DNA.|$|E
500|$|In eukaryotes, BRCA2 protein has an {{important}} role in homologous recombinational repair. In mice and humans, BRCA2 primarily mediates orderly assembly of RAD51 on single-stranded (ss) DNA, the form that is active for homologous pairing and strand invasion. BRCA2 also redirects RAD51 from double-stranded DNA and prevents dissociation from ssDNA. [...] In addition, the four paralogs of RAD51, consisting of RAD51B (RAD51L1), RAD51C (RAD51L2), RAD51D (RAD51L3), XRCC2 form a complex called the BCDX2 complex (see Figure: Recombinational repair of DNA). This complex participates in RAD51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites. [...] The BCDX2 complex appears to act by facilitating the assembly or stability of the RAD51 <b>nucleoprotein</b> filament. [...] RAD51 catalyses strand transfer between a broken sequence and its undamaged homologue to allow re-synthesis of the damaged region (see homologous recombination models).|$|E
40|$|Disulfide bonding in {{the major}} {{proteins}} of influenza virus A, WSN strain, was studied by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The electrophoretic behavior of the proteins correlated with their localization in the virions and their chemical composition. The internal proteins of the viral particles, i. e. matrix and <b>nucleoproteins,</b> were shown to contain {{a relatively small number}} of cysteine residues. Electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions yielded multiple forms of the proteins which could be discriminated by small but readily observable, reproducible differences in their migration rates in the gel. the multiplicity of the protein forms was caused by the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in matrix and <b>nucleoproteins</b> that arose during or after solubilization in sodium dodecyl sulfate. On the other hand, we failed to detect native inter- and intramolecular linkages in matrix and <b>nucleoproteins.</b> External glycoproteins of the virions (HA and NA) had, in contrast to the internal ones, a higher number of cysteine residues and native disulfide bonds. At least three disulfide linkages were revealed in HA and NA in our experiments. In uncleaved HA all of the linkages were intramolecular. In NA at least one disulfide bond linked two identical polypeptides into a dimer. It was established that the reduction of the different disulfide linkages in HA and NA required different concentrations of the reducing agent...|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{generation}} of a DSB, Ku proteins will {{move through the}} cytoplasm until they find {{the site of the}} break and bind to it. [...] Ku recruits XRCC4 and Cer-XLF and both of these proteins interact cooperatively with one another through specific residues to form a <b>nucleoprotein</b> pore complex that wraps around DNA. [...] Cer-XLF is a homodimer that is very similar to XRCC4 in the structure and size of its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. [...] Residues arginine 64, leucine 65, and leucine 115 in Cer-XLF interact with lysines 65 and 99 in XRCC4 within their N-terminal domains. [...] Together they form a filament bundle that wraps around DNA in an alternating pattern. [...] Hyper-phosphorylation of the C-terminal alpha helical domains of XRCC4 by DNA-PKcs facilitates this interaction. [...] XRCC4 dimer binds to a second dimer on an adjacent DNA strand to create a tetramer for DNA bridging early on in NHEJ. [...] Prior to ligation, Lig IV binds to the C-terminal stalk of XRCC4 {{at the site of the}} break and displaces the second XRCC4 dimer. [...] The BRCT2 domain of Lig IV hydrogen bonds with XRCC4 at this domain through multiple residues and introduces a kink in the two alpha helical tails.

We report an 18 Å resolution structure of the recombinant nucleoprotein-RNA complex determined by single-particle electron microscopy. In the 3 D density map, a ring of density is resolved on the inner surface and the density is proposed to be the RNA.
