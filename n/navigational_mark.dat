The name, {{given by}} the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1961, is {{descriptive}} of the smooth, ice-free surface of this island, which is a useful <b>navigational</b> <b>mark</b> for vessels approaching Bloor Passage from the north.|$|E
50|$|A Special Mark, {{as defined}} by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, is a sea mark used in {{maritime}} pilotage.

50|$|In 1791 Lt Henry Smith {{obtained}} {{permission from}} Trinity House {{to build a}} <b>navigational</b> <b>mark</b> on the rock. He built a 6.1 m high wrought iron daymark, 10 cm in diameter and supported by six stays and a metal effigy of a wolf was placed on top. By 1795 the daymark was washed away. In the late 1830s John Thurburn built a beacon, which was completed on 15 July 1840, and in November of that year was wrecked by storms when the pole and globe on its top were washed away and not replaced until 1842 but they were once more washed away in a storm on 9 October 1844. Trinity House engineer James Walker constructed a 4.3 m high cone-shaped beacon, which took five years to build. Made of iron plates and filled with concrete rubble this was completed in 1848, it can still be seen next to the lighthouse. In July 1861, engineer James Douglass surveyed the rock and Walker started to build the lighthouse the following March, based on Smeaton's third Eddystone Lighthouse. Walker died in October 1862 and James Douglass was appointed engineer-in-chief to the Trinity House, William Douglass, the younger brother of James became resident engineer. Completed on 19 July 1869, the light first shone in January 1870 and in 1879 {{it was reported that}} the light flashed red and white. In 1972 it became the first lighthouse in the world to be fitted with a helipad and the lighthouse became automated in July 1988.|$|E
40|$|Tailored {{selective}} amygdalohippocampal resections {{seem to be}} {{an interesting}} application for neuronavigation. The accuracy of freehand frameless neuronavigation was assessed in 28 patients for its ability to determine the hippocampal resection length, as compared to postoperative MRI. Brain collapse due to CSF displacement caused an expected error of navigation at the brain surface, but almost no error at the tentorial notch. Yet, the hippocampal resection length was overestimated by navigation to an extent of 3 +/- 2 mm. The discrepancy is explained by an anterior-posterior component of brain collapse in a tilted head, Horizontal positioning of the head or <b>navigational</b> <b>marking</b> prior to the occurrence of brain collapse may overcome the problem...|$|R

Plant later collaborated with Chinese merchants and the government to create Sichuan Steam Navigation Company, serving as Captain of SS Shutung and SS Shuhun, providing the first regular merchant steam service on the Upper Yangtze.

On 25 February 1918, USN Radio Officer Charles A. Rogers arrived in Wexford with 8 USN men. The Commanding Officer Lieutenant Commander Victor D. Herbster reported on station on 28 March 1918.
