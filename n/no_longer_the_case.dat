5|$|Historically Leigh {{was well}} {{connected}} to the local transport infrastructure, but with {{the closure of the}} railway in 1969 this is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Public transport is co-ordinated by the Transport for Greater Manchester. There are bus services operated by First Greater Manchester, Jim Stones, Maytree Travel, Diamond Bus North West, Stagecoach Manchester and Network Warrington from Leigh bus station to many local destinations including Wigan, Bolton, Warrington, Manchester and St Helens. There had been suggestions to reopen the railway via Tyldesley to Manchester, but a guided busway scheme was chosen for the route; this decision was not universally popular.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect {{peculiar}} to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. There is evidence {{at some point in}} the past that the people were bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
