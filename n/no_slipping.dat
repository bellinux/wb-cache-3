[...] What a fine active fellow his father was then! When people asked Adam whose little lad he was, he had a sense of distinction as he answered, [...] "I'm Thias Bede's lad." [...] He was quite sure everybody knew Thias Bede--didn't he make the wonderful pigeon-house at Broxton parsonage? Those were happy days, especially when Seth, who was three years the younger, began to go out working too, and Adam began to be a teacher as well as a learner. But then came the days of sadness, when Adam was someway on in his teens, and Thias began to loiter at the public-houses, and Lisbeth began to cry at home, and to pour forth her plaints in the hearing of her sons. Adam remembered well the night of shame and anguish when he first saw his father quite wild and foolish, shouting a song out fitfully among his drunken companions at the [...] "Waggon Overthrown." [...] He had run away once when he was only eighteen, making his escape in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle over his shoulder, and his [...] "mensuration book" [...] in his pocket, and saying to himself very decidedly that he could bear the vexations of home no longer--he would go and seek his fortune, setting up his stick at the crossways and bending his steps the way it fell. But by the time he got to Stoniton, the thought of his mother and Seth, left behind to endure everything without him, became too importunate, and his resolution failed him. He came back the next day, but the misery and terror his mother had gone through in those two days had haunted her ever since.|$|E

50|$|One {{turn of the}} cock {{controlling}} the couplings divided the train into segments of separate cars, each of which had a brake which acted automatically upon detachment from the train. This partially destroyed {{the momentum of the}} whole, and a collision could only take place by a succession of comparatively light blows from the engine and slowing sections of the train, instead of by a single blow with the momentum of the whole train. The brakes were operated upon the balancing wheels of the trucks, but they mayed also be fitted upon the supporting wheels. The action of the brakes could be well illustrated by rails between the rolls of a rolling mill, except that the action was reversed.

Note that there is <b>no</b> <b>slipping</b> going on in the final state; the term slip area refers to the slippage that occurred during the loading process.

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem that wheeled robot in the path {{tracking}} is prone to slip or roll over at a sharp curve, structure of the wheeled robot and its path tracking features are analyzed, and a new Fuzzy-Neural Network (FNN) based path tracking method of two-stage (route and speed) control is proposed. In the first stage, a FNN controller determines the robot’s turning radius by processing robot’s pose information. In the second stage, the secondary controller adjusts angular and linear velocities {{by taking advantage of}} the turning radius and condition of the path ahead. The experiments show that the controlled robot can track the planned path accurately and robustly when it runs at high speed; the process of path tracking is stable and <b>no</b> <b>slipping</b> and rolling occur...|$|E

Quad-A and Quad-B grafts failed when the whipstitched free end of the graft pulled from its tibial end and through the nearest cerclage suture, elongating the graft significantly. The Tripled group showed a similar mechanism of failure as the free, whipstitched ends at the femoral and tibial sides of the graft pulled through the cerclage sutures.|$|E

40|$|Gas {{centrifuges}} exhibit {{very complex}} flows. Within the centrifuge {{there is a}} rarefied region, a transition region, and a region with an extreme density gradient. The flow moves at hypersonic speeds and shock waves are present. However, the flow is subsonic in the axisymmetric plane. The analysis may be simplified by treating the flow as a perturbation of wheel flow. Wheel flow implies that the fluid is moving as a solid body. With the very large pressure gradient, {{the majority of the}} fluid is located very close to the rotor wall and moves at an azimuthal velocity proportional to its distance from the rotor wall; there is <b>no</b> <b>slipping</b> in the azimuthal plane. The fluid can be modeled as incompressible and subsonic in the axisymmetric plane. By treating the centrifuge as long, end effects can be appropriately modeled without performing a detailed boundary layer analysis. Onsager's pancake approximation is used to construct a simulation to model fluid flow in a gas centrifuge. The governing 6 th order partial differential equation is broken down into an equivalent coupled system of three equations and then solved numerically. In addition to a discussion on the baseline solution, known problems and future work possibilities are presented...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{intervertebral}} disc is a multicomposite structure, with an outer fibrous ring, the annulus fibrosus, retaining a gel-like core, the nucleus pulposus. The disc presents complex mechanical behaviour, {{and it is}} of high importance for spine biomechanics. Advances in multiscale modelling and disc repair raised a need for new quantitative data on the finest details of annulus fibrosus mechanics. In this work we explored inter-lamella and inter-bundle behaviour of the outer annulus using micromechanical testing and second harmonic generation microscopy. Twenty-one {{intervertebral disc}}s were dissected from cow tails; the nucleus and inner annulus were excised to leave a ring of outer annulus, which was tested in circumferential loading while imaging the tissue’s collagen fibres network with sub-micron resolution. Custom software was developed to determine local tissue strains through image analysis. Inter-bundle linear and shear strains were 5. 5 and 2. 8 times higher than intra-bundle strains. Bundles tended to remain parallel while rotating under loading, with large slipping between them. Inter-lamella linear strain was almost 3 times the intra-lamella one, but <b>no</b> <b>slipping</b> was observed at the junction between lamellae. This study confirms that outer annulus straining is mainly due to bundles slipping and rotating. Further development of disc multiscale modelling and repair techniques should take into account this modular behaviour of the lamella, rather than considering it as a homogeneous fibre-reinforced matrix.

30|$|Uniaxial {{tensile testing}} was {{accomplished}} {{with the aid}} of a computer controlled material testing system (Model 3342, Instron, Norwood, MA) incorporating a 50  N load cell. Manufacturer software (Bluehill® Lite, Instron, Norwood, MA) was used to control strain rate and record force/elongation data. Samples were aligned in the direction of loading and secured at each end using hand tightened serrated grips. <b>No</b> <b>slipping</b> of the tissue during any test was observed either visually or within the data. Rectangular samples were used based on preliminary data from a separate set of porcine colorectal tissue using identical tensile settings which showed consistent breakage near the midpoint of the tissue (data not shown). Therefore, to ensure consistency and ease in tissue preparation, rectangular, rather than traditional dogbone-shaped, specimens were employed. A gauge length of 2  cm was used for all samples. Prior to tensile testing, samples were pre-conditioned using ten cycles of 20 % strain to establish a uniform loading history for all samples. Immediately following pre-conditioning, each sample was loaded to failure at a quasi static strain rate of 1 %/sec (Hardcastle and Mann 1968). Raw data were collected at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. For each tissue sample, engineering stress versus strain curves were generated from load and elongation data. From these curves, ultimate tensile strength, tan modulus, and elongation at failure were calculated. Ultimate strength was calculated as the maximum stress attained by the sample prior to failure. Percent elongation at failure was calculated as the percent elongation attained at the point of maximal stress. The elastic modulus was calculated as the slope of a linear curve fit to the stress–strain region extending from the end of the toe-in region to the point of maximum stress.|$|E
