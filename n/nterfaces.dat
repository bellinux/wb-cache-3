Neutral trap density gradually increases with increasing repeated cycles, even after 700 ~ annealing in dry N 2, though these traps are removed completely by only one cycle. Positively charged and neutral traps are determined by avalanche hot-electron i jection, and interface traps at the SiO 2 -Si <b>nterface</b> are determined by quasistatic C-V measurements.

An analysis that relates the potential energy barrier for ion transport and image eff cts is presented where the finite size of permeable ions is recognized, instead of assuming that ions are point charges. The analysis considers the bilayer membrane as a laminated ielectric sheet structure where the central hydrocarbon-like core is interposed between two thinner layers that represent the polar head groups of the amphiphillic molecules that form the membrane. In the cases treated, the inner layer is approximately 30 - 70 A thick and has a dielectric onstant of 2, while the polar layers are 5 - 10 A thick and have dielectric constants in the range 10 - 30. Permeable ions are represented as charged, perfectly conducting spheres whose diameter {{is determined by the}} polarizability of the associated ion species. The energy barrier due to image forces is computed by solving a set of Poisson's equations for the electrical potential within the sheet membrane and the surrounding aqueous electrolyte solution. The solution is obtained by using the method of images to determine infinite, but convergent, sets of image charges that arise from the polarizing effect of a permeable ion near the membrane-solution <b>nterface.</b> The results of a parametric study of this mode] show that the potential energy barrier is strongly dependent on the radius of the ion.

These growth rates are much faster than the ordinary growth rate of silicon oxide in a dry oxygen atmosphere. From these data, the rate con-stants of growth of silicon oxide were estimated, assuming the relationship of the parabolic oxidation.

40|$|Difficulty is {{encountered}} in measuring {{the early stages}} of localized corrosion transients during pit growth, discon-tinuous stress corrosion cracking, and scratching. This is caused by the charging of the capacitance of the passive surface surrounding the actively corroding area.

The effect of surface capacitance on the flow of current has been presented by Newman (1). At high frequencies (or short times) the low effective interfacial impedance makes electrodes behave as equipotential surfaces with very high current densities at the edges. Oltra and Keddam (2) have discussed the measurement of impedance of ca-pacitative surfaces with active pitting, and the distribution of current o surfaces with localized corrosion taking place (3).

40|$|Abstract Background Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used in studying human brain functions and neurorehabilitation. In order to develop complex and well-controlled fMRI paradigms, interfaces that can precisely control and measure output force and kinematics of the movements in human subjects are needed. Optimized state-of-the-art fMRI methods, combined with {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) compatible robotic devices for rehabilitation, can assist therapists to quantify, monitor, and improve physical rehabilitation. To achieve this goal, robotic or mechatronic devices with actuators and sensors need to be introduced into an MR environment. The common standard mechanical parts {{can not be used}} in MR environment and MR compatibility has been a tough hurdle for device developers. Methods This paper presents the design, fabrication and preliminary testing of a novel, one degree of freedom, MR compatible, computer controlled, variable resistance hand device that may be used in brain MR imaging during hand grip rehabilitation. We named the device MR_CHIROD (M agnetic R esonance C ompatible Smart H and I <b>nterfaced</b> R ehabilitation D evice). A novel feature of the device is the use of Electro-Rheological Fluids (ERFs) to achieve tunable and controllable resistive force generation. ERFs are fluids that experience dramatic changes in rheological properties, such as viscosity or yield stress, in the presence of an electric field. The device consists of four major subsystems: a) an ERF based resistive element; b) a gearbox; c) two handles and d) two sensors, one optical encoder and one force sensor, to measure the patient induced motion and force. The smart hand device is designed to resist up to 50 % of the maximum level of gripping force of a human hand and be controlled in real time. Results Laboratory tests of the device indicate that it was able to meet its design objective to resist up to approximately 50 % of the maximum handgrip force. The detailed compatibility tests demonstrated that there is neither an effect from the MR environment on the ERF properties and performance of the sensors, nor significant degradation on MR images by the introduction of the MR_CHIROD in the MR scanner. Conclusion The MR compatible hand device was built to aid in the study of brain function during generation of controllable and tunable force during handgrip exercising. The device was shown to be MR compatible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system that utilizes ERF in MR environment. </p...|$|R
40|$|During the ANT V 14 (1986187) and ANT V 113 (1987188) cruises of R. V. Polarstern sedirnents {{from the}} eastern, {{southern}} and central Weddell Sea were sarnpled with a boxcorer andlor a multicorer. The 24 sampling locations are distributed {{over the whole}} depth range, from shelf to pelagic environments. Porewater concentrations of aluminium, fluoride, manganese, nitrate, nitrite, oxygen and silicate, the pH and the alkalinity were measured. Of the sediment the opal, calcium carbonate and organic carbon content were quantified. The 210 Pb-profile was measured for three sedirnent cores. This investigation deals with the estimation of the amounts of opal and organic carbon (Corg) that are transported into the sediment, the regional distribution of these flux rates and the early diagenetic processes that control the preservation of organic carbon and opal in the sediment. The flux and degradation rates of organic carbon were determined by modelling the rneasured oxygen and nitrate profiles. The highest flux and degradation rates {{were found in the}} eastern shelf sediments. Due to the high Corg-flux (> 500 mmol C m**- 2 a- 1) in this area the oxic environment is restricted to the upper 3 cm of the sediment. In contrast to this, the oxic Zone in the pelagic sedirnents of the Weddell Sea has probably an extension of a few meters. The Corg-flux here, computed from the flux of nitrate throug h the sedimentlwater-interface, is less than 50 mmol C m**- 2 a**- 1. The flux of organic carbon into the sediments of the continental slope area is usually intermediate between the values computed for the shelf and pelagic sediments. Exceptions are the continental slope region north of Halley Bay. In these sediments the measured oxygen and nitrate profiles indicate a relatively high organic carbon flux. This could be a result of the recurrent development of a coastal polynia in this area. The bioturbation rate determined in this region by a 210 Pb-profile is 0, 019 cm** 2 a**- 1. In the Weddell Sea the opal content at the sediment surface (0 - 1 cm depth) varies between 0, 1 and 7 %-wt. These opal concentrations are rnuch lower than the opal contents determined for the sediments of the ROSS Sea by Ledford-Hoffmann et al. (1986 doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (86) 90263 - 2). Therefore the importance of the Antarctic shelf regions for the global silica cycle as stated by Ledford-Hoffmann et al. (1986) has to be reconsidered. The regional distribution of the opal content and the computed opal flux rates are correlated with the organic carbon flux rates. The processes controlling the preservation of opal are discussed based On the measured aluminium and silicate concentrations in the Pore water and the opal content of the sediment. The depth distribution of the Si- and Al-concentration of the porewater indicates that the reconstitution of clay minerals takes place in the immediate vicinity of the sediment-water <b>nterface.</b> A characterization of these minerals e. g. the estimation of the Si/AI-ratio (Mackin and Aller, 1984 a doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (84) 90251 - 5, 1984 b doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (84) 90252 - 7) is not possible. With the program WATEQ 2 saturation indices are computed to estimate which minerals could reconstitute. In this context the applicability of programs like WATEQ 2 for computations of the species distribution and saturation indices in solutions with the ionic strength of sea water is investigated...|$|R
3000|$|The {{increasing}} older population [1] {{and current}} economic climate is resulting {{in health and}} social care provisions being stretched and this has provoked recent research into the development of assisted living systems that aim to provide efficient and effective assistance and support to older people in their own home. An Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solution provides a subject with assistance {{during the day and}} feedback assistance based on day and night time activities and events through an A mbient A ssisted L iving F lexible I <b>nterface</b> (AALFI). It provides interventions adapted based on the current time of day, activity, detected events and changes of context in the environment. Feedback derived from past interventions may be beneficial in solving current issues. A Multi-Agent system (MAS) controls AALFI and the interaction method for interventions and feedback is adapted based on the subject’s requirements profile. Current solutions known as Ambient Assisted Living Systems (AAL) have three identified shortcomings; (i) they normally concentrate on providing day based assistance and support and are not aware of activities and events that occur during the night, examples include a multimodal pervasive framework for ambient assisted living [2] where older people are supported through a multimodal interface and an intelligent home middleware system [3] that assists older people by acquiring, detecting and reasoning changes of context. These and other related projects outlined in Section [...] "Related Research Areas and Projects" [...] provide assistance during the day {{or in the case of}} NOCTURNAL [4] during the night. The research being carried out aims to provide a (cared for) person, the subject, with assistance during the day and adapt assistance based on the time of day, contextual changes and event that has occurred. In the future assistance may be adapted according to the older person’s behaviour or mood. AALFI is aware of activities and events that occur during the night and is able to provide feedback type assistance the following day. AALFI complements the night time intervention assistance offered by NOCTURNAL with day based interventions, several new night time interventions relating to older person behaviour and feedback assistance based on day and night time events and activities. AALFI and the NOCTURNAL projects were developed in parallel, by related developing teams, and are mutually complementary. (ii) The interaction method may be inappropriate for the capability of the user which leads to further confusion and frustration, e.g. the systems may carry out actions that a person may not understand due to illegible text size and inappropriate colours. The wrong assistance may be offered to the older person causing confusion. Related research has investigated GUI layout [5], element placement [6] and font size and style used to convey information can have an effect on a subject’s ability to interact with an interface; a study with 50 partially sighted and 100 sighted children found that larger fonts and clearer text are of benefit to partially sighted people [7]. To help alleviate any possible confusion AALFI can be adapted so that text, font or colour can be changed according to a subject’s requirements and if a person’s sight degrades over time, the interface can be further adapted through a care provider/person interface. Research into GUI content, placement, interface navigation and methods of conveying information have been used during the design of AALFI and planning for future work were further interface adaption may be implemented to include changing the layout of the interface and adapting other attributes. AALFI is currently installed on a 10 inch Windows Tablet PC and can function in a particular location or be moved to a different location by the older person. The approach which the NOCTURNAL project follows is to provide interactions through a static bed side interface. In the futures many Tablet PCs may be installed in key locations and the AALFI interface may be displayed on the interface where the older person is currently located. Auditory interactions may also implemented to allow an older person to interact with an interface through speech and sound [8]. The type of assistance that is offered to the older person is tailored to the limitations imposed by the subject’s daily routine, activities and actions are often ignored and suitable feedback strategies have not been properly evaluated. (iii) Current state of the art AAL may often only provide intervention type assistance that corresponds to day based activities and not be aware of activities and events that occur during the night; when a subject may exhibit bad behaviours, or carry out activities that they do not remember the following day. AALFI provides intervention type assistance during the day in addition to feedback assistance for recognised events that occur during the day and night so that potential issues with the older persons behaviour may be drawn to their attention.|$|R
