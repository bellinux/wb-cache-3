30|$|Coker gas oil (CGO), a {{main product}} {{derived from the}} coking process, {{can be used as}} the {{feedstock}} of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. However, when the FCC unit is blended with a certain amount (generally less than 20 wt%) of CGO, the activity and selectivity of catalyst decrease, the feedstock conversion drops, recycle oil and slurry oil withdrawal increase, the yield of coke increases, product distribution deteriorates, and CGO bending ratio becomes strictly limited [1, 2, 3]. Earlier works [4, 5] on this subject concluded that <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in CGO, especially basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> could heavily deactivate FCC catalysts. The poisonous basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> could reversibly adsorb onto the acid site of catalyst, resulting in a diminution of acid centers, or acted as coke precursors due to their size and aromatic nature [6]. Fu and schaffer [7] and Ho et al. [8] proposed that nitrogen content, proton affinity, and molecular size (or molecular weight) of basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> were the key factors affecting the performance of FCC. Nevertheless, Li et al. [9, 10] argued that the effect of structure and composition of basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> was much more obvious than that of nitrogen content. Consequently, the characterizing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in CGO and investigating the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> how to deactivate FCC catalysts have become research hotspots.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> sal {{ammoniac}} (ammonium chloride) was known {{since the time}} of the Ancient Egyptians. In the 1760s two scientists, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley, isolated nitrogen from air, but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element. It was not until several years later, in 1772, that Daniel Rutherford realized that the gas was indeed nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|Nitrogen-15 (15N) tracing is a {{technique}} to study the nitrogen cycle using the heavier, stable nitrogen isotope 15N. Despite the different weights, 15N {{is involved in the}} same chemical reactions as the more abundant 14N and is therefore used to trace and quantify conversions of one <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> to another. 15N tracing is applied in biogeochemistry, soil science, environmental science and environmental microbiology.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 W. E. Tolberg first {{synthesized}} a five valent <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> {{of nitrogen}} and fluorine when tetrafluoroammonium compounds, tetrafluoroammonium heaxafluoroantimonate NF4SbF6 and tetrafluoroammonium heaxafluoroarsenate NF4AsF6 were made. In 1971 C. T. Goetschel announced {{the preparation of}} NF4BF4 and also produced a white solid assumed to be tetrafluoroammonium fluoride (NFF−). This was made by treating nitrogen trifluoride and fluorine with 3MeV electron radiation at 77K. It decomposed above 143K back into those ingredients. Theoretical studies also show the ionic compound is very likely to decompose to nitrogen trifluoride and fluorine gas.|$|E
30|$|As {{crude oil}} supply {{all over the}} world is {{becoming}} heavier and inferior in quality and the demand for middle distillate is larger, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is still the key process in oil refinery and is now in rapid development [6]. The retardation effects of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and condensed aromatics in FCC process have to be figured out if shale oil is used to produce clean fuel. The retarding effects of basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> may be explained by two mechanisms [7, 8, 9]. First, the basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> reversibly absorb on the Brønsted or Lewis acid centers and then poison the acid centers, thus weaken other hydrocarbons cracking ability. Second, since their big size and aromatic nature, the basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> may be the precursors of coke. Li et al. [10] found that the retarding effects of non-basic compounds and condensed aromatics in catalytic cracking of coker gas oil are not as serious as those of basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{electrospray}} ionization (ESI) {{coupled with}} Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has been widely applied for characterizing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in crude oil and its distillates [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], oil bitumen sands [16], and shale oils [17, 18]. ESI FT-ICR MS {{can be used to}} identify the molecular structure of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> with high-molecular-weight and double-bond equivalent (DBE) values. However, amine species could not be distinguished from pyridine or pyrrole derivatives by ESI FT-ICR MS if they have the same DBE values. For instance, ESI FT-ICR MS cannot identify whether <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> with a DBE value of 4 are pyridine derivatives or aniline derivatives. Fortunately, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis can provide some chemical functional group information to understand the molecular structures of compounds more clearly. In this study, ESI FT-ICR MS combined with FT-IR was used to characterize the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in CGO, which can give a more accurate characterization of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in coker gas oil.|$|R
40|$|Rejection {{characteristics}} of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> were examined for reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, and low-pressure reverse osmosis membranes. The rejection of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> {{is explained by}} integrating experimental results with calculations using the extended Nernst-Planck model coupled with a steric hindrance model. The molecular weight and chemical structure of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> appear to be less important in determining rejection than electrostatic properties. The rejection is greatest when the Donnan potential exceeds 0. 05 V or when {{the ratio of the}} solute radius to the pore radius is greater than 0. 8. The transport of solute in the pore is dominated by diffusion, although convective transport is significant for organic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b> Electromigration contributes negligibly to the overall solute transport in the membrane. Urea, a small organic compound, has lower rejection than ionic compounds such as ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite, indicating the critical role of electrostatic interaction in rejection. This suggests that better treatment efficiency for organic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> can be obtained after ammonification of urea...|$|R
50|$|Although nitrites are the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> chiefly used in meat curing, nitrates {{are used}} in certain {{specialty}} curing processes where a long release of nitrite from parent nitrate stores is needed. The use of nitrates in food preservation is controversial. This {{is due to the}} potential for the formation of nitrosamines when nitrates are present in high concentrations and the product is cooked at high temperatures. The effect is seen for red or processed meat, but not for white meat or fish. Potently, the production of carcinogenic nitrosamines may be inhibited by the use of the antioxidants Vitamin C and the alpha-tocopherol form of Vitamin E during curing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> overload: Herbivores are {{equipped}} to deal with a normal level of potentially toxic nonprotein nitrogen compounds in their forage. If, for any reason, rapid increases in levels of these compounds occur, for instance in lush spring growth on fertilized lowland pasture, the natural metabolic processes can become overloaded, resulting in liver disturbance and toxic imbalance. For this reason, many avoid using synthetic nitrogen fertilizer on horse pasture. If clover (or any legume) is allowed to dominate the pasture, this may also allow excess nitrogen to accumulate in forage, under stressful conditions such as frost or drought. Many weeds eaten by horses are nitrate accumulators. Direct ingestion of nitrate fertilizer material can also trigger laminitis, by a similar mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{nutrient}} value {{may be because}} of Rhizosolenia mats, which also {{play an important role}} in contributing to marine snow in subtropical gyres. These are generally multi-species associations of Rhizosolenia species of diatoms. This larger phytoplankton may reach up to 10s of centimeters in size. These mats are particularly abundant in the NPSG. Their abundance in this ecosystem suggests a higher flux of nutrients in the NPSG than was predicted in classic theories.While N is transported deeper by this mechanism, the surface waters are potentially cut off from this source. Nitrogen must be available for life at the surface. In order to account for this lack of nitrogen to the surface, there are organisms that are capable of nitrogen fixation in the NPSG. Trichodesmium is one species capable of nitrogen fixation that is found in many surface plankton blooms. Nitrogen fixation is the process where inert N2 is taken from the atmosphere and converted into a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> that is available to organisms for use. In many oligotrophic marine ecosystems, nitrogen fixation is a common source of nitrogen.|$|E
30|$|Compared with {{untreated}} shale oil, {{more than}} 80  % of basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> were removed after HCl extraction. But furfural raffinate oil further extracted by HCl {{did not show}} much change in basic nitrogen contents and SARA compositions. Compared with untreated shale oil, after removing basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> the FCC performance of sample B improved considerably. Moreover, after removing both <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and condensed aromatics, the conversion and yields of liquid products of sample C further increased. But the acid site centers {{on the surface of}} catalysts after reacting with sample B and C were almost the same. So the retardant factors during shale oil FCC processing may be described as the poison of basic nitrogen on acid centers and the strong adsorption and dehydrogenation of non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and condensed aromatics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Products from {{pyrolysis}} of wood-based composites contain lots {{of valuable}} chemicals.

In this study, we characterized pyrolysis liquids and solid residues of waste wood-based composites such as particle board (PB) and medium density fiberboard (MDF). The study focuses mainly on the evolution of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b> Thermogravimetric analysis helped us to determine the optimum pyrolysis temperature. FTIR analysis was used to observe functions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in the solid residues. Components of pyrolysis liquids were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Changes of FTIR spectrum indicate that C-N groups are reduced during pyrolysis process. Results from GC-MS analysis show that pyrolysis liquids are influenced a lot by the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> transferred from urea formaldehyde. Such changes will guide the utilization of pyrolysis products from waste wood-based composites...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays most {{heavy oil}} {{reservoirs}} are developed by thermal recovery methods, such as steam huff- puff and steam flooding. At the late stage of heavy oil steam drive, because of steam overlap {{in the upper}} reservoir formation, steam channeling can easily occur in production well. The {{research has shown that}} development effect of steam- <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> drive is not as good as consideration after steam channeling. But by injecting water slug can decrease the effect of steam channeling. For increasing water phase saturation in high permeability channel, steam and nitrogen gas relative permeability will decrease. As result, it will enlarge the reservoir vertical producing degree, {{and at the same time}} take full advantage of the oil displacement effect of steam- <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> drive. Through the numerical simulation, the study found that, steam- water- <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> drive technology can achieve better recovery degree using high hot water temperature and shorter injection time. Evaluation of Steam- <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>Compound</b> Drive After Steam Channeling in Steam Flooding For heavy oil development, steam flooding has been widely used as an effective thermal recovery method.

Significant {{increases in the}} amount of deposit formed in accelerated storage tests are found upon addition of these compounds at levels as low as one ppm nitrogen. While the effect is correlated with basicity of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> within a given compound class, the correlation does not hold between classes (pyridines, quinolines, etc.). Steric hindrance at the nitrogen atom greatly inhibits deposit promotion. The characteristics, but not the elemental composition, of deposits vary with the identity of the added <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> and with deposition temperature...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are strong}} inhibitors of {{catalyst}} activity in downstream chemical processes. Two distinct types of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are present in}} light gas oils: basic and non-basic. Basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> are generally considered to have stronger inhibitory effects on hydrotreating; however, non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> are known to undergo inhibition reactions that can be generated during the hydrogenation process. This can cause the formation of basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> which are challenging to hydrotreat. Non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> have also been proven to hinder further hydrodesulfurization due to competitive adsorption on the catalyst active sites during hydrotreating. With more stringent environmental laws regarding allowable sulfur limits, {{it is important to}} find ways to decrease the amount of sulfur, nitrogen and aromatics contents even further, in hydrotreating products. In this thesis, the effect of the selective removal of non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> on hydrotreating was studied. An absorbent material consisting of three basic components, namely, a polymer support, poly (glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol methacrylate) (PGMA-co-EDGMA), a π-acceptor moiety (2, 4, 5, 7 -tetranitroflorenone, TENF) and a linker, three- (diaminopropane, DAP (3)), was synthesized to create a PGMA-DAP(3) -TENF polymer. The polymer was used to selectively target non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> from light gas oil through a mechanism known as charge transfer complex. The resulting light gas oil was referred to as the pretreated feed. To measure the effect of selective removal of non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> on hydrotreating, the pretreated feed was further hydrotreated and the extent of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodearomatization was measured. Hydrotreating experiments were executed in a trickle-bed reactor using a NiMo/γAl 2 O 3 commercial catalyst. These measurements were compared with results from the untreated feed. Any improvement before and after the hydrotreatment of the pretreated feed was associated with the removal of non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b> The first phase of this thesis involved the synthesis, adsorption and regeneration studies of the PGMA-DAP(3) -TENF polymer. Adsorption studies were carried out using a bulk mass quantity of the polymer. The effectiveness of the polymer on a bulk scale was measured and compared to a batch scale. Regeneration studies were carried out to determine if the polymer was reusable. Characterization techniques including BET and FTIR analysis were performed on each polymer, before and after adsorption and regeneration studies to determine any physical and/or chemical changes to the polymer. The second phase of this thesis focused on the hydrotreatment of the pretreated and untreated feeds to measure the effectiveness of the polymer. Statistical significance of selectively removing non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> was also examined after hydrotreatment studies. Results from this thesis show that there was an overall improvement in nitrogen, sulfur and aromatics removal after pretreatment. The PGMA-DAP(3) -TENF polymer selectively removed 24. 9 % of non-basic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in the untreated feed, which led to a 18. 7 %, 8. 3 % and 9. 4 % decrease in the total nitrogen, sulfur and aromatics content respectively, after hydrotreatment. Based on this result, pretreatment of light gas oil can serve as a useful industrial application in reducing impurities in petroleum product streams...|$|R

30|$|So {{it is very}} {{meaningful}} to characterize the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and the condensed aromatics in shale oil and figure out their influence on FCC process. The Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has largely been used to characterize petroleum {{at the molecular level}} [11]. Since electrospray ionization (ESI) has the advantage of easy to operate and high selectivity for polar species, it has been used in characterizing polar compounds in unconventional oil, petroleum distillates and crude oil fractions [12, 13, 14, 15]. Chen et al. [16] have characterized the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydro-treated and untreated shale oil by ESI FT-ICR MS and reported that the N 1 species in Fushun shale oil are probably pyridine, indole, carbazole, benzocarbazole and their derivatives. However, besides <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> there are a large amount of condensed aromatics in shale oil. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is often used to characterize condensed aromatics in oil samples since they cannot be ionized [17]. To some extent, there is still little detail information about the condensed aromatics and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in shale oil. And the kinds of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and condensed aromatics that are easily removed by acid–base neutralization and solvent extraction need to be further figured out.|$|R
