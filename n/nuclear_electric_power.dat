40|$|Abstract: A {{fault in}} a complex {{technical}} system usually leads to {{a large number of}} consequential faults. In a modern control room, most variables are measured and monitored by alarms. Therefore, a non-trivial fault usually leads to a large amount of triggered alarms, a so-called alarm cascade. Alarm cascades cause information overload and renders the alarm system useless during incidents. GoalArt has developed an algorithm that performs root-cause analysis on-line in real-time, as a fault situation develops. In this way, large alarm cascades can be reduced to a single initiating event. This is a revival for the alarm list, which becomes useful throughout complex fault situations. The algorithm has been proven in several industrial branches, such as conventional and <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> grids, and oil industry. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The baby tooth {{survey was}} a [...] "campaign that {{effectively}} employed {{a variety of}} media advocacy strategies" [...] to alarm the public and [...] "galvanized" [...] support against atmospheric nuclear testing, with {{putting an end to}} such testing being commonly viewed as a positive outcome for a myriad of other reasons. The survey could not show then at the time, nor in the decades that have elapsed, that the levels of global strontium-90 or fallout in general, were in any way life-threatening, primarily because [...] "50 times the strontium-90 from before nuclear testing" [...] is a minuscule number, and multiplication of minuscule numbers results in only a slightly larger minuscule number. Moreover, the Radiation and Public Health Project which currently retains the teeth has had their stance and publications heavily criticized: A 2003 article in The New York Times states that the group's work has been controversial and has little credibility with the scientific establishment. Similarly, in an April 2014 article in Popular Science, Sarah Fecht explains that the group's work, specifically the widely discussed case of cherry-picking data to suggest that fallout from the 2011 Fukushima accident caused infant deaths in America, is [...] "junk science", as despite their papers being peer-reviewed, all attempts to independently corroborate their results return findings that are not in agreement with what the organization suggests.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of the performance}} of a conceptual propulsion system in which liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are first vaporized and heated by thermal power from a spacecraft <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> supply prior to combustion in a rocket engine. Calculations of the specific impulse (I-sp) are presented for a series of O 2 /H 2 oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratios and reactant pre-heat temperatures (T-aug). It is found that the ratio of the augmentation power to the total engine jet power (P-aug/P-tot) determines the engine thrust for a given P-aug, T-aug, and I-sp. In addition, the performance of an unaugmented O 2 /H 2 and a heated-hydrogen rocket engine were also calculated for the same conditions. Results show that an augmented O 2 /H 2 engine has three to eight times the thrust of a heated H 2 engine for a given P-aug. It is concluded that {{it should be possible to}} design a high/low thrust propulsion system using a common propellant, with the option of using thermal power from the <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> supply to augment the low-thrust propulsion system during cruise periods when the reactor's full electric power is not needed...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the main circuit of electrical connections at a <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> plant that has two units with a capacity of 1, 200 MW each has been determined. Reliability, economical, maneuverable properties of the atomic power plant under study are largely determined by its main circuit, so {{the choice of the}} circuit for the design and its status in the process of operation occur to be critical objectives. Main electrical connection circuits in <b>nuclear</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> plants are {{selected on the basis of}} the schematic networks of the energy system and the land attached to the plant. The circuit of the connection of a nuclear power plant to the grid in the original normal operating modes at all stages of the construction of such a plant should provide the outcome of the full added capacity of a nuclear power plant and the preservation of its stability in the power system without the influence of the emergency system automatics when any outgoing transmission line is disabled. When selecting the main circuit the individual capacity of the installed units and their number are taken into account as well as the order of development of the plant and power supply system; the voltage on which the power of a plant is delivered; a shortcircuit current for switchgear high voltage and the need for their limitation by circuit means; the most power that can be lost when damage to any switch.
