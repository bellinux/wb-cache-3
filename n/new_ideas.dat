5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for <b>new</b> <b>ideas,</b> Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E

5|$|According to Kalupahana, Buddhaghosa was {{influenced}} by Mahayana-thought, which were subtly mixed with Theravada orthodoxy to introduce <b>new</b> <b>ideas.</b> Eventually {{this led to the}} flowering of metaphysical tendencies, in contrast to the original stress on anattā in early Buddhism.|$|E
50|$|Following BC Oppenheim's death, Henry Synck {{served as}} President of <b>New</b> <b>Idea.</b> In 1945 the family sold <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> to Avco, a {{conglomerate}} that was subsequently acquired by Textron. In a complicated series of transactions, Textron subsequently divested <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> to Allied Corporation, another conglomerate (White-New Idea) who subsequently divested it to AGCO Corporation. <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> {{has continued to}} produce {{a broad spectrum of}} farm-related machinery. Unfortunately, the Coldwater, Ohio plant was closed in 1999 as the manufacturer sought to reduce costs and consolidate manufacturing in fewer locations.|$|R
30|$|Here, Amabile et al. (1996) {{highlight}} {{both the}} ideation of the <b>new</b> creative <b>idea</b> {{and the ability}} to implement it successfully. This means using both the <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> and an organisational learning approach to execute collective successful implementation. The approach requires a variety of knowledge resources, from the <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> to learning how to apply and control resources for economic benefit on the <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> in a BMI, as highlighted by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) and Zott et al. (2011).|$|R
30|$|A totally <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> was {{required}} in fuzzy spaces with asymmetric structures, for example, in fuzzy quasi-metric spaces. This <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> concerning convergence and completeness was proposed by Gregori and Romaguera [5] and Gregori et al. [10].|$|R
5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; he maintains that <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society {{in an effort to}} improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin also edited a {{collection}} of his journalism, which was published as What Am I Doing Here (1989). At {{the time of his}} death in 1989, he was working on a number of <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> for future novels, including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled Lydia Livingstone.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in the Roman Empire {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} <b>new</b> <b>ideas.</b> The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the Pax Romana made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.|$|E
50|$|In 1899, Joseph Oppenheim, the {{inventor}} of the first mechanized manure spreader, established the <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> Spreader works in Maria Stein. He and his son-in-law, Henry Synck, also a resident of Maria Stein, subsequently moved <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> to Coldwater. <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> http://www.newidea.agcocorp.com, once owned by Avco, continues to prosper {{as a part of a}} larger conglomerate now known as AGCO. Maria Stein is also home to Pittsburgh Pirates relief pitcher, Cory Luebke.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: After {{modifying the}} usual {{combinatorial}} constructions of framed Vassiliev theory by introducing base-points on each {{component of a}} framed link, we describe {{a basis for the}} space of dual weight systems of second order. We show that the linking matrix can be recovered from the coefficient vector, and construct an action of the unimodular group on the coefficient vector. In the case where the framed link presents a smooth 4 -manifold (either closed or with homology sphere boundary), the orbit of the coefficient vector under the group action is an invariant of smooth structure, which, moreover suffices to distinguish all of the pairs of Gompf nuclei of [5], p. 320. It was once said of a purported solution to a long-open problem that it contained half of a <b>new</b> <b>idea,</b> but that the solution required a <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> The history of attempts to find simple, combinatorially defined invariants of smooth structures on 4 -manifolds makes it clear that a <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> has been needed. What has been unclear is whether a big <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> or a small <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> was needed...|$|R
5|$|He {{also studied}} {{philosophical}} {{texts of the}} Spanish Enlightenment {{under the tutelage of}} the priest Terrazas, and aspired to implement the <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> in his country. He wrote a thesis with strong criticism of the native slavery at the mines of Potosí, influenced by the Spanish jurist Juan de Solorzano Pereira, the foremost publisher of Indian Law, and Victoria Villalva, fiscal of the Audiencia of Charcas and defender of the indigenous cause.|$|E
5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth <b>new</b> <b>ideas.</b> Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly {{from its}} birthplace in Florence {{to the rest}} of Italy and soon {{to the rest of}} Europe. The {{invention}} of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these <b>new</b> <b>ideas.</b> As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.|$|E
60|$|The {{instinct}} of conventionality, {{horror of}} uncertainty, and vested interests, all militate against {{the acceptance of}} a <b>new</b> <b>idea.</b> And it is even harder {{to think of a}} <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> than to get it accepted; most people might spend a lifetime in reflection without ever making a genuinely original discovery.|$|R
30|$|Here, {{we use our}} <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> of {{recurrent}} functions {{in order to provide}} new sufficient convergence conditions, which can be weaker than before [4]. Using this approach, the error bounds and the example on the distances are improved (see Example 3.5 and Remarks  3.6). This <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> can be used on other iterative methods [1].|$|R

5|$|Neoclassicism or {{increasingly}} Nordic Classicism {{continued to}} thrive {{at the beginning}} of the century until about 1930 as can be seen in Kay Fisker's Hornbækhus apartment buildings (1923) and Hack Kampmann's police headquarters (1924). Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries, and from <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|The 184-inch {{cyclotron}} {{was completed}} with wartime {{dollars from the}} Manhattan Project. It incorporated <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> by Ed McMillan, and was completed as a synchrotron. It commenced operation on November 13, 1946. For {{the first time since}} 1935, Lawrence actively participated in the experiments, working unsuccessfully with Eugene Gardner in an attempt to create recently discovered pi mesons with the synchrotron. César Lattes then used the apparatus they had created to find negative pi mesons in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American Boom was {{a flourishing}} of literature, poetry and {{criticism}} in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> {{and came to}} international renown {{in a way that}} had not happened previously. Major figures of the boom include Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E

5|$|The arrow-head {{design of}} the castle's bastion {{reflected}} <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of semi-circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework, but an arrow-headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth {{was among the first}} fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to adopt this design.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} conceived by Doody, {{who was working}} with producer David Tyler on another BBC Radio 4 comedy series, Armando Iannucci's Charm Offensive. Doody attended a meeting where people were discussing <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> for radio shows, and Kirshen suggested the idea, and both he and Kirshen wrote the full proposal. Radio 4 liked the idea and a pilot was made. Tyler went on to produce and direct Bigipedia.|$|E

5|$|The white {{supremacist}} scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful {{summary of the}} subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. He quotes Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few <b>new</b> <b>ideas.</b> He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's later musical style {{introduced}} <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from Tristan und Isolde onwards, {{he explored}} {{the limits of}} the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan, which include the so-called Tristan chord.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
