40|$|Abstract. The biquaternion (complexified quaternion) algebra {{contains}} idem-potents (elements whose square remains unchanged) and <b>nilpotents</b> (elements whose square vanishes). It {{also contains}} divisors of zero (elements with van-ishing norm). The idempotents and <b>nilpotents</b> are subsets of the divisors of zero. These facts {{have been reported}} in the literature, but remain obscure through not being gathered together using modern notation and terminology. Explicit formulae for finding all the idempotents, <b>nilpotents</b> and divisors of zero appear not to be available in the literature, and we rectify this with the present paper. Using several different representations for biquaternions, we present simple formulae for the idempotents, <b>nilpotents</b> and divisors of zero, and we show that the complex components of a biquaternion divisor of zero must have a sum of squares that vanishes, and that this condition is equiva-lent to two conditions on the inner product of the real and imaginary parts of the biquaternion, and the equality of the norms of the real and imaginary parts. We give numerical examples of <b>nilpotents,</b> idempotents and other divi-sors of zero. Finally, we conclude with a statement about the composition of the set of biquaternion divisors of zero, and its subsets, the idempotents and the <b>nilpotents...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{the memory}} of Domingo Herrero, on the tenth aniversary of his passing We study the set of <b>nilpotents</b> t (tn = 0) of a type II 1 von Neumann algebra A which verify that tn− 1 + t∗ is invertible.

Herrero very nice Jordan <b>nilpotents,</b> forms a simply {{connected}} smooth submanifold of A in the norm topology. <b>Nilpotents</b> are related to systems of projectors, i. e. n-tuples (p 1, [...] ., pn) of mutually orthogonal projections of the algebra which sum 1, via the ma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study {{operator}} algebras {{generated by}} commuting families of <b>nilpotents.</b> In order {{for such an}} algebra A to be re°exive, {{it is necessary that}} each ideal generated by a rank two member of A be one{dimensional. When the underlying space is a ¯nite{dimensional Hilbert space and the <b>nilpotents</b> in question doubly commute {{in the sense that they}} commute with each other's adjoints, the condition is also su±cient. Doubly commuting families of <b>nilpotents</b> admit simultaneous Jordan Canonical Forms and re°exivity of A can also be characterized in terms of Jordan block sizes. In particular, our results generalize work of J. Deddens and P. Fillmore on singly{ generated operator algebras. 1. Introduction. Mos...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Henn, Lannes and Schwartz on {{unstable}} algebras over the Steenrod algebra modulo <b>nilpotents,</b> a characterization of unstable algebras that are $A$-finitely generated up to <b>nilpotents</b> is given in terms of the associated presheaf, by introducing the notion of a finite presheaf. In particular, this gives the natural characterization of the (co) analytic presheaves that are important in the theory of Henn, Lannes and Schwartz. However, finite presheaves remain imperfectly understood, as illustrated by examples. One important class of examples is shown to be provided by unstable algebras of finite transcendence degree (under a necessary weak finiteness condition). For unstable Hopf algebras, it is shown that the situation is much better: the associated presheaf is finite if and only if its growth function is polynomial. This leads to a description of unstable Hopf algebras modulo <b>nilpotents</b> in the spirit of Henn, Lannes and Schwartz. Comment: Minor revision; now 27 pages; (v 1 29 pages).

40|$|McCoy and Montgomery [3] {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a p-ring (p prime) as a ring R in which xp = x and px = 0 for all x in R. Thus, Boolean rings are simply 2 -rings (p = 2).
