30|$|To {{overcome}} {{such problems}} of data-driven approaches, model-driven methods generally {{are able to}} estimate landmark positions - even for total occlusions - by using global context. One prominent example of global models are active appearance models (AAMs) [23 – 25]. Besides many applications for human face modeling (e.g., [24, 26, 27]) and medical image analysis (e.g., [28, 29]), AAMs have also been successfully applied to landmark tracking in X-ray locomotion scenarios [17, 30]. One major problem in our scenario, however, is that {{the movement of the}} animals often is very complex. As a result, especially for the lower legs, landmark configurations during locomotion substantially differ from the mean landmark configuration, i.e., the motions are non-stationary [31, 32]. As discussed in [31] and [33], this situation drastically complicates the fitting of AAM-like models. Besides the non-stationary motion, another major problem is the non-discriminative texture information of the lower leg landmarks (cf. landmarks 12 to 15 and 19 to 22 in Figure 1 b), which additionally complicates the fitting process of AAMs. Thus, the aforementioned standard AAM-based approaches only work when <b>neglecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> non-stationary landmarks, as in [17, 30, 34].|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel outlook on the self­calibration task, by considering images {{taken by a}} camera in motion, allowing for zooming and focusing. Apart from the complex relationship between the lens control settings and the intrinsic camera parameters, a prior off­line calibration allows to <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> focus, and to fix the principal point and aspect ratio throughout distinct views. Thus, the calibration matrix is dependent only on the zoom position. Given a fully calibrated reference view, one has only one parameter to estimate for any other view of the same scene, in order to calibrate it {{and to be able}} to perform metric reconstructions. We provide a close­form solution, and validate the reliability of the algorithm with experiments on real images. An important advantage of our method is a reduced ­ to one ­ number of critical camera configurations, associated with it. Moreover, we propose a method for computing the epipolar geometry of two views, taken from different positions and with different (spatial) resolutions; the idea is to take an appropriate third view, that is "easy" to match with the other two...|$|R
40|$|The {{suppression}} of (neoclassical) tearing modes {{is of great}} importance {{for the success of}} future fusion reactors like ITER. Electron cyclotron waves can suppress islands, both by driving noninductive current in the island region and by heating the island, causing a perturbation to the Ohmic plasma current. This Letter reports on experiments on the TEXTOR tokamak, investigating the effect of heating, which is usually <b>neglected.</b> <b>The</b> unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> tools available on TEXTOR, notably the dynamic ergodic divertor to create islands with a fully known driving term, and the electron cyclotron emission imaging diagnostic to provide detailed 2 D electron temperature information, enables a detailed study of the suppression process and a comparison with theory...|$|R
40|$|Small {{molecule}} permeability through {{cellular membranes}} {{is critical to}} a better understanding of pharmacodynamics and the drug discovery endeavor. Such permeability may be estimated as a function of the free energy change of barrier crossing by invoking the barrier domain model, which posits that permeation is limited by passage through a single “barrier domain” and assumes diffusivity differences among compounds of similar structure are negligible. Inspired by the work of Rezai and co-workers (JACS 128 : 14073 – 14080, 2006), we estimate this free energy change as the difference in implicit solvation free energies in chloroform and water, but extend their model to include solute conformational affects. Using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> eleven structurally diverse FDA approved compounds and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> thirteen congeneric molecules, we show that the solvation free energies are dominated by the global minima, which allows solute conformational distributions to be effectively <b>neglected.</b> For <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> tested compounds, <b>the</b> best correlation with experiment is obtained when the implicit chloroform global minimum is used to evaluate the solvation free energy difference...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{relations for}} the nucleon isotopic vector form factors and the pion form factor which take into account contributions from both the 2 π and NN intermediate states become a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> coupled integral equations for the form factors if the four amplitudes (ππ|NN) (ππ|ππ) (NN|ππ) (NN|NN) are assumed known. If these four amplitudes are replaced by their Born approximation values and spin and certain kinematic factors are <b>neglected,</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>set</b> <b>of</b> coupled singular integral equations can be solved exactly. Comparison of these exact solutions with the form factors obtained from the usual approximation of retaining only the lowest mass state (i. e., the 2 π state) confirms the hope that high-mass states do not contribute much to dispersion integrals. It is also of interest that these solutions are obtained from dispersion relations without subtractions and satisfy the necessary conditions that they vanish at infinite momentum transfer and take on the value e at the origin for all values of the coupling parameters appearing in the equations...|$|R
40|$|In {{acoustics}} it {{is generally}} assumed that viscous- en thermal boundary layer effects play a minor role in the propagation of sound waves. Hence, these effects are <b>neglected</b> in <b>the</b> basic <b>set</b> <b>of</b> equations describing <b>the</b> sound field. However, for geometries that include small confinements of air or thin air layers, this assumption is not valid. Special models that include viscous and thermal effects are available (for example the Low Reduced Frequency model) {{but only for a}} limited number of geometries. To overcome these limitations and provide a solution {{that can be used for}} arbitrary geometries, an acoustic finite (2 D) element that includes viscous and thermal effects is developed. The model is based on the linearized Navier stokes equations (including shear), the equation of continuity, the equation of state for an ideal gas and the energy equation. The method of weighed residuals is used in combination with a mixed formulation of pressure, temperature and particle velocity degrees of freedom. The results of the developed element code are compared with the results of an existing (analytical) Low Reduced Frequency solution and a viscothermal element that was found in literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|Student {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> teaching (<b>SET)</b> {{is important}} to faculty because SET ratings help faculty improve performance and are often {{used as the basis}} for evaluations of teaching effectiveness in administrative decisions (e. g., tenure). Researchers have conducted over 2, 000 studies on <b>SET</b> during <b>the</b> past 70 years. However, despite the explosive growth in online education during the past decade, researchers have largely <b>neglected</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>SET</b> to evaluate teaching effectiveness in online courses. This exploratory study analyzed <b>the</b> actual <b>SET</b> data collected during a single semester at a large mid-western college that offers over 250 online/Web-based classes. The data included five dependent and eighteen independent measures of teaching effectiveness. The results indicate that average SET ratings in online classes are significantly lower than the average ratings in on-campus classes across all five dependent measures. This finding offers preliminary empirical support for anecdotal evidence cited by earlier authors in this field. Furthermore, regression analysis of the full model for each dependent variable indicated that the independent variables explained a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variance in <b>SET</b> ratings. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standardized beta coefficients revealed that the strength and significance of the independent variables varied across the five dependent measures. Findings also indicate that organization of the course materials had a strong impact on all five measures of overall teaching effectiveness. Other variables including clarity of the instructor’s writing, timeliness in providing feedback, and interest in whether students learned were also significant factors in models that measured instructor effectiveness (as opposed to models that measured quality of course content). The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this study for administrators, faculty, and researchers. ...|$|R
40|$|Right-brain-damaged {{patients}} with left unilateral spatial <b>neglect</b> typically <b>set</b> <b>the</b> mid-point <b>of</b> horizontal {{lines to the}} right of the objective center. By contrast, healthy participants exhibit a reversed bias (pseudoneglect). The same effect has been described also when bisecting orthographic strings. In particular, for this latter kind of stimulus, some recent studies have shown that visuo-perceptual characteristics, like stimulus length, may contribute to both the magnitude and the direction bias of the bisection performance (Arduino et al. in Neuropsychologia 48 : 2140 - 2146, 2010). Furthermore, word stress was shown to modulate reading performances in both healthy participants, and {{patients with}} left spatial neglect and neglect dyslexia (Cubelli and Beschin in Brain Lang 95 : 319 - 326, 2005; Rusconi et al. in Neuropsychology 18 : 135 - 140, 2004). In Experiment I, 22 right-brain-damaged patients (11 with left visuo-spatial neglect) and 11 matched neurologically unimpaired control participants were asked to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> subjective mid-point <b>of</b> word letter strings, and of lines of comparable length. Most patients exhibited an overall disproportionate rightward bias, sensitive to stimulus length, and similar for words and lines. Importantly, in individual patients, biases differed according to stimulus type (words vs. lines), indicating that at least partly different mechanisms may be involved. In Experiment II, the putative effects on the bisection bias of ortho-phonological information (i. e., word stress endings), arising from the non-neglected right hand side of the stimulus were investigated. The orthographic cue induced a rightward shift of the perceived mid-point in both patients and controls, with short words stressed on the antepenultimate final sequence inducing a smaller rightward deviation with respect to short words stressed on the penultimate final sequence. In conclusion, partly different mechanisms, including both visuo-spatial and lexical factors, may support line and word bisection performance of right-braindamaged patients with left spatial neglect, and healthy participants...|$|R
40|$|The author {{tries to}} {{interpret}} the questions raised during recent discussions on Yugoslav agricultural co-operatives {{in the light of}} E. Kardelj’s theory on agricultural co-operatives. In the first section of his article the author sums up the principal views of that theory and states that the agricultural co-operative is not the aspired ultimate model of socialist development in rural communities. Therefore {{from the point of view}} of Kardelj’s theory the disappearance of the characteristics of the co-operative as an association of co-operating members, and the strengthening of its characteristics as an enterprise cannot be critically assessed. What is called the Yugoslav 2 ̆ 7 co-operative question 2 ̆ 7 can be treated exclusively as a question of the possibility of the development of group economic operation by private farmers on the principles of workers’ self-management. However, this type of enterprise need not necessarily be organized on the co-operative model. The author then discusses the various aspects of agricultural co-operatives as a factor of co-operation between self-managed socialist enterprises and a number of peasant households. He states that the system of socialist enterprises, in which workers’ self-management is developed, must not be identified with co-operative farming. Co-operative principles and the principles of workers’ self-management — despite a number of similarities — are not identical. This raises the problem of finding the laws of the transformation of agricultural co-operatives into the system of self-managed socialist enterprises. Bearing in mind this nature of the Yugoslav co-operative problem, the author takes a critical view of the concept which calls for a simple reconstruction of the classical agricultural co-operative while at <b>the</b> same time <b>neglecting</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> up this type of collective enterprise on the principle of workers 2 ̆ 7 self- -management. This problem cannot be solved by the classical type of co-operative, which thus cannot be regarded as a special form of socialist evolution which could develop without conflicting with the self-managing system of economic operation. Starting from this basic view, the author discusses the elements of the concept of agricultural co-operative according to which in the system of self- -managed socialist economic operation co-operatives may take over the functions of a socializing mechanism. The co-operative can become a kind of group enterprise of associated private farmers capable of a regular production of goods. It cannot avoid the processes of agro-industrial integration which turns in into a factor of the subordination of private agricultural producers to the great agro- -industrial integrational unit. In developing its character as a self-managing enterprise, the co-operative may become a factor of the real integration of private smallholders with the system of socialist economic operation. In fact, the problem which theory should deal with more thoroughly is how to ensure that group enterprises of associated private farmers evolve from the co-operative form to the self- -managing form of economic organization...|$|R
