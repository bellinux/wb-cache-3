40|$|The {{circumstances}} under which waste can cease to be waste are often considered unclear for several different types of waste. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine both the general circumstances in which gypsum waste can cease to be waste and also examine a specific intended use for gypsum waste; using recycled gypsum as fuel additive in biofuel plants which not have permission to burn waste. The method used is mainly interviews with authorities and stakeholders in the gypsum industry as well as analysis of relevant case law. The results shows that stakeholders in the gypsum industry and the regulating authorities considered that recycled gypsum, which is used as raw material in the manufacture of new plasterboards, should be classified as a <b>non-waste</b> <b>material.</b> If recycled gypsum shall be used in new application areas such as the intended use of gypsum waste as fuel additives it has to be a legal examination case by case. The determining factors in such a legal examination will be the environmental impact of the fuel additive and if the practice should be considered as resource utilization or a disposal of waste. It has also become clear that gypsum waste material that, through a recovery operation ceases to be waste, has no obligation to be registered in the REACH Registry due to exemptions in the REACH-regulation. The overall conclusion from this study is that the field of application determines whether the recycled gypsum waste is classified as a waste or a <b>non-waste</b> <b>material...</b>|$|E
40|$|This Technical Basis Document (TBD) {{identifies}} how {{the values}} {{presented in the}} ''Criteria and Processes for the Certification of Non-Radioactive Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Wastes'' were derived. The original moratorium document (UCRL-AR- 109662) applied only to hazardous wastes generated in Radioactive Materials Management Areas (RMMAs) that were destined for off-site Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) that did not possess a radioactive materials license. Since its inception, the original moratorium document has become the de facto free-release procedure for potentially volumetrically contaminated materials of all varieties. This was promulgated in a February 4, 1992 memo from Jyle Lytle, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Waste Management, entitled ''Update: Moratorium on Shipment of Potentially Radioactive Hazardous and Toxic Wastes''. In this memo, Ms. Lytle states, ''While the moratorium {{does not apply to}} non-hazardous/non-TSCA solid wastes and <b>non-waste</b> <b>materials,</b> the same release criteria apply''. Over the past few years, a considerable quantity of data and operating experience has been developed, which has shown the limitations of UCRL-AR- 109662. The original Moratorium is out of date, and many of the organizations and procedures that it references are no longer in existence. In addition, the original document lacked sufficient detail to be used as an LLNL-wide procedure for free release, as it only addressed hazardous wastes. The original moratorium document also used highly optimistic ''action limits'', which were based on theoretically achievable minimum detectable activity (MDA) levels for various matrices. Years of operating experience has shown that these action limits are simply not achievable for certain analyses in certain matrices, either due to limitations in sample size, or underestimates of the contribution of naturally-occurring radioactive materials, resulting in the mis-characterization of samples of these matrices as radioactive, when no radioactivity was added by LLNL operations. The new moratorium document updates the organizations involved in Moratorium Declarations, specifically addresses non-hazardous waste matrices, and allows for alternative types of analysis. The new moratorium document formalizes the process of release of potentially volumetrically-contaminated waste materials from radiological controls at LLNL...|$|R
