5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> limestone to dry. The mortar began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E

Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games For Windows Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or fan modifications, though Capcom later confirmed {{a way to work}} around these issues.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Azaña and Indalecio Prieto {{started to}} unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of {{what would become the}} Popular Front. Lerroux's Radical {{government}} collapsed after two major scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. The elections of 1936 were won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss of engine power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> court to determine the cause of the total loss of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine the cause of the accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E
5|$|The Colts' 24–6 {{victory over}} the Buccaneers {{clinched}} their first playoff berth in 10 years, and their first winning record since 1977. Although Pro Bowl linebacker Duane Bickett did not play, the Colts' defense did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> Buccaneers inside the 20-yard line. Eric Dickerson ran 33 times for 196yards and two touchdowns. Colts quarterback Jack Trudeau was 17 of 27 for 426yards.|$|E
5|$|The French {{national}} stud, the Haras Nationaux, {{allows the}} registration of horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer, but does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> registration of cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, {{along with several}} other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E

5|$|The actors {{began working}} on the game in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were no {{different from those of}} film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so that it did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> establishment of an infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community helped install a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation in April 1997, but UNITA did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> regional MPLA {{government to take}} up residence in 60 cities. The UN Security Council voted on 28 August 1997, to impose sanctions on UNITA through Resolution 1127, prohibiting UNITA leaders from traveling abroad, closing UNITA's embassies abroad, and making UNITA-controlled areas a no-fly zone. The Security Council expanded the sanctions through Resolution 1173 on 12 June 1998, requiring government certification for the purchase of Angolan diamonds and freezing UNITA's bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{story behind}} the episode was {{inspired}} by several wars and occupations in the past, including the Quartering Acts and the Iraq War. Several parts of the episode changed from the script, more predominantly the scenes involving a suicide bombing. The producers were worried that the Sci Fi Channel would <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of the scene. The episode was seen by 2.2 million viewers and attracted generally positive reactions from critics. In addition, Moore's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award.|$|E
5|$|When Nobin {{returned}} to the village, he learned about the affair from village gossip. Nobin was publicly humiliated following {{the discovery of the}} affair. He confronted Elokeshi, who confessed and begged him for forgiveness. Not only did Nobin forgive her but he decided to run away with her from Tarakeswar. However, the mahant did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> couple to escape; his goons blocked their way. Overcome with anger and jealousy, Nobin slit his wife's throat with a fish knife, decapitating her, on 27 May 1873. Full of remorse, Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> piece to air.|$|E

5|$|Around the 14th century, {{the temple}} was {{associated}} with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792, did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> Nepalese to visit this temple and it became an exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{as an extension of the}} Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994). Many Nepalese artists have worked on the temple's design and construction.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum {{at the university}} during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.|$|E
5|$|Capcom {{expected}} Devil May Cry 4 to ship 1.8 Million Units {{by the end}} of its respected fiscal year. On February 20, 2008, Capcom's president Haruhiro Tsujimoto {{announced in}} a press release that the game shipped 2 million copies in its first month, making it the fastest selling title in the series. By the end of the title's launch year, it had sold 2.32 Million Copies and would eventually reach the milestone of 3 Million units sold by December 31, 2014. Capcom's Christian Svensson noted the PC retail version's sales in the US did not meet his wishes, while a digital download version was only available in the form of piracy as Capcom Japan did <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> game to be sold online. (A PC digital distribution release was made available over a year later).|$|E
