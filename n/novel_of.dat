60|$|The {{realistic}} {{movement in}} American fiction began, {{as we have}} noted, with the short-story writers; and presently the most talented of these writers, having learned the value of real scenes and characters, turned to the novel and produced works having the double interest of romance and realism; that is, they told an old romantic tale of love or heroism and set it amid scenes or characters that were typical of American life. Miss Jewett's <b>novels</b> <b>of</b> northern village life, for example, are even finer than her short stories in the same field. The same criticism applies to Miss Murfree with her <b>novels</b> <b>of</b> mountaineer life in Tennessee, to James Lane Allen with his <b>novels</b> <b>of</b> his native Kentucky, and to many another recent novelist who tells a brave tale of his own people. We call these, in the conventional way, <b>novels</b> <b>of</b> New England or the South or the West; in reality they are <b>novels</b> <b>of</b> humanity, of the old unchanging tragedies or comedies of human life, which seem more true or real to us because they appear in a familiar setting.|$|R
