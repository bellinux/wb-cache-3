40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} further {{understanding}} on European primary geography teachers' conceptual and factual standpoint {{on the use}} of digital technologies in primary geography lessons by researching their technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK), together with their teaching praxis and their teaching context. The study includes both qualitative and quantitative methodology and consists of two research modules. The first is a large-scale survey administered online to a voluntary sample of primary geography teachers (N= 200) teaching to 8 - 10 years old pupils in a selection of seven different European countries (United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Spain, Finland, Romania and Turkey). The second is a <b>national</b> <b>case-study</b> (N= 21) based on the experience of a continuing professional development workshop attended by a group of Italian primary geography teachers. The results report that primary geography teachers share a critical perception of knowledge on geography and indicate the teachers own geographical education as the main problem of teaching geography with technology at primary level today. This lack of confidence, however, co-exist with other factors already studied in literature, as for example the presence of ICT at school and teachers' system of beliefs concerning the efficacy of implementing ICT in their lessons. Ultimately, this study confirms that the simple implementation of ICT does not represent a valid solution to ameliorate geographical learning at primary level, and supports continuing professional development as a valid, appreciated, and efficient way to support teachers that want to improve their teaching of geography by introducing and using ICT in their lessons...|$|E

The authors track the contributions of member states and pressure groups to EU policy formation, and analyse the impact of European legislation on gender issues in law and practice in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden. By combining detailed analysis of the EU policy-making framework with <b>national</b> <b>case-studies,</b> the book illustrates how different policy styles and institutional settings have shaped equality policy and influenced implementation...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary draft – {{please do}} not quote without author’s {{permission}} This paper analyzes on an empirical basis the combined impact that the new European water framework directive and the reform of agricultural policies will have on irrigation water demand, namely the largest source of water use in Europe. Eight case-studies chosen in different countries, with different agronomic and climatic conditions are considered under the same assumptions in terms of water policy and agricultural policy scenarios, though with different methodological approaches {{with respect to the}} estimate of water demand. The simulations show that the effects are not straightforward, and not necessarily are consistent with environmental policy objectives. 1 This article is {{based on the results of}} a study that the author has coordinat ed for the EU-Dg-Environment, whose full report is available in Massarutto (2001). The author is greatly indebted to the colleagues involved in the study who have carried on the case-study simulation and the <b>national</b> <b>case-studies</b> (G. Dono, M. Setti, G. Pallad ino for Italy; J. Vergés for Spain; T. Rieu and G. Gleyses for France) for their valuable contribution to the collective effort resumed herein. Special thanks to P.

40|$|Book synopsis: The book examines, for {{the first}} time in any detail or in any depth, the {{provision}} of municipal medicine in interwar England and Wales at both <b>national</b> and local <b>case-study</b> levels. Municipal health care was an important, but historically neglected, part of the British health care system in this period. The book presents conceptual and empirical perspectives on interwar municipal medicine in England. Using a mixture of under-utilised quantitative and archival data, it explores the patterns of local authority medical services at both national and local levels. What emerges is a complex pattern of provision which touched on all areas of healthcare from the 'cradle to the grave', but with very different priorities and forms in different places. In turn, this raises important questions about the role of local government in this period before the advent of the National Health Service and thereby the subsequent history of health care in England...|$|R
40|$|Direction du panelThis {{panel will}} scrutinize {{the role played}} by {{religion}} in the contemporary variable combination of identities in Europe. Plurality of belongings {{can be found at the}} - relatively pacified - level of individual and cultural identities, as well as on the - more tense - normative level, when it has to do with the elaboration of collective preferences. The political identities can be articulated vertically or cumulatively, through the superposition of different scales of territorial identification, from the local to Europe. Tensions can occur between specific belongings and transnational solidarities, either community-based (diasporas, etc.) or functional. Religion represents a particularly salient factor of these horizontal affiliations which may challenge the established hierarchy of identities. Religion refers both to a set of common values and to institutional, national and transnational, networks. This duality turns religion into a key actor in the current identity-building processes in Europe, and invites to question again the picture of the 'European exception' in terms of secularisation. Theoretical contributions crossing identity politics, theories of nationalism/regionalism/europeanisation and theories of secularisation will be welcome, as well as empirical contributions concerning European territorial issues. Comparative research will be particularly welcome, as well as in-depth <b>national</b> or infranational <b>case-studies...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{ascertain}} the rules of private international law determining the procedural law of international commercial arbitral proceedings. In an Introduction, the author outlines the fundamental notions, introduces the topic and the major doctrines and issues, and sets out his methodology {{and structure of the}} work. The thesis examine first, as a preliminary issue, the considerations influencing the assumption of jurisdiction over arbitral proceedings. Chapter 1 discusses the various theories on the lex arbitri (the law supplying the general legal framework of an arbitration) as relevant to the procedural law, and concludes that they are deductive and therefore unable to satisfactorily to determine the applicable procedural law. Chapter 2 analyses major <b>national</b> laws as <b>case-studies</b> of the technique and scope of application of international arbitration law, and suggests a model of legislative and court jurisdiction based on the legal concept of 'seat of the arbitration' and on considerations based on the most appropriate court to control an arbitration. Chapter 3 discusses the obligations {{of the state of the}} seat under the European Convention on Human Rights and confirms the findings in Chapter 2. In a second part, the thesis elaborates on the title and extent of permissible municipal law interference. Chapter 4 tests the validity of the propositions derived from Chapters 2 and 3 against arbitral practice and concludes that seldom will arbitrators derogate from the law of the seat. Chapter 5 examines the particular case of arbitrations with states and similar entities. The third part discusses the relevance of compliance with the law of the seat at the stage of enforcement of an award. Chapter 6 deals with the technical issue of whether annulment at the place of making precludes enforcement in other fora. That chapter gives the opportunity to discuss models of separation of international jurisdiction and co-operation between different jurisdictions from a practical perspective. It thus serves as a convenient introduction to Chapter 7, which discusses the more abstract question of the nexus required between an arbitral award and the municipal law of the state of rendition in order for the award to enter, in limine, the scope of application of the international instruments in the field. The thesis ends with Conclusions in the form of model provisions for municipal law and arbitration rules. </p...|$|R
