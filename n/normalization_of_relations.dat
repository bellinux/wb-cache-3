5|$|The Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who {{had just}} {{returned}} from a trip to Sorrento, called for a government meeting on the night of March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict and a speedy relief of tension. It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence, a modified version of Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze, which required the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with Lithuania. The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Cramer was {{selected}} by the Ford administration to head the first trade mission to China after the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations.</b> Cramer represented the Republican National Committee when the liberal Ripon Society unsuccessfully fought the delegate formula dating from 1972, when Cramer had been chair of the RNC Rules Committee.|$|E
25|$|Syria {{continued}} {{to demand a}} full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders, including a strip of land on the east shore of the Sea of Galilee that Syria captured during the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli War and occupied from 1949–67. Successive Israeli governments have considered an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with Syria, provided certain security concerns are met. Prior to 2000, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad rejected normalization with Israel.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{marked a}} decisive {{victory for the}} left-wing alliance, Cartel des Gauches. Rather than promising social reforms, the Cartel focused on symbolic causes, including amnesty for Sadoul, which {{was also one of}} the PCF's key demands. On December 3, Sadoul reentered France through Belgium, just as Prime Minister Édouard Herriot was contemplating the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with the Soviet Union. He was welcomed in the home of industrialist Albert Vidal, who had been his friend since before the world war.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{there were}} Israeli-Syrian {{negotiations}} regarding a <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> and an Israeli {{withdrawal from the}} Golan Heights. But a peace treaty was not made, mainly due to Syria's desire to recover and retain 25 square kilometers of territory in the Jordan River Valley which it seized in 1948 and occupied until 1967. As the United Nations recognizes only the 1948 borders, there is little support for the Syrian position outside the Arab bloc nor in resolving the Golan Heights issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{country now}} divided, the {{relationship}} between the two Koreas turned more antagonistic as time passed. The Soviet forces having withdrawn in 1948, North Korea pressured the South to expel the United States forces, but Rhee sought to align his government strongly with America, and against both North Korea and Japan. Although talks towards <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with Japan took place, they achieved little. Meanwhile, the government took in vast sums of American aid, in amounts sometimes near the total size of the national budget. The nationalist government also continued many of the practices of the U.S. military government. In 1948, the Rhee government repressed military uprisings in Jeju, Suncheon and Yeosu. About 30,000 local people were gunned down.|$|E
25|$|US and Cuban Interests Sections {{staffed by}} actual US and Cuban diplomats were {{mutually}} agreed upon in 1977 after the Carter Administration took office {{and decided to}} seek <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with Cuba. US officials replaced the Swiss diplomats in the US Interests Section in Havana on September 1, 1977. Both under the Swiss and later with US staff, the Section occupied the former United States Embassy building on Havana's Malecon that was designed by Harrison & Abramovitz architects and originally entered into service in 1953. When relations were broken in 1961, the building was occupied, and its contents safeguarded, by the Swiss diplomats who handled US interests in Cuba {{on behalf of the}} US Government as the protecting power until the arrival of the US staff in 1977.|$|E

25|$|These {{talks were}} {{a result of}} North Korea {{withdrawing}} from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. Apparent gains following {{the fourth and fifth}} rounds were reversed by outside events. Five rounds of talks from 2003 to 2007 produced little net progress until the third phase of the fifth round of talks, when North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel aid and steps towards the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with the United States and Japan. Responding angrily to the United Nations Security Council's Presidential Statement issued on April 13, 2009 that condemned the North Korean failed satellite launch, the DPRK declared on April 14, 2009 that it would pull out of Six Party Talks and that it would resume its nuclear enrichment program in order to boost its nuclear deterrent. North Korea has also expelled all nuclear inspectors from the country.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1976, Holbrooke left Foreign Policy to serve as {{campaign}} coordinator for national security affairs to Governor Jimmy Carter (D-GA) in his bid for the White House. During the campaign, Holbrooke helped Carter prepare for his foreign policy debates with President Gerald Ford. After Carter's victory, Holbrooke followed {{in the footsteps of}} such diplomatic mentors as Philip Habib, Dean Rusk and Averell Harriman and, on March 31, 1977, became Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, making him the youngest person ever to hold that position, a post he held until 1981. While at State, he was a top adviser to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. During his service, he oversaw a warming with Cold War adversaries in the region, culminating in the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with China in December 1978. He was also deeply involved in bringing hundreds of thousands of Indochinese refugees to the United States, thus beginning a lifelong involvement with the refugee issue.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> {{with the}} Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia, Mieszko I {{returned}} to his plans of conquest of the more western part of Pomerania. On 21 September 967 the Polish-Bohemian troops prevailed in the decisive battle against the Wolinians led by Wichmann the Younger, which gave Mieszko the control over {{the mouth of the}} Odra River. The German margraves had not opposed Mieszko's activities in Pomerania, perhaps even supported them; the death of the rebellious Wichmann, who succumbed to his wounds soon after the battle, may have been in line with their interests. A telling incident took place after the battle, a testimony to Mieszko's high standing among the Empire's dignitaries, just one year after his baptism: Widukind of Corvey reported that the dying Wichmann asked Mieszko to hand over Wichmann's weapons to Emperor Otto I, to whom Wichmann was related. For Mieszko the victory had to be a satisfying experience, especially in light of his past defeats inflicted by Wichmann.|$|E

500|$|While the Syrian {{constitution}} liberally grants free speech, a {{state of}} emergency in effect since the Baath Party seized power suspends this freedom. Syria has stringently approached dissidents who question its policies in neighboring Lebanon; Syrian authorities detained and imprisoned ten activists who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration petition in May 2006. The petition, of which al-Mir was a signatory, advocated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> between the two countries.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by Russia, the United States and France, {{pressured}} Armenia and Azerbaijan {{to agree}} on the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh. In September, Ter-Petrosyan stated his support of the [...] "step-by-step" [...] proposal, which included the return of the territories outside the NKAO borders. Ter-Petrosyan argued the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with Azerbaijan and, therefore, the opening of the border with Turkey {{was the only way to}} significantly improve Armenia's economy. After the plan was publicized, he came up against strong opposition. The issue was [...] "important to the Armenians because of historical and psychological factors. After having been losing territories for centuries, the Armenians are reluctant to 'lose' Karabakh now that they have won a war against Azerbaijan." [...] According to political scientist Vicken Cheterian, [...] "By calling for major concessions on Karabakh, Ter-Petrosyan was antagonizing the last forces that supported his rule, the army and the Karabakh elite, at a time when his popularity within the Armenian society was at its lowest." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cultural Revolution {{caused a}} {{complete}} meltdown of Sino-Soviet relations, inasmuch as Moscow (along with every communist state save for Albania) considered that event to be simple-minded insanity. Red Guards denounced the Soviet Union {{and the entire}} Eastern Bloc as revisionists who pursued a false socialism and of being in collusion with the forces of imperialism. Brezhnev {{was referred to as}} [...] "the new Hitler" [...] and the Soviets as warmongers who neglected their people's living standards in favor of military spending. In 1968 Lin Biao, the Chinese Defence Minister, claimed that the Soviet Union was preparing itself for a war against the PRC. Moscow shot back by accusing China of false socialism and plotting with the US as well as promoting a guns-over-butter economic policy. This tension escalated into small skirmishes alongside the Sino-Soviet border, and both Khrushchev and Brezhnev were derided as [...] "betrayers of [...] Lenin" [...] by the Chinese. To counter the accusations made by the Chinese Central Government, Brezhnev condemned the PRC's [...] "frenzied anti-Sovietism", and asked Zhou Enlai to follow up on his word to normalize Sino-Soviet relations. In another speech, this time in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR in 1982, Brezhnev warned First World powers of using the Sino-Soviet split against the Soviet Union, saying it would spark [...] "tension and mistrust". Brezhnev had offered a non-aggression pact to China, but its terms included a renunciation of China's territorial claims, and would have left China defenseless against threats from the USSR. In 1972, US president Richard Nixon visited Beijing to restore relations with the PRC, which only seemed to confirm Soviet fears of Sino-US collusion. Relations between Moscow and Beijing remained extremely hostile through the entire decade of the 1970s, the latter deciding that [...] "social" [...] imperialism presented a greater danger than capitalist imperialism, and even after Mao Zedong's death showed no sign of a chill. The Soviet Union had by this time championed an Asian collective security treaty in which the USSR would defend any country against a possible attack from the PRC, but when the latter engaged Vietnam in a border war during early 1979, Moscow contented itself with verbal protests. The Soviet leadership after Brezhnev's death actively pursued a more friendly foreign policy to the PRC, and the <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> which had begun under Brezhnev, continued under his successors.|$|E
5000|$|King {{favors the}} <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> U.S.-Cuba <b>relations.</b> He opposes the U.S. embargo against Cuba, calling it an [...] "antiquated" [...] {{relic of the}} Cold War; in 2015, King {{introduced}} legislation to lift the embargo.|$|R

2500|$|On 21 September 2013, Alex Petriashvili, the Georgian State Minister of Euro-Atlantic Integration, {{said that}} the recent [...] "provocations" [...] did not promote <b>normalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> between Georgia and Russia.
