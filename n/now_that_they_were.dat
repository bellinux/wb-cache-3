5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at Sedan and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark {{the supreme}} and {{dominating}} power in Northern Europe, yet failed {{to restore the}} Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led {{to a series of}} conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> no longer fighting each other.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the cause}} of all this may {{be traced to the}} {{different}} views entertained by the two great Commanders. Blücher's extreme hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from the first moment he heard of the escape of Napoleon from Elba; that they ought not only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he nor his soldiers could ever forget the cruelties and extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when overrun by the French: and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> once more brought into the land of their enemies, and another period of retribution had arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army — that those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of war throughout the whole continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its evils. In Siborne's opinion a contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding, {{on the part of the}} Prussians was scarcely to be expected. Hence the value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops operating as a salutary counterpoise to the domineering and revengeful spirit which actuated the Prussians.|$|E

When he {{returned}} {{after the end of}} the fifth season, he presented Davies with a script and CD, complete with notated and orchestrated music, which Davies found [...] "mind-boggling". The actors were initially bewildered; in 2012, James Marsters commented that [...] "it's obvious <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> good songs but the thing was Joss and his wife Kai, they don't sing very well. And they don't play piano very well. The songs sounded really cheesy and horrible... We were saying, 'Joss, you're ruining our careers.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When the North Korean attack {{broke through}} the 2nd Battalion, Champney ordered the 1st Battalion, about [...] south of Haman on the Chindong-ni road, to counterattack and restore the line. Roberts {{assembled}} 40 men, all he could find of the disorganized 2nd Battalion, to join in this counterattack, which got under way at 07:30. Upon contact with the enemy, the 1st Battalion broke and fled to the rear. Thus, shortly after daylight the scattered and disorganized men of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 24th Infantry had fled to the high ground [...] east of Haman. The better part of two regiments of the NK 6th Division poured into and through the Haman gap, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> holding the town.|$|E

The moral rationale was that since the Acholi adults had proven themselves untrustworthy, the LRA must cleanse the land of them and create a new society with the children. This philosophical approach, similar to that taken by the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, has been referred to as [...] "auto-genocide." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dietzel {{recruited}} {{a talented}} freshman class for the 1956 season, and had high expectations <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> upperclassmen. However, {{in the preseason}} LSU was picked to finish ninth out of twelve teams in the Southeastern Conference. While they had talent on offense, the Tigers were young and inexperienced on defense. To utilize the team's talented backfield, which consisted of halfbacks Billy Cannon and Johnny Robinson, Dietzel adopted a wing T offensive formation. This formation favored the running game, {{and it was the}} first major change in LSU's offense since 1944. Dietzel then named the young defense the [...] "Chinese Bandits," [...] after characters from a Terry and the Pirates comic strip, hoping an identity would instill pride and confidence in what would ordinarily have been substitute players.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{destruction}} of Magdala, the British began to retrace their steps back to Zula, [...] "an imposing procession, with the bands playing and the flags leading the way, but the army soon learned that they had earned no gratitude in Ethiopia; they were treated as simply another warlike tribe on the move, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going away like weak and defeated men they were an obvious target for attack." [...] At Senafe, the British rewarded Ras Kassai, Yohannes IV, for his services with a formidable quantity of supplies, which Marcus estimates were worth [...] "approximately £500,000": six mortars, six howitzers, about 900 muskets and rifles, stocks of ammunition which included 585,480 percussion caps, and other goods and supplies. These later aided his rise to Emperor, against such talented rivals as Wagshum Gobeze and Menelik of Shewa. By 2 June Napier had reached Zula, and as the men were loaded into the ships, the base camp was dismantled; Napier boarded the Feroze on 10 June, and set sail for England {{by way of the}} Suez Canal.|$|E
2500|$|Although the CARICOM Skills Certificate regime pre-dates {{the formal}} inauguration of the CSME (Skills Certificates have been {{available}} since 1997, while the CSME was only formally instituted in 2005 following provisional application of the CSME protocols in 2001) the number of Skills Certificates issued to qualifying CARICOM nationals has only really taken off since the CSME was instituted. Between 1997 and 2005 only nine Member States had issued certificates of Recognition of Skills on a relatively small scale. Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Guyana have issued the bulk of these certificates. By September 2010 approximately 10,000 Skills Certificates had been issued by the 12 member states with the available data on free movement indicating that more than 6,000 of these skills certificates having been issued between 2006 and 2008. At {{an address to the}} graduates of the 48th Convocation of the University of Guyana on 8 November 2014, [...] CARICOM’s Secretary General, Irwin La Rocque, revealed that up to November 2014 a total of 14,000 Skills Certificates had been issued and he urged the graduates to apply for their own Skills Certificates <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> eligible.|$|E
