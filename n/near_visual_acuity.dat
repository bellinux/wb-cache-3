Method: Forty students with low vision, aged from eight to 20 years and without any intellectual, reading or learning disability, were recruited through the Paediatric Low Vision Clinic, Buranda, Queensland. Following a preliminary vision examination, reading performance measures—critical print size (CPS), maximum oral reading rates (MORR), <b>near</b> text <b>visual</b> acuity— were recorded using the Bailey-Lovie text reading charts before and after a 30 -minute prolonged reading task. Results: The mean age of the participants was 13. 03 ± 3 years.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{inclusion}} {{for rehabilitation}} of visually impaired children is partly {{based on the}} measurement of near vision, but guidelines for <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> assessment are currently lacking. The twofold purpose of this systematic review was to: (i) {{provide an overview of}} the impact of the chart design on <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured, and (ii) determine the method of choice for near vision assessments in children of different developmental ages. METHODS: A literature search was conducted by using the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The last search was run on March 26 th 2016. Additional studies were identified by contacting experts and searching for relevant articles in reference lists of included studies. Search terms were: vision test(s), vision assessment(s), visual acuity, chart(s) and near. RESULTS: For children aged 0 - 3 years the golden standard is still the preferential looking procedure. Norms are available for this procedure for 6 - 36 month old children. For 4 - 7 year olds, we recommend using the LEA symbols, because these symbols have been properly validated and can be used in preliterate children. Responses can be verbal or by matching the target symbol. In children aged 8 - 13 years, the recommended method is the ETDRS letter chart, because letter acuity is more predictive for functional vision and reading than symbol acuity. In 8 - 13 year olds, letter acuity is 0. 1 - 0. 2 logMAR poorer than symbol acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Chart design, viewing distance, and threshold choice have a serious impact on <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measurements. <b>Near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with symbols is lower than <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with gratings, and <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with letters is lower than <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with symbols.

SETTING: Eye Clinic, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom. METHODS: Presbyopic corrections examined were accommodating intraocular lenses (IOLs), simultaneous multifocal and monovision contact lenses, and varifocal spectacles. Binocular <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with different optotypes (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and words) and reading metrics assessed with the Minnesota Near Reading chart (reading acuity, critical print size [CPS], CPS reading speed) were intercorrelated (Pearson product moment correlations) and assessed for concordance (intraclass correlation coefficients [ICC]) and agreement (Bland-Altman analysis) for indication of clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Nineteen accommodating IOL cases, 40 simultaneous contact lens cases, and 38 varifocal spectacle cases were evaluated. Other than CPS reading speed, all <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> and reading metrics correlated well with each other (r> 0. 70, P<. 001). <b>Near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with uppercase letters was highly concordant (ICC, 0. 78) and in close agreement with lowercase letters (+/- 0. 17 logMAR). Near word acuity agreed well with reading acuity (+/- 0. 16 logMAR), which in turn agreed well with <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with uppercase letters 0. 16 logMAR). Concordance (ICC, 0. 18 to 0. 46) and agreement (+/- 0. 24 to 0. 30 logMAR) of CPS with the other near metrics was moderate.

Clinical outcomes included uncorrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity,</b> uncorrected distance visual acuity, visual acuity, spectacle independence, and halos. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to compare outcomes for the different IOL types. Results: Twenty papers were identified describing 11 monofocal IOLs and 35 multifocal IOLs (19 diffractive, including 12 ReSTOR&reg;, 14 refractive, and two accommodative) patient cohorts. Multifocal and monofocal uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0. 165 (0. 090 &ndash; 0. 240) and 0. 093 (0. 088 &ndash; 0. 098), respectively.

Compared with refractive multifocal IOLs, diffractive multifocal IOLs produced a similar uncorrected distance visual acuity (0. 105 [0. 098 &ndash; 0. 111] versus 0. 085 [0. 029 &ndash; 0. 140]; P &le; 0. 78, not significant) and better uncorrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (0. 217 [0. 118 &ndash; 0. 317] versus 0. 082 [0. 067 &ndash; 0. 098]; P &lt; 0. 0001) resulting in higher spectacle independence (IRR 1. 75 [1. 24 &ndash; 2. 48]; P &lt; 0. 001). Compared with other multifocal IOLs, ReSTOR produced a better uncorrected distance visual acuity (0. 067 [0. 059 &ndash; 0. 076] versus 0. 093 [0. 088 &ndash; 0. 098]; P &lt; 0. 0001) and better uncorrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (0. 064 [0. 046 &ndash; 0. 082] versus 0. 141 [0. 131 &ndash; 0. 152]; P &lt; 0. 006), resulting in higher spectacle independence (IRR 2. 06 [1. 26 &ndash; 1. 36]; P &lt; 0. 004).

They {{are based on}} reading types adopted by the Faculty of Ophthalmologists of the United Kingdom. Testing <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> has {{its place in the}} {{assessing}} of the macular function and prescribing a suitable addition for presbyopia. Some eye diseases affect reading acuity to a great extent such as posterior subcapsular cataract. ' Hence its testing is an indis-pensible part of ophthalmic examination. The first scientific attempt to test <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> was made by Snellen in 1868, 2 who applied to the test the same principle as he applied to his distance types. Each letter is made as a square subtending an angle of 5 ' at the ordinary reading distance. ' The unfamiliar configuration of letters of that construction, how-ever, is not reproduced in ordinary printer's founts. 3 Jaeger's suggestions 23 found more general accept-ance because they consisted in ordinary printer's founts of that time. Jaeger's types persisted for a long time, though their uniformity was entirely lost mainly because the original founts from which the types were produced became obsolete. 4 To overcome this difficulty the British Faculty of Ophthalmologists put forward the suggestions 4 and then recommendations for standarisation ' of reading types. Times Roman type face is used with standard spacing. (Times refers to the print used by The Times newspaper.) The notation was based on the printer's point system, where specimens of printed materials are given in sizes of 5 pt, 6 pt, 8 pt, etc. (a point stands for 1 / 72 inch (0. 35 mm) and indicates the size of the block on which individual letters are cast; 2 5 point type is one in which each letter is cast on a block 5 / 72 inch (1 - 76 mm) tall. This test proved its adequacy for the examination of <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> for more than 30 years. Arabic reading types Arabic test types for distance visual acuity wer...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{distant and}} <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> {{function}} after cataract surgery with implantation of Crystalens HD or Tek-Clear as accommodating intraocular lenses (IOLs), versus SA 60 AT {{as a standard}} IOL. Methods: The study included 62 eyes of 58 patients divided into three groups using three different IOLs: Crystalens HD (Bausch and Lomb, NY, USA), Tek-Clear (Tekia, CA, USA) and SA 60 AT (Alcon, TX, USA) were implanted in 23, 14 and 25 eyes, respectively. Corrected distant <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (CDVA), uncorrected and distance corrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> (UCNVA and DCNVA), near point of accommodation (NPA), spectacle freedom and patient satisfaction were assessed six months postoperatively and compared between the three groups. Results: After 6 months, all patients showed significant improvement in CDVA with no significant difference among the study groups. However, UCNVA and DCNVA were significantly better in patients implanted with accommodating IOLs. NPA was closest in the Crystalens HD group, followed by Tek-Clear and monofocal SA 60 AT (P < 0. 001). Patients with accommodating IOLs {{were more likely to}} become spectacle free and satisfied with their near vision as compared to subjects receiving a monofocal IOL. Conclusions: Accommodating IOLs (Crystalens HD and Tek-Clear) effectively reduce the necessity for spectacles after cataract surgery...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the new low-addition (add) (+ 3. 00 diopter [D]) ReSTOR multifocal IOL compared with the preceding ReSTOR model with + 4. 00 D add. SETTING: University Eye Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Patients with a + 3. 00 D or + 4. 00 D add multifocal IOL were examined for uncorrected and distance-corrected <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> at distance, intermediate, and near. A defocus profile was assessed, individual reading distance and the distance for lowest intermediate <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> were determined. Patient satisfaction was evaluated with a standardized questionnaire. Contrast sensitivity was tested under mesopic and photopic conditions. RESULTS: Uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were statistically significantly better in the + 3. 00 D add group (24 eyes) than in the + 4. 00 D add group (30 eyes); distance and <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were not different between groups. The defocus profile significantly varied between groups. The + 4. 00 D add group had a closer reading distance (33. 0 cm) than the + 3. 00 D add group (43. 5 cm), a closer point of lowest intermediate <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (65. 8 cm versus 86. 9 cm) and worse lowest intermediate <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (20 / 59 +/- 4. 5 letters [SD] versus 20 / 48 +/- 5. 5 letters). Thus, patients in the + 3. 00 D add group reported being more satisfied with intermediate <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> The + 3. 00 D add group reported more glare but less halos than the + 4. 00 D add group; contrast sensitivity was not different. CONCLUSION: The lower addition resulted in a narrower defocus profile, a farther reading distance, and better intermediate <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> and thus increased patient satisfaction.

40|$|OBJECTIVES This study {{examined}} the <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of dentists in relation to age and magnification under simulated clinical conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Miniaturized visual tests were performed in posterior teeth of a dental phantom head in a simulated clinical setting (dental chair, operating lamp, dental mirror). The visual acuity of 40 dentists was measured under the following conditions: (1) natural visual acuity, distance of 300  mm; (2) natural visual acuity, free choice of distance; (3) Galilean loupes, magnification of × 2. 5; (4) Keplerian loupes, × 4. 3; (5) operating microscope, × 4, integrated light; (6) operating microscope, × 6. 4, integrated light. RESULTS The visual acuity varied widely between individuals and was significantly lower in the group ≥ 40  years of age (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Significant {{differences were found between}} all tested conditions (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Furthermore, a correlation between visual acuity and age was found for all conditions. The performance with the microscope was better than with loupes even with comparable magnification factors. Some dentists had a better visual acuity without optical aids than others with Galilean loupes. CONCLUSIONS <b>Near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> under simulated clinical conditions varies widely between individuals and decreases throughout life. Visual deficiencies can be compensated for with optical aids. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Newly developed miniaturized vision tests have allowed, in a clinically relevant way, to evaluate the influence of magnification and age on the <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of dentists...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{results of}} {{implantation}} of refractive intraocular lenses (IOL), especially with an inferior segmental near add are {{of great interest}} due to advantages of the new lenses over more frequently used diffractive multifocal IOL.   Aim: To assess the ocular optical performance of eyes implanted with a new IOL Lentis Mplus.   Materials and methods: 78 patients (100 eyes) aged > 50 years were implanted with 100 IOLs Lentis Mplus. Preoperative examination included measuring uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected and corrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> Postoperatively, uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected and corrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (distance 33 cm) were estimated along with intermediate vision measurement using near-vision charts (60 cm).   Results: On the day 3 after the procedure, distance visual acuity was good, and patients were able to near-reading of medium-size fonts. In 1 year, uncorrected visual acuity was 0. 8 – 1. 0 in two thirds of patients. 25 % of patients needed distance visual correction from (-) 0. 5 to (-) 0. 75 D. Corrected visual acuity improved to 0. 9 – 1. 0. In 1 year, <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> was 0. 5 or more and intermediate visual acuity was 0. 4 or more in all patients. In 78 % of patients, 60 cm visual acuity was 0. 5.   Conclusion: Implantation of multifocal IOL Lentis Mplus produced good distance visual acuity and satisfactory (working) near and intermediate visual performance. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the predictability of lens shift induced by pilocarpine (LSPilo) on {{the outcomes of}} accommodating intraocular lens (Acc-IOL) implantation. Methods. Twenty-four eyes of 24 senile cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification and Acc-IOL implantation were enrolled. LSPilo was evaluated with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). At 3 months postoperatively, the best corrected distance <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> (BCDVA), distance-corrected <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> (DCNVA), and subjective and objective accommodations were measured. IOL shifts under accommodation stimulus (IOLSAcc) were evaluated with AS-OCT. Results. The mean LSPilo was 112. 29 ± 30. 72 [*]µm. LSPilo {{was not associated with}} any preoperative parameters. The mean IOLSAcc was 130. 46 ± 42. 71 [*]µm. The mean subjective and objective accommodation were 1. 54 ± 0. 39 [*]D and 1. 27 ± 0. 41 [*]D, respectively. The mean postoperative BCDVA and DCNVA (log MAR value) were 0. 22 ± 0. 11 and 0. 24 ± 0. 12, respectively. LSPilo positively correlated with IOLSAcc (r= 0. 541; P= 0. 006), subjective accommodation (r= 0. 412; P= 0. 022), and objective accommodation (r= 0. 466; P= 0. 045), respectively. Conclusion. LSPilo is an independent preoperative parameter associated with the postoperative Acc-IOL mobility and pseudophakic accommodation. It may offer valuable information for ophthalmologists in determining the suitable candidates for Acc-IOL implantation...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Comparar a função visual e a resposta dos pacientes ao índice de qualidade de vida quando estes são corrigidos com óculos com lentes progressivas ou lente de contato progressiva. MÉTODOS: Foram selecionados 35 pacientes présbitas, usuários de óculos com acuidade visual igual, ou melhor, a logMAR zero (longe) e J 1 (perto), para adaptarem a lente de contato Focus Progressive®. Foram comparadas medidas de acuidade visual para longe, perto e sensibilidade ao contraste com a lente de contato e com os óculos. Os resultados do questionário de avaliação de qualidade de vida NEI VFQ- 25 dos mesmos pacientes corrigidos com os óculos e com a lente de contato progressiva foram comparados, levando-se em consideração o tipo de {{ametropia}} e a idade. RESULTADOS: A acuidade visual para longe, perto e a sensibilidade ao contraste foram significantemente piores com lente de contato progressiva do que com os óculos. As respostas do questionário não diferiram quanto à forma de correção quando se analisou o tipo de ametropia, entretanto foram significantemente piores com a lente de contato nos grupos míope e hipermétrope abaixo das suas respectivas medianas da idade e maiores no hipermétrope acima de sua mediana. CONCLUSÃO: As funções visuais foram significantemente piores com a lente de contato e o tipo de ametropia não influenciou nas respostas ao índice de qualidade de vida quanto à forma de correção, mas sim, quanto à idade. PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} visual function and {{the answers to}} a questionnaire of {{quality of life of}} patients wearing a progressive contact lens or eyeglasses. METHODS: The Focus Progressive® contact lens had been fitted in 35 patients with far <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> with progressive-addition eyeglasses equal to zero (log MAR) and near J 1 (Jaeger). The far and <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> and the measurement of contrast sensitivity were compared when the patients were wearing the eyeglasses or the contact lens and the patients' results of the scores of the quality of life questionnaire (NEI VFQ- 25) were analyzed statistically considering the type of ametropy and the age. RESULTS: The far and <b>near</b> <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> and the contrast sensitivity measurement were worse with the contact lens than with eyeglasses. The answers to the questionnaire did not differ when were comparing the same patients wearing eyeglasses or contact lens, no matter the type of ametropy. The myopic and the hyperopic subgroups had worse answers to the quality of life questionnaire when corrected with the contact lens than with eyeglasses, both with age equal to or less than their median. CONCLUSIONS: The visual function was worse with the contact lens.
