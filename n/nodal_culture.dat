40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} method for high {{frequency}} plantlets regeneration protocol for Enicostema axillare (Lam.) Raynal ssp. littoralis (Blume) Raynal (E. axillare) without intermediate callus phase and to determine the content and correlation of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity of both the plants derived from nature and <b>nodal</b> <b>culture</b> by DPPH assay. Methods: The nodal explants were cultured on MS basal medium fortified with different concentration of various growth regulators such as BAP, KIN, TDZ and 2 iP (0. 5 – 2 mg/L) individually and in combinations with or without GA 3 for shoot bud induction and multiplication. Total phenol and flavonoid content was determined in both plants from nature and <b>nodal</b> <b>culture</b> and antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH assay. Results: The highest number of multiple shoot (108. 00 ± 3. 55 shoots/explants) was obtained on MS medium supplemented with BAP (2 mg/L) in combination with KIN (0. 5 mg/L) and GA 3 (2 mg/L). Rooting was optimized on half-strength MS medium supplemented with IAA (0. 5 mg/L). The rooted plantlets were transferred to paper cups containing vermiculite and hardening was successfully attained with 75 % survival. Among the four extract of methanol and water extract from both the plantlet from nature and <b>nodal</b> <b>culture,</b> the concentration of flavonoid {{was found to be}} higher in methanol extract of the plants from nature (146. 57 ± 1. 68 mg rutin/g extract) and phenol content was higher in the water extract of plant from nature (52. 53 ± 1. 67 mg GAE/g extract). The radical scavenging activity of four extracts. Methanol extract of plant grown in nature showed the highest radical scavenging activity (IC 50 = 87. 10 μg/mL) was investigated by DPPH test. Conclusion: The present study not only enables reinforcement of wild plant populations using ex situ growth of individuals, but it also helps for high scale production of plantlets. A high correlation between antioxidant capacities and their total phenolic contents indicated that flavonoid compounds were a major contributor of antioxidant activity of both plants grown from nature and <b>nodal</b> <b>culture...</b>|$|E
40|$|Papaya (Carica papaya L.) nodal {{cultures}} {{modified the}} atmosphere of the headspace of the vessel used for culture maintenance by producing ethylene. Under culture maintenance nodal cultures grew poorly and leaves senesced. Incubating nodal cultures under a range of ethylene concentrations suggested that this poor performance was caused in part, by the production of ethylene and its accumulation in the headspace of the vessel. To further evaluate the role of ethylene accumulation in growth suppression, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC) and silver thiosulphate (STS), were added to the nutrient medium and ethylene measurements performed during culture growth. The ethylene-suppressant, AVG, (1. 2 μM) and the ethylene-antagonist, STS, (0. 3 mM) significantly improved <b>nodal</b> <b>culture</b> growth (283 and 289 % respectively), leaf area production (350 and 211 % respectively) and reduced leaf senescence, while the ethylene-precursor, ACC, (1. 5 mM) significantly decreased culture growth (71 %), leaf area production (88 %) and promoted leaf senescence. Furthermore, <b>nodal</b> <b>culture</b> growth was significantly better at 20 °C than 30 °C since ethylene production and accumulation were less in these conditions. Better control or management of ethylene accumulation produces healthier nodal cultures for micro-propagation and may be a way of improving productivity of other papaya shoot culture systems...|$|E

Biotechnological approaches in forest science are advanced as a desirable tool to obtain superior genotypes and to screen for insect resistance. As a basic technique, in vitro cloning is a powerful tool using different explant types such as immature ovules or stem nodes for tree improvement. Typically, plants can be regenerated in vitro by apical or vascular cambial meristems. Genetic transformation is another option to improve the variable lines by genetic modification in host genetic materials with desirable traits. In addition to cloning and gene transfer, in vitro screening methods are applicable for early selection with modified plantlets;In this advanced biotechnology program, several aspects were addressed with Populus species: (1) light and scanning electron microscope study of shoot formation in developing ovules of cottonwood (Populus deltoides), (2) evaluation of shoot proliferation from alternative in vitro <b>nodal</b> <b>cultures</b> of a cottonwood hybrid (Populus deltoides X P. nigra), (3) investigation of morphological in vitro shoot abnormalities in hybrid aspen (Populus alba L.

Therefore, the culture system was developed and shoot formation from immature embryos was investigated via electron and light microscopes. The regeneration frequency was increased substantially by treatment with zeatin;Ordinarily, an intact node is used as explant material in {{plant tissue culture}}. However, shoot production was significantly enhanced by using internode and modified stem segment explants in this study. Besides the apical or vascular cambial meristems, shoots could be produced from the phellogen (lenticel) which is an organ for secondary growth in bark. Therefore, shoot formation from lenticel area was investigated through stereo and light microscopy;Even though the development of in vitro systems is important in biotechnological research, abnormal plantlets need to be studied to overcome in vitro problems.

For functional analysis, enzyme activities of lipoxygenase (LOX; EC 1. 13. 11. 12), glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2. 5. 1. 18), ascorbate peroxidase (APOX; EC 1. 11. 1. 11) and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1. 6. 4. 2) were determined. The enzyme activity of GR and LOX, and the glutathione content (GSH) {{were found to be}} significantly higher in PQT clones. CONCLUSIONS: Paraquat-tolerant clones as powerful new stress tolerant and non-GMO plants can provide an effective tool for phytoremediaton purposes where the pollutants cause oxidative stresses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProlonged {{maintenance}} of trophoblast stem (TS) cells requires fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 4 and embryonic fibroblast feeder cells or feeder cell-conditioned medium. Previous {{studies have shown}} that TGF-β and Activin are sufficient to replace embryonic fibroblast-conditioned medium. Nodal, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, is also known to be important in vivo for the {{maintenance of}} TS cells in the developing placenta. Our current studies indicate that TS cells do not express the Nodal co-receptor, Cripto, and do not respond directly to active <b>Nodal</b> in <b>culture.</b> Conversely, Activin subunits and their receptors are expressed in the placenta and TS cell cultures, with Activin predominantly expressed by trophoblast giant cells (TGCs). Differentiation of TS cells in the presence of TGC-conditioned medium or exogenous Activin results in a reduction in the expression of TGC markers. In line with TGC-produced Activin representing the active component in TGC-conditioned medium, this differentiation-inhibiting effect can be reversed by the addition of follistatin. Additional experiments in which TS cells were differentiated in {{the presence or absence of}} exogenous Activin or TGF-β show that Activin but not TGF-β results in the maintenance of expression of TS cell markers, prolongs the expression of syncytiotrophoblast markers, and significantly delays the expression of spongiotrophoblast and TGC markers. These results suggest that Activin rather than TGF-β (or Nodal) acts directly on TS cells influencing both TS cell maintenance and cell fate, depending on whether the cells are also exposed to FGF 4...|$|R

40|$|A {{protocol}} to micropropagate Capparis mitchellii and Citrus glauca through {{plant tissue culture}} techniques was investigated in this project. An efficient protocol will open a possibility to mass propagate both of these Australian native plants either for industrial or conservation purposes. The project was conducted using surface sterilisation, shoot initiation, shoot multiplication, rooting and acclimatisation experiments. Microbial contamination level in this project was maintained at a low level by agitating the plant material for 4 hours in 5 % (v/v) PPM(TM) solution prior to planting onto media supplemented with mancozeb. By this method, shoot initiation, multiplication, elongation and rooting experiments were made possible. A range of different strength basal media and growth regulators was utilised to promote shoot and root induction from C. mitchellii and C. glauca nodal shoot explants. Shoot proliferation was observed in all treatments with the optimum rate obtained on MS media supplemented with 1 mg/L BA and ½MS media with 0. 1 mg/L BA for C. mitchellii and C. glauca respectively. Healthy roots of C. mitchellii were promoted by exposing the proliferated shoots {{to high levels of}} NAA (100 - 200 mg/L) for 48 hrs. No roots were observed on C. glauca shoots. Necrotic and secondary abscission zone became a major issue in this project. Prolonged use of antibiotics, imbalance of nutrients and exogenous growth regulators were considered as the possible factors. Experimenting with nutrient level and growth regulators was necessary to improve shoot and root proliferation.
