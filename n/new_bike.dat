25|$|While the {{previous}} system, Copenhagen City Bikes, was {{considered one of}} the first examples of modern bike share systems, it was also of little or no use to commuters, and was mainly seen as serving tourists and casual users since it was primarily designed to prevent bike theft. This was set to change with the city's <b>new</b> <b>bike</b> share system opening in 2013, which should be designed specifically for commuters, in order to function as a range extender for the public transit system. With that in mind, the cities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg have appointed the operator of the S-train system, DSB to both tender and subsequently run the system. In 2013, a new system, Bycyklen, provided by Gobike has been put into function, once fully installed it will provide 1,260 modern bikes with aluminium frame, adjustable seat-height and GPS-guidance.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, McCormack {{noticed that}} one Honda dealer in Boise, Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the {{combined}} total of all six dealers in Los Angeles. He {{found out that}} the Idaho dealer, Herb Uhl, was selling the CA100s as a trail bike by adding knobby tires for off-road traction and a [...] "cheater sprocket," [...] that is, increasing the final drive ratio by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth, which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel, trading off lower top speed as a result. Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the automatic clutch allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off-road riding, in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle. McCormack shipped a version of Uhl's customized CA100 to Japan and requested Honda put it into production, and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers. Cycle World praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the <b>new</b> <b>bike,</b> and it was a US sales success.|$|E

500|$|Bathurst reprised {{the role}} in the Cold Feet series, which ran for five years from 1998 to 2003. He {{described}} the character of David as an [...] "emotional cripple", originally with little depth. The third series features an affair between David and a political activist played by Yasmin Bannerman. Bathurst appreciated the opportunity to bring some depth to a previously one-dimensional character, but was more impressed with the storylines {{that came out of}} the affair, rather than the affair itself: [...] "It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable". Like other cast members, Bathurst was able to suggest storylines as the series went on; one episode features David celebrating his fortieth birthday and Bathurst suggested the character could get a Harley-Davidson motorbike. Granada paid for him to take motorcycle lessons and a test. On the day before taking his test, the filming of a scene where David takes off on his <b>new</b> <b>bike</b> was scheduled. Bathurst [...] "wobbled, missed the camera and crashed into the pavement", leading director Simon Delaney to exclaim it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. In another episode, David buys a racehorse – ostensibly as a birthday present for his wife – in a plot born out of Bathurst's own love of horseracing. The role made him more widely recognisable and he often received prospective scripts that were [...] "obvious rewrites of the character". He turned them down, preferring to play a [...] "good person", which would be more interesting from a dramatic point of view.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to the Olympics, Lynch went to North America and competed in World Cup races in Canada and the United States. She then competed in the 1996 pre-Olympic cycle tour, winning one of the stages. Once she arrived at the Olympic Village in Atlanta, she was underwhelmed by the support she {{received}} from the cycling team; most had never been to a mountain bike event. The team jersey was unsuitable for the heat and humidity. Her <b>new</b> <b>bike</b> had a hole in the bottom bracket and the neutral tech support insisting that she couldn't ride it. Her old frame was couriered over with two days to spare. Life in the village was unpleasant due to constant security checks, and athletes who had completed their event partying all night. Lynch moved out and shared accommodation with Jacqui Nelson in a suburb. Whilst this required a two-hour bus ride to the mountain bike venue, it made for a more pleasant stay and sufficient sleep. The mountain bike course overlapped with the equestrian venue and was not open for mountain bike training until two days prior to the race. Lynch ignored this and promptly ran into an American army unit looking for bombs and was arrested. After an hour's detention, one of the mountain bike officials verified that she was a competitor. The race day, 30 July, was the hottest of the Olympic Games, and the [...] laps were reduced to [...] Lynch settled into fifth place in the first lap, but crashed on one of the corners. A few riders went past and she continued in 12th place. In the third lap, the heat became unbearable, but Lynch had a CamelBak with frozen drink; one of the few riders to do so. She kept her pace as other riders struggled. She finished 8th, with two previous world champions behind her (Juli Furtado in 10th, and Silvia Fürst in 16th).|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the overall}} contenders, 's Bradley Wiggins was {{considered}} as the pre-stage favourite, {{but was not}} expected to take the maglia rosa after losing time the previous day into Pescara. Wiggins caught his minute-man Danilo Di Luca (...) {{in the early part}} of the stage, but he had stop several minutes later with a puncture; he threw his bike to the ground, before receiving a <b>new</b> <b>bike</b> from his mechanics. Although he was 52 seconds down on Dowsett at the first split, Wiggins had reduced the gap to just 10 at the finish, which was the closest anyone got to Dowsett. 's Michele Scarponi put in a solid performance to lose just 43 seconds to Wiggins, while the 's Cadel Evans lost 29 to remain 47 seconds ahead of him, in the overall classification. Evans also moved up to second overall, as 's Vincenzo Nibali became the new leader. Nibali went quicker than Dowsett to the first intermediate, but faded in the second portion of the course, finishing fourth on the stage– just behind team-mate Tanel Kangert– losing eleven seconds to Wiggins, but maintained a 1' 16" [...] lead over him overall.|$|E

He got his first top ten result {{of the year in}} the , just short of the podium in fourth position. In March, Voigt participated in Paris-Nice, where he finished second of the prologue and grabbed the yellow jersey after the third stage, which was shortened [...] due to snowfall. He lost the jersey the very next day to eventual winner Alberto Contador, but managed to finish fifth overall after Alejandro Valverde's second place was annulled for his implication in the Operación Puerto doping case. Voigt then headed to the Volta a Catalunya, where he won stage 4 after escaping from the peloton to join a group of four riders on the last ascent of the day. He eventually was left with only Rein Taaramae to worry about, and won the sprint against the [...] rider. In May, he scored a sixth place overall in the Tour of California thanks to consistent placings in the hilly stages and finishing fifth in the individual time trial held in Los Angeles. He participated to the Tour de France as a domestique to his leaders, the Schleck brothers. Voigt survived a scare on the mountainous stage 16, where he crashed heavily on the descent of the Col de Peyresourde, destroying his bike. After getting back up, he realized that all the team cars had passed and that he would not be handed a <b>new</b> <b>bike.</b> Desperate, he borrowed a child's bike much too small for him, from a children group's car which was following the race. He rode on it for about [...] before reaching a policeman who had another bicycle which had been left for him by his team. His teammate Andy Schleck finished the Tour in second place, but was later given the title since the original winner Alberto Contador tested positive to clenbuterol.|$|E
