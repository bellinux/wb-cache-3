25|$|There {{are three}} {{international}} airports in Jamaica with modern terminals, long runways, and the <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment</b> required {{to accommodate the}} large jet aircraft used in modern and air travel: Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston; Ian Fleming International Airport in Boscobel, Saint Mary Parish; and the island's largest and busiest airport, Sir Donald Sangster International Airport in the resort city of Montego Bay. Manley and Sangster International airports are home to the country's national airline, Air Jamaica. In addition there are local commuter airports at Tinson Pen (Kingston), Port Antonio, and Negril, which cater to internal flights only. Many other small, rural centres are served by private fields on sugar estates or bauxite mines.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 1948 the new Stockholm was {{delivered}} to SAL. She set out on her maiden voyage from Gothenburg to New York on 21 February 1948. When the Stockholm entered service, the Drottningholm was transferred to South Atlantic Lines (a subsidiary of SAL) and renamed SS Brazil for traffic with Home Lines. Between 18 December 1949 and 14 February 1950 the Gripsholm was rebuilt at Howaldtswerke, Kiel with amongst others new funnels, a new bow and modern <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment.</b> In March 1950 the company placed an order for a new combined cruise ship/ocean liner with De Schelde shipyard at Vlissingen, Netherlands.

5000|$|Regulus was {{designed}} to be 30 ft long, 10 ft in wingspan, 4 ft in diameter, and would weigh between 10000 and 12000 lb. After launch, it would be guided toward its target by two control stations, usually submarines with guidance equipment. (Later, with the [...] "Trounce" [...] system (Tactical Radar Omnidirectional Underwater <b>Navigational</b> Control <b>Equipment),</b> one submarine could guide it). Army-Navy competition complicated both the Matador's and the Regulus' developments. The missiles looked alike and used the same engine. They had nearly identical performances, schedules, and costs. Under pressure to reduce defense spending, the United States Department of Defense ordered the Navy to determine if Matador could be adapted for their use. The Navy concluded that the Navy's Regulus could perform the Navy mission better.|$|R
25|$|A science {{documentary}} by EBS {{has revealed}} that Chang Bogo-class submarines undergo major generational overhaul and refit every eight to twelve years. The overhaul and refit involves periodic cutting, complete disassembly, and rewelding of the hull for the upgrade or total replacement of the submarine's old engines, <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment,</b> batteries, and other essential equipment with their modern counterparts. Hull stretch may also {{have taken place in}} some of the Chang Bogo-class vessels since the early 2000s, but it has neither been completely confirmed nor denied. Some Chang Bogo-class vessels are demonstrated to have sub-Harpoon launching capability when previously the class was lacking it. ROKN is committed to build and maintain a submarine force of 26 attack submarines until 2025, excluding small and midget submarines, though {{it is not clear how}} many submarines among those will belong to the Chang Bogo class. The oldest commissioned Chang Bogo class submarine by then will be 32 years old.|$|E
25|$|After delivery, Irma {{served on}} the BergenNewcastle route until she was {{transferred}} to Norway {{in the autumn of}} 1921 to carry out tourist voyages to the North Cape and Spitsbergen in the summer seasons. In 1927, she was put on the NorwayHamburg route, replacing SS Neptun and SS Mira. A new heating system was installed in 1913 and wireless radio in 1914. Irma had a new streamlined rudder put in place in 1928. In 1931, she joined the Hurtigruten route in Norway, replacing SS Hera after the latter's shipwreck in March that year. Irma was rebuilt that year and once again the year after that. In a series of upgrades she received a refrigeration system in 1933, improved <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment</b> in 1938 and an echo sounding device in 1939. Irma was a very popular ship amongst her passengers, with her smoking salon receiving particular praise. She had only one serious accident in the pre-war years, which occurred when she hit a reef off Kabelvåg in the Lofoten islands in 1937. Although suffering leaks in her port side, Irma managed to make port in Kabelvåg and put ashore all of her 120 passengers. Repairs were carried out at a shipyard in Bergen.|$|E
500|$|Neither Romania nor Albania {{took part}} in the invasion. Soviet command refrained from drawing upon East German troops for fear of {{reviving}} memories of the Nazi invasion in 1938. During the invasion by the Warsaw Pact armies, 72Czechs and Slovaks were killed (19 of those in Slovakia), 266 severely wounded and another 436 slightly injured. Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. Nevertheless, there was scattered resistance in the streets. Road signs in towns were removed or painted over—except for those indicating the way to Moscow. Many small villages renamed themselves [...] "Dubcek" [...] or [...] "Svoboda"; thus, without <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment,</b> the invaders were often confused.|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{changing}} operational environment, the Ministry of Supply started work with English Electric in 1955, attempting to define a new light bomber to replace the Canberra.

Implementation by the regional airline industry of cockpit {{resource management}}, designed to deal with human interactions problems in the most cost effective manner, is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Until the mid-1980s, {{the runway}} was a grass strip. This was {{replaced}} by a hard surface runway with temporary buildings. The airport started operations in 1986 and was developed with funds and assistance from the Government of Ireland, private investors, Donegal County Council, the International Fund for Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund. In the 1990s the runway was extended to 1500 m and a new terminal building with modern <b>navigational</b> aids and <b>equipment</b> was added.|$|R
500|$|The [...] boat {{journey to}} South Georgia, {{described}} by polar historian Caroline Alexander {{as one of}} the most extraordinary feats of seamanship and navigation in recorded history, took 17days through gales and snow squalls, in seas which the [...] navigator, Frank Worsley, described as a [...] "mountainous westerly swell". After setting off on 24 April 1916 [...] with just the barest <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment,</b> they reached South Georgia on 10 May 1916. Shackleton, in his later account of the journey, recalled Crean's tuneless singing at the tiller: [...] "He always sang when he was steering, and nobody ever discovered what the song was... but somehow it was cheerful".|$|E
500|$|On October 7, 1960 Edward M. Cotter {{came to the}} aid of {{firefighting}} {{authorities in}} Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada. Two days previously, on October 5, 1960, a set of grain elevators caught fire at the eight-story Maple Leaf Milling Company. The Port Colborne Fire Department did not have its own fireboat and they were unable to bring the fire under control. The Buffalo Fire Department was asked to send Edward M. Cotter to lend assistance. Escorted by a United States Coast Guard cutter, because she had never needed <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment</b> of her own, Edward M. Cotter proceeded across the international border. [...] The voyage to Port Colborne took two hours with an additional four hours needed to bring the fire under control. This mission {{is said to have been}} the first instance that a United States fire boat had crossed an international border to help authorities in another country.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the ship}} the second officer is the officer that works under the Master, i.e. the Captain {{of the ship}} and {{shoulders}} the responsibility of checking the functionality of all the <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment,</b> such as the Echo-sounder, Radar, ECDIS, AIS, and on some vessels even the GMDSS radio equipment, however recently it has been observed that Companies tend to designate the responsibility of maintaining the GMDSS equipment to the third officer. These checks are made in according to the companies planned maintenance system. In addition these checks are usually made prior to arrival and departure ports. Often if any <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment</b> is suspected of being faulty then it should be checked that the equipment is in working order as per the given performance standards.|$|E

2500|$|To a {{much greater}} degree than other {{regional}} airports in the area, Anda was subject to severe wind, frequently canceling flights. This was {{in part due to}} severe turbulence during the landing. Combined with poor navigation, this caused several near-accidents. This caused additional <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment</b> to be installed. The airport has had much lower regularity than the other airports in the county.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, it {{functioned as}} an astronomical (celestial) navigational guide and {{reference}} mark for mariners, who calibrated their <b>navigational</b> <b>equipment</b> by referencing the islet on long Atlantic crossings. [...] Its unique geological formation also attracted visitors travelling between Europe and America, intersecting here {{on their way}} to the ports of Lajes or Santa Cruz ports of Flores Island. The steep rock slopes of the islet and shoreline served as shelter from strong offshore gales.|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} of the assigned air combat groups began in May 1942 with the shipment by fast troopships (usually former ocean liners) of their ground echelons. The {{movement of}} their aircraft began in June after {{the decision was made}} that the most efficient and rapid buildup could be made by having the groups themselves ferry their planes overseas. Fighters, having only a single crewman and not equipped with proper <b>navigational</b> and communications <b>equipment</b> for trans-oceanic flights, were to be divided into flights of four and escorted by single bombers navigating the route for them.|$|R
5000|$|These {{vessels are}} usually less sturdy than ships {{built for the}} open seas, with limited <b>navigational</b> and rescue <b>equipment,</b> as {{they do not have}} to survive the high winds or large waves {{characteristic}} to large lakes, seas or oceans. They can thus be built from light composite materials. They are limited in size by width and depth of the river as well as the height of bridges spanning the river. They can be designed with shallow drafts, as were the paddle wheel steamers on the Mississippi River that could operate in water under two metres deep.|$|R
