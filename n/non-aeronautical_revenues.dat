Airports are now routinely targeting non-aeronautical revenue streams amounting to 40-60% of their total revenues. Industry leaders and researchers share best practices on <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> for airports at conferences and in literature, including refereed literature.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the impact of low cost {{carriers}} (LCCs) on <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> in 26 UK airports from 1999 to 2008. Increasingly <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> have become an important source for airport revenue. Our literature review highlights that there is little consensus in empirical results concerning LCC impact on <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues,</b> some of these report positive impact while others show negative impact. We estimate a non-aeronautical revenue function which includes frequency share of LCC, Air Transport Movements (ATMs), number of passengers and population of hinterland of each observed airports as explanatory variables. In addition to this, we produce marginal revenue estimates for both the case of capacity constrained and capacity unconstrained circumstance in airports. As a result, in the case of a non-capacity constrained airport, on average, the marginal revenue of an additional LCC ATM is £ 147 while for non-LCC ATM it is £ 226. On the other hand, in the case of a capacity constrained airport, on average, substituting one non-LCC ATM with an LCC ATM reduces revenue by £ 79...|$|E

The revenue generated from non-aeronautical activities has become increasingly interesting solution of revenue gener¬ation for airports. In this context, this paper presents some preliminary findings of an econometric study aiming at estimating the impacts of <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues.</b> According to the results, non-aeronautical revenue accounted for 54 percent compared with total operating revenue. Passenger movement, passenger terminal area, car park¬ing capacity and retail/duty-free (located in the departures area of the terminal, after security control) are of the most important factors that affect the non-aeronautical revenue...|$|E
40|$|Most {{airports}} internationally {{have implemented}} customer satisfaction programs into their operations to increase <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues.</b> In the US, taxicabs are an essential airport transport mode given the limited public transport options available. Effective airport taxicab planning can increase airport customer satisfaction levels, {{as well as}} facilitate handling increased airport passenger volumes. However, little is known on how US airports have adapted their governance practices from a traditional hierarchical to a network approach {{in their efforts to}} undertake airport taxicab planning initiatives since the deregulation of the transportation industry. Data acquired from 51 US hub airports is used to examine their existing taxicab planning practices. The findings offer how US airports can modify governance processes in their airport taxicab planning processes to better support increases in the customer satisfaction levels of airport taxicab patrons...|$|E
40|$|This report aims to {{describe}} how companies are estimating airports’ value through mathematical models in excel. After a brief presentation {{of the company and}} the business unit that I joined during my internship I present you an overview of project finance transactions. Then, I describe step by step all the analysis realized in the framework of airports’ due diligence process and how we integrate the information kept in the model. There are five elements that should never be neglected in a due diligence task because they are crucial for the airport’s valuation: traffic, aeronautical revenues, <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues,</b> operational expenses and capital investments. Once all these information investigated one by one, I proceed with the explication of the valuation methodology and the impact of the cost of equity calculation on it. I finally conclude by outlining how an airport valuation can affect the airport itself and its future economic development...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of global civil aviation industry, {{the significance of}} <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> has become increasingly evident from the 1990 s. Nowadays, many airports are focusing on being more creative with <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenue.</b> According to the latest statistics, the world’s <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> occupies about 45. 8 % of the total revenue with 7. 2 % of the annual rate of growth, (ACI, 2015). Therefore, to examine the significant role of the non-aeronautical activities for international hub airports in a multi-view, thus to make practical recommendations accordingly will be worthy for the future development of these airports. This study consists of methods of literature review, case study, survey, and professional interview. Through carrying out a desktop research by literature review to gain an insight into current world’s non-aeronautical activities. And through a case study to reveal the current situation of worldwide international hub airports in a large extent, {{which is based on}} the historical statistics of six target at-grade international hub airports worldwide. Moreover, by conducting a passenger survey in HKIA to gain an insight into the current situation of passenger satisfaction in international hub airports. And by conducting two professional interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of the current situation of non-aeronautical activities in international hub airports, and the views also is a guidance for making relevant recommendations. Based on the multi-angle the combined results of this study, this dissertation concludes the increasingly significant role of non-aeronautical activities in the development of international hub airports to a large extent.

5000|$|The strongest area {{of income}} for SGF is from <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> {{activities}} including parking and rental cars. This is followed by fuel sales, terminal fees and landing fees. Parking income has been the strongest {{for the past year}} and has followed enplanement trends with a drop in revenues in FY 2008, and increasing again in FY 2010, with the highest level to date at more than $2.5 million. [...] Personnel is the largest expenditure for the airport, this major operating expense is increasing per year and remains the highest by a very large margin. Additionally, an expense that sticks out is a sharp increase in contractual series between FY 2011 and FY 2012. An assumption can be made that the Airport is beginning preparations regarding the airport issue and alternative discussed in this paper.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model for}} the economic value of extra capacity at an airport. The model is based on a series of functional relationships linking the benefits of extra capacity and the associated costs. It takes into account the cost of delay for airlines and its indirect consequences on the airport, through the loss or gain of aeronautical and <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues.</b> The model is highly data-driven and to this end a number of data sources have been used. In particular, special care has been used {{to take into account the}} full distribution of delay at the airports rather than its average only. The results with the simple version of the model show the existence of a unique maximum for the operating profit of the airport in terms of capacity. The position of this maximum is clearly dependent on the airport and also has an interesting behaviour with the average number of passenger per aircraft at the airport and the predictability of the flight departure times. In addition, we also show that there exists an important trade-off between an increased predictability and the punctuality at the airport. Finally, it is shown that a more complex behavioural model for passengers can introduce several local maxima in the airport profit and thus drive the airport towards suboptimal decisions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAirport {{locations}} are increasingly {{the place of}} non-aeronautical activities. This is driven by airport operators seeking <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues</b> and real estate investors attempting to profit from major airports as high value locations. The resulting higher densities lead to more travel {{to and from the}} location. Travellers induced by non-aeronautical activity are likely to behave different than those induced by aeronautical activity. Consequently, there are potentially not only more, but also more public transport prone travellers. This can improve the viability of operating high quality public transport services. However, as demand of the different traveller groups is likely distributed differently, it also needs to be studied whether the superimposed demand affects the peaking behaviour of travel demand in a beneficial, balancing, or negative, exacerbating, way. For the analysis, an iterative reduction procedure is proposed that begins with a network of highest quality services. Considering demand elasticity and minimum loads to viably operate a service, network elements are degraded and demand is recalculated iteratively until only viable services remain. This procedure is applied to a case study of Zurich, where large scale commercial activities and a public transport hub are located at the airport. It was found that the non-aeronautical development already contributes decisively to public transport use and without it, severe service reductions might be necessary. Furthermore, the compound demand distribution is more even than that of the individual traveller groups, resulting in a landside transport hub that can be operated more efficiently than facilities in conventional locations. Future growth of the airport location will increase this effect and further service expansions may become an attractive option. It is concluded that the high connectivity of airport locations is an opportunity to drive development patterns conducive to public transport use. In addition, airports can be efficient locations for transfer centres as there, if their {{locations are}} suitable, sustained high demand with less variation throughout a day allows for a better utilisation of services and facilities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} airport {{shopping}} behaviour of travellers in a departure lounge {{with the major}} aim of providing a basis for future airport marketing activities. Due to {{the increasing number of}} privatisations of airports profit maximization has been gaining in importance. This can be more easily achieved by concentrating on nonaeronautical income than aeronautical income, as these are more manageable by an airport itself. One main source of income is made up of airport retailing. Customers need to get a business’ full attention. Airport managers thus need to concentrate on their passengers in order to improve <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenues.</b> Understanding their needs and desires helps to effectively develop marketing strategies, which help to increase commercial income. The dissertation focuses on main influences on airport shopping behaviour including purchase involvement levels, impulse buying as the main purchasing behaviour at an airport as well as tourist behaviour at an airport. A review of the literature on airport development and airport shopping behaviour will be supported by data gained from primary research in terms of intercept surveys in the departure lounge of Birmingham Airport. The findings revealed that most purchases made at the airport were of a low involvement nature. Furthermore, most purchases were also made due to impulse buying including planned impulse purchases. It is however, debatable in how far impulse buying behaviour and involvement levels relate to each other. A special tourist behaviour at an airport could not be exposed. Nevertheless, it is still an important topic that should be further examined as most of the leisure travellers were already in a holiday mood before they arrived at their destination. If tourist behaviour has an influence on airport shopping airport marketing managers should focus on making their holidays already start at the airport. Another issue to elaborate on is the effective use of the tool of sales promotion in an airport in order to reach consumers and increase non-aeronautical income...|$|E
25|$|AIAL enjoys diverse revenue streams, and {{operates}} a 'dual-till' approach, whereby its finances are split into aeronautical and non-aeronautical balance sheets. Aeronautical income {{is derived from}} airfield charges, terminal services charge and the airport development charge (or departure fee). <b>Non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> comes from its significant property portfolio, car park, and retail income. Income from the non-aeronautical {{side of the business}} accounts for just over half of its revenue. The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high landing charges. However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand. Further research by aviation consultants Airbiz conducted in August 2010 indicates that Auckland Airport domestic landing charges are amongst the lowest in Australasia.|$|R
40|$|The period 2003 - 08 is {{characterized}} in India as very promising for air transport, while the recent recession {{has put it}} under distress. However, the Indian Government has taken a decision, to modernize 32 non-metro airports and renovate 125 un-utilized regional airports, as well as introducing in the future, production of smaller capacity aircraft, there by to boost civil aviation industry. This paper will focus on these developments and a need for feeder and short-haul regional air transport network and its operational sustainability. Regional air services can augment better connectivity and will bring air connectivity into a reality, thereby help in further growth of aviation and economy because of multiplier effects (benefits) associated with air transport. The existing common phenomenon of small ratio of air time to total journey time taken to accomplish the short-haul air travel needs to be looked into by improving ground accessibility to/from existing and proposed new airports with rapid high capacity surface transport. The logistics, feeding each mode is necessary to perform a seamless journey and to promote ‘sustainable transport system that meets the transport and other needs of the present without compromising {{the ability of the}} future generations to meet their needs’. This paper addresses the following ‘emerging issues’ having effects and impacts on feeder and short-haul regional air transport operations; (i) economic-political scenario and driving forces of air travel demand in recent days, (ii) multi-modal transport and challenges associated with short-haul air travel for seamless journey, (iii) aviation infrastructure, emerging concept of airport city/ Aerotropolis, and human resources development (iv) regulatory and policy intervention, (v) tourism development/ leisure travel, low-cost fares, etc. Further, the paper elaborates the following ‘future perspectives’, which are prudent to the success of feeder and short haul regional air systems and to establish sustainable civil aviation growth; (i) rationalization of (a) air networks, (b) air transport demand modeling (c) MRO services, (d) air traffic management, (e) air fares in commensurate with the taxing policies of ATF, (ii) Bench mark to define hierarchy of air transport and its sustainability, (iii) encompassing renewed business models to (a) airline operations, (b) generate <b>non-aeronautical</b> <b>revenue</b> to minimize local impacts of air transport etc. This type of studies {{is expected to be a}} complement to strengthen academic pursuit and research efforts to make feeder and short-haul air transport more attractive with a viable network structure, regulatory and pricing policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the airport business is demonstrated by airports that are adopting new business strategies and commercial models, which allow them to be, for example, service providers instead of real-estate managers, with the focus on cost reduction and increasing <b>non-aeronautical</b> (commercial) <b>revenues.</b> Information technology (IT) {{can be used by}} airports to achieve their business goals, such as enhancing performance by delivering cost reductions and generating additional revenue streams. Airports operate in an increasingly competitive and dynamic market, with the aim of attracting a larger share of hub traffic from neighbouring airports. Therefore, financial and operational performance will be key elements for airlines when choosing a new airport destination. The research shows that airports are more focused on passenger satisfaction, resulting in airport performance indicators that have the passenger at its operational core and performance targets (e. g. Airport Service Quality passenger satisfaction survey). IT {{plays an important role in}} increasing airport performance through the automation of processes such as the deployment of common-use check-in desks and self-service check-in kiosks. Studies of other industries have shown evidence that IT impacts firm performance, but there have been few studies related to the airport industry. Thus, the aim of this research is to assess the relationship between IT and airport performance, and it proposes a conceptual framework to assess the relationship between IT and airport performance by drawing from studies in other industries. Two methodologies were used in this research, the first one was the case study, and the second one was the online survey. The case studies consisted of 16 faceto- face interviews with senior staff representing two airports in Asia, one airport in Australia, and one airport in Europe. The case studies result show that there is a relationship between IT and airport performance [...] . [cont. ]...|$|R
