40|$|The {{growth in}} ethical {{consumption}} behaviour and {{greater interest in}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> from a production side provides grounding {{for the emergence of}} a new consumer market for <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> To date, however, most studies in this field focus on the production end of the emerging market, with little exploration of the consumers. Of the work, there is on <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption; the majority discuss perceptions of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> by the general population, with little work sampling actual consumers of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the values and motivations underpinning actual <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption. Thirty-nine in-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of frequent sustainable clothing consumers. The study follows a means-end theory approach linking purchased products back to purchasing criteria and personal values. This study therefore contributes to the overall understanding of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption and gives insights into purchasing criteria and behavioural choices of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumers...|$|R

Present Western fashion industry is characterized by unsustainable consumption, where consumers’ urge {{to keep up with}} fast-changing trends using cultural and symbolic meanings prevents more <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption development. We study how <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> branding is used in consumers’ ongoing identity creation processes and how such branding can set coordinates for consumer action that guide towards more <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption. The findings and analysis are based on a qualitative method where phenomenological interviews seek to capture consumers’ first-hand experiences of consuming a <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> brand. The study shows the importance of considering how consumers’ varying perspectives of a <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> brand leads them to view, use and consume the brand in different ways. The study also shows {{that it is possible to}} drive more <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption by providing consumers with a brand-controlled set of coordinates that generates and facilitates more sustainable consumption.

40|$|Sustainability is {{an issue}} that has become {{increasingly}} important in recent years as a result of increasing consumer and industry awareness of social and environmental issues. Fashion retailers have utilised that growing awareness to market sustainable products to consumers. However, research has indicated that young consumers have are not been engaged with these products. In particular, young consumers appeared to lack knowledge in relation to <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Nevertheless, as fashionable and environmentally aware individuals, young consumers have been identified as a group that has great promise for engagement with sustainable consumption. Despite demonstrating potential as <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumers, it appears that there are numerous barriers that have negatively affected the attitude of young consumers towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Consequently, this study aims to explore the attitudes of young consumers towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> The research investigates the understanding of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> from the perspective of young consumers, as well as the influences and perceived barriers towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Analysis of the current literature on the topic revealed that {{there was a lack of}} research exploring the attitudes of young consumers from a qualitative perspective. Therefore, the study was approached qualitatively, with data gathered from semi-structured interviews with 10 participants aged 18 - 25. Interpretation of the findings revealed a lack of knowledge and awareness surrounding <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> had limited their engagement with <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> beyond second hand and vintage clothing. Overall the key barriers that were highlighted through thematic analysis were lack of awareness, price and fashion concern. Participants suggested memorable advertising and appealing to their personal style would positively influence their attitude and potentially encourage them to purchase <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> The findings did appear to contradict literatures which suggested that young consumers are both fashion and environmentally aware. Despite this, on the whole it appeared that participants had a positive attitude towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion,</b> particularly relating to recycled clothing. The research provided a current and deeper insight into the perceived barriers and how the participants suggested that these barriers could be addressed.

40|$|Aim of the Study. Activists and {{scholars}} have called attention for more ethical awareness regarding {{the production of}} clothing (e. g., Arrigo, 2013; Clark, 2008). Harmful production processes cause considerable damage to the environment (Shen, 2014) and are often used to manufacture so-called fast fashion clothing that is highly popular among young women (Morgan & Birtwistle, 2009). An alternative <b>fashion</b> style is <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> that is produced in a socially, ethically and environmentally fair and responsible manner (Joergens, 2006). Despite of the clear advantages of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> for the environment and labor forces working for these brands, <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> is not so popular (Niinimäki, 2010). The current study among young adults is the first study to explore the potential of social media and magazines to increase the popularity of ethical fashion. In contrast to earlier studies (Bhardwaj & Fairhurst, 2010), we applied a consumer-driven perspective (Gabrielli, Baghi, & Codeluppi, 2013) and introduced an explanatory model from health sciences, the integrative model of behavioral prediction (Fishbein, Hennessy, Yzer, & Douglas, 2003; Fishbein & Yzer, 2003), to explain the consumption of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Based on this theoretical framework and empirical research testing this theory (e. g., Beullens & Vandenbosch, 2016; Fishbein, 2000; Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, & Berry, 2005), we predicted that exposure to media messages containing fashion information (i. e., exposure to social media and magazines) predicted a set of cognitions (i. e., attitudes toward <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion,</b> descriptive/subjective norms about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> and self-efficacy beliefs towards buying <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion)</b> that would explain individuals’ intention to engage in that behavior (e. g., the intention to buy <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion).</b> As fashion magazines and social media channels hosted by fast fashion brands favor fast fashion clothing and its production processes (Engholm & Hansen-Hansen, 2014; Rocamora, 2012), we predicted that these media suggest ethical fashion behavior is unnecessary and less socially desirable, and, as such, would relate negatively to positive attitudes, norms and efficacy beliefs about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> behavior and the intention to buy such clothing. In contrast, <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> channels on social media and magazines specialized in environmental topics {{can be expected to}} critically discuss the ethical component of fashion and to promote <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> (Shen, Zheng, Chow, & Chow, 2014). As such, we expected that media users exposed to these media sources would hold more favorable cognitionsattitudes, norms and efficacy beliefs toward <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> and have a higher purchase intention. Methods & Results. Cross-sectional study data collected among 681 young adults (18 - 26 years old) were analyzed by using the conditional process analysis of Hayes's OLS regression based tool PROCESS (Hayes, 2013). All analyses controlled for gender, fashion consciousness and prior involvement in sustainable organizations. Results indicated that exposure to social media content on <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> was a positive predictor of attitudes ( =. 27, LLCI/ULCI=. 16 /. 38), subjective norms (=. 21, LLCI/ULCI=. 15 /. 27), descriptive norms ( =. 07, LLCI/ULCI =. 04 /. 10) and self-efficacy beliefs ( =. 13, LLCI/ULCI =. 09 /. 17) about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Specialized magazines appeared were not related to these cognitions. Exposure to social media content on fast fashion negatively predicted attitudes ( = -. 22, LLCI/ULCI = -. 37 /-. 08), subjective norms ( = -. 17, LLCI/ULCI =-. 25 /-. 10), descriptive norms ( = -. 06, LLCI/ULCI =-. 10 /-. 02) and self-efficacy beliefs ( =-. 13, LLCI/ULCI = -. 18 /-. 08) about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Surprisingly, fashion magazines positively predicted self-efficacy ( =. 14, LLCI/ULCI=. 05 /. 23), but not attitudes or norms. Furthermore, attitudes ( =. 05, LLCI/ULCI =. 02 /. 07), descriptive norms ( =. 24, LLCI/ULCI =. 13 /. 35) and self-efficacy beliefs ( =. 16, LLCI/ULCI=. 08 /. 24) about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> predicted the intention to buy <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Subjective norms did not predict the intention. Conclusion. Our results suggest that social media content about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> supports the adoption of positive cognitions about <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion,</b> while social media content about fast fashion discourages the adoption of such cognitions. Fashion magazines played a surprising positive role in young adults’ ethical fashion buying intentions. A possible explanation could be that fast fashion chains (e. g., H&M) recently have started to invest in <b>sustainable</b> clothing lines. <b>Fashion</b> magazines report about this fashion trend and may, as such, promote a sustainable lifestyle. The findings further demonstrate the value of the integrative model to explain links between media use and <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> behavior by the cognitive processes of attitudes, norms and self-efficacy beliefs. We thus support Fishbein and Yzer’s claim (2003) that the model has explantory value to not only predict health behaviors, but also consumption behaviors. Lastly, <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> brands {{should be aware of the}} potential that social media offer to promote their clothing. Our descriptive results also showed that young consumers are rarely exposed to such media content. As such, ethical fashion companies are encouraged to develop a strategy to attract more young social media users as followers of their social media pages. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{investigation was}} to gain an insight into and understanding of young women’s attitudes and behaviours towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption. In doing so, the researcher sought to explore its potential through behavioural change amongst these young women. For {{the purpose of this}} study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with young female fashion consumers living in Germany during June 2013. The regional focus of the study was on the city of Münster and its surroundings. Research participants belonged to the age group of 20 - 26, whereas most of the interviewees were students with an average age of 24 years. Through a combination of purposive sampling and snowball sampling, a final sample size of ten research participants was achieved following the concept of theoretical saturation. Data analysis was based on thematic analysis through the application of the framework approach. Five core concepts with several overarching metathemes emerged from the research. First, respondents appeared to acknowledge unsustainable fashion consumption within our society while holding fashion retailers and the government responsible for increased levels of fashion consumption. Second, attitudes towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption were multifaceted. However, a general market potential for the consumption of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> was reflected in the respondents’ accounts. Third, several influencing factors on <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption were identified amongst research participants, whereas promotional, social and emotional factors as well as the level of information provision and influence of celebrities seemed to be most relevant. Fourth, facilitating conditions of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption manifested themselves most strongly in terms of a general low availability and affordability of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> Finally, behaviours towards <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption were mixed. While most interviewees showed relative sustainable behaviours during the use and postuse phases of the consumption process, the pre-purchase and purchase phases have room for improvements. Accordingly, it should be focused on these phases of the consumption process. Based on the research findings, a conceptual model for <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> consumption was proposed as a modification of Triandis’ Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (1977, cited in Jackson, 2005) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explored the}} discursive practices employed by Vogue to construct <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> it its editorials between 1990 - 2013. These discursive practices revealed the ideological stance of Vogue regarding <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion.</b> The research asked: (a) how Vogue explicitly and implicitly defined sustainable, ethical and eco fashion through discursive practice; (b) how it visually illustrated sustainable fashion; (c) how Vogue's <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> discourse changed over time; and (d) how Vogue's inclusion of sustainability challenged or supported its {{position of power}} in the industry. A discourse-historical approach explored how Vogue's conception of <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> changed over time. Additionally, thirty-seven "Style Ethics" editorials were examined using Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA). References to sustainably minded values and actions were found throughout the twenty-three years analyzed, though these were in direct competition with the dominant discourse of the 'new'. Though Vogue periodically engaged the works of a handful of designers and activists striving for better products and practices, it rarely discussed the issues that led to their necessity, particularly ignoring labor issues. By co-opting preexisting nomenclature of sustainability without formally defining the concepts, Vogue was able to appropriate incongruous terminology into the discourse on fashion. Vogue relied heavily on stereotypical imagery to demarcate sections featuring sustainable goods. Over time, the <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> discourse was dismantled, neutralized and appropriated; presented as one option among many. Furthermore, the few sustainably minded goods and services that were included were undermined by the magazine's general emphasis on the 'new'...|$|R

30|$|This text {{provided}} an overview for ethics in the <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> field. It was grounded on environmental ethics and value discussion in it. As Ehrenfeld (2015, 61, based on Rittel and Webber 1973) argues ‘solutions for wicked {{problems are not}} true-or-false but good-or-bad’, which grounds the discussion in sustainable design on ethics, moral and values. Moreover, {{he points out that}} each ‘implemented solution to a wicked problem has consequences’. <b>Sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> is a wicked problem: there is no simple truth how to make things better or right, but only different approaches to improve the current situation. Values and ethics are fundamental grounds also for <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion,</b> and they might help to widen the discussion and seeing problem areas more holistically and further to include the ethical dimension more tightly to discussion. Ethics is the ground for making choices in the sustainable design and manufacturing and even while considering the business models and profit-making options. It is worthwhile to investigate the value base in <b>sustainable</b> <b>fashion</b> and further to consider the consequences of our design and industrial manufacturing processes for the environment, human health and for societies.|$|R
