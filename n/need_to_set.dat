5|$|Hanley council made {{a formal}} {{proposal}} in 1902 to the Local Government Board {{for the expansion}} of the County Borough of Hanley to include not only Stoke, Burslem, Longton, Fenton and Tunstall but also Smallthorne Urban District, Wolstanton Rural District, and the parishes of Milton, Goldenhill, Chell, Trentham, Stoke Rural, Caverswall and Stone. Only Longton council supported the idea as concurrently, Sir Hugh Owen, a former secretary to the Local Government Board, presented the six towns committee with a scheme of financial adjustment. Under this proposal, the net assets of each town would be calculated by deducting outstanding debts and liabilities from the values of its various properties. The proportion each town needed to contribute to the overall value of the county borough was then to be calculated. If the value of the net assets to be contributed by a town was less than the proportion calculated as due from that town towards the overall sum, then that town would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a higher general rate to be paid by the ratepayers of that town. Conversely, towns contributing a value of net assets greater than their proportion of the overall sum would be able to set a lower general rate. While five of the towns awaited a report from Alderman Frederick Geen of Stoke on the implications of the Owen proposal, Fenton immediately decided that it would impose undue financial hardship on the ratepayers of the district as the net assets of the district would show a deficiency and therefore a higher rate would have to be set. Fenton district council could not accept such a move and withdrew from all discussions on federation forthwith. Geen's July 1903 report increased opposition to the idea of federation while a poll of ratepayers in Burslem came out strongly against federation. Burslem council then withdrew from the scheme to be followed shortly afterwards by Stoke. Faced by such strong opposition, Hanley council felt compelled to withdraw its submission to the Local Government Board bringing the first attempt at federation in the twentieth century to an unsuccessful conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Watch – A {{watch is}} used when {{the risk of}} a {{hazardous}} weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, or timing is still uncertain.

People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.

Critics have argued that reinstating women’s softball in the 2016 Olympic Games would be a huge step towards gender equality, and they also suggest requiring each event at the Games to have a women equivalent, not just each sport. For example, if there are 10 men’s boxing events, there should also be 10 women’s boxing events. They believe that this is necessary because the Olympic Games <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a high standard for sports programs and countries around the world to follow.|$|E

The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble was opened on 8 February 1916 with 48 day girls and 86 boarders. Marden became the Principal of both schools. The opening of the Pymble campus necessitated a change of name for the Croydon College, from The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney to The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Humphrey McQueen has it {{that working}} and living {{conditions}} for Australia's working classes in the early 20th century were of [...] "frugal comfort." [...] While {{the establishment of the}} Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for industrial disputes was divisive, it was an acknowledgement of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> Industrial awards, where all wage earners in one industry enjoyed the same conditions of employment and wages. The Harvester Judgment of 1907 recognised the concept of a basic wage and in 1908 the Federal government also began an old age pension scheme. Together with the White Australia Policy and pioneering social policy, these developments have since been dubbed the Australian settlement. As a result of them, the new Commonwealth gained recognition as a laboratory for social experimentation and positive liberalism.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{significant}} changes in the location and action of the French version of Lombardi, especially given the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the story for French involvement in the First Crusade of 1095–1099. Characters' names changed from Italian to French and one, Arvino (who was renamed as the Count of Toulouse, though elements of his character were given to the principal tenor role, Gastone) was now a baritone instead of a tenor. Several roles present in the original version were deleted, including the leading tenor role of Oronte. In the restructured libretto, the central romance is given more prominence, and a happier ending. [...] In addition, Verdi added a standard ballet and new music, but re-shaped much of the structure by removing inappropriate material he felt to be weak. [...] As musicologist Roger Parker notes, [...] "only a few of the original numbers [...] in their former positions." [...] Verdi himself described the new work as having [...] "transformed [...] out of recognition".|$|E
2500|$|Legislation will be {{required}} to set in place access to the VII data and communications between applicable agencies. [...] In the USA, for example, an Interstate is a Federal roadway that is often maintained by the State, but the local county or municipal authorities may be involved too. [...] The legislation would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> the levels of authority of each agency. [...] In Pennsylvania, for example, municipalities tend to have greater authority than counties and sometimes even the State whereas neighboring Maryland has more authority at the county level than at municipal level; and State roads are almost exclusively controlled by the State. [...] It would also have to be determined which other agencies can use the data (i.e. law enforcement, Census, etc.) and to what degree it is permissible to use the information. Law enforcement would be needed to minimise data misuse. [...] The various levels of authority could also increase incompatibility.|$|E
2500|$|After {{explaining}} the domestic policies the US should pursue, he discusses foreign policy. He advocates {{a system of}} [...] "triage," [...] such as that suggested by William and Paul Paddock in Famine 1975!. Under this system countries would be divided into categories based on their abilities to feed themselves going forward. Countries with sufficient programmes in place to limit population growth, {{and the ability to}} become self-sufficient in the future would continue to receive food aid. Countries, for example India, which were [...] "so far behind in the population-food game that there is no hope that our food aid will see them through to self-sufficiency" [...] would have their food aid eliminated. Ehrlich argued that this was the only realistic strategy in the long-term. Ehrlich applauds the Paddocks' [...] "courage and foresight" [...] in proposing such a solution. Ehrlich further discusses the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up public education programs and agricultural development schemes in developing countries. He argues that the scheme would likely have to be implemented outside the framework of the United Nations due to the necessity of being selective regarding the targeted regions and countries, and suggests that within countries certain regions should be prioritized to the extent that cooperative separatist movements should be encouraged if they are an improvement over the existing authority. He mentions his support for government mandated sterilization of Indian males with three or more children.|$|E
