40|$|The {{constitutional}} crisis of 2003 was a defining event for Nevada and may prove instructive {{for the rest}} of the nation. Among the prominent features in the topography of the crisis were (1) state constitutional provisions that required two-thirds legislative approval for tax increases but only simple majority approval for spending increases and (2) the State Supreme Court’s decisions in Guinn v. Legislature that ended the immediate impasse. Both are focal points of continuing controversy. Criticism of the Guinn decision has exceeded praise of it – probably in frequency, certainly in passion and rhetorical exuberance. In my view, much of the criticism has been misplaced. At least equal criticism should attach to the State 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional structure. The tension between the supermajority tax provision and the simple majority spending provision was a train-wreck waiting to happen. I am not among the fans of the Guinn decision. I do not think the court made the best decision among the alternatives available to it. Rather, I should say, the court did not make “the least bad decision. ” That more precise phrasing acknowledges the following fact: there was <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> available to the court in the case. Because of the tensions internal to the State Constitution and the impasse into which the political branches of the State government had worked themselves, whatever decision the court made would have entailed harm to some portion(s) of Nevada’s constitutional structure and values. When <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> exists, those with the responsibility to decide deserve more understanding and less rebuke. Part I of this Article briefly describes the facts. Part II explains why, given Nevada’s constitutional structure, the court had no good alternatives in Guinn. Part III considers the supermajority tax provision. It argues that focusing on taxes, instead of on spending, undercuts the educative role that politics can play and ultimately distorts the limited-government agenda the provision was intended to advance...|$|E

It is unilaterally profitable for a seller to deter search under mild conditions, but sellers can suffer when all do so. In a monopoly setting where the buyer has an uncertain outside option, the optimal selling mechanism features both buy-now discounts and deposit contracts.

40|$|Using {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} life cycle model with endogenous labor supply and idiosyncratic risks in both income and medical expenses, {{we argue that}} employment-based health insurance is an important reason why Americans work much more than Europeans. In contrast to Europeans, who get universal health insurance from the gov-ernment, most working-age Americans get health insurance through their employers. Since medical expenses are large and volatile, and there is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> avail-able in the private market, health insurance from employers can be highly valuable to risk-averse individuals (much more than its actuarially fair cost), thus providing them with extra incentive to work.

Furthermore, our model is also consistent with several other relevant empirical observations: (1) the dif-ferences in employment rate and in the shares of full-time/part-time workers, and (2) the labor supply difference by age.

40|$|The {{systematic}} of key cognitive competencies is of high {{scientific and}} societal relevance, {{as is the}} availability of high-quality data on cognitive competencies. In order to make well-informed decisions, politicians and educational authorities need high-quality data {{about the effectiveness of}} formal and non-formal educational environments. Similarly, researchers need strong data to test complex theoretical models about how individual biographies are shaped by the interplay between individual and institutional affordances and constraints. Innumerable data sets offer some form of information on competencies such as respondents' years at school and their school grades. Such data are relatively easy to collect. When it comes to making informed political and educational decisions, however, there are increasing calls for a more systematic use of standardized competence tests. The production, storage, and use of standardized test data on competencies in specific domains is expensive, complex, and time-consuming, however. This chapter argues that there is a paucity of adequate data on cognitive competencies in important domains, especially of longitudinal data from standardized competence tests, and that for many important questions there are <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternatives</b> to high-quality standardized tests of cognitive competencies.

40|$|This {{discussion}} of gender constructs compares them with racial constructs, and examines {{ways in which}} language tends to dichotomize or polarize them, and to reject ambiguity as unacceptable. Other curiosities about sexual categorization are noted, {{including the fact that}} femaleness is subsumed under the category of "man, " which in turn is synonymous with human, but some roles are stereotyped as female only. It is argued that the English language supplies <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternatives</b> to the biologica:. ly-based bipolar construction, and conceptualization follows this pattern. Reliance on certain implicit assumptions: that there are distinct biological sex categories (male and female) and that gender is directly related to sex results in fuzzy conceptualizations of gender. It is noted that some feminist scholarship focuses on diversity among women, not just differences from men. However, little challenge to underlying bipolar assumptions is found in the literature. It is proposed that a useful way of approaching this issue is to pay attention to those people who challenge the biological categories assigned to them or reject the cultural concomitants. Distinctions made between gender assignment (made at birth), gender identity (as expressed both to oneself and to others), gender role, and gender attribution are seen as useful.

Using survey data for city council members in rural Iowa, this dissertation used difference of means tests, cross-tabs and multiple regression modeling (OLS and logistic regression) to compare the responses of male and female town councilors. Scholarship on state legislatures and Congress often find that male and female legislators are different on a number of important demographic and attitudinal variables and many feminists argue that electing more women to office will change the way government institutions work. However, council members are very different from legislators at higher levels of government, and many of the theories developed using data from Congress and state legislators do not apply. Male and female town councilors share many important characteristics and attitudes, with some important exceptions. Women and men in local government are different on many demographic characteristics, in their approach to the delegate-trustee dilemma and regarding the initial motivation to run for office. On occasions where council members disagree with their constituents on policy issues, {{women are more likely to}} be politicos than trustees.

40|$|Observational {{evidence}} {{along with}} theoretical arguments which call for non-baryonic dark matter are reviewed. A brief {{summary of the}} dark matter session is included. There is increasing evidence that relative to the visible matter in the Universe, {{which is in the}} form of baryons, there is considerably more matter in the Universe that we don’t see [1]. Here, I will review some of the motivations for dark matter in the Universe. The best observational evidence is found on the scale of galactic halos and comes from the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies. There is also mounting evidence for dark matter in elliptical galaxies as well as clusters of galaxies coming from X-ray observations of these objects. Also, direct evidence has been obtained through the study of gravitational lenses. In theory, we believe there is much more matter because 1) inflation tells us so (and there is at present <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> to inflation) and 2) our current understanding of galaxy formation only makes sense if there is more matter than we see. One can also make a strong case for the existence of non-baryonic dark matter in particular. The recurrent problem with baryonic dark matter is that not only is it very difficult to hide baryons, but the standard model of primordial nucleosynthesis would have to discarded if all of the dark matter is baryonic. Fortunately, as will be covered at length in these proceedings, there are several attractive alternatives to baryonic dark matter. Before embarking on the subject of dark matter, it will be useful to review the relevant quantities from the standard big bang model.

40|$|Abstract. Most game {{programs}} {{have a large}} number of parameters that are crucial for their performance. While tuning these parameters by hand is rather difficult, efficient and easy to use generic automatic parameter optimisation algorithms are known only for special problems such as the adjustment of the parameters of an evaluation function. The SPSA algorithm (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation) is a generic stochastic gradient method for optimising an objective function when an analytic expression of the gradient is not available, a frequent case in game programs. Further, SPSA in its canonical form is very easy to implement. As such, it is an attractive choice for parameter optimisation in game programs, both due to its generality and simplicity. The goal of this paper is twofold: (i) to introduce SPSA for the game programming community by putting it into a gameprogramming perspective, and (ii) to propose and discuss several methods {{that can be used to}} enhance the performance of SPSA. These methods include using common random numbers and antithetic variables, a combination of SPSA with RPROP, and the reuse of samples of previous performance evaluations. SPSA with the proposed enhancements was tested in some large-scale experiments on tuning the parameters of an opponent model, a policy and an evaluation function in our poker program, MCRAISE. Whilst SPSA with no enhancements failed to make progress using the allocated resources, SPSA with the enhancements proved to be competitive with other methods, including TD-learning; increasing the average payoff per game by as large as 0. 19 times the size of the amount of the small bet. From the experimental study, we conclude that the use of an appropriately enhanced variant of SPSA for the optimisation of game program parameters is a viable approach, especially if <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> exist for the types of parameters considered...|$|E

40|$|The need to {{consider}} using dapsone in pregnant women for its antimalarial activity is becoming greater in areas where Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine is rapidly increasing. Dapsone {{in combination with other}} antimalarials might provide a valuable alternative for both treatment and prophylaxis. This review assesses the clinical pharmacology of dapsone and its adverse drug reactions in relation to haemolysis, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency, blood dyscrasias and methaemoglobinaemia. Studies are summarised reporting its use in leprosy, dermatological and other conditions, and malaria, in relation to maternal and infant outcomes. A total of 924 pregnancies were identified during which dapsone therapy was taken. Only limited data are available and this precludes a meaningful quantitative benefit-risk analysis. Mild degrees of haemolysis consistently occur with continued therapy, although adverse effects may be less likely with intermittent treatment, as most reported adverse effects have occurred with long-term use of dapsone. There are a number of gaps in knowledge where more data are needed. These include no data on pharmacokinetics in pregnancy and whether these are altered with co-administration of chlorproguanil. Potential complications in women with severe anaemia are unknown and there is no information on haemolytic effects in women or the fetus with G 6 PD deficiency. The use of dapsone in HIV-infected women in malarious areas could carry increased risks because of the immunosuppressive actions of the drug. Trials of dapsone therapy in pregnancy should be considered in malarious areas where there is good reason for its deployment. Controlled trials have provided data on maternal tolerance, and dapsone in combination with other antimalarial drugs can offer clear benefit in terms of improved birthweight. The use of dapsone combinations should be considered when <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> is available and the threat of malaria is the greater ris...|$|E
40|$|Federal Courts law {{was once}} a vibrant area of {{scholarship}} and an essential course for intellectually ambitious students. Now its prestige has diminished so much that scholars debate its future {{in a recent issue}} of the Vanderbilt Law Review, where even one of its champions calls it (albeit in the subjunctive mood) a “scholarly backwater. ” What, if anything, went wrong, and what should Federal Courts scholars do about it? In his contribution to the Vanderbilt symposium, Richard Fallon defends the reigning model of Federal Courts law, an approach to jurisdictional issues that dates from the publication in 1953 of Henry Hart and Herbert Wechsler 2 ̆ 7 s casebook, The Federal Courts and the Federal System. In Fallon 2 ̆ 7 s view, nothing went wrong, and in any event there is not much we can do about it. In brief, Fallon argues that with a few adjustments, Federal Courts scholars should continue to work within the model set out by Hart 2 ̆ 6 Wechsler forty years ago, a model that rests upon “the principles and policies underlying federalism and the separation of powers,” and such process values as “reasoned elaboration of principles and policies that are ultimately traceable to more democratically legitimate decisionmakers” and the obligation that judges “be principled in their reasoning. ” He suggests that although the rise of interdisciplinary studies has overshadowed the process-based methodology that characterizes most Federal Courts teaching and scholarship, the traditional approach to Federal Courts still has much to offer. In any event, Fallon suggests, there is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> available for the study of the allocation issues that make up the Federal Courts field. In this article I argue that the “Hart 2 ̆ 6 Wechsler paradigm” (as Fallon calls their model) no longer serves us well either as an account of what the Supreme Court does in Federal Courts cases or as a guide to what the Court ought to do. In its place, I propose a new, more fruitful model for analyzing the normative issues that arise in Federal Courts cases. I call it the “pragmatic paradigm,” because its central feature is the pragmatist precept that no value should be taken as foundational, be it process, federalism, or separation of powers. Rather, the force of any of these values in a given case depends on the arguments that can be mustered in their support, and those arguments will vary in strength depending on context...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} cause one {{in every}} six deaths worldwide. Antimicrobial drugs have helped dramatically in curing patients suffering from bacterial infections. However, emerging antimicrobial resistance in bacteria threatens to undermine the management of bacterial infections. Developing countries have greater burden of infectious diseases. A number of factors, which may promote antimicrobial resistance such as availability of antimicrobials without prescription, use of counterfeit or substandard antimicrobial drugs, suboptimal hygiene, immunosuppression due to malnutrition or HIV, may be more frequent in developing countries. At the same time, consequences of antimicrobial resistance may be felt harder in resource-poor settings, since second-line antimicrobial drugs for resistant bacteria may be unavailable or unaffordable. There are many unresolved questions regarding antimicrobial resistance in general, including regarding its impact on patient outcome. In Sub-Saharan, some studies on antimicrobial resistance have been done, but, by and large, the issue has received far too little attention. We set out to improve available antimicrobial susceptibility data in Tanzania. We implemented a free-of-charge computerized software (WHONET) for resistance surveillance in the University Teaching Hospital in Dar es Salaam. This exercise showed that resistance surveillance is feasible in the setting and provided useful data on antimicrobial resistance. The surveillance data indicated high rates of resistance to common antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. We performed a prospective, observational cohort study of bloodstream infections in 1828 admissions of children with fever or suspected serious infection at the hospital. We performed blood culture, malaria testing and HIV testing and collected clinical data from the study subjects. The study showed that a disturbingly high proportion of Gram-negative bacteria produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), with prevalent genotypes being TEM- 63, SHV- 12 and CTX-M 15. The ESBL-producing bacteria had {{a high rate of}} resistance to almost all other available drugs, except for ciprofloxacin, and bloodstream infection caused by these multiresistant bacteria were associated with extremely high case-fatality rates. The study showed that inappropriate treatment due to antimicrobial resistance, as well as malnutrition and HIV-infection, were risk factors for death in children admitted with bloodstream infections. We investigated an outbreak of pediatric / neonatal meningitis at Haydom Lutheran Hospital, finding that Salmonella serovar Enteritidis, resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to gentamicin, was the cause of the outbreak. Although the numbers were small, the case-fatality rate for meningitis caused by these organisms was 100 % (5 / 5). Antimicrobial resistance varies greatly from one geographical area to another. Thus, data obtained at major hospitals in urban centers may not be representative for the whole country. We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of isolates of uropathogenic bacterial obtained from the urine of pregnant women in a rural area in Northern Tanzania. This study indicated that there is less antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates from this rural area than in isolates from the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam. In formulating guidelines for antimicrobial use this possible rural-urban difference should be taken into account. For some of the bacteria carrying resistance traits for multiple antimicrobials, there are actually <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>alternative</b> drugs available. Based on the findings of these studies, we recommend sober, rational use of antimicrobial drugs, restrictions on sale and use of antimicrobials, and attention to hygiene...|$|E
