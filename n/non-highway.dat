25|$|As secretary, Cunningham {{oversaw the}} design and {{construction}} of the <b>non-highway</b> capital construction projects in Pennsylvania, {{as well as the}} state's minority and women-owned business contracting program and the Bureau of Commonwealth Media Services. Additionally, he served as the state’s real estate agent and insurance broker, and doubled the state's property insurance coverage while reducing premiums nearly by half, saving more than $4 million annually. He also ran the Governor's management and productivity initiative, which saved the state $500 million in operating costs. Cunningham also led initiatives to sell surplus state property, with the intention of saving taxpayer money, putting the properties back onto tax rolls, and creating community and economic development opportunities. He urged local governments and school districts in Pennsylvania to buy equipment from state contracts, thus realizing financial savings, and also consolidated warehouse facilities in Harrisburg from 17 buildings to four, for an annual saving of $4 million. In addition to his secretary position, Cunningham served on the State Public School Building Authority, the Pennsylvania Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the Governor’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, the PENNVEST board, the Capitol Preservation Committee, and the Agricultural Land Preservation Interagency Committee during his time in Rendell's administration.|$|E

30|$|Association {{rule for}} cluster 1 shows that two wheeler {{accidents}} are mainly occurs on specific road segments such as intersections at community areas, i.e., colony, markets and hospitals. Intersections in colonies near highways {{are more prone}} to two wheeler accidents than colonies on <b>non-highways.</b> Also market areas {{are more likely to have}} two wheeler accidents with two or more injuries at evening around 4 : 00  p.m. to 8 : 00  p.m. Rules revealed that hospitals area are also associated with two wheeler accidents but most of the accidents at this place have happened at night time after 8 : 00  p.m.|$|R
30|$|Association {{rules for}} cluster 6 {{indicate}} that vehicle roll-over accidents are occurred {{at night in}} forest area and roads near agriculture land areas. A slope in forest road and a curve on road is the reasons involved in these accidents. A forest road is more prone to vehicle roll-over accidents in night time. Although rules revealed that vehicle roll-over accidents are scattered at every road condition and road type, {{but most of these}} accidents have happened on forest areas and agriculture land areas on both highway and <b>non-highways.</b> Rules shows that UNK road feature are highly involved in this cluster. Our survey reveals that the locations where these accidents occurred were having different size of potholes and bad road surface that probably causes these accidents.|$|R

50|$|A parclo {{interchange}}, {{also known}} as a partial cloverleaf, is an interchange usually involving four to six ramps, two of which are loop ramps, which connect to the <b>non-highway.</b>|$|E

50|$|A single-point urban interchange, often {{abbreviated}} to SPUI, is {{a modification of}} the diamond interchange and has its ramps meet at one point, usually on the overpass/underpass of the <b>non-highway.</b> This requires only one set of traffic signals, increasing its efficiency and capacity when compared to a diamond.|$|E
5000|$|Logging {{trucks are}} {{generally}} given right of way.

50|$|One {{form of the}} {{roundabout}} interchange can be used {{to connect}} a highway with a <b>non-highway.</b> It uses a single roundabout, rotary, or traffic circle which spans the highway as an over/underpass. Such junctions can be improved by adding a flyover for straight-through traffic on the non-freeway, creating the Roundabout interchange.|$|E
50|$|They greatly affect in-town {{movement}} and traffic. Street networks can become very complex in cities. Street networks are very often localized, {{because there is}} little <b>non-highway</b> transportation from town to town. The U.S. Highway System is like a street network, but it is national, and consists of highways instead of streets and roads.|$|E
50|$|A {{diverging}} {{diamond interchange}} (DDI) or double crossover diamond interchange (DCD) {{is similar to}} a traditional diamond interchange, except the <b>non-highway</b> lanes cross each other twice, once {{on each side of the}} highway. This allows all highway entrances and exits to avoid crossing the opposite direction of travel and saves one signal phase of traffic lights each.|$|E

50|$|Autosteer steers the car {{to remain}} in {{whatever}} lane it is in (known as lane-keeping). With HW1, it is also able to safely change lanes as directed by a tap of the turn signal. As of May 2017, HW2 is limited to 90 mph on highway roads and the former 35 mph speed limit on <b>non-highway</b> roads was removed, instead limiting to five over the speed limit or 45 mph if no speed limit is detected.|$|E
50|$|The former Bissell Tavern {{is located}} in {{northern}} Windsor, {{on the east side}} of Palisado Avenue (Connecticut Route 159), south of its junction with Hayden Station Road. Palisado Avenue is the major <b>non-highway</b> north-south route along the west bank of the Connecticut River. The tavern house is a two story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, end chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a four-light transom window. There is a 19th-century porch attached to the south side, and a single-story ell to the rear.|$|E
50|$|In this respect, {{the data}} for fuel energy wasted in braking, rolling resistance, and {{aerodynamic}} drag are all somewhat misleading, {{because they do not}} reflect all the energy that was wasted up to that point in the process of delivering energy to the wheels. The image reports that on <b>non-highway</b> (urban) driving, 6% of the fuel's energy is dissipated in braking; however, by dividing this figure by the energy that actually reaches the axle (13%), one can find that 46% of the energy reaching the axle goes to the brakes. Also, additional energy can potentially be recovered when going down hills, which may not be reflected in these figures.|$|E
50|$|The parclo is a safer {{modification}} of the cloverleaf design. Depending {{on the number of}} ramps used, they take up a moderate to large amount of land and are typically inexpensive to build. Parclos with more ramps have a greater capacity and efficiency than parclos with fewer ramps. Parclos are sometimes called a folded diamond when only four ramps, in two quadrants, are used. If the loop ramps are constructed opposite or mirrored along the highway, weaving is avoided. Cloverleaf interchanges that involve a <b>non-highway</b> can be changed to parclos without too much reconstruction. Although the interchange's capacity is reduced, weaving is eliminated, increasing the safety and efficiency of the interchange.|$|E
5000|$|As some enduro courses have {{portions}} {{on public}} roads {{as well as}} off-road tracks, competitors in such events will need enduro bikes that comply with local registration requirements for on-road use. Modern enduro bikes {{are closely related to}} their MX counterparts, and the manufacturers may state that enduro machines are for <b>non-highway</b> use only. Some countries refuse the registration of enduro bikes for on-highway use unless they are altered to meet local road-legal specifications. However, some enduro bikes, such as the Husqvarna TE250 and some Husabergs are built to comply with on-road requirements, and it is fairly straightforward to register these machines for on-road use [...]|$|E
50|$|The Veterans Memorial Bridge {{now serves}} as the pathway for Route 6 and Route 138 to cross the river into Fall River.

Along with the Braga Bridge, {{it is one of the}} two major crossings of the river. This has led to the bridge having vital importance anytime there is a problem on the Braga; since the northern detour takes approximately twenty miles and the southern detour (over the Mount Hope Bridge and the Sakonnet River Bridge) is over twenty-five miles, it immediately becomes the major path for people coming in and out of the city, and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|In the European Union, the “Euro IV” {{standard}} {{has applied}} since 2005, which specifies {{a maximum of}} 50 ppm of sulfur in diesel fuel for most highway vehicles; ultra-low-sulfur diesel with a maximum of 10 ppm of sulfur must “be available” from 2005 and was widely available as of 2008. In 2009, the Euro V fuel standard came into effect [...] which reduced maximum sulfur to 10 ppm. In 2009, diesel fuel for most <b>non-highway</b> applications {{is also expected to}} conform to the Euro V standard for fuel.

In particular, the so-called EU accession countries (primarily in Eastern Europe), have been granted certain temporary exemptions to allow for transition.|$|E
50|$|For {{several years}} in the early 21st century, a major project of James City County {{officials}} and Supervisor Bruce Goodson, who represents the Roberts Magisterial District, has been to improve US Route 60 between Grove and Newport News to provide better (faster and more direct) access to Interstate 64 from the industrial sites in Grove which generate a considerable volume of truck traffic, and reduce the same on the existing roadway.Access for the industrial traffic to I-64 currently requires a drive of about 4 mi in either direction on two-laned sections of U.S. 60 at <b>non-highway</b> speeds through residential areas, sharing the road with local traffic and school buses serving either the James River Elementary School's county-wide magnet program or alternatively, the large elementary school in the Lee Hall community in neighboring Newport News, as well as school buses for other schools going {{into and out of}} neighborhoods along the route in both communities.|$|E
50|$|Off-road vehicle use {{on public}} land has been criticized by {{some members of the}} US {{government}} and environmental organizations including the Sierra Club and The Wilderness Society. They have noted several consequences of illegal ORV use such as pollution, trail damage, erosion, land degradation, possible species extinction, and habitat destruction which can leave hiking trails impassable. ORV proponents argue that legal use taking place under planned access along with the multiple environment and trail conservation efforts by ORV groups will mitigate these issues. Groups such as the Blueribbon Coalition advocate Treadlightly, which is the responsible use of public lands used for off-road activities.Noise pollution is also a concern, and several studies conducted by Montana State University, California State University, University of Florida and others have cited possible negative behavioral changes in wildlife as the result of some ORV use. Some US states have laws to reduce noise generated by off-road and <b>non-highway</b> vehicles. Washington is one example.|$|E
50|$|Klobuchar {{has been}} an active {{supporter}} of outdoor recreation legislation, including the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) and the Travel Promotion Act. When the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed MAP-21, legislation ending the 1991 user pay-user benefit provision for RTP, trail interests and state park officials warned that the new policy could effectively end the program by relegating recreational trail projects to competition for funding among a broad category of authorized <b>non-highway</b> projects. Klobuchar led efforts to alter the proposal, working closely with recreation interests to develop a floor amendment that would reauthorize the RTP program unchanged. Although she faced bipartisan leadership {{in support of the}} committee’s proposal, Klobuchar managed to secure acceptance of her new language by the legislation’s floor manager, and she won strong bipartisan support for her amendment. The result was Senate passage in early 2012 of new surface transportation legislation, which continued RTP with $85 million in guaranteed annual funds and no significant change in its operations.|$|E
