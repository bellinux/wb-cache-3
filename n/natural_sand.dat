40|$|In this study, {{extender}} and bender element {{tests were}} conducted investigating the small-strain Poisson's ratio of variable sands, {{with a focus on}} the effect of stress anisotropy in order to quantify the sensitivity of Poisson's ratio to the applied deviatoric stress. Four different uniform sands were tested, including a biogenic sand, a crushed rock and two <b>natural</b> <b>sands,</b> covering a wide range of particle shapes. From these sands, eleven samples were prepared in the laboratory and were tested under variable stress paths, maintaining a constant mean effective pressure while increasing the deviatoric compressive load. Under the application of these given stress paths, the data analysis indicated that the sensitivity of Poisson's ratio to the stress ratio was more pronounced for sands with irregularly shaped particles in comparison to sands with fairly rounded and spherical grains. For sands with very irregularly shaped particles, the increase of Poisson's ratio from the isotropic to the anisotropic stress state reached 50 %, while this increase for <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> with fairly rounded particles was in the order of 20 %...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors have}} been {{studying}} the mechanical properties of granulated coal ash formed by the milling process {{with a small amount}} of cement added, with particles almost equivalent in size to sand or fine gravel. The use of granulated coal ash has many advantages, such as the suppression of leaching of heavy metals and the possibility of outdoor curing. In addition, since granulated coal ash is produced artificially, their particle strength can be understood easily. Another advantage is that it is possible to control the particle strength, something which cannot be performed in <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> The present research was carried out in order to investigate the possibility of putting such advantages to good use. Single particle crushing tests were carried out on various kinds of granulated coal ash to evaluate the crushing characteristics of each individual grain. Also, the characteristics of the individual particle, such as shape, were investigated. Next, one-dimensional compression tests were conducted to investigate their compression characteristics. Finally, drained monotonic triaxial compression tests were performed under different confining pressures. The effects of the confining pressure on the shear characteristics, as well as their relation to shear strength, were examined with the single particle crushing strength taken into account. Contrary to observations in <b>natural</b> <b>sands,</b> the single particle crushing strength of granulated coal ash did not depend on particle size. Regarding compression characteristics, granulated coal ash compressed very easily because the crushing strength of a single particle was low. Therefore, the yield stress of granulated coal ash was found to be smaller than that of <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> Moreover, the crushing strength affected the shear characteristics, i. e., as the crushing strength increased, the shear stiffness became higher and the compressive volumetric strain became smaller. Therefore, crushing strength can be a useful parameter in evaluating the shear characteristic of granulated coal ash...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} {{applicability}} of the physicochemical theory of effective stresses to sandy soils. It is proven that the above theory may be furthered by the argument that all three types of energy contacts, including coagulatory, transient and phase contacts, are present in sandy soils. Coagulatory contact predominates over the other three types of contact. The authors provide their findings in terms of morphological peculiarities attributable to genetic differences of quaternary sands. The authors have completed an experimental research to identify the fixed water content in sands and artificial mixtures that have a sand grain size, and they have also analyzed dimensions of the per-unit surface of samples of <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> and their fractions to identify correlation between morphological peculiarities of sands and their maximal molecular water-absorbing capacity. The authors have proven the presence of a correlation between the morphology of sand grains and their number in the test sample exposed to the research undertaking, as it determines the number of contacts between particles of sand. The experimental data has proven that the principal provisions of the physicochemical theory of effective stresses are applicable to sandy soils. <b>Natural</b> <b>sands</b> that have particles of different shapes and surface nature demonstrate different types of contacts that prevent compliance of analytical data with the results of experimental researches. Moreover, natural dimensions of coagulatory contact areas of "sandy" systems substantially exceed those identified analytically. Areas of per-unit surfaces of sands that contain particles with highly developed surfaces and clay films exceed those of rounded particles the surfaces of which are smooth and polished {{as a result of their}} soft friction in the water. This phenomenon boosts the thickness of adsorbed hydrated or solvated shells. As the influence of physicochemical factors onto effective stresses in sands is not as prominent as in clays, supplementary and more accurate experiments are to be held in respect of separate sand fractions of monogene sands and in respect of samples of <b>natural</b> <b>sands...</b>|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: A simple {{calculation}} {{has shown}} what {{the impact of}} muck created during {{the construction of a}} hypothetical 50 km long and 100 m 2 cross section tunnel could be on the environment: around 8 million cubic meters would have to be discharged as waste material. One solution to such a problem could be to recycle (almost a part) the earth material, that is, the muck and debris that are excavated from the tunnel face. Approach: In order to verify the possibility of using some different breakers from the ones used in the handling plant on the studied tunnel-access, some tests were performed in the DITAG laboratory at the Politecnico DI Torino. Results and Conclusion: Different cut dimensions were considered in the recycling of the muck material from the tunnel excavation using TBMs. The obtained material, mixed with <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> and gravels according to various hypotheses, corresponds to the dimensional requirements for the shotcrete and concrete aggregates. The optimal solution should be the mixture of the best fines produced by TBM, the products of the broken rock and some percentage of <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> and gravels.

40|$|Abstract: Proton nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) relaxometry offers a non-invasive and non-destructive measurement method to observe and to visualise changes in the iron(III) -ion concentration in aqueous solutions. This is possible due to its paramagnetic influence on the relaxation times. In the context of mineral dissolution processes in natural sediments, {{the effect of the}} presence of dissolved iron(III) on the NMR relaxation times of the pore water was investigated. The decrease in the relaxation times T 1 and T 2 corresponding to an increase in the dissolved iron(III) concentration was quantified. This relation was used to monitor relative changes in the concentration of dissolved iron(III) -ions in <b>natural</b> <b>sands.</b> Experiments were conducted to calibrate the iron(III) concentration from the measured relaxation times. These were done in bulk water as well as in iron(III) -mineral bearing sands to take the effect of surface relaxation into account. It was shown that for relatively coarse-grained sand fractions the effect of iron(III) -ions in solution dominates. This allows the determination of the dissolved iron(III) concentration in <b>natural</b> <b>sands</b> by NMR. The method also enables us to capture the changes in the iron(III) concentration with high temporal resolution. This was demonstrated in column experiments, in which an acid (hydrochloric or sulphuric acid) was applied from the top on the sands to dissolve the mineralogical bound iron(III) and were the dissolution of iron(III) can be captured with sufficient temporal resolution...|$|R
