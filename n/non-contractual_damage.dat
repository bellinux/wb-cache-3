40|$|Since the Middle Ages, the European {{civil law}} {{tradition}} {{has been characterized}} by a tendency to identify the <b>non-contractual</b> <b>damage</b> with the Aquilian damage. This has caused, in the Italian civil law, the difficulty to identify the contractual or non-contractual nature of those damages that neither arise from a contract nor coincide with material injuries: the so-called pure economic loss. The research attempts to reconstruct, moving from the Roman law, {{the complexity of the}} notion of non contractual damage, particularly focusing {{on the history of the}} actio de dolo, in order to offer an historical-dogmatic basis for a better understanding of some problems in the modern law systems.

40|$|This {{study is}} mainly focused on {{handling}} the causing <b>non-contractual</b> <b>damage,</b> achieving a theoretical analysis of its constituent components as fault, causal connection, unlawful act or omission and damage compensation. Non-contractual liability {{is provided by}} our civil code, defining it as at fault or without fault liability. Our country, as a country in transition needs legal investment and its implementation into practice. One of the cases on which liability on damage compensation arises is {{the combination of the}} rights of persons, whose dignity has been infringed against the right that is explicitly sanctioned in the Constitution of the Republic of Albania, freedom of speech as well as thought, fundamental principles of law, but always without thereby infringing the dignity of a subject of law and and being faced with moral and material damages. In order to handle legally this issue as well as its civil legal consequences that threaten to influence on the entities that breach the law, but also their sensibilization. Hereafter I am handling the theoretical and legal way – the analysis of such a case, under legal - civil perspective...|$|E

For the Italian scholars this topic is made difficult by structural and conceptual diversity of Western and Islamic legal systems. Therefore, it is studied the case of <b>non-contractual</b> <b>damages</b> in accordance with the basic elements of Italian law (tort as source of obligation; injustice of the damage; causation; psychological element). Finally, {{the analysis}} focuses on economic harm (theft, robbery, damage) ...|$|R

The Court held that the new single Market based on {{the rule of law}} implies the remedy of compensation where rights which enure to individuals and private entities under the treaty are infringed by a Member State. It held however that State liability in damages is not automatic and that it requires demonstration that the treaty provision allegedly breached was intending to benefit the party, that the breach is serious, that there is substantial loss, {{and that there is a}} causal link between the breach by the State and the damage or loss to the party.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} choice of law rules {{in the field of}} <b>non-contractual</b> liability for <b>damage</b> caused to environment in national legislations of European countries as well as in Private International Law of the European Union. Before the adoption of Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II), special choice of law rules for environmental torts existed in a small number of European national legal orders. This is the fact that gives the rule contained in Article 7 of the Rome II Regulation a particular importance. From the Serbian Private International Law perspective, the significance of that provision is highlighted {{by the fact that the}} working draft of the new Serbian Private International Law Act has strictly followed the choice of law rule envisaged by the European legislator for environmental damage. For that reason, a significant part of the paper is dedicated to analysis of said rule, to its interpretation and potential problems which its application could create...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction. According to Article 220 of the EC Treaty, the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance (hereinafter CFI) “each {{within its}} jurisdiction, shall ensure {{that in the}} {{interpretation}} and application of [the EC] Treaty the law is observed”. The “pre-Nice” allocation of jurisdiction between the two Community courts can be summarized as follows. At Court of Justice level, mention should first of all be made of references for a preliminary ruling. A national court, in a case pending before it, can - or in some circumstances must - refer to the Court of Justice a question relating to the interpretation of provisions of the EC Treaty or of secondary Community law, or relating to the validity of provisions of secondary Community law. 1 Moreover, the Court of Justice ensures the observance {{of the law in}} the context of actions for annulment or failure to act brought before it by the Community institutions, the European Central Bank (hereinafter ECB) and the Member States. 2 These actions concern, respectively, the legality of an act of secondary Community law and the legality of the failure of the institution concerned to adopt such act. The Court of Justice also has jurisdiction in actions brought by the Commission or by a Member State relating to the infringement of Community law by a Member State (hereinafter infringement actions) 3 and in actions relating to compensation for <b>non-contractual</b> <b>damage</b> brought by Member States against the Community. 4 Finally, as regards the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, mention should be made of appeals which can be lodged on points of law only against rulings of the CFI. ...|$|E
40|$|Contractual and <b>non-contractual</b> {{liability}} to <b>damages</b> (a comparison with foreign legislation) In theory tort and contractual liability {{might seem to}} draw clear boundaries. The first one arises from breach of contract whereas tort being unrelated to any contractual obligation. However {{it is known that}} some legal systems, like the Czech law, do not differentiate between them and do not provide them with different rules. Does it only mean the differentiation is useless in these legal systems or does it suggest that there might be no reasonable grounds for distinction in other legal systems? How do tort and contractual liability differ? Differences have to be weighed when area between tort and contract is considered. They are of significance when it comes to possibility or impossibility of choice in case of concurrence of tort and contract and they are important for {{liability to}} third parties of a contract. I researched following legal systems: Czech law, German law, French law, Spanish law and Italian law. In each of them I examined these areas: contractual liability, liability to third party, tort liability, liability for behaviour contrary to bonos mores, and selected elements of tort liability with some remarks to some special rules for contractual liability: wrongfulness, fault, causation, damage and its [...] ...|$|R
