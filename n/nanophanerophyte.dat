40|$|AbstractThe {{life form}} and leaf size spectra of plant {{species of the}} Thandiani forests, {{district}} Abbottabad, were studied {{during the summer of}} 2013. These forests host 252 plant species of 97 families. Biological spectra showed that Hemicryptophytes (80 spp., 31. 74 %) were dominant followed by Megaphanerophytes (51 spp., 20. 24 %), Therophytes (49 spp., 19. 44 %) and <b>Nanophanerophytes</b> (45 spp., 17. 86). Hemicryptophytes are the indicators of cold temperate vegetation. At the lower elevations, Megaphanerophytes and <b>Nanophanerophytes</b> were dominant which confirm trees as dominant habit form due to high soil depth, moisture and temperature factors. Data on Leaf spectra in the area showed that Microphyllous (88 spp., 34. 92 %) species were dominant followed by Leptophyllous (74 spp., 29. 36 %) and Nanophyllous (60 spp., 23. 80 %). The Microphyllous plants again are the indicator of cold temperate zone as the area is situated at an elevation of 1191 – 2626 m. Similarly, Nanophylls were dominant at lower elevations. Data on family importance values and diversity among various communities were also recorded. Life form and Leaf spectra studies could be used to understand the micro climatic variation of the region...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline of}} agro-pastoral {{activities}} {{has led to}} a widespread tree and shrub-encroachment of former semi-natural meso-eutrophic grasslands in many European mountain regions. Temporary night camp areas (TNCA) and mineral mix supplements for targeted cattle were arranged over shrub-encroached areas to restore grassland vegetation within the Val Troncea Natural Park (Italy). From 2011 to 2015, their effects on vegetation structure and pastoral value of forage were assessed along permanent transects. Four years after treatments, both practices were effective in reducing the shrub cover and increasing the cover and average height of the herbaceous layer, but changes were more remarkable within TNCA. Moreover, the arrangement of TNCA decreased the cover of <b>nanophanerophytes</b> and increased the cover of graminoids and high quality species, as well as the overall forage pastoral value. In conclusion, TNCA were the most effective pastoral practice to contrast shrub-encroachment and increase herbage mass and forage quality of sub-alpine grasslands...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the level of {{anthropogenic}} transformation of the vegetation cover of the nature protected areas located within the Ukrainian Forest Steppe, we have analysed the distribution of alien species in natural and anthropogenic habitats. All recorded species are represented in habitats shaped by human activity: dominated by phanerophytes, which included deciduous and coniferous woodlands as well as shrublands of Rhamno-Prunetea class. The same number of species was found in grassland habitats and {{is caused by the}} huge number of potential ecological niches {{as a result of the}} complex structure and also by the proximity of transportation networks and watercourses. Biotopes of chamaephytes and <b>nanophanerophytes,</b> though being represented in all the studied sites, often have a very narrow ecological amplitude and occupy small areas, making it difficult for alien species to spread. About one-third of species were recorded across at least three habitat types; such species may be considered eurytopic in their secondary ranges. Most widespread species were Fallopia convolvulus L., Vicia angustifolia Reichard, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronqist, Phalacroloma annuum (L.) Dumort. and Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv. At the same time, there was not a single species that would have occurred in all habitat types. In sum, agricultural lands and ruderal biotopes were highly invaded; three times less alien plant species occurred in woodlands, shrublands, grasslands and wasteland; and only small number of non-native species were restricted to continental water habitats...|$|R

This study was carried out during the years 2006 - 2008, in Samahni valley district Bhimber A. K. (Pakistan), using methods consisting of semi-structured interviews employing a check list of questions, questionnaires, direct observations and biological inventories. It provides information about different local plants and their life form and leaf size spectra. 120 plant species recorded belonging to 46 families. Poaceae is the dominating with 14 members. Among these {{the most of the}} plants are used to cure common diseases like diarrhea, earache, fever, jaundice, flu, cough and other skin diseases. Snake bite, wound healing and burning of body part are also treated with local herbs. Many plants are used for multiple purposes like as medicines, food, fodder, fuel, furniture and shelter. Due to deforestation vegetation is eliminating rapidly. But the efforts and knowledge about plant wealth conservation is at initial stages. Megaphanerophytes are dominating followed by therophytes. Hemicryptophytes, <b>Nanophanerophytes</b> and Geophytes come after these respectively. All the types of vegetation depend upon presence of trees. In leaf size spectra Microphyllous are dominant followed by Megaphyllous. This work can be the base for advance research in different fields like phytochemistry, molecular biochemistry and antimicrobial plant secondary metabolites.

40|$|Woody species {{represent}} a significant {{component of the}} flora and vegetation of a territory. Their presence or absence directly affects the formation of whole communities and {{plays an important role}} in landscape sculpturing and in forest management. For this reason, the knowledge of woody species geographic distribution is of great theoretical and practical relevance. Tuscany, with 3810 taxa of vascular flora, is among the Italian regions with the highest diversity (1), has a high number of woody native taxa (2), and is ranked 4 th in forest cover (3). However, specific researches on its woody flora are lacking. Apart from the historical contribution of G. Savi (4), the only study on the whole regional territory is a list of shrubs (5). In the context of the Global Tree Seed Bank project, promoted by Garfield Weston Foundation in collaboration with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (UK), we present the first comprehensive survey of Tuscan woody flora with sub-regional detail (presence/absence at province level) based on bibliographic, herbarium and field investigations, including the unpublished observations stored in the on-line database Wikiplantbase #Toscana (1). For the purpose of our study we define as woody flora those taxa whose life forms are reported as phanerophytes (P) and/or <b>nanophanerophytes</b> (NP) (6), including also plants occasionally growing as chamaephytes. Based on our checklist, a chorological spectrum was built at region and province level. In addition, a cluster analysis (UPGMA, Baroni Urbani & Buser's index) of provinces, based on floristic data of native taxa, was carried out. We checked 404 specific and subspecific taxa: 268 native (66. 3...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The State of Maranhão {{comprises}} {{the second largest}} coastline in Brazil. Nonetheless, few floristic surveys on restinga vegetation have been performed in Northeastern Brazil. This study aimed to survey floristic in a restinga of Maranhão, and to assess its similarity to other restingas in the states of Pará and Piauí. Botanical specimens were sampled at Sítio Aguahy, in the municipality of São José de Ribamar, along the eastern coast of Maranhão between June/ 2012 and October/ 2013. Species identification and life forms classification followed the usual methods employed in floristic studies. Similarities in plant composition of six sites were estimated based on cluster analysis through Bray-Curtis distance. In the studied area, we found 116 phanerogamic species, 100 genera and 52 families; 19 species were new occurrences for the restinga of Maranhão. Families with largest number of species were Fabaceae, Cyperaceae, Rubiaceae, Poaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Malvaceae, Combretaceae, and Eriocaulaceae, which comprised 49. 2 % of all sampled species. We identified 41 <b>nanophanerophytes,</b> 34 terophytes, 15 camephytes, ten microphanerophytes, six hemicryptophytes, and five lianas. Similarity analyses indicated greater affinity between the restinga flora from the states of Maranhão and Pará than that observed for the states of Maranhão and Piauí, suggesting {{that the process of}} species colonization in the former is more likely derived from the Amazon Forest. It is expected that these results may encourage future researchers to conduct further surveys in restinga areas of the Maranhão aiming to better understand the influence of neighboring vegetation on the colonization of the coastal areas of Maranhão...|$|R

These orchards were cultivated with: Citrus spp., Phoenix dactylifera, Musa sapientum, Prunus persica, Mangifera indica, Vitis vinifera, Psidium guajava and Pyrus malus. The total number of weed species recorded in these orchards was 169 related to 126 genera and grouped under 35 families. Out of these weeds, 47 species were monocotyledoneae (27. 81 %) and 122 species were dicotyledoneae (72. 19 %). Gramineae and Compositae were the main families representing collectively about 36. 06 % of the total recorded species. According to the life span, the recorded species were classified into three groups: 1) 50 perennial weed species (29. 58 %), 2) 4 biennial weed species (2. 37 %) and 3) 115 annual weed species (68. 05 %). Furthermore, the annual weeds can be subdivided into three categories as follows: a) all year active annuals (31 species), b) winter-spring annuals (57 species) and c) summer-autumn annuals (27 species). According to the life-form spectrum, the weed flora of the study orchards may be grouped under six groups; these were: therophytes (119 species), cryptophytes (27 species), hemicryptophytes (12 species), chamaephytes (7 species), <b>nanophanerophytes</b> (3 species) and parasites (one species).

An inventory was made of spontaneous vascular flora present at the investigated sites. The plants were described in respect of their affiliation to geographical-historical groups, life forms as well as the presence of honey species (polleniferous and nectariferous) and protected species. Within the area of these 7 necropolises, the presence of 382 taxa was found. The number of taxa observed at the individual sites varied between 124 and 274 in the metropolitan zone, 146 in the urban zone, and between 110 and 146 in the rural areas. 			 			The area richest in terms of flora was Majdanek where 274 species of plants were found, while the cemetery in Łuszczów was the least rich – 110 species. The highest precentage of hemicryptophytes was observed in Ostrówek (50. 7 %), the lowest in Lublin – Kalina (40. 3 %). In the case of therophytes, the greatest variation was observed in the urban cemetery in Unicka Street (32. 6 %), while the least varied site was the cemetery in Ostrówek (23. 3 %). The average precentage of geophytes was 12. 1 %, with the greatest number in Łuszczów (16. 4 %), and the smallest one in Majdanek (8. 4 %). Chamaephytes were characterised by a small percentage (between 5. 1 % and 4. 4 %), similarly to <b>nanophanerophytes</b> (6. 2 % to 2. 7 %), and megaphanerophytes (9. 6 %– 1. 8 %). The investigated sites were dominated by apophytes, the percentage of which varied between 52. 3 % in the Lublin cemeteries on Lipowa and Unicka Streets, and 44. 5 % in Ostrówek. 			 			Among anthropophytes, there were mostly archeophytes (between 26. 3 % in Łuszczów and 13. 1 % on Lipowa St. in Lublin).
