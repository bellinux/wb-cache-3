40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted {{to obtain the}} heat transfer and pressure drop data for an integral trailing edge cavity test section that simulates a novel turbine blade’s internal cooling passage with bleed holes. Local heat transfer is measured on both the suction and pressure sides by a transient liquid crystal technique, while pressures at six positions are recorded by pressure calibrators. Moreover, flow characteristic {{and its effect on}} heat transfer are analyzed for conditions with or without bleed flow. The experimental results show that, in the cases with bleed flow, local heat transfer on the pressure side exceeds that on the suction side in the first and second channels. In the cases without bleed flow, in the first and third channels, local heat transfer on the suction side weakens whilst it increases significantly on the pressure side. For the second channel, <b>non-bleed</b> condition leads to a more balanced heat transfer distribution between the upstream and downstream channel. Besides, after the bleed holes are blocked, heat transfer in the first bend region on the suction side declines sharply, while the opposite phenomenon occurs for the second bend region on the pressure side. In both bleed and <b>non-bleed</b> cases, the total pressure of six measurement positions decreases continuously along the channel at the same Reynolds number and it promotes for higher Reynolds number. Among all the measurement points, under the same flow rate condition, the highest speed occurs at Position 5, which also shows the maximum difference between the total and static pressures.

40|$|Class of 2015 AbstractObjectives: Argatroban is {{the current}} drug of choice for type II heparin induced thrombocytopenia. Primarily metabolized by the liver, this direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor has a volume of distribution of approximately 174 mLs per kg. While few studies suggested no differences in coagulation parameters or clinical outcomes between obese and non-obese populations receiving argatroban, a recent case report revealed elevated anticoagulation parameters for 20 days post argatroban discontinuation in a morbidly obese female. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess anticoagulation parameters in obese and non-obese patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting who received argatroban treatment during their stay. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational, single-centered study. Participants of the study must be adults, at least 18 years of age. Patient must be an inpatient and have received argatroban for either suspected or confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). All patients in the study were screened for the above criteria between November 2008 and September 2013. Patients admitted to the cardiac ICU were excluded from the study. Main anticoagulation parameters post discontinuation evaluated were daily international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), while safety outcomes included major, minor and <b>non-bleed</b> events. All data were analyzed with STATA 13 with P less than 0. 05 being considered as statistically significant. Results: The study included a total of 51 patients, 37 were non-obese with body mass index (BMI) less than 30 kg per m 2 (73 percent), and 14 were obese with BMI greater or equal to 30 kg per m 2 (27 percent). Among basic demographic data, no differences were found between age, sex, race, height and SOFA scores at baseline between the two groups, BMI less than 30 kg per m 2 and BMI greater or equal to 30 kg per m 2. (P equals 0. 7, 0. 21, 1. 0, 0. 41, 0. 51 respectively). However, as expected, weight was the only characteristic that was different at baseline (P less than 0. 01). Primary outcome of time of INR to normalization post argatroban administration (2. 73 seconds plus or minus 0. 27 seconds) as well as safety outcomes including major, minor, and <b>non-bleed</b> adverse events (P equals 0. 61) were statistically non-significant between the two groups. Conclusions: In this retrospective, observational, single centered study, no differences were identified between non-obese and obese groups in terms of argatroban administration, primary anticoagulation parameters, and safety outcomes. The length of time required for coagulation parameters to normalize after discontinuation of argatroban therapy for HIT does not appear to be influenced by BMI.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a shroud bleed slot system of a compressor stage from a turbocharger unit used in heavy duty diesel engines of approximately 300 kW. The {{first part of the}} work presented in this thesis deals with a detailed analysis of a compressor stage with and without a shroud bleed slot, and various slot geometries which include three different widths and three different positions of the slot. The second stage of this study is an investigation of an addition of a set of vanes in the annular cavity of the shroud bleed slot system. This investigation was performed using both CFD modelling and experimental measurements. The CFD model used a full stage steady state approach. Very good agreement was achieved between the experimental measurements of efficiency, pressure ratio and mass flow rate and those values predicted by the CFD model over the entire performance map, providing confidence in the CFD model as a tool to help understand the flow features of the bleed slot, its various geometries and an addition of annular cavity vanes. The first stage of the study emphasises the significance of the inclusion of a shroud bleed slot into the conventional turbocharger compressor stage and the appropriate choice of the slot geometry in order to achieve as the widest map possible. In comparison with the <b>non-bleed</b> slot compressor stage, the bleed slot significantly extended the map width at the higher speeds, by reducing the surge mass flow rate. However, no or very little improvement was found at lower speeds. The analysis of changes to design parameters revealed that it is vital to obtain an optimised geometry of the bleed slot system for a compressor stage to achieve a wider map without compromising other performance characteristics of the compressor. This study also discloses the importance of an optimised shape of the shroud bleed slot system to increase the compressor performance by avoiding the recirculation losses within the slot and cavity passages at both choke and surge flow conditions. In the second stage of the work presented in this thesis, three different types of the annular cavity vane (straight, positive curved and negative curved vanes) have been designed and investigated. The purpose of the annular cavity vane technique is to remove some of the positive swirl that can be carried through the bleed slot system, which would influence the pressure ratio. In addition to this, the series of cavity vanes provides better guidance to the slot recirculating flow before it mixes with the impeller main inlet flow. Better guidance of the flow improves the mixing at the inducer inlet in the circumferential direction. As a consequence, the stability of the compressor is improved at lower flow rates and a wider map can be achieved. The impact of these three cavity vane designs on the map width and performance of the compressor has been highlighted through a detailed analysis of the impeller and cavity vane bleed slot flow field. Interestingly, all three types of cavity vane showed an improvement in map width by moving the surge point to a lower mass flow rate with no significant efficiency penalty over the entire operating range. This improvement was most evident at the highest running speed. In particular, the negative curved vane showed a significant increase in map width which re{{presents an}} extra 67 % improvement in map width that was achieved between the baseline bleed slot and <b>non-bleed</b> slot configurations.

MethodsThe databases PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data, VIP, and CNKI were searched to obtain Chinese articles on SAAG and esophagogastric variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis published between January 2001 and June 2015, and each article should include a bleeding group and a <b>non-bleeding</b> group. Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) {{was used as a}} reference to evaluate the quality of articles. The mean±standard deviation (SD) of SAAG in bleeding groups and <b>non-bleeding</b> groups were pooled and analyzed. The Meta-Analyst software was used to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) of SAAG between bleeding groups and <b>non-bleeding</b> groups and perform the meta-analysis. The chi-square test was applied for comparison of categorical data between groups. ResultsThirteen articles met the inclusion criteria. SAAG was (22  54 ± 4. 69) g/L in bleeding groups and (15. 91 ± 4. 20) g/L in <b>non-bleeding</b> groups. The test for heterogeneity showed significant heterogeneity (Q= 100. 735, I 2 = 89  065, P＜ 0. 001), and the bleeding groups had a significantly higher SAAG than the <b>non-bleeding</b> groups (SMD= 1. 970, 95 % CI: 1. 425 - 2. 515, P＜ 0. 001). According to the SAAG level, the patients were divided into the group with a SAAG of ＜ 15 g/L, the group with a SAAG of ≥ 15 g/L and ≤ 19. 9 g/L, and the group with a SAAG of ≥ 20 g/L, and with the increasing SAAG, the proportion of patients experiencing variceal bleeding increased significantly (χ 2 = 111. 702, P＜ 0. 001).

To assess whether INR prolongation parallels changes in the results of other tests investigating hemostasis, and to evaluate the coagulant effects of a fixed dose of FFP in <b>non-bleeding</b> critically ill patients with a coagulopathy. Markers of coagulation, individual factor levels and levels of natural anticoagulants were measured. Also, thrombin generation and thromboelastometry (ROTEM) assays were performed before and after FFP transfusion (12 mL kg(- 1)) to 38 <b>non-bleeding</b> critically ill patients with an increased INR (1. 5 - 3. 0). At baseline, levels of factor II, FV, FVII, protein C, protein S and antithrombin were reduced, and thrombin generation was impaired. ROTEM variables were within reference ranges, except for a prolonged INTEM clot formation time. FFP transfusion increased the levels of coagulation factors (FII, 34 % [interquartile range (IQR) 26 - 46] before vs. 44 % [IQR 38 - 52] after; FV, 48 % [IQR 28 - 76] before vs. 58 % [IQR 44 - 90] after; and FVII, 25 % [IQR 16 - 38] before vs. 37 % [IQR 28 - 55] after), and the levels of anticoagulant proteins.

The reasons of ICU-physicians to transfuse FFP and platelets were determined during a 10 -week period. Transfusion triggers were assessed, as well as correction of prolonged coagulation test results. Of 310 admissions, 44 patients (14 %) received a transfusion of FFP and 35 patients (11 %) received a platelet transfusion. In 67 % patients, FFPs were transfused in bleeding patients and in 33 % in <b>non-bleeding</b> patients. FFP was transfused at a prothrombin time (PT) of 19 s (17 - 22). After FFP transfusion, PT levels of 15 - 18, 18 - 20 and 20 - 26 s decreased with a median of 0. 7, 1. 9 and 3. 5 s, respectively. On average, 3. 2 FFP units were ordered, of which 28 % was not transfused. The major reason to transfuse platelets was bleeding.

40|$|Background: Intensive {{care unit}} (ICU) {{patients}} usually have abnormal biochemical and hematological laboratory test results {{as a consequence}} of organ dysfunction and underlying disease. Thromboelastography (TEG®) is a point-of-care laboratory analysis that gives an overview of several aspects of the coagulation process. In {{order to be able to}} perform a clinical interpretation of abnormal TEG® results the expected values from <b>non-bleeding</b> ICU patients should be known. The aim of this study is to report the normal variability observed in <b>non-bleeding,</b> non-transfused ICU patients. Methods: Adult ICU patients without bleeding in the last 24 hours, who had not received blood products within the last 24 hours, with no hematological diseases and no anticoagulation therapeutic treatment were included. Standard clinical chemistry tests, coagulation tests and TEG® were obtained. All results were reported in relation to standard reference values. TEG® values were compared with routine coagulation measurement using Spearman correlations. Results: We observed that the normal variability observed in <b>non-bleeding,</b> non-transfused ICU patients in this study included abnormally high TEG® values for maximum amplitude (MA) (73 %). None of the patients showed MA results corresponding to hypocoagulability. Other coagulation tests were also changed with elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen and APTT values, and a low ATIII value. Conclusion: In unselected ICU patients without bleeding or known factors that influence coagulation, a TEG® value of MA is often elevated suggesting hypercoagulability. This finding should be considered when interpreting TEG® observations obtained in ICU patients. Keywords: Critically ill, Coagulation, Tromboelastograph...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{every case}} of upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding suspicion, an endoscopic examination {{ought to be}} performed {{as a matter of}} urgency. Finding active bleeding, a visible <b>non-bleeding</b> vessel or a lesion with an adherent clot should be followed by application of an available method of endoscopic therapy. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the effectiveness of various endoscopi...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{bleeding}} concerns, other <b>non-bleeding</b> {{events can}} also occur from warfarin therapy. These <b>non-bleeding</b> events, occurring {{in less than}} 1 %, include but are not limit to skin necrosis, “purple toe syndrome,” and dermatologic hypersensitivity reactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions from warfarin are uncommon and rarely reported in the literature. In this article, a rare case is described of warfarin induced generalized dermatitis in a 73 -year-old female patient who was admitted for COPD exacerbation but later had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (CHADS 2 score of 2) and experienced an acute dermatological reaction during the initial and subsequent re-challenge of warfarin therapy. Both episodes of hypersensitivity reaction were managed by standard support care. The purpose of this communication is to increase awareness of this adverse event, review prior case studies, and address alternative anticoagulation agents {{in the event of}} a similar dermatologic reaction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of warfarin induced generalized dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Rupture of {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) {{is not uncommon}} and most ruptured HCC present with hemoperitoneum and hemorrhagic shock. Management of ruptured HCC is different than non-ruptured one. Short- and long-term mortality increases following rupture of HCC with increasing chances of tumor dissemination. We describe a case with <b>non-bleeding</b> spontaneous rupture of HCC. A 62 -year-old male patient was admitted to our institute hospital with mild to moderate pain in the right {{upper part of the}} abdomen. He lost appetite and weight. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was performed and it suggested HCC and ascites. Triple phase computer tomography revealed HCC in segments 6 and 7 of liver with typical radiological characteristics. Portal vein was thrombosed. No extravasation of dye was seen. Ruptured of tumor through liver capsule was seen with necrosis and hemorrhage {{in the center of the}} tumor. <b>Non-bleeding</b> ruptured HCC has not been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We herein describe this rare case...|$|E
40|$|Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) {{larger than}} 5 cm in {{diameter}} {{is considered an}} indication for elective surgery, {{because of the risk}} of haemorrhage and malignant transformation. Transarterial embolization (TAE) is used to manage bleeding HCA and occasionally to reduce tumour size. TAE might have potential as an elective therapy, but its current role in this context is uncertain. This systematic review provides an overview of clinical outcomes after TAE, in bleeding and <b>non-bleeding</b> HCA. Two independent reviewers performed a systematic search of literature in PubMed and Embase. Outcomes were change in tumour size, avoidance of surgery, complications and malignant transformation after TAE in bleeding and <b>non-bleeding</b> HCA. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool for cohort studies was used for quality assessment of included studies. From 320 potential articles, 20 cohort studies and 20 case reports including 851 patients met the inclusion criteria. TAE was performed in 151 of 851 patients (17 · 7 per cent), involving 196 tumours, of which 95 (48 · 5 per cent) were <b>non-bleeding.</b> Surgical treatment was avoided in 68 of 151 patients (45 · 0 per cent). Elective TAE was performed in 49 patients involving 66 HCAs, with 41 of these patients (84 per cent) not requiring surgery. Major complications occurred in eight of 151 patients (5 · 3 per cent); no death was reported. Among cohort studies, complete tumour disappearance was observed in 10 per cent of patients, and regression in 75 per cent. Acute or elective TAE in the management of HCA is safe. In the elective setting, TAE provides a potential alternative to surger...|$|E
40|$|From September 1991 to December 1992, a {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the risk factors and residual risk of rebleeding, and the evolutionary endoscopic changes in peptic ulcers that rebled. Emergency endoscopies were performed on 452 patients with haematemesis or a melaena, or both within 24 hours of admission. If the lesions were actively bleeding, then the patients were treated with injection sclerotherapy. A multivariate analysis of clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic variables of 204 patients with ulcer bleeding showed that hypovolaemic shock, a <b>non-bleeding</b> visible vessel, and an adherent clot on the ulcer base were independently significant in predicting rebleeding (p < 0. 05). Considering these three factors according to the estimates of their regression coefficients showed that a <b>non-bleeding</b> visible vessel was the strongest predictor of rebleeding. The study of the residual risk of rebleeding after admission showed that most rebleeding episodes (94. 1 %), including all associated with hypovolaemic shock, surgical treatment, and death, occurred within 96 hours of admission. After this time, the residual risk of rebleeding was less than 1 %. Study of the changes in endoscopic findings before and after rebleeding illustrated that all ulcers with a visible vessel or adherent clot showed at follow up endoscopy were derived from ulcers with initial major stigmata. It is concluded that hypovolaemic shock, a <b>non-bleeding</b> visible vessel, and an adherent clot on an ulcer base are of independent significance in predicting rebleeding. Observation for 96 hours is sufficient to detect most rebleeding episodes after an initial bleed from peptic ulcer...|$|E
