40|$|A {{significant}} {{effort is}} being made by fusion researchers to minimize the total size of magnetic fusion devices on the path toward developing fusion energy. The spherical tokamak, which has a very low aspect ratio, is the most promising of the compact magnetic fusion reactor designs. This compactness imposes a severe material constraint on the design, as a highly compact device will have very thin inner shielding. This inner shielding, which in traditional designs is required to be around 1 meter thick, acts to protect the central solenoid and return toroidal field coil legs from material damage and <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> resulting from high neutron fluxes. The use of a sub-meter inner shield creates potential {{for the design of}} a proof of principle magnetic fusion device, sacrificing the central component materials for a demonstration of temporary fusion power production. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> of thin shields (~ 0. 1 - 0. 2 m) of various compositions was explored using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code. The principal finding was that <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> is the largest concern to the central inboard components. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> of these sensitive materials was found to be minimized by the use of a magnesium borohydride blanket with a tungsten first wall.

40|$|As part of {{the design}} studies {{conducted}} at CEA for future power and research nuclear reactors, the validation of neutron and photon calculation schemes related to <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> prediction are strongly dependent on the implementation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> measurements. Such measurements are usually performed in low-power reactors, whose core dimensions are accurately known and where irradiation conditions (power, flux and temperature) are entirely controlled. Due to the very low operating power of such reactors (of the order of 100 W), <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> is assessed by using dosimetry techniques such as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). However, although they are highly sensitive to gamma radiation, such dosimeters are also, to a lesser extent, sensitive to neutrons. The neutron dose depends strongly on the TLD composition, typically contributing to 10 - 30 % of the total measured dose in a mixed neutron/gamma field. The experimental determination of the neutron correction appears therefore to be crucial to a better interpretation of doses measured in reactor with reduced uncertainties.

40|$|The {{design of}} the cold neutron source(CNS) {{facility}} for HANARO, a 30 MW research reactor, is in progress. In order to measure the <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> rate and thermal neutron flux in the CN hole of HANARO, a calorimeter based {{on the concept of}} the heat flow calorimeter is designed and constructed. The calorimeter sensor consists of a cylindrical Al sample, Al container, Al pipe for the neutron flux measurement, two thermocouples and an electric heater for the calibration. The sample is separated by an air gap from the Al container surrounded by an air containing Al sleeve. The heat transfer of the calorimeter under the irradiation condition is simulated by the calibration experiment of the electric heating for the sample. Thereupon, the relationship between the temperature difference and the heating power is predetermined. By using the calibration curve and the temperature measurements, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> rates in the CN hole at the reactor powers of 1, 4 and 8 MW are determined.
