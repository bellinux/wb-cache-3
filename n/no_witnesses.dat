5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. <b>No</b> <b>witnesses</b> recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
5|$|The Guayaquil conference {{took place}} on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the {{following}} one. As there were <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> or minutes, {{the content of their}} discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters to other people. Some likely topics of discussion may have been a request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Martín ranked second to Bolívar.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgibbons {{argues that}} it was not {{impossible}} for Cromwell's body to have been substituted before his posthumous execution. One proposition is that Sergeant Norfolke, who exhumed the bodies from the abbey, found the tombs of Cromwell and Ireton empty, prompting the government to sanction an exhumation of two other graves. This has been put forward because Bradshaw's body arrived at the Red Lion Inn at Holborn a day after Cromwell and Ireton, prompting rumour that he was the only real body to be hanged at Tyburn. An alternative theory is that Cromwell's friends bribed the guards attending Cromwell's body, “privately interring him in a small paddock near Holborn”, so that when the sledges dragged the bodies to the gallows, Cromwell's body was already buried. The faces on the three bodies, although heavily shrouded, were clearly visible; and since <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> expressed any doubt that the bodies were those of Cromwell and Ireton, there is no evidence supporting this theory.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as {{a result}} of an {{apparent}} murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital, but died shortly after. Larry's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> at the time, and Larry's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear; however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family-run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes. Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.|$|E
5|$|Rome's Ciampino airport, {{the site}} of the first Comet hull loss, was the origin of more {{disastrous}} Comet flights just over a year later. On 10 January 1954, 20minutes after taking off from Ciampino, the first production Comet, G-ALYP, broke up in mid-air while operating BOAC Flight 781 and crashed into the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Elba with the loss of all 35 on board. With <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> to the disaster and only partial radio transmissions as incomplete evidence, no obvious reason for the crash could be deduced. Engineers at de Havilland immediately recommended 60 modifications aimed at any possible design flaw while the Abell Committee met to determine potential causes of the crash. BOAC also voluntarily grounded its Comet fleet pending investigation into the causes of the accident.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces {{launched}} an offensive in Western Europe, but Wick {{remained on the}} ground while his aircraft, Bf 109 Yellow 2, underwent an engine change. Seven days later, {{he was back in}} the air, recording three victories over French LeO 45 bombers in one mission. By 6 June, Wick had 10 confirmed and two unconfirmed victories, including four French Bloch 151/152 fighters that he shot down on 5 June to record his fifth through eighth victories. The two unconfirmed victories were Royal Navy Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers claimed on 19 May and for which he had <b>no</b> <b>witnesses.</b> On 6 June, Wick became the first pilot of the I. Gruppe to complete 100 combat missions, claiming his ninth and tenth victory the same day. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class by Oberstleutnant Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp. By the end of the French Campaign, Wick's total stood at 14 confirmed victories, trailing only Hauptmann (Captain) Mölders of JG53 with 25 victories and Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar of JG27 with 23 victories as the Luftwaffes top scorer. At the end of the French campaign, 3. Staffel headquarters moved into the house of Louis Aston Knight, an artist who had fled {{a few days before the}} Germans arrived.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1943, 15./JG 52 {{transferred}} from Nikolayev to Kerch, and it flew the first missions of its second tour the following day. On 15 April, Dukovac and Feldwebel Viktor Mihelčić {{took off on}} a patrol of the Krymskaja–Abinskaja area, and Dukovac shot down a US-made Bell P-39 Airacobra. Five days later, Dukovac was late taking off and was catching up to his Schwarm when he downed a LaGG-3 fighter during an engagement with four of the Soviet aircraft, but there were <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> to confirm his claim. Later that day, he and three other pilots were escorting a group of Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers when they came across 25 Soviet fighters and flying boats over the Black Sea. Dukovac claimed another LaGG-3, but again no-one witnessed it. The following morning, Dukovac was on patrol with another pilot near Karbardinovka when they came across six Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighters. Dukovac claimed one, but the other pilot's aircraft was hit {{and they had to}} retire. Later that day, Dukovac and another pilot engaged several LaGG-3s between Novorossiysk and Gelendzhik; Dukovac claimed two, one of which was not witnessed. On 22 April, Dukovac was attacking shipping in Novorossiysk when he had to force-land his aircraft with engine problems. He flew another mission in a different aircraft later that day over the Black Sea, downing a Ilyushin DB-3 bomber.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a mutual}} {{reflection}} on their past, it is revealed that Sarah and Andrew were on holiday {{at the time}} of their meeting with Little Bee. The trip was an attempt to salvage their marriage after Andrew discovered Sarah had been unfaithful to him, embarking on an affair with Home Office employee Lawrence Osborn. While walking on the beach one morning, they were approached by a then 14-year-old Little Bee, and her older sister Nkiruka. The girls were being pursued by soldiers who had burned down their village and intended for there to be <b>no</b> <b>witnesses</b> left alive. The soldiers arrived and murdered a guard from the O'Rourkes' hotel, but offered to spare the lives of the girls if Andrew would amputate his own middle finger with a machete. Afraid, and believing the soldiers would murder the girls anyway, Andrew refused, but Sarah complied in his place. The soldiers took both girls away, leaving the couple in doubt as to whether the soldiers would leave one girl alive in response, as they promised.|$|E

25|$|Curry then {{traveled}} back to Knoxville. In a {{pool hall}} on November 30, 1902, Curry was captured {{after a lengthy}} physical fight with lawmen.

25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings.
