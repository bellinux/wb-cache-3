These errors are captured and corrected before reaching the patient fortuitously or purposefully by designed system controls. This study analyzed the reported near misses in a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh city. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated consecutively collected <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>report</b> forms over a period of 6 months from January 1, 2012 to June 30, 2012. Results: The total number of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>report</b> forms was 1, 025 and each form contained one or more near misses. Of these <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>report</b> forms, 58. 73 % (n = 602) were related to male patients. Most frequently reported near misses were wrong frequency (n = 266, 25. 95 %), followed by improper doses (n = 250, 24. 39 %), wrong drug prescribed (n = 126, 12. 29 %), wrong duration (n = 97, 9. 46 %), wrong concentration (n = 92, 8. 98 %), and wrong dosage form (n = 57, 5. 56 %). Stages where most near misses were identified included transcription and entering (n = 676, 55. 32 %), physician ordering (n = 397, 32. 49 %), and dispensing and delivery (n = 115, 9. 41 %). Physicians and nurses made most of the near misses (n = 929, 89. 1 %), whereas pharmacists identified most of the near misses (n = 1, 002, 97. 3 %). Most frequently reported reasons for near misses were lack of staff training (n = 419, 34. 12 %), communication problems related to drug order (n = 387, 31. 5 %), staff, workflow and milieu problems (n = 199, 16. 2 %), and missing drug information (n = 121, 9. 85 %). Sites related to most near misses were the general hospital outpatient department (n = 453, 44. 67 %), the general hospital emergency room (n = 237, 23. 37 %), and the maternity hospital outpatient department (n = 203, 20. 02 %). Pharmacists intervened by correcting drug-related items in most near misses (n = 702, 34. 58 %), waited for a response from source of errors (n = 358, 17. 64 %), called reporter for clarifications (n = 471, 23. 20 %), or did not dispense the drug (n = 331, 16. 3 %). Drugs most frequently involved in near misses were anti-infective (n = 239, 22. 61 %), cardiovascular (n = 207, 19. 58 %), and central nervous system (n = 154, 14. 57 %) agents. Conclusion: This prospective study provides some important tentative pharmacovigilance insights into near misses, which are comparable with current international trends in near misses. Further studies on near misses are warranted in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Keywords: near miss, medication errors, e-prescribing, electronic prescribing system, Saudi Arabi...|$|E

40|$|Organization Sierra-Tango is {{employing}} a systematic and methodical safety framework to manage risks {{in all their}} operational and training activities. While this safety system has shown itself to be reasonably effective in curtailing the number of accidents within the organization, Organization Sierra-Tango is not resting on its laurels and is continuing efforts to refine and improve upon its safety management framework. One of the focus areas is that of enhancing vehicle safety management in training deployments. This thesis fulfills Organizations Sierra-Tango's need for systematic understanding and continuous learning to enhance vehicle safety management in training deployments. This is achieved by extending the preponderant focus on the events and symptoms of accidents, which mostly ascribe human error as {{the primary cause of}} accidents, towards a more holistic perspective of accidents by also examining the often complex and dynamic contribution of organizational policies and practices towards accidents. An extensive research process was undertaken where discussions and interviews were conducted with the organization's vehicle safety Subject Matter Experts so as to develop {{a better understanding of the}} context of vehicle accidents during training deployments. Additionally, a thorough review of Organization Sierra Tango's internal documents (accident reports, training policies, etc) and open literature on accidents and safety was performed. Two System Dynamics (SD) models were developed to synthesize the mental models from the research phase and to generate, through simulations and analysis, insights for enhancing the organization's vehicle safety framework and practices. (cont.) The key insights drawn from the Work Management SD model are that, schedule pressure must be managed at all levels, driver workload should be relieved by increasing the number of drivers available rather than task reduction, and supervisor workload management has a larger bearing on a driver's accident resilience compared to driver workload management. The <b>Near</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>Reporting</b> SD model revealed that increasing the level of identity confidentiality of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> reporters encourages <b>reporting,</b> reducing the severity of punitive measures is not recommended as a means to encourage <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>reporting,</b> and the overall safety culture of the organization is a key driver of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>reporting.</b> by Kelvin F.

The transfusion process is a complex sociotechnical system and relies on multidisciplinary teams (MDT) of healthcare professionals, hence there are many opportunities for error. Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) is the United Kingdom (UK) independent, professionally-led haemovigilance scheme, which has collected and analysed anonymised information on adverse events and reactions in blood transfusion since 1996. The emphasis has been to learn from what goes wrong in these incidents, but the recent development of the safety II concept helped to see the importance of learning from what goes right. Investigation of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> errors (what eventually goes right) can show where resilience/recovery within the transfusion process could be enhanced.

40|$|The U. S. {{construction}} industry continues to rank {{as one of}} the most dangerous work environments when compared to other industrial sectors. Construction companies are required to record and report lagging safety leading indicators including fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. Safety leading indicators provide an opportunity to identify construction site hazards and hazardous worker behavior before a fatality, injury, or illness occurs. Further improvements are also necessary for construction safety through the use of technology. The application of advanced or emerging technologies can have a significant role in enhancing construction worker safety performance. This research seeks to report and analyze safety leading indicators, specifically <b>near</b> <b>misses.</b> Furthermore, technologies capable of providing alerts in real-time to construction equipment operators and ground workers during hazardous proximity situations are reviewed.

40|$|The {{consideration}} of early interventional radiology {{in the management}} of postpartum haemorrhage. BACKGROUND 1 Postpartum haemorrhage remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Confidential enquiries and <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>reports</b> indicate that large numbers of women suffer severe morbidity requiring blood transfusions, hysterectomy and intensive care facilities because of excessive blood loss. This may be predictable where there is known placenta accreta or placenta praevia. However, the majority of postpartum haemorrhage is unpredictable. TECHNIQUE The procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist in an angiography suite. The common femoral artery is punctured and a guide wire is advanced, followed by a catheter into the distal aorta. Pelvic angiograms and selective bilateral internal iliac angiograms identify the internal iliac of interest. Catheterisation of the internal iliac with digital “road mapping ” to subselect the bleeding vessel is performed and this vessel is then occluded by gelfoam pledgets, coils or rings. The contralateral internal iliac is then catheterised. Vascular occlusion is confirmed by repeat angiography. Initial catheterisation of the anterior branch of the internal iliacs can be done with occluding balloon catheters prior to planned surgery and eventual embolotherapy in order to reduce blood loss and control postpartum haemorrhage...|$|R

To ensure success, the whole organization, especially executive management, need to be advocates. Illustrated by four case studies, we discuss the influence of organisational culture on buy-in and commitment to WSPs. Despite an internal desire to undertake risk management, aspects of organisational culture prevented these from reaching full potential. Enabling cultural features included: enthusiastic management; past incidents; accountability; insufficient regulations; image; learning and continual improvement cultures; stakeholder relationships; and empowerment of staff. Blocking features included: lack of awareness and recognition; complacency; poor internal relationships; competing priorities; lack of resources and skills; contrasting internal cultures {{and a lack of}} <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>reporting.</b> Benefits of WSP implementation and how management are committed are also discussed. We offer some suggestions to those wishing to generate executive buy-in such as: understanding reasons for hesitance; demonstrate benefits; avoiding complacency; highlight building blocks of WSPs and recognising the value of using the WSP approach to inform sound investment planning. We urge water utilities to consider the influence of organisational culture on the success and sustainability of WSP adoption, and to better understand how effective leadership can mould culture to support implementation...|$|R
40|$|In the UK 27 million {{working days}} are lost due to work-related illness or injury; at an {{estimate}} of £ 13. 4 billion to the economy. Over the last 30 years researchers have examined safety culture {{and its relationship to}} poor safety performance. An organisation in the high hazard construction industry wanted to understand the factors that shaped and influenced safety performance and safety culture. This thesis details a research project which addresses that aim. A multi-method, triangulated approach was adopted combining both qualitative (focus groups and interviews) and quantitative (safety climate questionnaire) methods. The results of the qualitative studies informed the development of the safety climate questionnaire that included a measure of self-reported accidents and <b>near</b> <b>misses.</b> The qualitative studies identified 6 main themes; Communication, Leadership, Employee Engagement & Involvement, Safety Prioritisation, Job Demands and Culture. Quantitative study results show, Upward Communication, Perceived Organisational Support (POS), Employee Engagement. Leader Member Exchange (LMX) and Organisational Commitment demonstrate a significant relationship with Safety Climate. Safety Climate, POS had a Significant, positive, predictive relationship with both accidents and <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> <b>reported.</b> Upward communication had a significant negative, predictive relationship with accidents and <b>near</b> <b>misses.</b> LMX and Organisational Commitment show a Significant, negative, predictive relationship with accidents reported only. Results can be explained in the context of social exchange relationships. Reporting behaviour is being measured, this can be conceptualised as organisational safety citizenship behaviour. The probability of increasing or reducing reporting behaviours is shaped by social exchanges such as; a) the degree that employees feel supported by the organisation, b) and their manager, c) the safety climate, d) their commitment levels e) and opportunities to raise safety concerns. Interventions should aim to develop leaders and organisational practices to be more supportive, to increase reporting behaviour and to create a more accurate picture of safety performance...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctorate of Business Administration (DBA) After {{decades of}} {{workplace}} safety evolution, organisations {{are looking for}} new insights {{in order to prevent}} harm. However, there has been relatively little focus on the role of ethical decision-making in behaviour-based safety. This study examines the influence of contextual, organisational and individual factors that influence the ethical decision-making process. 376 responses to three scenarios, crafted to reflect common health and safety related dilemmas in the Australian telecommunications and broadcasting industry, were captured and analysed. A three-tiered quantitative research model was developed, firstly using vignettes to test the contextual influences on ethical decision-making. Secondly a bivariate analysis was used to investigate the moral intensity of the three dilemmas and the influence of individual factors and safety culture. The third tier explores the influence of variables on forming moral intent. Drawing on philosophy and social psychology theory this study suggests that perceptions of moral intensity are stronger for safety dilemmas than workplace health dilemmas, creating concerns for the active caring movement. Moreover, moral intensity and forming moral intentions was found to vary significantly between safety and health dilemmas. Results suggest individuals with strong moral potency are more likely to perceive high levels of moral intensity and {{will be more likely to}} form moral intent in response to health and safety dilemmas. It appears more likely for an idealistic person to form moral intent for safety dilemmas but not health related scenarios. Small positive associations were also identified between idealism and perceptions of moral intensity. Individuals with strong levels of relativism were less likely to form moral intent. However, relativism does not appear to influence <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> <b>reporting</b> or perceptions of moral intensity. Safety culture was observed to have very small positive associations with perceptions of moral intensity, and forming moral intent despite assumptions that social consensus and safety culture may have strong correlations. There were no significant relationships with idealism or relativism.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{examined}} {{the use of the}} Folstein Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) in predicting retrospective reports of driving problems among the elderly. The utility of existing scoring systems for the CDT was also examined. Methods Archival chart records of 325 patients of a geriatric outpatient clinic were reviewed, of which 162 had CDT results (including original clock drawings). T -test, correlation, and regression procedures were used to analyze the data. Results Both CDT and MMSE scores were significantly worse among non-drivers than individuals who were currently or recently driving. Among current or recent drivers, scores on both instruments correlated significantly with the total number of <b>reported</b> accidents or <b>near</b> <b>misses,</b> although the magnitude of the respective correlations was small. Only MMSE scores, however, significantly predicted whether or not any accidents or <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> were <b>reported</b> at all. Neither MMSE nor CDT scores predicted unique variance in the regressions. Conclusions The overall results suggest that both the MMSE and CDT have limited utility as potential indicators of driving problems in the elderly. The demonstrated predictive power for these instruments appears to be redundant, such that both appear to assess general cognitive function versus more specific abilities. Furthermore, the lack of robust prediction suggests that neither are sufficient to serve as stand-alone instruments on which to solely base decisions of driving capacity. Rather, individuals who evidence impairment should be provided a more thorough and comprehensive assessment than can be obtained through screening tools. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue/sleepiness is {{recognised}} as {{an important}} contributory factor in fatal and serious injury road traffic incidents (RTIs), however, identifying fatigue/sleepiness as a causal factor remains an uncertain science. Within Australia attending police officers at a RTI report the causal factors; one option is fatigue/sleepiness. In some Australian jurisdictions police incident databases are subject to post hoc analysis using a proxy definition for fatigue/sleepiness. This secondary analysis identifies further RTIs caused by fatigue/sleepiness not initially identified by attending officers. The current study investigates the efficacy of such proxy definitions for attributing fatigue/sleepiness as a RTI causal factor. Over 1600 Australian drivers were surveyed regarding their experience and involvement in fatigue/sleep-related RTIs and near-misses {{during the past five}} years. Driving while fatigued/sleepy had been experienced by the majority of participants (66. 0 % of participants). Fatigue/sleep-related <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> were <b>reported</b> by 19. 1 % of participants, with 2. 4 % being involved in a fatigue/sleep-related RTI. Examination of the characteristics for the most recent event (either a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> or crash) found that the largest proportion of incidents (28. 0 %) occurred when commuting to or from work, followed by social activities (25. 1 %), holiday travel (19. 8 %), or for work purposes (10. 1 %). The fatigue/sleep related RTI and near-miss experience of a representative sample of Australian drivers does not reflect the proxy definitions used for fatigue/sleepiness identification. In particular those RTIs that occur in urban areas and at slow speeds may not be identified. While important to have a strategy for identifying fatigue/sleepiness related RTIs proxy measures appear best suited to identifying specific subsets of such RTIs...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{identified}} medical errors {{as a significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} among patients {{in a number of different}} countries. A variety approaches have been implemented to identify errors and their causes. To gain the better understanding of these phenomena, learn more about the incidence and type of medical errors, and the factor contributing to these errors, we first need to acquire a broad range of raw data relating to patient safety and quality of care and perform a comprehensive analysis of the data. Transfusion medicine lacks a standard method for the systematic collection and analysis of event reports. The most frequent use is Medical Event Reporting System for Transfusion Medicine (MERS-TM) which has been developed decade ago by Kaplan and al. MERS-TM utilizes descriptive coding and causal classification schemes. The Eindhoven Classification Model (Medical Version) was adopted for causal classification and analysis. The MERS-TM system is used in our hospital until 2002. The present study analyzed 36 adverse events reported between 2002. and 2010. and 908 <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> events <b>reported</b> in 2007. Sample collection and identification of patients were found to be the highest risk step in the work process. The pediatric, especially neonatal intensive unit, was identified as high-risk clinical area. The data showed multiple causes for events. We identified clusters of identical transfusion incidents and established database with suggesting solutions for each case. This study confirms that <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> events occur far more frequently than adverse events causing harm. High risk errors occur most frequently outside the transfusion service, and the bedside of the patient is the main location. Our data can be used to identify areas where resources need to be targeted in order to prevent future harm to patients, improving the overall safety of transfusion...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{release of}} the report 'To err is human' put medical safety and the {{disclosure}} of errors {{to the forefront of}} the health care agenda. Disclosure of medical errors by physicians is vital in this process. We studied the role of background and social psychological factors in internists' willingness to report medical errors. Methods: Survey among a random sample of internists from five teaching hospitals in the Netherlands, all internists and internists in training at the Departments of Internal Medicine of the participating hospitals. Results: Questionnaires were received from 115 participants (response 51 %). The willingness to disclose was related to the severity of the error, with the majority of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> not <b>reported</b> to the head of department or the hospital error committees. Errors were more often reported to colleagues. Positive factors in favour of disclosing were reported more often than negative ones prohibiting disclosure. Motivation, behavioural control and social barriers were related to the disclosure of errors. Conclusion: Personal and social issues contributing to the willingness to report medical errors should be identified and addressed properly to stimulate disclosure. The creation of an atmosphere where disclosing errors is routine seems vital. In addition, it is essential to create a departmental culture where medical errors are discussed in a non-judgmental, safe environment. In order to improve reporting of medical errors, more emphasis should be placed on the individual barriers that preclude adequate reportin...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. (1) To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> incidence ratio (MNMR), maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> to mortality ratio and mortality index. (2) To compare the nature of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> events with that of maternal mortality. (3) To see the trend of <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> events. Design. Audit. Setting. Kasturba Hospital, Manipal University, Manipal, India. Population. <b>Near</b> <b>miss</b> cases & maternal deaths. Methods. Cases were defined based on WHO criteria 2009. Main Outcome Measures. Severe acute maternal morbidity and maternal deaths. Results. There were 7390 deliveries and 131 “near miss” cases during the study period. The Maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> incidence ratio was 17. 8 / 1000 live births, maternal <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> to mortality ratio was 5. 6 [*]:[*] 1, and mortality index was 14. 9 %.
