5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a <b>negative</b> <b>correlation</b> between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and <b>negative</b> <b>correlation</b> between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} choice of the measure of mean abundance on the abundance-occupancy relationship, and to examine the implications for identifying causal mechanisms. Innovation: Simulations were performed to generate stochastic abundance-occupancy data sets covering {{a wide range of}} scenarios representative of empirical abundance-occupancy data. Two common measures of mean abundance were used: local mean abundance (mean abundance calculated using only data from occupied sites) and global mean abundance (mean abundance calculated using all sites or samples). I found that the choice of mean abundance measure had a strong effect on the correlation between abundance and occupancy. Local mean abundance was associated with a high proportion of <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> (mean percentage of <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> across 24 simulations = 44. 39), while global mean abundance was strongly associated with positive correlations (mean percentage of <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> across 24 simulations = 0. 02). Main conclusions: The choice of abundance measure influences the correlation between abundance and occupancy. <b>Negative</b> <b>correlations</b> between local mean abundance and occupancy are an inherent and unavoidable consequence of using this measure of abundance. Efforts to identify causal mechanisms that give rise to the abundance-occupancy relationship have attempted to explain occasional <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> when the expectation was for positive correlations. This study shows that <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> arise from the choice of mean abundance measure and that this artefact confounds efforts to identify ecological causal mechanisms. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} was to examine functional connectivity linked to the auditory system in patients with bothersome tinnitus. Activity was low frequency (3 brain volumes in 17 patients with moderate-severe bothersome tinnitus (Tinnitus Handicap Index: average 53. 5 ± 3. 6 (range 38 - 76)) and 17 age-matched controls. Results In bothersome tinnitus, <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> reciprocally characterized functional connectivity between auditory and occipital/visual cortex. <b>Negative</b> <b>correlations</b> indicate that when BOLD response magnitudes increased in auditory or visual cortex they decreased in the linked visual or auditory cortex, suggesting reciprocally phase reversed activity between functionally connected locations in tinnitus. Both groups showed similar connectivity with positive correlations within the auditory network. Connectivity for primary visual cortex in tinnitus included extensive <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> in the ventral attention temporoparietal junction and in the inferior frontal gyrus and rostral insula - executive control network components. Rostral insula and inferior frontal gyrus connectivity in tinnitus also showed greater <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> in occipital cortex. Conclusions These results imply that in bothersome tinnitus there is dissociation between activity in auditory cortex and visual, attention and control networks.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} was to examine functional connectivity linked to the auditory system in patients with bothersome tinnitus. Activity was low frequency (< 0. 1 Hz), spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses at rest. The question was whether the experience of chronic bothersome tinnitus induced changes in synaptic efficacy between co-activated components. Functional connectivity for seed regions in auditory, visual, attention, and control networks was computed across all 2 mm 3 brain volumes in 17 patients with moderate-severe bothersome tinnitus (Tinnitus Handicap Index: average 53. 5 ± 3. 6 (range 38 - 76)) and 17 agematched controls.

40|$|The {{past decades}} have {{witnessed}} extensive efforts to correlate fitness traits with genomic heterozygosity. While positive correlations are revealed {{in most of}} the organisms studied, results of no/negative correlations are not uncommon. There has been little effort to reveal the genetic causes of these <b>negative</b> <b>correlations.</b> The positive correlations are regarded either as evidence for functional overdominance in large, randomly mating populations at equilibrium, or the results of populations at disequilibrium under dominance. More often, the positive correlations are viewed as a phenomenon of heterosis, so that it cannot possibly occur under within-locus additive allelic effects. Here we give exact genetic conditions that give rise to positive and <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> in populations at Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibria, thus offering a genetic explanation for the observed <b>negative</b> <b>correlations.</b> Our results demonstrate that the above interpretations concerning the positive correlations are not complete or even necessary. Such a positive correlation can result under dominance and potentially under additivity, even in populations where associated overdominance due to linked alleles at different loci is not significant. Additionally, <b>negative</b> <b>correlations</b> and heterosis can co-occur in a single population. Although our emphasis is on equilibrium populations and for biallelic genetic systems, the basic conclusions are generalized to non-equilibrium populations and for multi-allelic situations...|$|R

Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant <b>negative</b> <b>correlation</b> between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations.

25|$|Prayer {{appears to}} have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also {{positively}} correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a <b>negative</b> <b>correlation</b> between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in an almost fetal position, are suggestive of “social touch” actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased {{blood flow to the}} head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.|$|E
40|$|A more {{complete}} picture of the timing and patterns of the ENSO signal during the seasonal cycle {{for the whole of}} Africa over the three last decades is provided using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Indeed, NDVI has a higher spatial resolution and is more frequently updated than in situ climate databases, and highlights the impact of ENSO on vegetation dynamics as a combined result of ENSO on rainfall, solar radiation, and temperature.
