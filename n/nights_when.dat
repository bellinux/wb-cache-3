5|$|Hordern's London debut came in January 1937, as an {{understudy}} to Bernard Lee in {{the play}} Night Sky at the Savoy Theatre. On <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> he was not required, Hordern would {{be called upon to}} undertake the duties of assistant stage manager, for which he was paid £2.10s a week. In March, Daltry, who had since formed his own company, Westminster Productions, cast Hordern as Ludovico in Othello.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
5|$|There are two diamond {{switches}} {{near the}} western end of this station, located between the local and express tracks in each direction. This switch is used in revenue service. E and F trains use it to switch from the Queens Boulevard express tracks to the local tracks, allowing them to stop at 75th Avenue. The F uses these switches at all times, while the E only uses them on weekends and during weekday evenings. The stretch of local track between 71st Avenue and 75th Avenue is only used in revenue service during late <b>nights,</b> <b>when</b> the E runs local.|$|E
5|$|Woodhaven Boulevard is a {{local station}} on the IND Queens Boulevard Line of the New York City Subway, {{consisting}} of four tracks. Located in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, it is served by the R train at all times except <b>nights,</b> <b>when</b> the E train takes over service. The M train provides additional service here on weekdays except nights. The station serves the adjacent Queens Center Mall, as well as numerous bus lines.|$|E

5|$|Lamenting at a bar, {{she meets}} Johnnie (Mark Proksch), a former mate at their {{secondary}} school. Johnnie confesses his anxiety regarding a scheduled interview with Bubblegum {{for a business}} venture. Lumpy advises that he fix his posture as to appear more confident. Johnnie thanks Lumpy for her advice and invites her to his complex. There, the two {{fall in love and}} share good <b>nights.</b> <b>When</b> Johnnie finds Lumpy absent in the morning, he suspects that she has abandoned him. Much to his relief, he finds her waiting for breakfast in his kitchen. When he returns from the interview, he reveals he has been invited to a separate meeting with Bubblegum at her castle. Lumpy asks that she appear with him, but Johnnie says the meeting is private. Supposing Bubblegum has stolen his heart, Lumpy leaves in a fit of rage.|$|E

Within a month, the show was moved to Sunday nights, where it would stay until halfway through the season, when it took a Friday-night slot. Dallas remained on Fridays until the show ended in 1991, alternating between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. airings.|$|E
25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
25|$|COP Keating became {{increasingly}} {{isolated in the}} summer of 2009. Ground resupply became almost impossible due to the area's limited roads and the threat of insurgent attacks. Furthermore, Camp Keating's location, surrounded by mountains on three sides, exposed helicopters and the outpost's garrison to insurgent fire. Towards the end, resupply flights were limited to moonless <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> near total darkness offered some protection to helicopter crews and their craft. The nearest attack helicopters were located in Jalalabad, a thirty-minute flight away.|$|E

25|$|City Hall, {{notwithstanding}} its architectural grandeur, {{was never}} an important station. In its final year of use, it served only 600 passengers per day and was not open at <b>nights</b> (<b>when</b> trains continued to the loop station at South Ferry). The Brooklyn Bridge station, located a short walk away, {{at the opposite end}} of City Hall Park, was more popular, as it provided both local and express service, including trains to Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Bridge streetcar terminal and Park Row station on the BMT elevated lines were above for easy transfers. Given the extensive renovations that would have been required to bring the station up to modern standards, the city decided to close it instead. The final day of service was December 31, 1945.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to maintaining rights to films from various distributors, HBO also produces its own made-for-cable movies through HBO Films; the film division, originally named HBO Pictures, began producing original movies {{for the network}} in 1983 with the debut of The Terry Fox Story. Unlike most television films produced for cable television, most of the original movies produced by HBO have featured major film actors over the years, ranging from James Stewart to Michael Douglas. The channel also produces stand-up comedy specials, which were formerly broadcast under the On Location, HBO Comedy Hour and HBO Comedy Half-Hour banners, which periodically premiere on certain Saturday <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> a boxing match or movie is not scheduled during the late prime time slots.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2012, NBC Sports was {{reportedly}} involved in negotiations for a television contract with Major League Baseball. NBCSN was expected to play a large part in NBC's bid. However, it was likely that NBC would want either marquee event (All-Star Game and World Series) to air on the broadcast network rather than cable. This could have potentially conflicted with the network's broadcasts of Sunday Night Football, which has generally had a game or two scheduled on <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> a World Series game is held since 2010; however, prior to this, no game was scheduled on these nights so {{it would not have}} been unprecedented. Besides the potential conflicts with Sunday Night Football, another disadvantage for NBCSN is that it was available in fewer than 80 million homes, trailing the national reach of both Fox Sports 1 and TBS.|$|E
