(Homoptera: Aphididae), a major pest insect on apple, was assessed in one-year field experiments in Switzerland. Single and multiple applications of pyrethrin and kaolin were tested at different dates after apple harvesting in autumn 2002 when sexuales of the rosy apple aphid were present. Repeated applications of Surround WP in autumn significantly reduced the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> females in autumn and, consequently, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> fundatrices in spring. Single kaolin treatments were less effective. Unexpectedly, neither single nor multiple applications of the contact insecticide Pyrethrum FS had a knock-down effect on females in autumn.

A total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 23 473 eggs from hens of all 9 aforementioned lines were set after being artificially inseminated. The total average hatchability of set eggs was 73. 2 % and the average percentage of unfertilised eggs was 9. 3 %. Positive correlations (r p = 0. 22 to r p = 0. 72; P < 0. 01) were found between the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs laid till the 240 th day of age and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs produced {{at the beginning of the}} laying period in the all studied lines. There were negative correlations (r p =− 0. 03 to r p =− 0. 16; P < 0. 01) between the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs laid till the 240 th day of age and the average egg weight (on the 222 nd day of age).

Correlations between the egg weight and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicks/hen were negative to zero and their values ranged from r p =− 0. 19 (P p = 0. 02. Correlations between the egg weight and hatchability were always negative (r p =− 0. 15; P p =− 0. 04). Regarding the fact that there is a concurrent selection for an increased egg weight it can be said that this preference of smaller eggs is really counter-productive. A positive relationship between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> eggs/hen and the hatchability (r p =− 0. 02 to r p = 0. 39; P < 0. 01) was influenced by calculated negative correlations existing between the weight of eggs and the hatchability as well as between the weight of eggs and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> laid eggs. As far as the hatchability is concerned, it can be concluded that in the aforementioned laying lines those hens are preferred, which produce more eggs of smaller size and that this fact obviously influences also the efficiency of selection for a greater weight of produced eggs...|$|R

We explored banding data from 1997 - 2009 to examine yearly patterns of abundance and survivorship for the 10 most common breeding species. We found that survivorship patterns vary by species. We documented Nashville and Yellow warblers {{living up to}} 4 years, while some Dusky Flycatchers, MacGillivray’s Warblers and Chipping Sparrows lived 7 years or more. In fact several Western Tanagers and Dusky Flycatchers exceed or match longevity records in the USGS Bird Banding Lab database. The ratio <b>of</b> <b>hatch</b> year birds (hatched that spring) to adults lends insight into survivorship, productivity and recruitment in the community. Species may have low <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatch</b> years one year yet high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> second year birds (hatched the previous spring) the next year. This was particularly seen in Warbling Vireos and suggests that immigration is important for this species.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} genetic correlations between the behavioural profile and performance in laying hens as an indirect answer to the question whether the observed behavioural responses are associated with increased levels of stress in these birds. Methods The assessment of birds’ temperament was carried out using the novel objects test. The behavioural test was conducted in two successive generations comprising 9, 483 Rhode Island White (RIW) birds (approx. 4, 700 individuals per generation) and 4, 326 Rhode Island Red (RIR) birds (approx. 2, 100 individuals per generation). Based on the recorded responses, the birds were divided into two groups: a fearful profile (1, 418 RIW hens and 580 RIR hens) and a brave/curious profile (8, 065 RIW hens and 3, 746 RIR hens). The birds were subjected to standard assessment of their performance traits, including SM, age at sexual maturity; ST, shell thickness; SG, egg specific gravity; EW, mean egg weight; IP, initial egg production; and HC, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicks. The pedigree was three generations deep (including two behaviour-recorded generations). Estimation of the (co) variance components was performed with the Gibbs sampling method, which accounts for the discrete character of the behavioural profile denotation. Results The analyses revealed negative correlations between the performance traits of the laying hens and the behavioural profile defined as fearful. In the group of fearful RIW birds, delayed sexual maturation (0. 22) as well as a decrease in the initial egg production (− 0. 30), egg weight (− 0. 54), egg specific gravity (− 0. 331), shell thickness (− 0. 11), and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicks (− 0. 24) could be expected. These correlations were less pronounced in the RIR breed, in which the fearful birds exhibited a decline in hatchability (− 0. 37), egg specific gravity (− 0. 11), and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> chicks (− 0. 18). There were no correlations in the case of the other traits or they were positive but exhibited a substantial standard error, as for the egg weight. Conclusion To sum up the results obtained, it can be noted that behavioural responses indicating fearfulness, i. e. escape, avoidance, and approach-avoidance may reflect negative emotions experienced by birds. The negative correlations with performance in the group of fearful hens may indirectly indicate a high level of stress in these birds, especially in the white-feathered birds, where stronger performance-fearfulness correlations were found. Fearful birds should be eliminated from breeding by inclusion of the behavioural profile in the selection criterion in the case of laying hens...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of various}} diets on Eudrilus eugeniae (Oligochaeta) coccon {{production}} {{and the effects of}} various incubating media on hatchability of the cocoons, were studied in culture pots. The results indicated that the Pennisetum polystachion (Shum et Thonn) grass diet, as compared to the Panicum maximum (L) grass diet induced more and faster cocoon production, greater hatchability, greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> worms per correlated to weight- 1  cocoon (size) and varied with the cocoons were laid and isolated, and (for cocoons isolated from a given diet) the type of the incubating media significanty influenced hatchability and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> worms per <b>hatch.</b> Generally vermicompost material (mostly earthworm castas and little organic residues) constituted favourable incubating media which gave rise to great hatchability and hight <b>number</b> <b>of</b> worms per <b>hatch.</b> The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> days to <b>hatching</b> <b>of</b> cocoons was negatively correlated to the stage (duration days) at wich they were laid. Cocoons laid at later vermicomposting stage hatched out faster than those laid at the earlier stage...|$|R
40|$|The egg case of Cryptocephalus rufipes (Goeze) is {{described}} and illustrated. In laboratory trials, eggs of field-collected C. rufipes were observed for larval emergence (untreated control) or exposed to {{two species of}} generalist predators, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) or Xylocoris flavipes (Reuter) in no-choice experiments. The behaviour of the predators upon contact with the C. rufipes eggs was observed. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> larvae was counted and compared. In the presence {{of each of the}} two species of predators, larval emergence was significantly reduced. Eggs that were not protected by an egg case were completely consumed by the predators. C. rufipes eggs were therefore incompletely protected from the studied generalist predators. This is the first study showing experimentally the protective function of cryptocephaline egg case...|$|R
5000|$|Spread of vector-borne diseases, in particular, tick-borne infections like Lyme disease (borreliosis) and tick-borne encephalitis. Ticks {{have spread}} northwards and can now even {{be found in}} the regions of Norrland. Also, there are still five species of {{mosquitoes}} in Sweden that may spread the malaria parasite. With the last indigenous case reported in the 1930s, a few new cases of malaria may appear with increasing temperature. The anopheles species of mosquitoes that spread the malaria parasite are sensitive to weather conditions that can be affected by climate change. Increased precipitation affects the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatching</b> places <b>of</b> the mosquitoes, while an increase in humidity and temperature increases the life span of the mosquitoes and the development of the malaria parasite inside the mosquito.|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{significance of}} embryo mortality in demersally spawning coral reef fishes is poorly understood. Here we describe patterns {{of variation in}} embryo mortality in Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae) at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef). The aim {{was to determine whether}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> embryos <b>hatched</b> substantially differed from egg production, and if so, identify whether predatory fishes were a source of embryo mortality. Spawning success (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs laid), embryo mortality (proportion of embryos that died prior to <b>hatching)</b> and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> embryos <b>hatching</b> were estimated from daily maps of clutches laid on artificial surfaces (PVC tiles) defended by nesting males. Patterns of variation in eggs laid, embryo mortality and <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> embryos <b>hatched</b> were examined at three spatial scales: (1) among widely-spaced locations around the island; (2) between adjacent reef slope and patch reef habitats occupied by P. amboinensis at a single location; and (3) among different males within these two habitats. The embryo mortality was extremely high, with a mean of 25. 9 pm ± 6. 2 % (S. E.) for 4 locations examined in 1994 and a mean of 69. 2 pm ± 2. 9 % for two habitats surveyed in 1995. There {{were no significant differences in}} embryo mortality among locations or habitats in either year. This meant that spatial patterns in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> embryos <b>hatching</b> reflected differences in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs laid on tiles. Embryo mortality was extremely variable on the scale of individual territories, with embryo mortality commonly ranging from 0 % to 100 %. Much of the mortality could be attributed to diurnal predatory fishes, especially the wrasse Thalassoma lunare. However, variation in predator densities did not explain spatial patterns in embryo mortality rates. Both solitary and group predatory behaviour was observed, with groups often causing 100 % embryo mortality. The level of embryo mortality observed suggests that predation prior to hatching may have a substantial effect on the reproductive output of populations of this demersal-nesting fish...|$|R
50|$|As {{the first}} queen bee to hatch will kill rival hatchlings, {{the eggs are}} covered with a small plastic cage. This {{prevents}} a newly hatched queen from approaching the other eggs, and thus harming them. This allows a beekeeper {{to return to the}} hive to find a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> newly <b>hatched</b> queen bees.|$|R
40|$|As {{the amino}} acid taurine {{is being used}} more {{frequently}} in human and animal diets, the exact physiological role and benefit have not been fully elucidated. To determine if taurine can impact long term physiology, we investigated {{the effects of a}} chronic taurine supplemented diet using the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We specifically studied how life span and development are affected. A pairwise comparison of survival curves found a significant difference between male and female fruit flies supplemented with a taurine diet. Another pairwise comparison found a significant difference between taurine and normal fed fruit flies with respect to gender. Fruit fly eggs are sensitive to exogenous taurine concentrations reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hatched</b> larvae. Present studies indicate chronic taurine provided throughout the life time may be beneficial to life span extension in adulthood...|$|R
