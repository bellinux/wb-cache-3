40|$|PURPOSE. To {{elucidate}} mechanisms {{behind the}} morphology of Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis (TSPK). METHODS. Sixteen patients were examined with the slit lamp and photographed by non-contact photomicrography. The results {{were compared with}} morphology of epithelial keratitis in herpes simplex type 1 (HSV 1), varicella zoster (VZV), and adenovirus type 8 (Ad 8) infections, all previously studied by the same method, and with published histologic findings in TSPK. RESULTS. In the photographs, the corneal epithelium showed various numbers of abnormal subsurface cells measuring about 10 - 15 mum in diameter, present individually, in small groups, or aggregated in larger lesions (coarse lesions with the slit lamp). The surface epithelium was well preserved, except in larger lesions, which showed surface debris. The morphology was unlike HSV 1 and VZV epithelial keratitis, but strongly resembled epithelial changes occurring in Ad 8 infections on day 5, and later, after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSIONs. TSPK shows a more widespread epithelial involvement than suspected with the slit lamp. Its morphology seems to reflect an action of a <b>noxious</b> <b>agent</b> targeted at the deeper epithelial layers, {{with the appearance of}} abnormal cells as a result. These might represent invading inflammatory cells, damaged intraepithelial ones, or both. The coarse lesions visualize areas of major involvement showing discernible signs of cell destruction. The similarity to Ad 8 keratitis suggests that the source of the <b>noxious</b> <b>agent</b> might be located outside the cornea. The morphology, in conjunction with clinical features, is compatible with an immunologically mediated injury. The etiology remains unknown. (Eur J Ophthalmol 2004; 14 : 85 - 93...|$|E

30|$|Neuropathic pain, {{arising from}} a lesion {{of the nervous}} system, is defined as {{persistent}} intractable pain disproportional between {{the extent of the}} lesion and the severity of the pain. It is associated with sensory and/or motor disturbance [1]. Neurostenalgia is a neuropathic pain that results from continuing irritation of an anatomically intact nerve by a <b>noxious</b> <b>agent</b> [1]. It may be chronic or acute and is not associated with excess sudomotor or vasomotor activity. Common causes include compression, distortion, ischaemia or tethering of the nerve. Removal of the causative agent typically results in immediate relief of pain and a more gradual recovery of nerve function. If the cause persists, irreversible changes in the affected nerve may occur with the nerve lesion worsening from that of a conduction block to a degenerative lesion [1]. It is therefore important that pain in relation to nerve palsy is recognised and acted upon quickly to prevent significant nerve damage from occurring.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{describe}} {{the present state of}} knowledge regarding host susceptibility factors that may determine the occurrence, development and severity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) caused by exogenous agents. First, host susceptibility may pertain to differences in the delivery and/or persistence of the <b>noxious</b> <b>agent</b> in the lung. The deposition and clearance of inhaled particles or fibres may vary depending on innate anatomical or physiological characteristics, and on acquired changes, such as nasal disease or smoking-induced alterations. Genetically- or environmentally-induced interindividual differences in the expression of pulmonary biotransformation enzymes may form the basis for, or contribute to the risk of, drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Secondly, there are genetic and acquired variations in various enzymatic and nonenzymatic defence systems that protect cells and tissues against oxidative stress, which is often involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease caused by particles, fibres, metals, organic agents and drugs. Thirdly, the occurrence of immunological sensitization is dependent on both geneti...|$|E

Several explanations for the mechanism of effect in olfactory aversion have been offered. Two of these, one using a nausea-producing agent and one using a pain-producing agent are described. The procedure using the pain-producing agent is the simplest to implement, the least ambiguous, and offers the least cumbersome explanation for the behavioral effect observed in olfactory aversion.
