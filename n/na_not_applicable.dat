30|$|Also as an {{instrument}} in this experiment, the use of two questionnaires: a General Information Questionnaire and the QUIS 7.0 for satisfaction measures, this last has a good recognition {{in the field of}} user satisfaction and is used in several mobile usability evaluation studies (Hussain and Kutar 2012 a). The QUIS 7.0 designed by a group of researchers in Human–Computer Interaction at the University of Maryland was used to collect the user’s opinions and to evaluate their satisfaction on different aspects of an interface on a 9 -point scale (Chin et al. 1988). It includes the following components: a demographic questionnaire, the evaluation of the system satisfaction via six scales, and the measures of nine specific interface factors: screen aspects, terminology and system information, learning aspects, system capabilities, technical user guides, online help and online tutorials, multimedia, conferencing, and methods of software installation. Each interface factor has a question as a major component followed by subcomponents questions, each of which rated on a scale of 1 – 9, with significant positive adjectives on the right, other negative on the left and <b>NA</b> (<b>not</b> <b>applicable).</b> The questionnaire also contains free text boxes for each section that allows the user to list his comments and provide feedbacks (Harper et al. 1990).|$|E
