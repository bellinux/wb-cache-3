5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the <b>national</b> <b>police</b> <b>force,</b> paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police.

Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the <b>national</b> <b>police</b> <b>force,</b> producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E
