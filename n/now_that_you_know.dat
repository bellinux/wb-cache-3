60|$|GILBEY. Radical! What do you mean? Dont {{you begin}} to take liberties, Juggins, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> we're loth to part with you. Your brother isnt a duke, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for the tribute. You imagined, of course, that I was a scene-shifter. And <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all about me, what of Gavrillac? What of my godfather?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have spoken}} her name," [...] said he, at last, in an altered and tremulous tone; [...] "tell me, <b>now,</b> all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All I want to know, {{after such}} a hint. A man is never anxious to make the {{acquaintance}} of parents who are afraid to own him. I dare say, <b>now,</b> Miles, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> and loved, and respected your mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! but you, my lord cardinal, <b>you</b> must interfere. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> at last <b>know</b> him, <b>you</b> must {{undertake}} the great task; you must save him." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS GEORGE. Yes: it's mean to let poor {{things in}} {{for so much}} while theyre in that state. Would you marry <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> better {{if you were a}} widower? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{what she}} is," [...] cried Mr. Worthington, rising and smiting {{the pile of}} letters on his desk, [...] "why do you keep her there an instant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Morgan {{walked on}} {{and after a}} little had begun again: “Well, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I know and {{that we look at}} the facts and keep nothing back—it’s much more comfortable, isn’t it?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what am I to call <b>you,</b> your honour, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are Captain Gerald O'Carroll, and not Desmond Kennedy, at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{something}} like <b>that.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how things are, you must choose your line. I can't judge how far your duty {{to your parents}} binds you; you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{am afraid}} of nothing, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are near me. I <b>knew</b> so well <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would come. I have been expecting {{you all the}} evening." ...|$|R
60|$|THE PRINCESS. It's too dreadful {{to think}} of. I wonder {{you can be}} so coarse. I really don't think you'll suit. I feel sure <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> more about men than you should.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you may {{understand}} that it is refused once for all," [...] said Carrington. [...] "I will not have another birch felled on Green Mountain. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> my views there is an end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "Mistress Fate {{has been}} ahead of me. The good lady {{is in the}} habit of doing that sort of thing. And <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the parties in question, what have you to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to ask you to be a Sir Charles Grandison, Mr. Eames. But never mind all <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> that girl has {{absolutely}} had her first sitting for the picture?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Merton groaned. 'I bar the fellow, anyhow,' he said. 'But, in any case, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{have found}} me out, I must be going. If only she were as poor as I am!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Richard. Your anger {{makes you}} forget many things. Remember {{that he is}} a {{dangerous}} man, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he <b>knows</b> <b>you</b> are in London he holds your liberty, perhaps your life, in his hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And here is Jim!" [...] shouted {{that young}} moonlighter. [...] "So <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> we are here, where Brother Newcombe has been {{watching}} for the last dozen hours, suppose the whole posse of you drive back to Bradford, where you belong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can see," [...] Sherikov said finally, {{waving a}} chicken leg, [...] "that your {{appearance}} {{here has been}} very upsetting to our program. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> more about us {{you can see why}} Commissioner Reinhart was so interested in destroying you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you will, Señora. Certainly I {{forgive her}} this indiscretion, if {{at last she}} has shown you the truth about that man for whose sake you have endured so much. Margaret, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{him for what he}} is, say, do you still cling to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{said just}} <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did not <b>know</b> where your place was," [...] she continued. [...] "You called {{yourself}} nobody's man. Why, the most ignorant person who thinks about things {{could tell you}} where you belong. Even I could tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I summoned {{you back}} to Pesaro," [...] she {{continued}} pitilessly, [...] "trusting in your fine words and deeming honest the offer of services <b>you</b> made me. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> you are free to depart from Pesaro when you will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, boy! it's {{all very}} well for <b>you</b> to say <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> well enough <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would rather have lost your ears than have missed such a chance as this. But, I say, it'll puzzle <b>you</b> to stuff <b>that</b> fellow, won't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, young sir, she is Elsa Brant, {{the only}} child of Hendrik Brant, the famous {{goldsmith}} of The Hague, but doubtless <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> her name you know all that also, for she must be some kind of cousin to you. Husband, help Elsa on to her mule." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the first, you know," [...] he answered, [...] "you took an {{interest}} in my prospects. You were on my side. That gratified me, I assure you. And <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what they have done to me, I am sure you are with me all the more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mary," [...] said poor Una in distress. [...] "I don't believe God {{will send}} you to hell for telling lies when you didn't know it was wrong. He COULDN'T. Why, He's kind and good. Of course, you mustn't tell any more <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose that's so," [...] said Miss Duncan, thoughtfully, [...] "only you're {{very clever}} {{to have seen}} it. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> I think you a more {{remarkable}} person than ever. You don't seem at all like a country girl, and you don't talk like one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no doubt," [...] said he, [...] "as to {{his being}} a blackguard. He was hunting for your money, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he <b>knows</b> <b>you</b> have got none, he will trouble you no further." [...] Then {{he made a}} move from the place on which he stood, {{as if he were}} going.|$|R
6000|$|... "This tumult {{will die}} out soon," [...] he went on, {{in the effort}} to comfort her, [...] "and then I can come on to Washington for a visit. I warn you I've lost all my scruples; {{seventeen}} hundred million dollars are as straws in my path, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> really care for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't do that," [...] {{replied the}} boy, decidedly; [...] "but, having seen these, {{you may be}} able to {{discover}} their construction for yourself. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> such things to be possible and practical, the hint should be sufficient to enable a shrewd electrician to prepare duplicates of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. That is natural. It {{would have}} been a great misfortune if you had loved him before you had reason to know that he loved you;--a great misfortune. But now,--now that you cannot but think of him, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what his wishes are, perhaps you may learn--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have told you all this long ago," [...] she said simply. [...] "To-day I felt that I must tell you without another hour's delay. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I am not so terrified. But you must promise {{to come and see}} me every day while that brute remains in London." ...|$|E
5000|$|There's {{a kind of}} truism <b>now</b> in art, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{all good}} art is political. I'm not sure that's true. I think my work deals {{with the real world}} and it deals {{sometimes}} with social problems but I've absolutely no delusions about the power of art to change peoples minds. I think the least effective way of effecting social change is to take photographs. Geoffrey James ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange! that I {{should be}} so much more prejudiced than I <b>knew.</b> What will <b>you</b> think of me when I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your {{profession}} does not seem half so shocking <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> to be {{the son of an}} artist, and not a journeyman butcher or a laborer, as my cousin told me." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a child, Hedman {{originally}} {{started out}} playing as a goaltender. His father, Olle Hedman, told his son {{that if he}} left the net, he would purchase him the new helmet that he coveted. He has not played in goal since that day. Victor said [...] "I'm thankful for <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> <b>You</b> never <b>know</b> {{what would have happened}} otherwise." ...|$|R
