He published a volume of French-language poetry, titled La guerre ("The War", 1919). In 1920, Giuseppe Ungaretti married the Frenchwoman Jeanne Dupoix, {{with whom he had}} a daughter, <b>Ninon</b> (born 1925), and a son, Antonietto (born 1930).|$|E
25|$|Charlotte <b>Ninon</b> Coleman (3 April 1968 – 14 November 2001) was an English actress {{best known}} for playing Scarlett in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral, Jess in the {{television}} drama Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, and her childhood roles of Sue in Worzel Gummidge and the character Marmalade Atkins. Coleman died of an acute asthma attack in Holloway, North London, aged 33.|$|E
25|$|Conflict {{seems to}} have broken out between the towns of Sybaris and Croton. The forces of Croton were headed by the Pythagorean Milo, {{and it is likely}} that the members of the brotherhood took a {{prominent}} part. After the decisive victory by Croton, a proposal for establishing a more democratic constitution, was unsuccessfully resisted by the Pythagoreans. Their enemies, headed by Cylon and <b>Ninon,</b> the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from the brotherhood, roused the populace against them. An attack was made upon them while assembled either in the house of Milo, or in some other meeting-place. The building was set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the younger and more active escaping. Similar commotions ensued in the other cities of Magna Graecia in which Pythagorean clubs had been formed.|$|E
25|$|Weill's family {{experienced}} financial hardship in {{the aftermath}} of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a répétiteur at the Friedrich-Theater {{under the direction of the}} new Kapellmeister, Hans Knappertsbusch. During this time, he composed an orchestral suite in E-flat major, a symphonic poem of Rainer Maria Rilke's The Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke as well as Schilflieder, a cycle of five songs to poems by Nikolaus Lenau. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in Lüdenscheid, where he directed opera, operetta, and singspiel for five months, and also composed a cello sonata and <b>Ninon</b> de Lenclos, a now lost one-act operatic adaptation of a play by Ernst Hardt. From May to September 1920, Weill spent a couple of months in Leipzig, where his father had become the new director of a Jewish orphanage. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed Sulamith, a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Offenbach {{intended}} {{that the}} four soprano roles be played by the same singer, for Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia are three facets of Stella, Hoffmann's unreachable love. Similarly, the four villains (Lindorf, Coppélius, Miracle, and Dapertutto) would be performed by the same bass-baritone, because they are all manifestations of evil. While the doubling of the four villains is quite common, most performances of the work use different singers for the loves of Hoffmann. This is because different skills are needed for each role: Olympia requires a skilled coloratura singer with stratospheric high notes, Antonia is written for a more lyric voice, and Giulietta is usually performed by a dramatic soprano or a mezzo-soprano. When all three roles (four if the role of Stella is counted) are performed by a single soprano in a performance, it {{is considered one of}} the largest challenges in the lyric-coloratura repertoire. Notable sopranos who have sung all three roles include Karan Armstrong, Vina Bovy, Edita Gruberová, Fanny Heldy, Catherine Malfitano, Anja Silja, Beverly Sills, Ruth Ann Swenson, Carol Vaness, <b>Ninon</b> Vallin and Virginia Zeani. All four roles have been performed by Josephine Barstow, Diana Damrau, Elizabeth Futral, Marlis Petersen, Georgia Jarman, Elena Moșuc and Joan Sutherland.|$|E
500|$|In October 1866 Massenet and <b>Ninon</b> were married; {{their only}} child, Juliette, {{was born in}} 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly {{interrupted}} by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which {{he served as a}} volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so [...] "utterly terrible" [...] that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.|$|E
500|$|Fauré made piano {{rolls of}} his music for several {{companies}} between 1905 and 1913. Well over a hundred recordings of Fauré's music were made between 1898 and 1905, mostly of songs, with a few short chamber works, by performers including the singers Jean Noté and Pol Plançon and players such as Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot. By the 1920s a range of Fauré's more popular songs were on record, including [...] "Après un rêve" [...] sung by Olga Haley, and [...] "Automne" [...] and [...] "Clair de lune" [...] sung by <b>Ninon</b> Vallin. In the 1930s better-known performers recorded Fauré pieces, including Georges Thill ("En prière"), and Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot (Violin Sonata No. 1 and Berceuse). The Sicilienne from Pelléas et Mélisande was recorded in 1938.|$|E
500|$|The prize {{brought a}} well-subsidised three-year period of study, two-thirds {{of which was}} spent at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. At that time the academy was {{dominated}} by painters rather than musicians; Massenet enjoyed his time there, and made lifelong friendships with, among others, the sculptor Alexandre Falguière and the painter Carolus-Duran, but the musical benefit he derived was largely self-taught. He absorbed the music at St Peter's, and closely studied {{the works of the}} great German masters, from Handel and Bach to contemporary composers. During his time in Rome, Massenet met Franz Liszt, at whose request he gave piano lessons to Louise-Constance [...] "Ninon" [...] de Gressy, the daughter of one of Liszt's rich patrons. Massenet and <b>Ninon</b> fell in love, but marriage {{was out of the question}} while he was a student with modest means.|$|E

2500|$|On her {{way back}} Christina visited the {{beautiful}} and atheistic <b>Ninon</b> de l'Enclos in the convent at Lagny-sur-Marne. In early October she left France and arrived in Torino. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in Pesaro, probably to flee the plague in Rome. (The plague infested several regions including Naples, where 250,000 people died within two years.) In July 1657 she returned to France, likely being impatient. It is not known where she stayed that summer. In Fontainebleau she was ordered by the court to halt.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the run of}} Carminetta, Delysia {{returned}} to revue in As You Were, by Herman Darewski and Arthur Wimperis, adapted from a French revue, Plus ça change. It opened in August 1918 at the London Pavilion, newly refurbished by Cochran ("transformed almost beyond recognition", according to The Observer). The show was structured around Delysia, giving her the chance to shine in a succession of roles including <b>Ninon</b> de l'Enclos, Helen of Troy, Elizabeth I, and Cleopatra. She also appeared as Lucifer, once again coming {{to the attention of}} the Lord Chamberlain for the skin-tight black costume in which she appeared. The Morning Post commented, [...] "Never can an actress have worn so negligible a dress".|$|E
2500|$|It was in Lyon that {{he first}} heard an orchestra, saw his first operas (Boris Godunov and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg) and met the {{well-known}} soprano <b>Ninon</b> Vallin, who {{asked him to}} accompany her in arias from Aida and La Damnation de Faust. Impressed by his ability, she persuaded Léon to allow his son {{to apply to the}} Conservatoire in Lyon, but the selection board rejected him. Boulez was determined to pursue a career in music. The following year, with his sister's support in the face of opposition from his father, he studied the piano and harmony privately with Lionel de Pachmann (son of the pianist Vladimir). [...] "Our parents were strong, but finally we were stronger than they," [...] Boulez would later say. In fact, when he moved to Paris in the autumn of 1943, Léon accompanied him, helped him to find a room (at 14 rue Oudinot, near the Invalides) and subsidised him until he could earn a living.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of [...] "La engañadora", the {{popularity}} of Orquesta América grew as Jorrín kept writing one hit after another: [...] "El alardoso", [...] "Nada para ti", [...] "El túnel"... Cha-cha-cha had eclipsed both mambo and danzón as the most popular dance style in Cuba. Jorrín claimed {{to be responsible for}} {{the success of}} Orquesta América and was uncomfortable with the band's credits, which always stated [...] "Orquesta América de <b>Ninón</b> Mondéjar". He was named the orchestra's music director in 1954, but Mondéjar still insisted on receiving credit for the success of cha-cha-cha. This led to the departure of Jorrín in August 1954, forming his own band in Mexico City. In November, Mondéjar also moved along with Orquesta América to Mexico City. At this point, the only hit-making charanga in Cuba was Orquesta Aragón, which had briefly collaborated with Jorrín before his departure from Orquesta América. However, in December 1955, some members of Orquesta América returned to Havana and in January 1955 founded Orquesta América del 55.|$|E
2500|$|As Robert Nichols {{stated in}} The Times:Sir Henry possessed the fullest {{as well as}} the wisest mind I have ever known. It was no unusual thing to hear him in the course of one evening {{discourse}} on topics so various as: the influence of reasoning upon Goethe and Mozart, types of apprehension in listeners to symphonic music, sensations while looping the loop (he was over 60 when he did so), the painting of Guardi, 'co-ordination' in a star golfer, <b>Ninon</b> de Lenclos, Conrad as a narrator (Sir Henry was far the ablest literary critic I have ever known), religious ecstasy, the relation of art and science, the social customs of Melanesia. On each of such topics he not only appeared to have more information than anybody in the room, but spoke after a more illuminating fashion, for, like Leonardo (on whom he was an authority) he had a supreme eye for the significant. Nor did he resemble Leonardo in mind only. He had Leonardo's lofty human compassion, humility, patience, and profound serenity of spirit." [...] (10 October 1940) ...|$|E

60|$|I ask'd {{the woman}} about <b>Ninon</b> and the widow. She seemed disturb'd, I thought; but, making no {{reply to the}} first part of my question, said that her {{mistress}} was {{in another part of the}} house, and did not wish to be with company.|$|E
60|$|<b>Ninon</b> was {{too young}} to feel much grief at these sad occurrences; and the mother, {{whatever}} she might have suffer'd inwardly, had a good deal of phlegm and patience, and set about making herself and her remaining child as comfortable as might be. They had still a respectable sum in cash, and after due deliberation, the widow purchas'd the little quiet tavern, not far from the grave of her boy; and of Sundays and holidays she took in considerable money--enough to make a decent support for them in their humble way of living. French and Germans visited the house frequently, and quite a number of young Americans too. Probably the greatest attraction to the latter was the sweet face of <b>Ninon.</b>|$|E

[256] {212}[According to {{the editor}} of Voltaire's Works (Oeuvres, Beuchot, 1830, xix. 378, note 1), there was a report that Casimir, after his {{retirement}} to Paris in 1670, secretly married [...] "Marie Mignot, fille d'une blanchisseuse;" [...] and there are other tales of other loves, e.g. <b>Ninon</b> de Lenclos.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed! I {{should not}} have thought it of old Madame Leroux, she seemed so {{thoroughly}} interested in la pauvre petite. What did you do?

60|$|I need hardly {{say that}} thenceforward every Wednesday {{afternoon}} was {{spent at the}} widow's tavern. Strangely, neither Matthew or my two friends, or myself, spoke to each other of the sentiment that filled us in reference to <b>Ninon.</b> Yet we all knew the thoughts and feelings of the others; and each, perhaps, felt confident that his love alone was unsuspected by his companions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, my poor dear child. Captain Egremont {{with the}} General got off {{with some of}} the crew in a boat when the <b>Ninon</b> was burnt.

Miss Headworth felt as if she had fired a cannon and looked to see the effect.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The <b>Ninon</b> {{was really}} {{reported}} lost with all on board,' said Miss Headworth. 'That was ascertained. He was saved by a Chilian ship, {{and seems to}} have been a good while making his way back to Europe.

60|$|O, {{through the}} years that live no more, my memory strays back, and that whole scene comes up before me once again-and the {{brightest}} {{part of the picture}} is the strange ethereal beauty of that young girl! She was apparently about the age of my brother Matthew, and the most fascinating, artless creature I had ever beheld. She had blue eyes and light hair, and an expression of childish simplicity which was charming indeed. I have no doubt that ere half an hour had elapsed from the time we enter'd the tavern and saw <b>Ninon,</b> every one of the four of us loved the girl to the very depth of passion.|$|E
60|$|We neither {{spent so}} much money, nor drank as much beer, as we had {{intended}} before starting from home. The widow was very civil, being pleased to see us, and Margery served our wants with a deal of politeness--but it was to <b>Ninon</b> that the afternoon's pleasure was attributable; for though we were strangers, we became acquainted at once--the manners of the girl, merry as she was, putting entirely out of view the most distant imputation of indecorum--and {{the presence of the}} widow and Margery, (for we were all in the common room together, there being no other company,) serving to make us all disembarrass'd, and at ease.|$|E
60|$|Madame Eugenie Lalande, quasi Simpson--formerly Moissart--was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother.

By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, {{as well as of}} the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the French metropolis.

Else, why {{at the age of}} sixty, have some women held in the strongest bonds of love and fealty, men young enough to be their grandsons?
