5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hops.|$|E
5|$|North and South Korean forces {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the battle, each side inflicted large numbers of casualties on one another. The exact numbers of casualties are impossible to determine. Both sides {{are known to have}} suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon, the North Korean units in the sector fled back North, <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US Casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E

5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The shadowed {{portion of}} the crater was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim. The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred meters. The bottom is covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention for <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be conclusively dated to <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested {{that it may have}} been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of {{at least part of the}} church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale, {{transient}} supercells {{embedded within}} the outer bands {{of the hurricane}} produced numerous tornadoes throughout its path. Unlike supercells over the Great Plains, these storms last <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours and are often training. Most of the tornadoes occurred in the hurricane's right-front quadrant, where strong low-level wind shear, high moisture content, and low convective available potential energy combined to produce locally favorable tornadic conditions. A study in 2008 conducted through the American Geophysical Union found {{that the majority of}} Katrina-related supercells developed inland over the Gulf Coast rather than offshore, a finding contrary to multiple studies of prior tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|In Proposition 45 of his Principia, Newton applies his theorem of {{revolving}} orbits {{to develop}} a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets. Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses, and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements. The long axis {{is defined as the}} line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point, i.e., the line connecting the two apses. For illustration, the long axis of the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion. Over time, the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually, generally <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> degrees per complete revolution, because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies, oblateness in the attracting body, general relativistic effects, and other effects. Newton's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets.|$|E

5|$|In April 1982, {{the first}} Nationals {{was held at}} Loyola Marymount University in California—16 states and the District of Columbia participated. However, the competition's founder, Dr. Robert Peterson, was {{inspired}} by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event, and so at the 1984 Nationals, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand fielded teams in addition to teams from 32 U.S. states. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> teams a year have competed at Nationals. Since the first national event in 1982, only three states have ever won the National Competition: California, Texas, and Wisconsin, with California having won the majority of the National Competitions. El Camino Real High School from California currently holds the record for the most wins, having won its sixth national title in 2010. The current National Champion is Granada Hills Charter High School from Granada Hills, California.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean 13th and 1st Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles. The 1st Division had numbered 5,000 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 13th Division numbered 9,000. Only 2,000 men from the 1st Division were able to retreat back into North Korea by October. The majority of the division's troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The NK 13th Division, however, was completely annihilated. Only a few isolated pockets of its men were known to have made it back to North Korea. Most of the division's officers, including its artillery commander, division surgeon, the chief of staff, and two of the three regimental commanders. When the NK 19th Regiment surrendered in Tanyang, it had only 167 men. <b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred of the original 9,000 returned to North Korea. All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and the North Korean army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase {{a ticket to}} a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E
