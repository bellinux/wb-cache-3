25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other deep-sea species.

The study provides coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTADs) essential for diet formulations aimed at further growth performance and nutrient utilization studies with gadoids using these waste streams as potential replacements for high-cost fish meals and poorly digestible wheat by-products. Organic matter (OM) CTTAD was significantly improved (P= 0. 005) with Shrimp 150 (0. 82) relative to the Control (0. 79), while Shrimp 300 was similar (0. 79) (P= 1. 000).

40|$|During 1989 - 90 a {{new concept}} to avoid bycatch of fish in shrimp trawl has been {{developed}} in Norway. The system consists of an aluminium grid, 0. 6 - 1. 0 m wide and 1. 3 - l. 5 m long, with bars spaced 19 mm. The grid is installed in the extention piece in front of the codend, angled 45 º, and with a fish outlet on the top. In front of the grid is mounted a guiding funnel or flapper. Several practical tests with commercial trawlers are conducted. Performance of the system and behaviour of fish and shrimp relative to it has been studied with a remote controlled underwater TV-vehicle. Escapement of fish like cod, haddock, redfish and Greenland halibut is better than with any bycatch device tested earlier. Handling cause no significant problems, neither on small nor larger shrimp trawlers. Loss of shrimp when using the system is acceptable, less than 5 %.

40|$|Sea {{surveys were}} {{initiated}} {{in the spring}} of 1965 to obtain estimates of population size, mortality rates, and growth rates of the <b>northern</b> California ocean <b>shrimp</b> population. From March 1965 through September 1968, nine surveys were conducted in a 270 -square-mile area from off Mad River, California, north to Smith River, California. Four surveys were conducted in a 105 -square-mile area off southern Oregon during 1967 and 1968. Estimates of the California population ranged from a low of 2. 2 million pounds in the fall of 1966 to a high of 8. 1 million pounds in the fall of 1967. Survival rates, derived from natural mortality rates for ocean shrimp during their second winter of life, for the 1964 and 1965 year classes were 0. 68 and 0. 55 respectively. Lowest survival rates were obtained from the 1963 and 1964 year classes during their third winter of life. The highest fishing mortality rates were observed for shrimp during their third summer in the fishery. Survey data indicate a relationship between annual fishing mortality rates and total trawling hours expended by shrimp fishermen. Limited data suggest a relationship also exists between the number of spawners and 1 -year-old recruits as well as the existence of a density dependent relationship between population size and survival of the incoming year class. The Von Bertalanffy growth equation was applied to mean carapace lengths of 1964 and 1965 year class shrimp. Values for the constants L and K were very close while the values to t 0 varied considerably.

New biodiversity data are reported for 7 different countries, although one species reported from Malta is new for the entire Mediterranean basin, and is presumably also present in Israel and Lebanon (see below, under Malta). Italy: the rare native fish Gobius kolombatovici is first reported from the Ionian Sea, whilst the alien jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica and the alien fish Oplegnathus fasciatus are first reported from the entire country. The presence of O. fasciatus from Trieste is concomitantly the first for the entire Adriatic Sea. Finally, the alien bivalve Arcuatula senhousia is reported {{for the first time}} from Campania (Tyrrhenian Sea). Tunisia: a bloom of the alien crab ortunus segnis is first reported from the Gulf of Gabes, where it was considered as casual. Malta: the alien flatworm Maritigrella fuscopunctata is recorded in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time, on the basis of 25 specimens. At the same time, web searches include possible unpublished records from Israel and Lebanon. The alien crab P. segnis, already mentioned above, is first formally reported from Malta based on specimens collected in 1972. Concomitantly, the presence of Callinectes sapidus in Maltese waters is excluded since based on misidentifications. Greece: the Atlantic <b>northern</b> brown <b>shrimp</b> Penaeus atzecus, previously known from the Ionian Sea from sporadic records only, is now well established in Greek and international Ionian waters. The alien sea urchin Diadema setosum is reported for the second time from Greece, and its first record from the country is backdated to 2010 in Rhodes Island. The alien lionfish Pterois miles is first reported from Greece and concomitantly from the entire Aegean Sea. Turkey: the alien rhodophyte Antithamnion hubbsii is first reported from Turkey and the entire eastern Mediterranean. New distribution data are also provided for the native fishes Alectis alexandrina and Heptranchias perlo. In particular, the former record consists of a juvenile measuring 21. 38 mm total length, whilst the latter by a mature male. Cyprus: the rare native cephalopod Macrotritopus defilippi, and the alien crab Atergatis roseus, sea slug Plocamopherus ocellatus and fish Cheilodipterus novemstriatus are first recorded from the entire country. Lebanon: the alien crabs Actaea savignii and Matuta victor, as well as the alien fish Synanceia verrucosa, are first recorded from the entire country. In addition, the first Mediterranean record of A. savignii is backdated to 2006, whilst the high number of M. victor specimens observed in Lebanon suggest its establishment in the Basin. The Atlantic fishes Paranthias furcifer and Seriola fasciata, and the circumtropical Rachycentron canadum, are also first reported from the country. The P. furcifer record backdates its presence in the Mediterranean to 2007, whilst S. fasciata records backdate its presence in the eastern Mediterranean to 2005.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study is to examine the present {{institutional}} arrangements of the Newfoundland and Labrador <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshery, to identify the roles of cooperative ﬁsheries economic development corporations and make recommendations for institutional improvements. There are a number of institutional and organizational arrangements more favorable for ﬁsheries management and development than present ones (Bishop, 1981; Bromley, 1982; McCay and Acheson, 1987; Pinkerton, 1989). Jentoft and McCay (1995) identiﬁed the need for this type of research in ﬁsheries management in order to understand the complexity of relationships in ﬁsheries management and to develop more effective means of ﬁsheries management in general. The research was divided into two phases. The ﬁrst phase constituted a review of the literature focusing on cooperative ﬁsheries management and the relative importance of institutional research and institutional considerations in ﬁsheries management. The ﬁrst part of the thesis presented a vision of how commercial ﬁsheries should be managed and regulated to promote cooperative ﬁsheries economic development arrangements. The strengths and weaknesses identiﬁed in the literature regarding cooperative ﬁsheries management, institutional arrangements, systems theory, ecosystem-based management, coastal zone management, and economic development were adapted to develop a normative model and evaluative institutional framework for cooperative ﬁsheries management arrangements. Evaluative criteria were based on elements of process (interactive organizations, local control, community support, planned processes) and substantive values (substantive diversity, holism). The second phase of this research involved the selection of the Newfoundland and Labrador <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshery as a case study for the application of the normative framework. The <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshery is a relatively new ﬁshery and is presently undergoing a major transformation in management and institutional structure. At the same time, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is also undergoing an institutional restructuring in its approach to regional and community economic development. Through application of the normative framework, institutional constraints regarding the Newfoundland and Labrador <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshery were identiﬁed. At the same time, through application of the framework, ﬁeld interviews revealed a number of institutional opportunities for economic development corporations as alternative institutional arrangements in the cooperative management and development of the <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshery. The research concluded that institutional arrangements are an important prerequisite for facilitating effective cooperative ﬁsheries management and development arrangements. The minimum critical criteria for institutional arrangements for cooperative ﬁsheries management include interactive organizations, local control of regulation, management and decision-making responsibilities, community support and a planned process. Institutional arrangements in ﬁsheries management are the entity from which resource management decisions are made and action is taken. Effective institutional arrangements facilitate a cooperative management arena, decentralize and delegate responsibility to the resource users and lowest capable organizations, allow a more ﬂexible management process, and provide a framework in which problems can be evaluated and addressed in a timely and equitable manner. It is concluded in this thesis that rather than undergo a complete institutional restructuring of the present <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> ﬁshery to achieve these critical conditions, processes and mechanisms provided by cooperative ﬁsheries economic development corporations could offer an alternative management arrangement for cooperative ﬁsheries management and development. Cooperative ﬁsheries economic development corporations display characteristics of interactive organizations, local control, community support and strategic planning processes, essential for effective cooperative ﬁsheries management and development...|$|E
40|$|Wehypothesized that a {{floating}} trawl bridle {{that does not}} contact the seabed would reduce the herding of fish, especially bottom dwelling floun-ders, and thus reduce bycatch of these fish in shrimp trawls. We further hypothesized that, due to the non-herding nature of <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis), the use of anoff-bottomfloating bridlewouldnot reduce shrimp catch. These hypotheseswere tested in the field by comparing a trawl with regular bottom-tendering wire bridles and the same trawl with floating synthetic bridles in the Gulf of Maine <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery. As expected, {{no statistically significant differences}} in catch rates and size were found for the targeted <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (146. 3 + 10. 58 kg h 21 control vs. 140. 8 + 9. 35 kg h 21, p 0. 13). Total finfish bycatch was reduced by 14. 9 %, and the difference was statistically different (p 0. 01). The most important reduction was the catch of juvenile American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) with a significant reduction of 20. 0 % (p 0. 01). For witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), a reduction of 19. 3 % was found, but it was not statistically significant (p 0. 14). The reduction of Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) (by 28. 0 %, p 0. 02) was also statistically different. Catch of targeted silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) was reduced by 10. 8 %, but the difference was only marginally significant (p 0. 07). An analysis of length frequencies for the targeted shrimp and major bycatch species revealed no size-related selection between the gears with regular bridles and floating bridles. The reductions in flounder bycatch indicate reduced herding of benthic species when the bridles are kept off bottom. This easy modificatio...|$|E
40|$|Energy-density {{values of}} prey species are {{essential}} inputs for bioenergetic models of consumption. Diets of marine vertebrate predators {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic are reasonably well described, but the proximate composition (PC) and energy density (ED) of these prey species, and the factors affecting them, are poorly known, particularly tor those prey sizes commonly eaten. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate PC and ED of important prey species, and investigate important sources of variation. [...] Twelve species were collected in waters near Newfoundland and Labrador: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp.), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), squid (Illex illecebrosus and Gonatus fabrici), capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and daubed shanny (Lumpenus maculatus). ED was estimated from replicates of all samples by determining moisture, lipid, protein and inorganic content. ED differed among species and was influenced by body size, season, geography, and year of collecting. Herring, capelin and Gonatus squid had the highest ED; Atlantic cod, American plaice, sand lance, Arctic cod and <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> had the lowest. ED increased greatly with size (age) in capelin, and also in Greenland halibut and Illex squid. Other species showed no strong relationships of ED to body size. ED was greater in male than female <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp.</b> ED in capelin was highest in winter. Arctic cod had higher ED offshore than nearshore in eastern Newfoundland. Interannual variation in ED was found in Greenland halibut and Atlantic herring. Levels and variation in ED are discussed in relation to predator physiology, ecology, and life history...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports on}} various {{biological}} {{features in the}} life history of <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis) on Flemish Cap. <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> on Flemish Cap are males for approximately their first three years. Then usually half change sex at age four years, and the rest at age five years, to become females from then on. Small shrimp are generally found at lesser depth than the larger ones so the size of shrimp increases with depth, especially that of males. Larger females seem to move to shallower waters in March when hatching starts. The size at sex change (L 50) and the maximum length (Lmax) are studied within and between seasons. Both L 50 and Lmax have decreased in recent years. L 50 was 22. 5 mm CL on average in the seasons 1996 / 1997 – 2003 / 2004, but has decreased from 23. 2 mm CL in 1997 / 1998 to 22. 4 mm CL in 2003 / 2004 (Icelandic commercial data) and from 24. 3 mm CL in 1994 to 20. 9 mm CL in 2003 (EU survey data). Also Lmax has decreased from 29. 8 mm CL in 1996 / 1997 to 28. 0 mm CL in 2003 / 2004 (Icelandic commercial data). In spite of this, there is an invariant re-lationship between L 50 and Lmax, where L 50 is about 80 % of the average Lmax of <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> on Flemish cap. This supports the theory of Charnov and Skúladóttir (2000) on the invariant relationship between L 50 and Lmax in sex changing organisms. The same is found in Icelandic offshore waters an...|$|E
40|$|The Spanish Institute of Oceanography {{carried out}} in 2010 two bottom trawl surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area in Division 3 NO and 3 L during the months of June, July and August respectively. The results on <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis) are {{presented}} and compared with those from previous surveys from the same series. In 2010 the catch (21 kg.) and estimated biomass (114 t.) confirm the decrease of shrimp importance from 2004 in 3 NO. In 3 L Division, <b>northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> indices show a drastic decline (49 % with respect to 2009) and confirm the downward trend initiated in 2009. Estimated biomass increased from 2003 - 2006; then, the values of these indices declined in 2007 (about 10 %) and increased again in 2008 up to its historical maximum (149265 t.). In 2010 the biomass estimated 37803 t in 3 L and 114 t. in 3 NO were {{the lowest in the}} time series of Spanish. Catch results from the surveys and data analysis are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Some {{ecological}} indices {{were calculated}} from the data obtained in the research surveys conducted by Spain in NAFO divisions 3 NO between the years 2002 and 2011. These indices were calculated for individual populations (intrinsic population rate of growth and mean length) {{and for all the}} community (ABC curves, indices about faunal diversity, proportion of non-commercial species, mean length in community and size spectra). We use the data of twenty five species caught in the survey along the years, included <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis). The data of <b>Northern</b> <b>shrimp,</b> capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius) have a great influence {{in the value of the}} indices, as their abundance is very high in relation to their contribution to the biomass. The indices present a general stable pattern with a slight improvement in recent years. After two decades of moratorium, yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) seems to be recovered and other important commercial species as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) begin to recover in the South of the Grand Banks...|$|E
