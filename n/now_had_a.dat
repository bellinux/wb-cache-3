5|$|On January 13, 1994, NASA {{declared}} the mission a complete success {{and showed the}} first sharper images. The mission {{was one of the}} most complex performed up until that date, involving five long extra-vehicular activity periods. Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more capable space telescope.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{felt that}} Vick had not {{lived up to}} his {{potential}} during his four seasons with the team. Considering the team <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> solid outfield of Ruth, Meusel, Lewis, and Bodie, and the Yankees needed pitching; Vick became expendable. On December15, 1920, the Yankees traded Vick, Muddy Ruel, Del Pratt and Hank Thormahlen to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Wally Schang and Mike McNally.|$|E
5|$|The band {{entered into}} talks with Dickinson, {{who agreed to}} rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later. With Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> three-guitar line-up and {{embarked}} on a hugely successful reunion tour. Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game {{of the same name}} starring the band's mascot.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} {{a turning point in the}} war for North Korean forces, which had seen {{previous}} victories owing to superior numbers and equipment. The American forces <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> numerical superiority and more equipment, including tanks and weapons capable of defeating the powerful North Korean T-34 tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> natural explanation.|$|E
5|$|They soon {{reverted to}} state ownership. The Colorado Highway Commission {{used them to}} realize plans it had made a decade earlier, when it first {{designated}} the future Highway 82 through the Roaring Fork Valley.

5|$|With {{stability}} at last {{achieved in}} the west, Alexios <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to begin solving his severe economic difficulties and {{the disintegration of the}} empire's traditional defences. In order to reestablish the army, Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants (próniai) and prepared to advance against the Seljuks, who had conquered Asia Minor and were now established at Nicaea.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of Kuchlug, the Mongol Empire secured control over the Qara Khitai. Another segment of the Qara Khitai, from a dynasty founded by Buraq Hajib, survived in Kirman as vassals of the Mongols, but ceased to exist as an entity {{during the reign of}} the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü. The Mongols <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> firm outpost in Central Asia {{directly}} bordering the Khwarazm Empire. Relations with the Khwarazms would quickly break down, leading to the Mongol invasion of that territory.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E

Marge decides to help Lisa while Homer teaches Bart to shave his beard where he discovers {{that he has}} to take the plastic cover off the blade for it to work properly. Meanwhile, Lisa tries to hide her face with a hoodie, but Marge changes her mind by {{presenting}} her to makeup in order to hide her skin problems.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> supply of ready money to pay for more troops.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 18th century a complex of {{building}} had grown up around the original blockhouse, which <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pier, a dock and two wharfs alongside it, and a large house built by the King's brother, James the Duke of York, after his return to England, as well as the two lines of approximately 20 guns stretching on either side along the river; it had a garrison of a sergeant, 20 soldiers and a gunner on loan from Tilbury Fort. The blockhouse itself was no longer used to mount guns but instead acted as the magazine for the wider fortification, being able to store 2,500 barrels of gunpowder. Under the terms of the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, the number of artillery pieces was reduced to ten, and a survey in 1766 reported that Gravesend was in good condition and equipped with ten 9 lb guns.|$|E

5|$|Each platoon <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Lewis gun {{section and}} a section that {{specialised}} in throwing hand-grenades (then known as bombs), each section {{was compelled to}} provide two scouts to carry out reconnaissance duties. Each platoon was expected to provide mutual fire support in the attack they were to advance, without halting; but leap frogging was accepted, with the lead platoon taking an objective and the following platoons passing through them and onto the next objective, while the Lewis gunners provided fire support. Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Marquis was {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time on his research into the Custer battle. He <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote Western history articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.|$|E
5|$|NY31 was {{truncated}} to NY365 in Verona in {{the early}} 1940s; as a result, NY31 and NY234 <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> common terminus. Despite this fact, the two routes continued to co-exist for the next 40 years. On April1, 1981, ownership and maintenance of the Churton Road portion of NY234 was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Oneida County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Two of highways that the state received in return were Stuhlman Road (CR81) and the segment of Youngs Road (CR13) between Stuhlman Road and Churton Road (NY234). The two new state highways did not become a rerouting of NY234, however, as the NY234 designation was eliminated at this time. Instead, NY31 was extended southeastward over NY234's former routing to Vernon, from where it continued to Vernon Center by way of NY5, Stuhlman and Youngs Roads. Churton Road was redesignated as CR94.|$|E

5|$|On 20 June, Prinzess Wilhelm {{arrived in}} the Philippines; Diederichs <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> force of five warships: Prinzess Wilhelm, Kaiser, Irene, Kaiserin Augusta, and Cormoran. After her arrival, Prinzess Wilhelm {{proceeded}} to Mariveles to replenish her coal supplies and receive new crewmen from the transport Darmstadt. On 9 August, the American squadron in the Bay ordered the neutral warships in the harbor to leave the bombardment zone, and so Prinzess Wilhelm and the other German ships went to Mariveles. Following {{the fall of the}} city, most of the German ships departed the Philippines; only Prinzess Wilhelm remained on station to protect German nationals in the islands. She was replaced by Arcona in October. In mid-November, Kaiser ran aground and had to go into drydock for repairs; Diederichs therefore made Prinzess Wilhelm his flagship. The ship remained in Asia for only a few more months, returning to European waters in 1899.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 2006, Punk {{made his}} ECW debut during a house {{show at the}} former ECW Arena, {{defeating}} Stevie Richards. He made his TV debut on the July 4 ECW on Sci Fi, cutting a brief pre-taped promo about his straight edge lifestyle emphasizing the disciplinary aspects of being drug and alcohol free. Although he had retained the straight edge gimmick, he <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Muay Thai training background. Punk made his TV wrestling debut on August 1 at the Hammerstein Ballroom, defeating Justin Credible. Punk established himself in ECW by going undefeated, defeating opponents such as Christopher W. Anderson, Stevie Richards and Shannon Moore.|$|E
5|$|The BBC regime brought {{immediate}} benefits. The use of {{the second}} half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E
