40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the European IMAGINE project, is to {{formulate}} strategies to improve traffic modelling for application in noise mapping. It is well known that the specific deceleration and acceleration dynamics of traffic at junctions can influence local <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> However, macroscopic traffic models do not always model intersections, and if they do, only the influence of intersections on travel time is incorporated. In these cases, {{it would be useful to}} know what increase or decrease in noise production can be expected at or near intersections. A correction factor for road crossings has been suggested in several national <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> The question is open whether such a correction factor should be included in future harmonized methods. In this paper, a case study is presented, consisting of a large set of microscopic traffic simulations and associated <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> calculations, which provides some insight into the specific dynamics of the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> near different types of intersections.

The design optimisation is currently a promising way to meet these new NVH challenges. In this context, the experimental sound source identification and characterization method like the m-iPTF method presented here may be an efficient tool and analysis support. Indeed, this method is able to reconstruct sound quantities directly on the real geometry of the structure and from only cost-effective pressure measurements performed in a possible complex industrial environment (noisy and/or cluttered). This conformal mapping makes possible sub-systems ranking and a precise identification of sound source to determine where local design changes {{have to be made}} to improve the overall noise radiation. In a context of reducing expensive prototypes and time development, it also allows an efficient comparison and coupling with numerical simulation in order to promote its development and its use (predictability and reliability of models).

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{importance}} of objective measurements, {{the health effects}} of many occupational risk factors are currently not fully quantified. Occupational noise, as a widespread risk factor, is illustrative in this regard; there is a strong body of evidence linking it to an important health outcome (hearing loss), but it is less decisively associated with others (such as psychological disorders). It is also distinct from environmental noise, and therefore falls under the responsibility of employers as well as individuals. Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is, at present, incurable and irreversible. However, it is preventable, if effective and global hearing conservation programmes can be implemented. These programmes should not be isolated efforts, but should be integrated into the overall hazard prevention and control programme of the workplace. Belgian law encompasses a set of provisions for prevention and the protection of {{the health and safety of}} workers within the workplace, including aspects pertaining to the hygiene of the workplace and psychosocial aspects at work (stress, violence, bullying and sexual harassment, among others).

Honda used VTEC to meet tightening <b>noise</b> and <b>emissions</b> <b>standards</b> and to increase the peak engine horsepower.Based on the VTEC-E system, the simplified motorcycle version of VTEC employs {{only two of the}} four valves per cylinder when operating at lower engine speeds. All four valves per cylinder are engaged above approximately 6,800 rpm. This is initiated by an electronically actuated oil spool valve, which send oil pressure to the lifter actuators, which then move the engagement pins into place above the valve stem, allowing the remaining two valves to open. This design allows for variable valve timing as well, since the cam lobe profiles can be made different. After much criticism of the abruptness of power transition, Honda lowered the VTEC activation rpm threshold to 6,400 rpm in 2006. The VTEC disengages two cylinder valves when the engine speed drops again below 6,100 rpm.|$|R
40|$|With the {{advantages}} and popularity of Permanent Magnet (PM) motors due to their high power density, there is an increasing incentive to use them in variety of applications including electric actuation. These applications have strict <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> The generation of audible noise and associated vibration modes are characteristics of all electric motors, it is especially problematic in low speed sensorless control rotary actuation applications using high frequency voltage injection technique. This dissertation is aimed at solving the problem of optimizing the sensorless control algorithm for low noise and vibration while achieving at least 12 bit absolute accuracy for speed and position control. The low speed sensorless algorithm is simulated using an improved Phase Variable Model, developed and implemented in a hardware-in-the-loop prototyping environment. Two experimental testbeds were developed and built to test and verify the algorithm in real time. ^ A neural network based modeling approach was used to predict the audible noise due to the high frequency injected carrier signal. This model was created based on noise measurements in an especially built chamber. The developed noise model is then integrated into the high frequency based sensorless control scheme so that appropriate tradeoffs and mitigation techniques can be devised. This will improve the position estimation and control performance while keeping the noise below a certain level. Genetic algorithms were used for including the noise optimization parameters into the developed control algorithm. ^ A novel wavelet based filtering approach was proposed in this dissertation for the sensorless control algorithm at low speed. This novel filter was capable of extracting the position information at low values of injection voltage where conventional filters fail. This filtering approach {{can be used in}} practice to reduce the injected voltage in sensorless control algorithm resulting in significant reduction of noise and vibration. ^ Online optimization of sensorless position estimation algorithm was performed to reduce vibration and to improve the position estimation performance. The results obtained are important and represent original contributions that can be helpful in choosing optimal parameters for sensorless control algorithm in many practical applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Liebherr mobile harbor cranes use {{electrical}} generators {{to provide}} electrical power for load attachment {{devices such as}} container spreaders or magnets. Upcoming exhaust and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> and energy saving considerations lead to a broad diesel engine speed range. The challenging design aspect is to ensure a constant speed of the asynchronous generator by the hydraulic drive system. In addition, electrical load profiles of inductive consumers usually have DT 1 system characteristics with very small time constants. They evoke fast torque variations interfacing the hydraulic transmission. Liebherr mobile harbor cranes, see Figure 1, usually have a closed hydraulic circuit containing a hydraulic pump with a high displacement volume that is adjusted electronically in accordance to the current diesel engine speed. Regarding the energy saving aspects, a further minimization of the diesel engine speed leads to a larger pump size with increasing torque losses. Depending on the pressure setting, the volume flows can be reduced in constant pressure grids. Especially in part-load operation this results in better efficiency compared to closed hydraulic circuits by minimizing the displacement volume of hydraulic components. To obtain a stable generator speed, {{it is essential to}} adjust the displacement volume of the hydraulic unit for equalizing its input torque with the Figure 1 : LHM 800 Group 10 - Mobile Hydraulics | Paper 10 - 5 199 generator load torque. In interaction with the software-based control architecture, the stability of the electrical frequency depends on the mass inertia of the generator drive and time constants of the embedded hydraulic actuators. The system model, represented by ODEs is established and verified with a hydraulic simulation software. On that basis, the design approach of a PI-state-controller is presented. Corresponding controller gains and state feedback parameters are determined by pole placement techniques. To conclude this investigation a comparison between the hydraulically closed circuit and the constant pressure grid is shown by simulation and measurement data...|$|R

It focused on one of the busy and crowded square along with its 7 connecting streets, which had a heavy traffic and located in the downtown of the city. Total of 115 measuring points were selected along the roads, pavements and in the shopping areas to adequately represent the different acoustically commercial situations. The measuring points were divided in to 4 site-groups namely; Street, Pavement, Shop and Barrier each with 60, 40, 10, and 5 measuring points respectively. The measurements were carried out during a full week days started on Saturday morning and end on Friday evening. The A-weighted continuous equivalent sound level values, LAeq; LA max; LA min; and the statistical levels: L 1, L 10, L 50, L 90 and L 99 as well as the octave band center frequencies sound pressure levels were manually measured at each point separately. The mean values of LAeq for Street, Pavement, Shop and Barrier site groups were 78. 5, 73. 3, 68. 7 and 70. 8 dBA respectively and the overall mean of LAeq was 74. 7 dBA. The statistical test (p< 0. 01) showed that the mean values for LAeq in all site groups as well as the overall mean value were higher than 65 dBA, which is the daytime governmentally prescribed noise limit for commercial areas. Comparing the individual measurements has also shown the 86. 6 % exceeded values from 65 dBA. The highest mean noise level in center frequencies upper than 1000 Hz was 71. 5 dBA which was observed in the Street site group and the lowest one was 43. 2 dBA in the Shop site group at 8000 Hz center frequency. The corresponding values for the center frequencies lower than 1000 Hz were 78. 2 and 66. 1 dBA at 63 and 500 Hz which were also observed in the Street and Shop site groups respectively.

As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied. The ability of the textured surfaces to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> was assessed from the texture characteristics and air flow resistance of textured surfaces measured in the laboratory.
