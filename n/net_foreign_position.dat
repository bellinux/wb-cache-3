40|$|This paper explores whether export {{intensity}} and <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>position</b> of the Japanese firms are carefully watched by investors and are properly {{reflected in the}} stock prices. By estimating a multifactor model including the TOPIX, the call rate, the exchange rate, and other variables representing the characteristics of individual firms, the market efficiency of the Japanese stock market has been examined. Novelty {{of this paper is}} in that the channels of the effect of exchange rate on stock prices are explicitly formulated and estimated directly, and in that the use of daily data enables knowledge to be gained on the market efficiency. The main results are as follows: (i) Japanese investors adequately consider the characteristics of the firms, such as the exporting behaviour and <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>position.</b> (ii) The market efficiency of the semistrong form has been improved throughout the period. (iii) Stock investors correctly evaluate firms' foreign asset position and appropriately respond to the change of the exchange rate after 1992. In contrast, investors began to pay attention to exporting firms much earlier, that is, since 1985. ...|$|E

A recent literature, including Prescott (2004) and Rogerson (2005), argues that differences in labor supply between the US and Europe can largely be explained by differences in tax rates. We use tax data from the OECD to develop tax schedules for a sample of 17 countries. The empirical correlation between hours worked and different measures of tax levels and progressivity is negative, however, weak. Motivated by these observations, we develop a life-cycle model with heterogeneous agents, marriage and divorce and use it to study the impact of two mechanisms: 1) differences in marriage stability and 2) differences in tax systems on labor supply. There are three types of households; single males, single females and married households. Divorces and marriages occur stochastically. The main channel through which individual divorce and singlehood rates impact labor supply is by reducing the implicit insurance of marriage, and thereby providing incentives for individuals to invest in experience. We calibrate our model to US data and study how labor supply in the US changes as we introduce European tax systems, and as we replace the US divorce and marriage rates with their European equivalents. We find that the divorce and tax mechanisms combined on average explain 28 % of the difference between the US and 11 European countries. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: China in {{the past}} few years has emerged as a <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> {{creditor}} on the international scene with <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets slightly greater than zero percent of wealth. This is surprising given that China is a relatively poor country with a capital-labor ratio about one-fifth the world average and one-tenth the U. S. level. The main questions that we address are whether it makes economic sense for China to be a net creditor and how we see China’s <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>position</b> evolving over the next 20 years. We calibrate a theoretical model of international capital flows featuring diminishing returns, production risk, and sovereign risk. Our calibrations for China yield a predicted <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>position</b> of- 17 percent of China’s wealth. We also estimate non-structural cross-country regressions of determinants of <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets in which China is always a significant outlier with 5 to 7 percentage points more of <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets relative to wealth than is predicted by its characteristics. China’s extensive capital controls can explain why its current <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>position</b> is far away from what is predicted by open-economy models and cross-country empirics. It seems reasonable to assume that China’s international financial integration will increase over time. We calibrate and predict different scenarios out to 2025. These scenarios are necessarily speculative, but it is interesting that they typically imply negative <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>positions</b> between 3 and 9 percent of wealth.

40|$|The United States has a {{large and}} {{persistent}} current account deficit. Yet, U. S. 's income receipts {{from the rest of}} the world have exceeded its income payments to the rest of the world for many years. This appears to be paradoxical because for a country with a negative <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets <b>position,</b> such as the U. S., international income payments to the rest of the world are likely to exceed its international income receipts. Hausmann and Sturzenegger (2005) offer an explanation of this apparent paradox. They argue that U. S. current account statistics do not properly measure U. S. 's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets <b>position</b> and that its actual <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets <b>position</b> is measurably better than the officially estimated position primarily due to the existence of intangible corporate capital invested overseas. In their view the debate about the sustainability of the U. S. current account deficit and the negative <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> assets <b>position</b> is moot because these deficits and debts are either non-existent or fairly small. This paper critically evaluates Hausmann et al's claims and examines the implications of their hypothesis.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{cross-border}} portfolio holdings of a large variety of assets have risen sharply. This has created an important role for changes in asset prices of a country's external assets and liabilities (i. e. "valuation effects") in affecting the country's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>position.</b> Valuation effects are commonly thought as stabilizing: they counteract current account movements and mitigate {{the impact of the}} current account on the country's <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>position.</b> This paper shows that whether valuation effects are stabilizing or not depends critically on the nature of underlying productivity shocks. In response to transitory shocks, valuation effects are stabilizing; but in response to trend shocks, such effects amplify the impact of the current account on the <b>net</b> <b>foreign</b> asset <b>position.</b> These contrasting results arise because optimally smoothing consumers respond differently to a transitory shock than to a trend shock to income.
