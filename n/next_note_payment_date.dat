50|$|If the {{above-mentioned}} is applicable, the transaction price will {{be adjusted to}} eliminate {{the effect of this}} benefit. This is simply done by calculating the net present value of the payments (if the satisfaction of performance obligations is prior to the <b>payment</b> <b>date),</b> or by calculating the net future value (if the <b>payment</b> <b>date</b> is prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations). The difference (between the amount recognized after adjustment for a significant financing component and amount of consideration to be received) is simply recognized as interest income/ expense in terms of the accrual basis of accounting as mentioned in IAS 1.|$|R
50|$|In finance, a day count {{convention}} {{determines how}} interest accrues over {{time for a}} variety of investments, including bonds, notes, loans, mortgages, medium-term notes, swaps, and forward rate agreements (FRAs). This determines the number of days between two coupon payments; thus, calculating the amount transferred on <b>payment</b> <b>dates</b> and also the accrued interest for <b>dates</b> between <b>payments.</b> The day count is also used to quantify periods of time when discounting a cash-flow to its present value. When a security such as a bond is sold between interest <b>payment</b> <b>dates,</b> the seller is eligible to some fraction of the coupon amount.|$|R
