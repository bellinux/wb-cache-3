500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think? Of course I am. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> of Appleby's crew {{coming into}} Seymour's and ragging studies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He mustn't see my father, you know; mind that!" [...] said Michael. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> public {{exhibition}} to {{a little}} beast like him." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE.--Don't {{you speak}} <b>to</b> me; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school--I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no more governesses soon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anybody {{following}} me around {{and trying to}} boss me. I've had all of that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] says Mr. Parable, {{speaking}} very deliberate-like, [...] "but I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{her name}} dragged into this business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> trouble to-night," [...] he said. [...] "He's coming round again, {{and when}} he feels like it, there's nobody can be more high-toned polite!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! Well, I {{guess you}} are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> kind {{of belief in}} them now. They're {{planning}} to run our big stock train through the Bitter Creek bridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me? I {{should say}} not! It's like this: I don't mind dealing {{with my men}} if they think they've got any grievances--though Lord knows what's come over workmen, nowadays--don't {{appreciate}} a good job. But still, if they come to me honestly, as man to man, I'll talk things over with them. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> outsider, any of these walking delegates, or whatever fancy names they call themselves now--bunch of rich grafters, living on the ignorant workmen! <b>Not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> of those fellows butting in and telling ME how to run MY business!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] Margaret Duffe said. She looked reflectively up at him. [...] "But you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> do with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{put your hand}} on my {{shoulder}} where it's steep," [...] he suggested. [...] "Still, we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> much trouble in getting down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a lazy, good-for-nothing boomer lay it over me----" [...] began Tucker, when {{once more}} the sight of Pawnee Brown's pistol silenced him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can let up and {{get that}} jib off her. Strip it right off the stay. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> use for a sail of that kind. Get out the small one, Harry." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Maxwell went home, {{he met his}} mother. [...] "Why, mother," [...] {{said the}} young fellow, [...] "old Ricker is going to print my report as editorial; and we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> report." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> Crocker in my house," [...] {{said the}} old woman, [...] "unless I know where he comes from. Perhaps he's a counter-skipper. He may be a ticket-of-leave man for all you know." ...|$|E
5000|$|Give {{yourself}} {{permission to}} experiment and make mistakes. [...] "It's like taking {{up a new}} sport—you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a perfect golf swing the very first day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lottie {{made her}} way to the door. [...] "Well, if you do stay, mother, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> you hanging round me all day. I can {{chaperon}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it, I hope," [...] Francis said indignantly. [...] "It {{would be}} a shame, indeed, to give her to such a man as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go for a soldier, do you mean?' {{returned}} my aunt, alarmed; 'or go to sea? I won't hear of it. You {{are to be}} a proctor. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> knockings on {{the head}} in THIS family, if you please, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{like you}} to ask me; isn't it?" [...] To tell the truth {{he should not have}} asked her. [...] "Never mind. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> words with you. If you've been a knave I've been a fool, and that's worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir!" [...] said Mrs. Carson. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> strange {{servants}} on my place. I {{have just}} been able to prevail upon my own women {{to go into the}} house, and I don't want any more trouble. I have had enough already!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I won't say to-morrow, Mr Crumb, nor yet the {{day after}} to-morrow, nor yet no day at all. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> you. I've told you as much before.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS MARCH. If {{you were}} ordinary, Johnny, {{it would be}} the girl's look-out. But you're not, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> you in the trap she'll set for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I won't {{promise a}} thing! I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{the whole school}} {{laughing}} at me," [...] protested Sam, who hated to be ridiculed even more than Ben did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{you leave}} 'em alone?" [...] inquired the young man. [...] "Be cheerful and smile at 'em. You'd soon {{be able to}} smile with a little practice." [...] "You mind your business, George Gale, and I'll mind mine," [...] said Mr. Wragg, fiercely; [...] "I've 'ad enough of your impudence, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> more. And don't lean up agin my house, 'cos I won't 'ave it." ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT. First love is only {{a little}} foolishness {{and a lot of}} curiosity: no really self-respecting woman would take {{advantage}} of it. No, my dear Nora: I've done with all that long ago. Love affairs always end in rows. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> rows: we're going to have a solid four-square home: man and wife: comfort and common sense--and plenty of affection, eh [he puts his arm round her with confident proprietorship]? ...|$|E
60|$|That is {{the only}} way to get a kettle to boil up the river. If it sees that you are waiting for it and are anxious, it will never even sing. You have to go away and begin your meal, as if you were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> tea at all. You must not even look round at it. Then you will soon hear it {{sputtering}} away, mad to be made into tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not one. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{my father}} getting {{like the people}} you read about in the {{magazine}} advertisements. You don't want to feel sudden shooting pains, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lister {{took him}} gently by the sleeve, {{and his voice}} sank with the solemnity of his subject: [...] "I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no old age," [...] he said, resignedly.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Mr. Welling <b>has</b> got <b>to</b> prove that. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{young men}} {{addressing}} my wife as Oh their darling, {{without knowing the}} reason why. It's a liberty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> of your horrid New England directness, cousin," [...] said St. Clare, gayly. [...] "If I {{answer that}} question, I know you'll be {{at me with}} half a dozen others, each one harder than the last; and I'm not a going to define my position. I {{am one of the}} sort that lives by {{throwing}} stones at other people's glass houses, but I never mean to put up one for them to stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{interrupted}} Clement harshly. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> {{words with}} you. If I had seen fit {{not to tell}} you of this how much would you have known of it? Sit down and keep your tongue between your teeth." [...] He turned to Dan and his voice was softer. [...] "Dan, when I was hungry you took me in and fed me. For that I've given you a good position. Is that debt paid?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is a good}} plan, too, {{if you are in}} a great hurry, to talk very loudly to {{each other}} about how you don’t need any tea, and are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any.</b> You get near the kettle, so that it can overhear you, and then you shout out, “I don’t want any tea; do you, George?” to which George shouts back, “Oh, no, I don’t like tea; we’ll have {{lemonade}} instead—tea’s so indigestible.” Upon which the kettle boils over, and puts the stove out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> you think--" [...] He began passionately, but {{he broke}} off, and a slow, dull crimson blotted over the healthy red-brown {{of his neck}} and cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Kate," [...] said Harry; and {{he stopped}} as he spoke, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anybody else as Treasurer. If you resign that office I'll smash the company!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's all. We needn't {{argue about}} it. If {{you want to}} come here and have supper, I can't stop you. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the place turned into a night-club.' ...|$|R
