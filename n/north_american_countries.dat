[...] Haiti has more human trafficking than any other Central or South American country. [...] According to the United States Department of State 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report, [...] "Haiti is a major source, passage, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex slavery." [...] Haitians are trafficked out of Haiti and into the neighboring Dominican Republic, as well as to other countries such as Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> as well. Haiti is also a transit country for victims of trafficking en route to the United States. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, human trafficking has drastically increased. [...] While trafficking often implies moving, particularly smuggling people across borders, it only requires [...] "the use of force, fraud, or coercion to exploit a person for profit," [...] and it is understood to be a form of slavery.|$|E

500|$|The {{poaching}} {{of elephants}} for their ivory, meat and hides {{has been one}} of the major threats to their existence. Historically, numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory, and its use rivalled that of gold. The ivory trade contributed to the African elephant population decline in the late 20th century. This prompted international bans on ivory imports, starting with the United States in June 1989, and followed by bans in other <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries,</b> western European countries, and Japan. Around the same time, Kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks. CITES approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in January 1990. Following the bans, unemployment rose in India and China, where the ivory industry was important economically. By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not badly affected. [...] Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, elderly {{care has}} been the {{responsibility}} of family members and was provided within the extended family home. Increasingly in modern societies, elderly care is now being provided by state or charitable institutions. The reasons for this change include decreasing family size, the greater life expectancy of elderly people, the geographical dispersion of families, and the tendency for women to be educated and work outside the home. [...] Although these changes have affected European and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> first, they are now increasingly affecting Asian countries as well.|$|E
2500|$|Once again, Canada {{found itself}} at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian {{contributions}} were slight before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The entry of the United States {{into the war}} helped to tip the balance in favour of the allies. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the Gulf of Mexico waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to declare war to the Axis nations and entered the conflict. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> to more important roles in world affairs. The United States especially emerged as a [...] "superpower".|$|E

2500|$|Homeschooling in South America has {{not taken}} hold {{as it has in}} <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> of Canada and the United States. [...] In 1824, Brazil {{permitted}} home education {{to take the place of}} traditional education for nearly 70 years. [...] In 1990, however, The Statute of Children and Adolescents, or the Estatuto da Criança e Adolescente, prohibited homeschooling and did not recognize it as a legitimate form of education. [...] A resurgence in the homeschooling movement, however, has encouraged congressman Lincoln Portela to introduce a new bill that would allow children to be educated at home if parents followed state approved guidelines. [...] The National Association of Home Education was founded in 2010 to achieve these goals. Rough estimates state that around 3,201 families are homeschooling in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|His famous {{textbook}} Sekai Kunizukushi ("All the Countries of the World, for Children Written in Verse", 1869) {{became a}} best seller and {{was used as an}} official school textbook. [...] His inspiration for writing the books came when he tried to teach world geography to his sons. [...] At the time there were no textbooks on the subject, so he decided to write one himself. [...] He started by buying a few Japanese geography books for children, named Miyakoji ("City roads") and Edo hōgaku ("Tokyo maps"), and practiced reading them aloud. He then wrote Sekai Kunizukushi in six volumes in the same lyrical style. [...] The first volume covered Asian countries, the second volume detailed African countries, European countries were discussed in the third, South American countries in the fourth, and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries</b> and Australia in the fifth. Finally, the sixth volume was an appendix that gave an introduction to world [...] geography.|$|E
2500|$|Another way {{in which}} the {{ideation}} of migration is demonstrated is in the relatively high numbers of Israelis who seek citizenship of European Union countries, (where in 2007 an estimated 42 percent of Israelis are eligible for citizenship based on their parents' and grandparents' nationalities). More than 4,000 Israelis received German citizenship in 2007, a 50 percent increase over 2005. A recent survey by the Jerusalem-based Menachem Begin Heritage Center found that 59% of Israelis had approached or intended to approach a foreign embassy to ask for citizenship and a passport and <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>countries,</b> possibly to use as a safe haven, but actually continue living in Israel. The seeking, attainment and possession of multiple nationalities by a Jewish individual is allowed by Israeli law, whereas other nations, require a renouncement of foreign citizenship and the voluntary attainment of a foreign citizenship can result in the loss of citizenship in that country. For example, 220 Israeli diplomats to the U.S. have received 'Green card' or Permanent Resident Alien status between 1966 and 1979 [...] but the likelihood is low that these career Israeli government officials permanently emigrated from Israel, but rather they gained a passport of convenience to travel to countries that may be less welcoming of Israeli passports.|$|E
