More than 90 % LECL remained even after complete removal of the cell suspension 10 min after TPA stimulation, and ~ 22. 5 % of neutrophils were adhered to the reaction tube.

40|$|Shared first co-authors) Elucidating the {{heterogeneous}} {{responses of}} single cells to external perturbation {{is one of}} the central interests in cell biology. However, continuous monitoring of <b>non-adhering</b> single cells is still hindered by the limited availability of systems for precise manipulation and retention of cells at a desired location. Flow cytometry {{is one of the}} most widely used techniques to characterize <b>non-adhering</b> cells, however, its inability to follow the response of single cells in time is a major drawback 1. Here we describe an application of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) based digital microfluidic (DMF) chip 2, as a platform for trapping of <b>non-adhering</b> cells in an array of microwells. Consequently, the single cell response to a drug incubation can be monitored with a spatio-temporal resolution in an automatic way. The scheme of DMF device for trapping single yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is illustrated in Fig. 1. The device consists of two parallel glass plates, namely the actuation plate and grounding plate (Fig. 1 a). An array consisting of 22000 microwells (5 µm wide and 3 µm deep) was fabricated in the Teflon layer of the grounding plate 3. The microwells have hydrophilic bottom and hydrophobic sidewalls (Fig. 1 a,inset). In order to trap yeast cells, the cell droplet was transported over the array for multiple times, referred to as seeding cycles (Fig. 1 a), resulting in entrapment of single cells in femtoliter droplets in the microwells. These spatially confined cells were then subjected to antifungal treatments (Fig. 1 b) and the viability of single cells using the viability dye Propidium Iodide (PI) was monitored with time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 1 c). The cell’s response upon treatment with various concentrations of amphotericin B (AmB), a cell membrane permeabilizing antifungal drug that also induces programmed cell death at certain doses 4, was studied over a period of 6 hours during which viability of the cells was monitored every 15 minutes. We found a dose-dependent increase of the number of PI-positive cells (dead cells) over time. The maximum number of dead cells for each AmB dose was reached after approx. 270 min of incubation (Fig. 2). Treating the cells with higher AmB doses (> 50 µM) did not result in 100 % PI-positive staining of cells. Only upon UV treatment, all cells stained PI-positive, indicating complete cell death of the culture. This result indicates that a subpopulation of the yeast culture treated with AmB is PI-negative, indicative for increased AmB tolerance or programmed cell death. Cells dying via programmed cell death or apoptosis are typically characterized by PI-negative staining as the cell membrane is still intact. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time, an EWOD based DMF device-enabling spatial isolation of single <b>non-adhering</b> yeast cells and their subsequent cytotoxicity read-out upon drug treatment. Our system allows efficient monitoring of cellular response over a period of time.

40|$|The {{deformation}} and toughness of amorphous glassy polymers is discusses {{in terms}} of both the molecular network structure and the microscopic structure at length scales of 50 - 300 nm. Two model systems were used: polystyrene-poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene ether) blends (PS-PPE; where PS possesses a low entanglement density and PPE a relatively high entanglement density) and epoxides based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) with crosslink densities comparable with up to values much higher than the thermoplastic model system. The microscopic structure was controlled by the addition of different amounts of <b>non-adhering</b> core-shell-rubber particles. Toughness is mainly determined by the maximum macroscopic draw ratio since the yield stress of most polymers approximately is identical (50 - 80 MPa). It is shown that the theoretical maximum draw ratio, derived from the maximum (entanglement or crosslink) network deformation, is obtained macroscopically when the characteristic length scale of the microstructure of the material is below a certain dimension; i. e. the critical matrix ligament thickness between added <b>non-adhering</b> rubbery particles ('holes').

EC lines established from human lymph node, appendix, lung, skin and intestine microvessels, labeled with PKH 26 -GL fluorescent dye, were grown to confluency in 24 -well TC plates. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell suspension was overlaid onto labeled ECs, and allowed to adhere for 20 min at 4 degrees C under static conditions. <b>Non-adhering</b> cells were collected first, and adhering tumor cells together with ECs were detached from the culture plate.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of adhered and <b>non-adhered</b> parasites during the metacyclogenesis process show that only epimastigotes and few transition forms {{are found in the}} first population, whereas metacyclic trypomastigotes are exclusively found in the cell culture supernatant. PAGE analysis of the [35 S]methionine metabolic labeling products of adhered and <b>non-adhered</b> parasites shows that although most of the polypeptides are conserved, adhered parasites express specifically four polypeptides in the range of 45 - 50 kD with an isoelectric point of 4. 8.

40|$|The {{influence}} of microstructural properties on the macroscopic mechanical behaviour {{has been studied}} by finite element predictions of the response of different microstructures of polystyrene (PS) or polycarbonate (PC) containing voids or rubbery particles, subjected to unidirectional extension. The voids represent a low-modulus <b>non-adhering</b> dispersed phase. The rubbery inclusions, which {{are assumed to be}} pre-cavitated and perfectly adhering, idealise core-shell particles with a hard rubber shell and a soft <b>non-adhering</b> or pre-cavitated core. The predictions show that the inclusion properties strongly affect the averaged post-yield response of the heterogeneous systems. Especially the post-yield strain softening can be eliminated by the introduction of voids in PC or rubbery particles in PS. Since macroscopic strain softening {{is believed to be the}} main cause of catastrophical stress or strain localisations, the softening elimination is believed to be primarily responsible for toughness enhancement of the polystyrene or polycarbonate systems. The results and experiences are extrapolated in order to explain the {{influence of}} the absolute length scale of a sub-micron sized morphology on the macroscopic behaviour, especially toughness. Two potential sources of particle-size effects are presented that may result in a stabilised, and thus tougher, macroscopic mechanical response, i. e. the yield stress reduction near a surface or interface because of a locally enhanced mobility of the polymer segments, and the temporary excessive hardening because of a sufficiently small size of the yield zones which results in a reduced effective entanglement distance.

40|$|Dynamic {{follow up}} and {{analysis}} of isolated single cells that display <b>non-adhering</b> behaviour is hindered {{by the fact that}} they float in the suspension medium and thus requires the implementation of systems that physically entrap the cells for successful analysis. We describe the potential of digital microfluidic (DMF) chip technology for conducting analysis of cells in suspension at the single cell resolution. More specifically, we demonstrate the use of DMF technology for the analysis of a group of single individual protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana plants that are labelled with magnetic particles and are immobilized on the DMF chip by magnetic forces. By transporting droplets with different osmotic conditions to the site where the cells are trapped, we challenge the cells and monitor their responses dynamically with a camera. The use of DMF technology for performing osmotic potential measurements has the following advantages: (i) solid particles such as cells and magnetic beads are manipulated on the chip without the risk of clogging channels, (ii) the static fluid conditions and low shear stress that characterize DMF are particularly suited for analysis of delicate cells types that lack cell walls such as protoplasts, (iii) the throughput of the analysis is strongly increased as multiple protoplasts are analysed simultaneously, which is much higher compared to traditional methods that can handle and challenge only one cell at a time. We show that the DMF analysis platform is effective in creating the steep osmotic gradients required for calculation of water permeability coefficients (Pos) as the values found are comparable with previously reported ones thus validating the suitability of the technology for such studies. This method illustrates DMF as an unparalleled and promising system for implementing single cells studies on <b>non-adhering</b> cells in an automated way. status: publishe...|$|E

In previous studies on the adenylyl cyclase in flagella of a single mating type (i. e., <b>non-adhering</b> flagella) we presented evidence that the gametic form of the enzyme, but not the vegetative form, was regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Zhang, Y., E.

In the present report we describe studies on regulation of flagellar adenylyl cyclase during adhesion in a cell-free system. The {{results show that the}} activity of gametic flagellar adenylyl cyclase is regulated by adhesion in vitro between flagella isolated from mt+ and mt- gametes. After mixing mt+ and mt- flagella together for 15 s in vitro, adenylyl cyclase activity was increased two- to threefold compared to that of the non-mixed (non- adhering), control flagella. This indicates that the regulation of gametic flagellar adenylyl cyclase during the early steps of fertilization is not mediated by signals from the cell body, but is a direct and primary response to interactions between mt+ and mt- agglutinins. By use of this in vitro assay, we discovered that 50 nM staurosporine (a protein kinase inhibitor) blocked adhesion-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase in vitro, while it had no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity of <b>non-adhering</b> gametic flagella. This same low concentration of staurosporine also inhibited adhesion-induced increases in vivo in cellular cAMP and blocked subsequent cellular responses to adhesion. Taken together, our results indicate that flagellar adenylyl cyclase in Chlamydomonas gametes is coupled to interactions between mt+ and mt- agglutinins by a staurosporine- sensitive activity, probably a protein kinase...|$|E
40|$|Cementitious {{composites}} {{are commonly}} evaluated considering their workability, level of incorporated air, elasticity modulus and compression strength. Data from compression testing commonly present a high dispersion, {{which has been}} attributed to effects of the specimen geometry, dimensions and of the degree of material compaction, as well as to problems in the specimen end-faces, such as their parallelism, orthogonality in relation to the compression axis and surface regularity. Specimen end-face regularization has been achieved through various techniques, such as adhering or <b>non-adhering</b> capping with various materials, mechanical grinding and systems involving special moulds. The regularization methods utilized more frequently employ sulfur mortar capping, neoprene cushions and surface grinding. The present work covers the experimental compression tests of cementitious composites of different classes of strength employing sulfur mortar capping and neoprene cushions. It was concluded that there is a strong influence of the chosen regularization technique on the measured compression strengths...|$|E
30|$|The {{scaffolds}} {{were treated}} with ethanol immediately after the removal of scaffold from the electrospinning machine to avoid curling {{and then it was}} autoclaved before the biological characterization. Rat L 6 muscle fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 1  ×  104 cells per silk fibroin scaffold. The cells were incubated at 37  °C with 5  % CO 2 for a period of 24 and 48  h. After the incubation, the scaffolds were removed from the well and rinsed with PBS twice to remove <b>non-adhered</b> cells from the scaffold. Then the scaffolds were fixed with 2.5  % phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde and kept at 4  °C for 2  h and subsequently dehydrated with gradient ethanol solution (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100  %). The dried scaffolds were sputtered with iron and observed by SEM.|$|R
40|$|The {{supply of}} information, {{particularly}} of bad news, in an agency relationship is a sensitive issue. We employ a game theory approach to investigate {{conflicts in the}} particular case of the doctor–patient relationship when information affects the emotions of patients. The doctor does not know the type of agent and the patient {{does not know how}} much information he is given. Hence, the paper obtains results when there is conflict, rather than common interest in the objectives of the two parties. The perfect Bayesian equilibrium describes beliefs and strategies which guarantee adherence to the doctor’s recommendation. We show also that the patient may <b>non-adhere</b> to the recommendation not only when the doctor fails to identify the patient’s needs but also if he falsely believes that the doctor has not done so...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{transient}} rise in cytosolic free Ca 2 + {{which occurs}} during neutrophil adhesion and cell spreading is unclear. In order to establish whether such a Ca 2 + signal triggers neutrophil shape change, neutrophils co-loaded with fluo 3 and Nitr 5 ('caged' Ca 2 +) were used with rapid-time confocal laser scanning microscopy. Here we show that the photolytic generation of a Ca 2 + rise in neutrophils which were adherent to an integrin-engaging surface, triggered a rapid change in cell morphology, with increases in cell diameter of approximately 175 % occurring within 90 seconds of the Ca 2 + signal. In <b>non-adhered</b> neutrophils or neutrophils on plain glass, no acceleration of the rate of spreading occurring {{in response to the}} release of 'caged Ca 2 +' could be demonstrated. It was concluded that although a rise in cytosolic free Ca 2 + was not the sole trigger for neutrophil shape change, with other signals generated by integrin engagement, a rise in cytosolic free Ca 2 + accelerated the rate of neutrophil spreading...|$|R
