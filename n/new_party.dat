5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Vlaams Blok seized {{the occasion of the}} ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name. Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a <b>new</b> <b>party</b> with the name Vlaams Belang was established. (Other proposed names included the Flemish People's Party and Flemish Freedom Front.) The <b>new</b> <b>party</b> instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more extreme positions of the former Vlaams Blok.

50|$|After {{the coup}} of 1980, all {{political}} parties were closed {{by the military}} rule (so called National Security Council or MGK) regardless of their political views, on 16 October 1981.

5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to abolish the Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the <b>new</b> <b>party</b> Leader.|$|E
5|$|Dmowski was {{a deputy}} to the 1919 Legislative Sejm, but he {{attended}} {{only a single}} session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from a lung infection, in Algeria. He reorganized endecja into a <b>new</b> <b>party,</b> Popular National Union (Związek Ludowo-Narodowy). During the Polish-Soviet War {{he was a member}} of the Council of National Defense and a vocal critic of Piłsudski's policies.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Eighth National Congress, held in September 1956, Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the <b>new</b> <b>Party</b> Constitution. At this meeting, Peng suggested that a section in the Constitution's preamble referring to Mao Zedong Thought be removed.

At the Congress, Peng was re-appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|In the {{lame-duck session}} of 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which allowed the {{president}} to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, {{the spirit of the}} law encouraged Weaver and the Boomers to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in the new Congress the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing third party, the Union Labor Party. In Iowa's 6th district, the <b>new</b> <b>party</b> agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, JohnF. Lacey, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, Alson Streeter, fared poorly nationally as well, and the <b>new</b> <b>party</b> soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the lame-duck session and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to leave office, signed the bill into law.|$|E
40|$|Since {{individuals}} demanding formations of <b>new</b> <b>parties</b> face {{a collective}} action problem, I inquire why people form <b>new</b> <b>parties,</b> and why this political strategy became increasingly popular between 1973 and 2002 in Swedish municipalities. Case-studies indicate that ‘strong emotions’ – i. e. anger, frustration and indignation – mobilize rational actors {{to start up}} <b>new</b> <b>parties.</b> However, ‘strong emotions’ only explain why individuals form parties in the first place, not why party formation has become a popular strategy. Hence, I hypothesize that entrepreneurs forming parties at t inspire potential entrepreneurs in neighbouring municipalities at t + 1.

5|$|The {{election}} for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly {{defeated in the}} election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the UMNO-MCA Alliance, which won three seats. Another <b>new</b> <b>party,</b> the leftist People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.|$|E
5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as party leader of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as <b>new</b> <b>party</b> leader at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011.

40|$|Recent {{elections}} in Europe {{have shown that}} a context of increasing citizen distrust towards democratic institutions may lead to very high levels of electoral volatility and {{to the emergence of}} <b>new</b> <b>parties.</b> On the other hand, institutional reforms are sometimes presented as a solution to citizens’ discontent with political institutions. Focusing on a specific type of political institution ‒ electoral systems ‒ the question addressed in this study is whether high levels of electoral volatility may trigger electoral reforms. The article investigates the conditions under which reforms affecting the electoral system’s degree of openness to <b>new</b> <b>parties</b> were enacted in 25 European countries between 1945 and 2012. The findings demonstrate that volatility due to the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>parties</b> is the most powerful explanation to account for the introduction of electoral reforms, particularly those that hinder the entry of <b>new</b> <b>parties</b> into the system.

5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a <b>new</b> <b>party,</b> the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E

When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on December 19, {{there were}} troop {{movements}} in the capital as the junta deposed the civilians.

However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission.
