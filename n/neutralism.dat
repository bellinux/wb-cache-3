5|$|After {{the three-year}} {{transition}} period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly {{collided with the}} regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to <b>neutralism</b> regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be overwhelmed by the project.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce <b>neutralism.</b> Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli was reelected in 1948, but was toppled in a {{military}} coup in 1949. He subsequently went into exile in Egypt, returning to Syria in 1955 {{to participate in the}} presidential election, which he won. A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist-dominated government, Quwatli officially adopted <b>neutralism</b> amid the Cold War. After his request for aid from the United States was denied, he drew closer to the Eastern bloc. He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact. In 1957, Quwatli, who the US and the Pact countries attempted but failed to oust, sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria, but to no avail. By then, his political authority had receded as the military bypassed Quwatli's jurisdiction by independently coordinating with Quwatli's erstwhile ally, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser.|$|E
5|$|In late December {{and early}} January, student demonstrations in South Vietnam were held against <b>neutralism</b> and French President Charles de Gaulle, who {{advocated}} {{the removal of}} the Americans and negotiations between the two Vietnams. The Council of Notables had accused the provisional government and junta of having an uncertain stance on the issue and went as far as to recommend that South Vietnam suspend diplomatic relations with France. The rumors and crisis heightened when a reputed French agent, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Dinh Lan suddenly returned to Saigon after several years in France. He had served in both the French and Vietnamese National Army and had brought with him several million US dollars worth of South Vietnamese piasters. Lan moved into the home of one of Kim's top aides, fuelling speculation that French agents were being systematically brought into the capital. Such rumors served to spread the belief that a French-sponsored neutralist deal was imminent and gave the conspirators an opportunity to act.|$|E
25|$|Khánh used de Gaulle's policy {{plans to}} enact {{retribution}} against Generals Đôn and Kim. Khánh had them arrested {{on grounds of}} <b>neutralism.</b> Khánh noted that they {{had served in the}} French-backed VNA, although he did as well. The generals were flown to My Khe beach, near Đà Nẵng, along with Generals Tôn Thất Đính and Mai Hữu Xuân, the interior minister and police chief, respectively, of the MRC.|$|E
25|$|However, Khánh {{received}} little assistance from Minh, who resented his deposal by a younger officer whom he {{viewed as an}} unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the detention of his colleagues and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter were set free when Minh demanded that Khánh release them {{as a condition for}} his cooperation. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged plot as long as he could, and then claimed that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and implement <b>neutralism.</b> Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hit man US$1,300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. U.S. intelligence officials in Vietnam found the story spurious.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 29 January, Khiêm ordered troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon, including armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions. Khánh then went to sleep. Khánh headed to the staff headquarters, where {{he saw that the}} compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over without a shot being fired. Generals Dương Văn Minh, Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim woke up to find Khiêm's men surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers, having had no inkling of the plot. Khánh put them under house arrest, later charging them with <b>neutralism.</b> In a morning radio broadcast Khánh said he had conducted the coup because of the junta's failure to make progress against the Viet Cong. After the coup, Khiêm became Defense Minister and the Chairman of Joint General Staff while serving on the junta.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{the authoritarian}} Diệm became {{increasingly}} unpopular {{due to the}} Buddhist crisis and the ARVN generals decided to launch a coup, which Minh eventually led. Diệm was assassinated on 2 November 1963 shortly after being deposed. Minh was accused of ordering an aide, Nguyễn Văn Nhung, to kill Diệm. Minh then led a junta for three months, but he was an unsuccessful leader and was heavily criticized for being lethargic and uninterested. During his three months of rule, many civilian problems intensified and the communists made significant gains. Angered at not receiving his desired post, General Nguyễn Khánh led a group of similarly motivated officers in a bloodless coup in January 1964. Khánh allowed Minh to stay on as a token head of state in order to capitalize on Minh's public standing, but Khánh had the real power. In the meantime, Khánh had four of Minh's colleagues tried and put under house arrest on purported charges of promoting <b>neutralism</b> and a truce with the communists. After a power struggle, Khanh had Minh exiled. Minh stayed away before deciding to return and challenge General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu {{in the presidential election}} of 1971. When it became obvious that Thieu would rig the poll, Minh withdrew and did not return until 1972, keeping a low profile.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the coup, Lon Nol did not {{immediately}} launch Cambodia into war. He appealed to the international community and to the United Nations in an attempt to gain support for the new government and condemned violations of Cambodia's neutrality [...] "by foreign forces, whatever camp they come from." [...] His hope for continued <b>neutralism</b> availed him no more than it had Sihanouk.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held {{behind closed doors}} and the public was not {{informed}} of the results nor that legal proceedings had occurred until a few days later. Despite the outcome, when the matter was made public, it was accompanied with a warning from Khánh against <b>neutralism.</b> The public press release stated that Khánh's junta had taken a lenient approach to enhance [...] "the spirit of unity and the traditional comradeship in arms of the armed forces." [...] Some civilians in Khánh's cabinet were caught off-guard by the secret hearing and one spoke out, saying [...] "Letting them go like this removes the apparent justification for the whole Government's existence". The junta statement did not specifically charge anyone of <b>neutralism</b> but said that repetition of such activities could result in discharges from the military, implying that neutralist moves had occurred in the past. It warned of [...] "infliction of all the punishments reserved for military personnel who have committed the crime of treason against {{the people in the}} struggled against the Communists and neutralists." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} radio {{broadcast}} upon seizing power, {{which did not}} occur until 16:00, Khánh assailed the former regime for its performance during its three months at the top. He said [...] "The political, economic, and social situation in the countryside still offers no promising prospect. There has not been one single compensation worthy of the sacrifices accepted daily by the soldiers." [...] He alluded to a neutralist plot, claiming that [...] "some persons" [...] had joined [...] "with the colonialists standing for <b>neutralism</b> in order {{to pave the way}} for the Communists to enslave us". Khánh's broadcast was signed by 17 generals and 32 other senior officers. Many observers were immediately sceptical of the claims of <b>neutralism</b> and regarded personal ambition as the motivating factor all along. An anonymous source close to the plotters told The New York Times that [...] "We were anxious about them indeed...and we had conclusive proof that they had been talking with the French in terms of a neutralized Vietnam and that North Vietnam had given support to the plan", explicitly naming Kim and Xuan.|$|E
500|$|Khánh's actions left {{divisions}} {{among the}} {{officers of the}} ARVN who became dissatisfied with him. When Khánh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that the four generals were innocent; the original documents that Khánh claimed proved his accusations of <b>neutralism</b> were neither presented to nor found by anyone. Robert Shaplen said that [...] "the case...continued {{to be one of}} Khánh's biggest embarrassments". Nevertheless, despite what the South Vietnamese public may have thought of him, Khánh enjoyed continuing confidence among the Americans until the latter part of 1964.|$|E
500|$|With {{many of its}} articles, Seara popularized Marghiloman's {{views on}} {{conservatism}} and geopolitics. Conservative in outlook, the Russophobic and anti-Slavic Karnabatt outlined his political vision in some detail, discussing the Entente's imminent [...] "bankruptcy". Ilie Bărbulescu, a Slavist and Marghiloman Conservative who advocated pro-German <b>neutralism,</b> also published articles in Seara during 1915. Beyond this conservative core, Seara colored its pages in various shades of left-wing advocacies, from socialism and social democracy to anarchism. According to literary historian Paul Cernat, the ideological ambiguity and conjectural alliances between socialists and conservatives was motivated by a common enemy, the pro-Entente and [...] "plutocratic" [...] National Liberal Party.|$|E
500|$|Increasingly {{concerned}} at the growing leftist {{trend in the}} country, Quwatli called for a national unity government that would include parties from {{across the political spectrum}} on 15 February 1956. Despite opposition from the Ba'athists, Quwatli managed to preside over a [...] "national covenant" [...] which entailed a foreign policy of opposition to Zionism and imperialism as well as the adoption of <b>neutralism</b> amid the Cold War. Nonetheless, and against Quwatli's advice, Ghazzi resigned from his post in June 1956 as a result of pressure from the Ba'athists and the communists who had been leading protests against Ghazzi's decision to lift the ban on wheat sales to Western Europe. Faced with few options, Quwatli reappointed Asali as Prime Minister. Asali moved to further strengthen ties with Egypt, including a pledge to start unity talks, and appointed Ba'athists to the ministerial positions of economy and foreign affairs.|$|E
500|$|On {{his third}} day in Washington, Diệm was {{the keynote speaker}} and guest at a National Press Club lunch. He {{attacked}} Asian leaders who advocated <b>neutralism,</b> saying that [...] "Since communism is not neutral, we cannot be neutral". This impressed the media, who prominently noted Diệm's unequivocal stance in their reports. The Pulitzer Prize-winning Marguerite Higgins of the New York Herald Tribune said that [...] "it is a refreshingalmost startlingexperience to hear this Asian hero assert forthrightly: 'communism isn't neutral, therefore we cannot be neutral.'... He made himself unique among recent Asian visitors... by the decisiveness with which he publicly chose up sides with the United States and against the communists". In her critique, Higgins again criticized the stances of Nehru and Sukarno. Such was the impact of Diệm's soundbite that the AFV thereafter {{used it as a}} headline quote in their mailouts and campaigns.|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{presided over}} their trial of Đính {{and his colleagues}} on 28 May 1964. The generals were interrogated for {{five and a half}} hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the {{original}} charge of promoting <b>neutralism.</b> As all of the officers were involved in Diệm's overthrow, the hearings did not reveal any new information. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] the generals, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality" [...] and unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". Đính's quartet were allowed to remain in Đà Lạt under surveillance.|$|E
500|$|Before dawn on January 30, {{the coup}} forces caught the junta {{completely}} off-guard and seized power without a fight. Khánh grudgingly {{decided to keep}} Minh as a figurehead chief of state while maintaining real power in his hands as Minh was popular within {{the army and the}} Americans wanted a show of unity to be maintained. Khánh also tried to consolidate his standing in the military by promoting a group of younger officers, and increasing the pay of the enlisted men. In the meantime, the other key generals in the junta, Don, Kim, Dinh and Xuan were put under house arrest, accused by Khánh of attempting to negotiate a peace deal with North Vietnam. However, when they were brought to a military trial presided over by Khánh, the junta leader did not provide any evidence and convicted them of [...] "lax morality". Khánh then allowed them back to meaningless desk jobs, but the show trial brought him much embarrassment. Khánh later admitted that there was no basis to the charges of <b>neutralism</b> against the four generals, and after a tumultuous year in power, Khánh was himself deposed in February 1965 and forced into exile.|$|E
500|$|The Americans became {{increasingly}} {{worried about the}} growing chasm in the outlook towards the war, and on advice from his advisers, Johnson described <b>neutralism</b> as [...] "another name for a Communist takeover" [...] in a New Year's message to Minh. As Minh remained adamant about these policies, Roger Hilsman and Lodge, the main proponents of removing Diệm, began to lose confidence in the junta, joining the military establishment, who had opposed the coup against Diệm in the first place. In a January 21 meeting between Harkins, Lodge, Minh, Kim and Tho, the Americans mooted a plan to bomb North Vietnam and were explicitly rebuffed by Minh, who thought that such actions would result in escalation and be counterproductive, possibly inducing a Chinese land incursion akin to what had happened during the Korean War. The Australian historian Anne E. Blair identified this meeting as sealing Minh's political [...] "death warrant" [...] because when Lodge reported the meeting to Washington, the leading generals in the US military lobbied McNamara claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the US should simply take control of anti-communist military policy.|$|E
500|$|The generals were {{secretly}} interrogated {{for five}} and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the original charge of promoting <b>neutralism.</b> As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Diệm, this did not reveal any information new to them.

They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". Khánh also assailed Dinh, claiming that he had derogatorily compared Khánh to Gamal Abdel Nasser in a meeting with Diệm. The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers shook hands and made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years, and Don 18 months. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in [...] "research and planning". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, Khánh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.|$|E
2500|$|During 1915, {{networking}} between Romania and France, Filipescu jr {{helped his}} father by denouncing the mainline Conservatives. He focused on Alexandru Marghiloman, who stood accused of plotting {{to establish a}} Germanophile cabinet and of consciously undermining France–Romania relations. In an interview with Le Journal, Grigore backed Nicolae's [...] "arduous interventionist campaign", expressing regret that Romania had failed to strike the Central Powers {{in conjunction with the}} Gallipoli Campaign. However, he noted that the PNL's <b>neutralism</b> had [...] "some arguments in its favor." [...] At times, his sporting interests interfered with his politics: at the Bucharest Jockey Club in early 1916, he had a publicized row with Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, ambassador of the German Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Bửu Hội {{advocated}} a new [...] "government of national solidarity" [...] in Saigon that incorporated the religious sects. This contrasted to Diệm, {{who wanted to}} have unchallenged power with the sects in a subservient position. He felt that this would foster reconciliation between non-Communist nationalists in the south. Bửu Hội opposed a military buildup in the south, reasoning that the best defense against insurrection came from fostering popular participation in the administrative and economic institutions of the state. He favoured <b>neutralism</b> in South Vietnam's foreign affairs while remaining on positive terms with France and the United States. He argued that the colonial era and Vietnam's natural place in Asia was to join other nations such as India in a policy of non-alignment. He hoped that both North and South Vietnam could be admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
2500|$|Caton did {{not share}} his brother's worldview. He was in France as the war started, and had to take an unusually long trip back to Romania, through Italy, Greece, and the Turkish Straits. Recounting his {{adventure}} in Adevărul, {{he argued that the}} world was poised for an Entente victory. Privately, however, he was also in favor of <b>neutralism.</b> As argued by historian Lucian Boia, he was [...] "hypochondriac and restless", especially alarmed by news of aerial bombardments. In July 1916, as the conflict of visions split the SSR into factions, Theodorian resigned his position on the committee. He politely declined when asked by the prestigious novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu to return and ensure [...] "continuity"; later, he resigned from the syndicate altogether. He ran for reelection at the reading committee, against George Ranetti. Ranetti claimed that, although he lost, Theodorian was still appointed, being favored by Education Minister Ion G. Duca.|$|E
2500|$|Khánh tried Xuân and {{his colleagues}} in May. The generals were interrogated for {{five and a half}} hours, mostly about details of the coup against Diệm, rather than the {{original}} charge of promoting <b>neutralism.</b> As Khánh was involved in the plot as well, this did not reveal any new information. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] Xuân {{and his colleagues}}, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality", unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". Xuân and his fellow generals were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". They were allowed to remain in Đà Lạt under surveillance with their families.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-1950s, KPRP factions, the [...] "urban committee" [...] (headed by Tou Samouth), and the [...] "rural committee" [...] (headed by Sieu Heng), emerged. In {{very general}} terms, these groups espoused {{divergent}} revolutionary lines. The prevalent [...] "urban" [...] line, endorsed by North Vietnam, recognized that Sihanouk, {{by virtue of}} his success in winning independence from the French, was a genuine national leader whose <b>neutralism</b> and deep distrust of the United States made him a valuable asset in Hanoi's struggle to [...] "liberate" [...] South Vietnam. Champions of this line hoped that the prince could be persuaded to distance himself from the right wing and to adopt leftist policies. The other line, supported for the most part by rural cadres who were familiar with the harsh realities of the countryside, advocated an immediate struggle to overthrow the [...] "feudalist" [...] Sihanouk. In 1959 Sieu Heng defected to the government and provided the security forces with information that enabled them to destroy as much as 90% of the party's rural apparatus. Although communist networks in Phnom Penh and in other towns under Tou Samouth's jurisdiction fared better, only a few hundred communists remained active in the country by 1960.|$|E
2500|$|Mậu {{was mainly}} {{responsible}} for stifling anti-government sentiment. Saigon newspapers, which {{been able to}} operate liberally in the post-Diệm era, reported that the junta was paralysed because all twelve generals in the MRC had equal power. They strongly attacked Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, accusing his civilian government of being [...] "tools" [...] of the MRC. They also questioned Thơ's activities under Diệm's presidency, accusing him of personally benefiting from corruption under Diệm's land policy. Mậu's ministry had already circulated {{a long list of}} topics which could not be reported. Thơ could no longer tolerate what was being reported about him. He called journalists into his office and assailed them for what he regarded as inaccurate, irresponsible and disloyal reporting. Thơ accused them of lying, and claimed one of the journalists was a communist while another was a drug addict. He said that his administration would [...] "take steps to meet the situation" [...] if the media did not behave responsibly. The next day Mậu's ministry closed down three newspapers for [...] "disloyalty". During this time, Mậu enacted the [...] "Golden Rules" [...] to govern media conduct: Do not promote Communism or <b>neutralism.</b> Do not endanger national security or the army's morale. Do not spread false news of any kind. Do not slander individuals. Do not bolster vices.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1963, {{a series}} of {{celebrations}} were held by Buddhist priests all over South Vietnam to honor the 2,527th anniversary of Lord Buddha's birthday. The Catholic Diem disapproved of the birthday celebrations of Lord Buddha and {{a series of}} clashes occurred all over South Vietnam as the police sought to end the marches. When she heard that Diệm was to sign a statement offering compensation to the families of Buddhist protesters shot dead by the police of his brother Ngô Đình Cẩn, she was reported to have thrown a bowl of soup at him. On 8 June 1963, Madame Nhu released a statement through the Women's Solidarity Movement accusing the Buddhists of <b>neutralism,</b> effectively accusing them of being communist collaborators. It then implored [...] "bonzes of good faith" [...] to stop helping the communists, otherwise Vietnamese Buddhism would be seen as a [...] "small anti-nationalist branch of a dubious international association, exploited and controlled by communism and oriented to the sowing of the disorder of neutralism" [...] and calling on Diem to [...] "immediately expel all foreign agitators whether they wear monks' robes or not." [...] She made another attack on the United States, calling on Diệm to [...] "keep vigilance on all others, particularly those inclined to take Viet Nam for [...] satellite of [...] foreign power or organization." [...] Madame Nhu publicly mocked Thích Quảng Đức, who performed a self-immolation on 11 June 1963 in a crowded Saigon street to protest against the shooting of Buddhists by Diệm's regime. She labelled it a [...] "barbecue" [...] and stated, [...] "Let them burn and we shall clap our hands." [...] She further offered to provide more fuel and matches for the Buddhists, noting the [...] "barbecuing" [...] was not [...] "self-sufficient" [...] because [...] "imported gasoline" [...] was used. The monk's suicide followed Ngo Dinh Nhu's repression of the Buddhist-inspired protests and was responsible for the regime's continuing instability.
