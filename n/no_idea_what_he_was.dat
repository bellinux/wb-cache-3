500|$|Adelina Poerio {{was cast}} as the {{fleeting}} red-coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome. Standing at only 4'2" [...] tall, she had {{a career as a}} singer. Renato Scarpa was cast as Inspector Longhi, despite not being able to speak English and so he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying in the film.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but you had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> or {{what he was going}} to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{returned}} to his parents' home in Harlem in 1923 with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do next. He considered returning to music, but an old school friend suggested that he try boxing. At one amateur match, fight announcer Joe Humphries saw the name [...] "Canagata, Lee" [...] on the card he was using. He tossed the card aside and instead announced [...] "Canada Lee"—a name that Lee liked and adopted. In the amateur ring he won 90 out of 100 bouts and the national amateur lightweight title.|$|E

500|$|In October 2011, Gallagher told Newsnight he {{believed}} the then Labour leader Ed Miliband was [...] "utterly uninspiring and dull", and said <b>he</b> had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> stood for.|$|R
2500|$|Aaron {{surmised that}} this setting would also return the Apollo 12 {{telemetry}} to normal. When {{he made the}} recommendation to the Flight Director, [...] "Flight, try SCE to Aux", most of his mission control colleagues had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about. Both the flight director and the Capcom asked him to repeat the recommendation. Pete Conrad's response to the order was, [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] Fortunately Alan Bean {{was familiar with the}} location of the SCE switch inside the capsule, and flipped it to auxiliary. Telemetry was immediately restored, allowing the mission to continue. This earned Aaron the lasting respect of his colleagues, who declared that he was a [...] "steely-eyed missile man".|$|E
2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is amazing," [...] he admitted, [...] "but {{it is the}} truth. I know it for a fact. The man was {{absolutely}} beside himself, he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} diplomat, {{with a little}} bow and an incredulous expression, as if the lady could have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> might yet know, [...] "I am so much obliged to you! I am so thankful!" ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is during}} this period that he {{encounters}} an assassin named Clay who has the same powers as Jamie. Although killed after telling Jamie that the Multiple Man has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> truly is, Clay would come back later.|$|R
5000|$|... "Roth's show is ... skin-crawlingly awful. ... In {{these days}} of bland Clear Channel/Infinity {{corporate}} radio, it's bracing to hear {{a guy who has}} <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing. ... Listening to Roth, you feel actual physical pain." [...] - Rob Sheffield, Rolling Stone ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you," [...] Sabatini repeated, [...] "that not only am I ignorant {{as to how}} the man met with his death, but I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing in the house at all. The night Rosario was there it was different. They were on his track then, without a doubt, and they meant mischief. Since then, however, there has been a {{pronounced}} difference of opinion between the two branches of the revolutionary party--the one which I represent and the one which includes Lalonde and his friends. The consequence is that although we may be said to be working for the same ends, we have drawn a little apart. We have had no communications whatever with Lalonde and his friends since the murder of Rosario. Therefore, I can only repeat that I am entirely in the dark as to what that man was doing in my sister's rooms or how he met with his death. You must remember that these fellows are all more or less criminals. Lalonde, I believe, is something of an exception, but the rest of them are at war with Society to the extent of enriching themselves at the expense of their wealthier neighbors on every possible occasion. It is quite likely that the night they were watching Rosario it may have occurred to them that my sister's room contained a good many valuable trifles and was easily entered, especially as they seem to have had a meeting place close at hand. That, however, is pure surmise. You follow me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Being angry was a relief, {{but it was}} {{not exactly}} a solution, and Bernard, at last, leaving his place, where {{for an hour or two}} he had been {{absolutely}} unconscious of everything that went on around him, wandered about for some time in deep restlessness and irritation. At one moment he thought of going back to Gordon's hotel, to see him, to explain. But then he became aware that he was too angry for that--to say nothing of Gordon's being too angry also; and, moreover, that there was nothing to explain. He was to marry Angela Vivian; that was a very simple fact--it needed no explanation. Was it so wonderful, so inconceivable, an incident so unlikely to happen? He went, as he always did on Sunday, to dine with Mrs. Vivian, and it seemed to him that he perceived in the two ladies some symptoms of a discomposure which had the same origin as his own. Bernard, on this occasion, at dinner, failed to make himself particularly agreeable; he ate fast--as if he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eating, and talked little; every now and then his eyes rested for some time upon Angela, with a strange, eagerly excited expression, as if he were looking her over and trying to make up his mind about her afresh. This young lady bore his inscrutable scrutiny with a deal of superficial composure; but she was also silent, and she returned his gaze, from time to time, with an air of unusual anxiety. She was thinking, of course, of Gordon, Bernard said to himself; and a woman's first meeting, in after years, with an ex-lover must always make a certain impression upon her. Gordon, however, had never been a lover, and if Bernard noted Angela's gravity it was not because he felt jealous. [...] "She is simply sorry for him," [...] he said to himself; and by the time he had finished his dinner it began to come back to him that he was sorry, too. Mrs. Vivian was probably sorry as well, for she had a slightly confused and preoccupied look--a look from which, even in the midst of his chagrin, Bernard extracted some entertainment. It was Mrs. Vivian's intermittent conscience that had been reminded of one of its lapses; her meeting with Gordon Wright had recalled the least exemplary episode of her life--the time when she whispered mercenary counsel in the ear of a daughter who sat, grave and pale, looking at her with eyes that wondered. Mrs. Vivian blushed a little now, when she met Bernard's eyes; and to remind herself that she was after all a virtuous woman, talked as much as possible about superior and harmless things--the beauty of the autumn weather, the pleasure of seeing French papas walking about on Sunday with their progeny in their hands, the peculiarities of the pulpit-oratory of the country as exemplified in the discourse of a Protestant pasteur whom she had been to hear in the morning.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{he was a}} young man, Mick had no idea he was {{different}} from other children. He discovered he {{was different}} when describing [...] "sparkiness" [...] with other children, who had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, Drake was {{questioned}} by the FBI about {{the murder of her}} then-boyfriend and known mobster, Louis Amberg. She claimed to only know him as [...] "Mr. Cohen" [...] and had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did for a living.|$|R

5000|$|... "And {{he said it}} so smooth, so fast," [...] recalls Searles. [...] "We {{just kind}} of smiled and had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying. We were rookies. I {{had no idea what}} was going on. But every {{briefcase}} zipped up and closed and everyone sat up straight in their chairs. It was over.|$|E

5000|$|Only half awake, {{he thinks}} he is hallucinating when he finds his presumably dead wife sitting at his side asking him reproachfully why {{he has tried to}} murder her.

50|$|Mr. Wilhelm {{is delighted}} with the job George did on the project; however, George has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did or how he did it. Unknowingly to George, Mr. Wilhelm had {{forgotten}} to take his medication and did it himself, which would explain his compliment (he {{did the same thing}} with the gardener at home).|$|R
50|$|His name {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the Popish Plot fabricated by Titus Oates in 1678. Oates unwisely claimed to have met Don John in Madrid; when questioned closely by Charles II, who had met Don John in 1656, {{it became clear that}} Oates had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> looked like, confirming the King's suspicion that the Plot was an invention.|$|R
60|$|She was {{not angry}} with him now, but puzzled; she had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant: she {{accepted}} the situation, she had indeed a vague {{feeling that he was}} behaving in a very noble fashion and that she ought to admire it; but also she felt inclined to laugh at him and perhaps even to despise him a little.|$|R
50|$|When we were {{beginning}} {{to work out the}} songs for Sunday Mornings, my friend Dave Gibbs, formerly of Gigolo Aunts and now Low Stars, said ‘Why don’t you record ‘You Can’t Count On Me’?’ I told him I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about. He said it was one of his favorite songs of mine and sent me an mp3 of my original demo.|$|E
50|$|Madison {{did things}} she never would’ve done; {{had sex with}} strange men, smoked, taking what looked like ecstasy and fools around with women. When her {{landlord}} says Madison could pay the rent with sexual favors like before, Madison said she had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about, so he got angry and ordered her to pay him with cash. She even did drugs by sticking a needle in her arm {{with the help of}} Grace.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dangerous Brian" [...] Conley was Conley's alter-ego stuntman. He {{would perform}} stunts that would often vary in danger and ludicrousness, {{some of which}} he'd often not perform. Stunts varied from bungee jumps to riding pizza {{delivery}} scooters. From the second series, he was accompanied by commentator John Sachs who would often make fun of Dangerous much to his despair. He was occasionally joined by his scrawny helper, Nearly Dangerous Norris (played by Ray Tizzard) who dressed in a pink costume and often had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E

I believe he is well up in anatomy, {{and he is a}} {{first-class}} chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors." ...|$|R
60|$|Felix {{drew the}} bow softly, perplexedly over the strings. <b>He</b> had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should play. Then {{his eyes were}} caught and held by Naomi's burning, mesmeric, blue gaze as she lay on her {{crumpled}} pillow. A strange, inspired look came over the boy's face. He began to play {{as if it were}} not he who played, but some mightier power, of which he was but the passive instrument.|$|R

5000|$|Kim {{borrowed}} from friends, took out loans, {{spent all of}} his savings, and mortgaged his school to produce the film. He had never made a film before. Erin Sullivan of Orlando Weekly said that Kim [...] "had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing". Kim said that he hoped to find a distributor so the film would play nationally, but hundreds of distribution companies and studios rejected the film, including {{all of the major}} film distributors and several independent film distributors. He later said that [...] "Every distribution company rejected it after screening and said to me, 'Don't waste your time. Just throw it away; it is trash.' [...] ".|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{a report}} issued {{by the office of}} the New Jersey State Comptroller {{revealed}} that an attorney for North Bergen made $18,800 a year plus health benefits, but township officials had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, or whether he was even at work. It was reported that he was hired between the years of 1988 and 1990. He had been actively working until 2006, when he had a falling out with a township official and stopped receiving legal work. Despite not being assigned work, the attorney told investigators that throughout his employment with the township, he was routinely solicited to make political contributions to Nick Sacco's political allies. His contributions in 2012 to this committee totaled $6,600.|$|E

60|$|Dick {{looked at}} her, helplessly.
