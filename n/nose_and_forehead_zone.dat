50|$|The {{traditional}} Māori greeting, the Hongi is done {{by pressing}} one's <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead,</b> at the same time, to another encounter. It is used at traditional meetings among Māori people and on major ceremonies and serves a similar purpose to a formal handshake. In the hongi, the ha (or breath of life), is exchanged. The breath of life can also be interpreted as the sharing of both people’s souls.|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} very fine and good. His eyes were gray-blue, deep and quiet but {{slightly}} smiling, as were his lips, which his golden-brown mustache shaded {{but did not}} hide. He was kept smiling in this quizzical way by the nervous chatter of the girl beside him. His profile, which was the view Allen had of him, was handsome. The strong, straight <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> abrupt <b>forehead</b> formed a marked contrast to the rather characterless <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> retreating <b>forehead</b> of the girl.|$|R
50|$|The face can {{be divided}} into six {{different}} regions with unique anatomic and aesthetic features: the facial aesthetic units. There are three central and three peripheral aesthetic units: eyelids, <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> lips, <b>and</b> <b>forehead,</b> cheek <b>and</b> chin, respectively. The aesthetic surface anatomy characteristics of the cheek have been described eloquently by Menick.|$|R

60|$|As he rode {{across the}} desert, even though keen eyes {{searched for the}} moving black dots, the rising puffs of white dust that were warnings, he saw Nell's face in every cloud.

60|$|In silence {{all three}} bent {{their eyes on}} the baby. His little fists, <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead,</b> even his little naked, crinkled feet, were thrust with all his feeble {{strength}} against his mother's bosom, as though he were striving to creep into some hole away from life. There was a sort of dumb despair in that tiny pushing of {{his way back to the}} place whence he had come. His head, covered with dingy down, quivered with his effort to escape. He had been alive so little; that little had sufficed. Martin put his pipe back into his mouth.|$|R

Presently a terrible kick occurred. This was the seaman's toe against the step, {{of which he had}} been warned, but which he had totally forgotten; then a softer, but much heavier blow, was heard, accompanied by a savage growl--that was the seaman's <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> against old Mrs Roby's portal.|$|R

50|$|Although {{cleaning}} the guest rooms {{was one of}} Lizzie and Emma's regular chores, John Morse had slept in the room the previous night, and Abby had gone up to the room to make the bed. According to the forensic investigation, Abby was facing her killer {{at the time of}} the attack. She was first struck on the side of the head with a hatchet which cut her just above the ear, causing her to turn and fall face down on the floor, creating contusions on her <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead.</b> Her killer then struck her multiple times, delivering 17 direct hits to the back of her head, until she was dead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper tackles a {{particular}} shape matching problem: given a data base of shapes (described as triangular meshes), we search for all shapes which describe a human. We {{do so by}} applying a 3 D face detection approach on the mesh which consists of three steps: first, a local symmetry value is computed for each vertex. Then, the symmetry values in a certain neighborhood of each vertex are analyzed for building sharp symmetry lines. Finally, the geometry around each vertex is analyzed to get further facial features like <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead.</b> We tested our approach with several shape data bases (e. g. the Princeton Shape Benchmark) and achieved high rates of correct face detection. ...|$|R

50|$|Placed on {{and around}} the head and face, the beauty {{micrometer}} uses flexible metal strips which align with a person's facial features. The screws holding the strips in place allow for 325 adjustments, enabling the operator to make fine measurements with a precision of one thousandth of an inch. The inventors stated {{that there are two}} key measurements that they looked for: the heights of the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> should be the same, and the eyes should be separated by the width of one eye. When an imperfection is identified, corrective make-up can be applied to enhance or subdue the feature. The company Max Factor claims that the device helped Max Factor, Sr. to better understand the female face.|$|R

50|$|Archaeologists {{increasingly}} use paleopathology as {{an important}} main tool for understanding the lives of ancient peoples. For example, cranial deformation {{is evident in the}} skulls of the Maya, where a straight line between <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> may have been preferred over an angle or slope. There is also evidence for trepanation, or drilling holes in the cranium, either singly or several times in a single individual. Partially or completely healed trepanations indicate that this procedure was often survived. The 10,000 year-old human remains discovered at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, reportedly show extreme traumatic lesions to the head, neck, ribs, knees and hands, including embedded stone projectiles, and they may represent the earliest evidence of inter-group conflict between hunter-gatherers in the past.|$|R

60|$|Fort {{stood at}} the end of the perambulator, and looked at that other fellow's baby. In the shade of the hood, with the frilly clothes, it seemed to him lying with its head downhill.

60|$|I {{forget the}} drift of the conversation, {{or what it}} was made Isabel {{interrupt}} me. She did interrupt me. She had been lying prone {{on the ground at}} my right hand, chin on fists, listening thoughtfully, and I was sitting beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat. I turned to Isabel's voice, and saw her face uplifted, and her dear cheeks <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> all splashed <b>and</b> barred with sunlight and the shadows of the twigs of the trees behind me. And something--an infinite tenderness, stabbed me. It was a keen physical feeling, like nothing I had ever felt before. It had a quality of tears in it. For {{the first time in my}} narrow and concentrated life another human being had really thrust into my being and gripped my very heart.|$|R
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|R
30|$|As one ages, facial {{blemishes}} like wrinkles, freckles, and age spots appear. Underneath the skin, melanin-producing {{cells are}} damaged due to {{exposure to the}} suns’ ultraviolet (UV) rays. Freckles and age spots appear due to overproduction of melanin. Consequently, light-reflecting collagen not only decreases but also becomes non-uniformly distributed making facial skin tone non-uniform [1]. Parts adversely affected by sunlight are the upper cheek, <b>nose,</b> <b>nose</b> bridge, <b>and</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ornaments}} that chiefs wear {{over their}} left hip most often depict the human face but {{are different in}} form from the pectorals. They have a decorative flange around the lower portion of the face, usually representing either coiled mudfish, an openwork lattice or guilloche pattern, or a fluted collar, with a row of small loops directly below or behind it. A collar of coral beads is depicted below the face, and above the face is a latticework coral-beaded cap with clusters of coral beads at the edges. The face has three raised keloid scarification marks (ikharo) above each eye. Some masks are inlaid with a strip of metal down the forehead and/or nose. The most likely explanation for this marking is that it indicates urebo, a protective mixture of herbs and chalk, which was rubbed on the <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> to ward off danger during festivals. Earlier scholarship suggested that sacrificial blood was also in this mixture.|$|R
60|$|As {{with the}} skull, {{so with the}} nose; the ancient Huns during the age of Attila were {{accustomed}} to flatten the noses of their infants with bandages, “{{for the sake of}} exaggerating a natural conformation.” With the Tahitians, to be called, long-nose is considered as an insult, and they compress the <b>noses</b> <b>and</b> <b>foreheads</b> of their children for the sake of beauty. So it is with the Malays of Sumatra, the Hottentots, certain Negroes, and the natives of Brazil.[442] The Chinese have by nature unusually small feet;[443] and {{it is well known that}} the women of the upper classes distort their feet to make them still smaller. Lastly, Humboldt thinks that the American Indians prefer colouring their bodies with red paint in order to exaggerate their natural tint; and until recently European women added to their naturally bright colours by rouge and white cosmetics; but I doubt whether many barbarous nations have had any such intention in painting themselves.|$|R
50|$|Wood was {{renowned for}} walking {{everywhere}} rather than paying {{the cost of}} a carriage. One story records that once he travelled back to Gloucester from Tewkesbury {{in the back of a}} passing hearse, laid out in the space usually reserved for the deceased. His miserliness and wealth brought him national fame with Toby Jugs and a Staffordshire figure being created based on him. His profile of protruding chin <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> sloping <b>forehead,</b> made him prime fodder for caricaturists.|$|R
30|$|At initial ARDS {{diagnosis}} and after 24  h, pulse oximetry results were retrospectively collected, {{and the corresponding}} SpO 2 /FiO 2 was calculated. For this, we first collected ten successive nurse-validated SpO 2 and FiO 2 values over 10  min directly preceding, and at the time, an arterial blood sample was drawn for blood gas analysis. The median of these ten SpO 2 and FiO 2 values was {{used to calculate the}} SpO 2 /FiO 2 to alleviate potential artifactual SpO 2 values. In all patients, pulse oximetry was measured by conventional two-wavelength finger pulse oximeters. The local protocol dictated a change in finger position every 3 – 4  h to avoid decubitus lesions and to use alternative probes, such as <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> <b>forehead</b> probes, only in patients in whom no adequate signal could be obtained with a conventional pulse oximeter on a finger. In addition to this, PaO 2 and PaCO 2 levels, pH levels and body temperature were collected, and it was determined whether or not patients received treatment with vasopressors at both time points.|$|R
