5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
25|$|Määttä {{joined a}} London team primed {{to make a}} run for the J. Ross Robertson Cup. The Knights won their first five games by a {{combined}} score of 31–10 and did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>back.</b> London ended the regular season with {{the best record in the}} OHL (49–18–0–1) and the top defence in their conference. Along the way to posting a +25 plus-minus rating for the team, Määttä paced the team in defensive scoring with 32 points in 58 games, despite missing 6 games in the middle of the season to play for Finland at the 2012 World Junior Championships. Seeking to improve on Finland's sixth-place finish in 2011, Määttä was expected to be a key contributor for his team, but in the tournament opener he was concussed on a hit by Canada's Boone Jenner and missed the remainder of the tournament. Finland ultimately finished fourth without him. In the OHL playoffs, Määttä continued his strong play, only being held pointless in just five of London's 19 post-season games. As the Knights rolled through each series, losing only three games on their way to their first title since 2004–05, Määttä finished tied for the team lead in scoring with 23 points in 19 games.|$|E

500|$|Michelle Bush, in {{her book}} Myth-X, noted that the oil {{platform}} is named [...] "Galpex-Orpheux", {{a reference to the}} ancient Greek religious and mythological figure Orpheus, who was a legendary musician, poet, and prophet. According to the myth, Orpheus's wife Eurydice was killed by a serpent. Hades, the god of the underworld—after hearing Orpheus' moving music—allowed Orpheus to retrieve his wife as long as he does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at her until they are safely out of the underworld. Orpheus fails, and his wife's soul slips back into the underworld. Bush compared Orpheus's otherworldly singing to the [...] "broadband signal which is the catalyst for the events on the rig". In the episode, Mulder, Doggett, and the two Huecha Indians [...] "wreck havoc" [...] because of their fear, and the [...] "black oil slips back to the underworld".|$|E
500|$|In the Underworld, Proserpina, Queen of Hades, who {{has been}} deeply {{affected}} by Orfeo's singing, petitions King Plutone, her husband, for Euridice's release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone agrees on the condition that, as he leads Euridice towards the world, Orfeo must <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>back.</b> If he does, [...] "a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss". Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife's white bosom. But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in: [...] "Who will assure me that she is following?". Perhaps, he thinks, Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an off-stage commotion, Orfeo looks round; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly: [...] "Losest thou me through too much love?" [...] and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{initiated}} a storyline twist when choosing to have JR {{open up to}} Babe about his feelings moments after Babe has engaged in sexual intercourse with Josh {{for the first and}} only time, with this being unknown to JR.

She's like, 'How can I walk away when he's doing what I've always wanted him to do?’" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E

5000|$|The journal's name, Orpheu was {{not chosen}} by {{accident}} - as in Greek myth, Orpheus (Orfeu in Portuguese) was the musician who, {{to save his}} wife Eurydice from Hades, had to travel {{from the world of}} the living with the stipulation to <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back.</b> It was this metaphor that was important to the men of the Geração de Orpheu: the <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> the forgetting, the relinquishing of the past and the concentration of attention and force to the journey ahead, to the future, for the [...] "edification of Portugal in the twentieth century." [...] After bursting onto the Portuguese literary scene in 1915, the journal folded due to financial insolvency, since the father of Sá-Carneiro, unwilling sponsor of the publication, refused the role. Only two issues were published (Jan-Feb-Mar and Apr-May-Jun, 1915). The third issue of Orpheu, that was already in printing proof, was lost during many years and it was finally recovered and published in 1984.|$|R
