40|$|Counting roaring stags {{during the}} rut has been {{proposed}} {{as a means to}} assess deer population size and trends but few, if any, {{attempts have been made to}} evaluate the reliability of this technique. By means of a commonly used field protocol, we assessed to what extent relative abundance estimates of red deer (Cervus elaphus) based on roaring-stag counts in the northern Apennines (Italy) were susceptible to exogenous and unpredictable sources of variability. By using up to 26 simultaneous observers in an area of 5218 ha, we estimated densities from 0. 45 to 0. 61 roaring stags per 100 ha in 3 consecutive years (1992 - 94), corresponding to annual changes in the number of counted roaring stags ranging from - 21 % to + 35. 7 %. However, only in two of the three years were seasonal trends and peaks in roaring activity apparent, and timing of the survey was not always synchronous with the roaring peak. In addition, annual and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>variation</b> in roaring activity, and weather conditions during the survey, might have influenced the counts to some extent, probably determining high Type I and Type II error rates. We contend that additional sources of error, associated with unknown demographic and ecological settings, may further increase unreliability of the technique when it is used to estimate absolute density of red deer populations. We conclude by emphasising that managers should not use this method for population monitoring unless they can prove it can yield reliable results...|$|E

High-resolution Na lidar measurements were taken throughout the diurnal and annual cycle (1996 – 98) at Urbana, Illinois (40 °N, 88 °W) to characterize the seasonal behavior of the 24, 12, 8 and 6 -hr tides. Complementary measurements using a recently developed CCD imager capable of mapping OH temperature (at ∼ 87 km altitude) were made from Bear Lake Observatory, Utah (41.9 °N, 111.6 °W) and Ft. Collins, Colorado (40.6 °N, 105 °W) within the same time period. The “mean day” lidar data for {{the spring and fall}} periods investigated here each indicate an average amplitude variation of ∼ 2 – 5 K over the depth of the OH layer but distinct phases of < 1 -hr LST and ∼ 7 -hr LST, respectively, for the 8 -hr component. The Temperature Mapper data are in excellent agreement with these findings but in addition have shown that the amplitude of this tidal component can vary by as much as an order of magnitude (1.5 – 15 K) on a night-by-night basis resulting in an apparent 8 -hr dominance of the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>variation</b> during investigated portions of the spring and fall seasons with little or no diurnal and semi-diurnal variability evident.

So far, limb-sounding from space and {{a small number of}} ground-based low-to-medium resolution spectra have been used to measure FeO emission in the MLT. In this study the medium-to-high resolution echelle spectrograph X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in the Chilean Atacama Desert (24 ° 37 ′ S, 70 ° 24 ′ W; 2635  m) is used to study the FeO pseudo-continuum in the range from 0. 5 to 0. 72  µm based on 3662 spectra. Variations of the FeO spectrum itself, as well as the diurnal and seasonal behaviour of the FeO and Na emission intensities, are reported. These airglow emissions are linked by their common origin, meteoric ablation, and they share O 3 as a common reactant. Major differences are found in the main emission peak of the FeO airglow spectrum between 0. 58  and 0. 61  µm, compared with a theoretical spectrum. The FeO and Na airglow intensities exhibit a similar <b>nocturnal</b> <b>variation</b> and a semi-annual seasonal variation with equinoctial maxima.

There is variability in amplitude and phase obtained from SATI observations. In this paper, SATI observations on 10 Dec 2012 and 3 March 2013 are compared with Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) simulations. The amplitude of semidiurnal tides is ~ 25 K/ 30 K on 10 Dec 2012 during solstice for OH/O 2 temperature. During equinox SATI data indicates existence of semidiurnal tide also.

Alertness management strategies can minimize the adverse effects of sleep loss and circadian rhythm desynchronization and promote optimal vigilance in operational settings. Within these strategies, one possibility is to use short periods of “prophylactic sleep” (before long periods of work), which can be facilitated by hypnotics. Vigilance can be evaluated by means of several tests which, sometimes, imply procedures and devices not easily employable in operational settings. In such conditions pencil and paper tests of vigilance can be very useful {{in the assessment of}} attentional performance degradation due to sleep loss and/or inversion of the sleep–wake cycle.

No significant differences in PAH and OPAH profiles were observed at both sites whereas, for NPAHs, 1 -nitropyrene (diesel source) was the most abundant at the traffic site and 2 + 3 -nitrofluoranthene (secondary formed by gas-phase reaction) was predominant at the suburban site. The study of the specific ratio 2 -nitrofluoranthene/ 1 -nitropyrene (2 -NFlt/ 1 -NP) showed a local formation of NPAHs in gaseous phase at the suburban site. A detailed analysis showed that atmospheric humidity and rainfalls modified differently PAH and NPAH profiles, in comparison to OPAH. A difference of the scale variability of water solubility between, light (MW = 273 g mol- 1), could explain these observations. The specific study of the relationships between PACs and other measured pollutants highlighted that particle resuspension could constitute a significant source of PM on the traffic site. Even if NPAH formation seemed clearly evident at the suburban site during periods characterised by high O 3 and NO 2 concentration levels, results showed also that the primary and/or secondary origins of OPAHs and NPAHs were strongly dependent on the sampling site and on sampling conditions. Finally, we conclude that higher time sampling resolutions would be helpful in investigating the atmospheric chemistry and behaviours of PACs in correlation with the local meteorological variations and the daily cycle of human activities...|$|R
40|$|Using 3 years (2013 – 2015) of O 2 (0 – 1) and OH(6 – 2) band {{nightglow}} emission intensities {{and corresponding}} rotational temperatures as tracers of mesospheric dynamics, we have investigated large- and small-timescale {{variations in the}} mesosphere over a low-latitude location, Gurushikhar, Mount Abu (24. 6 ° N, 72. 8 ° E), in India. Both O 2 and OH intensities show variations {{similar to those of}} the number of sunspots and F 10. 7  cm radio flux with coherent periodicities of 150  ±  2. 1, 195  ±  3. 6, 270  ±  6. 4, and 420  ±  14. 8  days, indicating a strong solar influence on mesospheric dynamics. In addition, both mesospheric airglow intensities also showed periodicities of 84  ±  0. 6, 95  ±  0. 9, and 122  ±  1. 3  days which are of atmospheric origin. With regard to the variability of the order of a few days, O 2 and OH intensities were found to be correlated, in general, except when altitude-dependent atmospheric processes were operative. To understand mesospheric gravity wave behavior over the long term, we have carried out a statistical study using the periodicities derived from the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>variations</b> in all four parameters (O 2 and OH intensities and their respective temperatures). It was found that the major wave periodicity of around 2  h duration is present in all the four parameters. Our analyses also reveal that the range of periods in O 2 and OH intensities and temperatures is 11 to 24 and 20 to 60  min, respectively. Periods less than 15  min were not present in the temperatures but were prevalent in both emission intensities. No seasonal dependence was found in either the wave periodicities or the number of their occurrence...|$|R
40|$|The use of high {{resolution}} 3 D urban raster and vector databases in urban climatology is presented. It applies two different methods to {{the calculation of}} continuous sky view factors (SVF), compares their values and considers their usefulness and limitations in urban climate studies. It shows and evaluates the relationship between urban geometry, quantified by SVF, and intra-urban <b>nocturnal</b> temperature <b>variations</b> using areal means in the whole urban area of Szeged, a city located in southeast Hungary. Results from the vector and raster models shows similar SVF values (r(2) = 0. 9827). The usefulness of using areal means in SVFtemperature relations is confirmed. The vector and the raster approaches to the derivation of areal means of SVF are both shown to be powerful tools to obtain a general picture of the geometrical conditions of an urban environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{circadian}} {{clock in}} controlling the metabolism of entire trees has seldom been considered. We tested whether the clock influences nocturnal whole-tree water use. Whole-tree chambers allowed the control of environmental variables (temperature, relative humidity). Night-time stomatal conductance (g s) and sap flow (Q) were monitored in 6 - to 8 -m-tall Eucalyptus globulus trees during nights when environmental variables were kept constant, and also when conditions varied with time. Artificial neural networks were used to quantify {{the relative importance of}} circadian regulation of g s and Q. Under a constant environment, g s and Q declined from 0 to 6  h after dusk, but increased from 6 to 12  h after dusk. While the initial decline could be attributed to multiple processes, the subsequent increase is most consistent with circadian regulation of g s and Q. We conclude that endogenous regulation of g s is an important driver of night-time Q under natural environmental variability. The proportion of <b>nocturnal</b> Q <b>variation</b> associated with circadian regulation (23 - 56 %) was comparable to that attributed to vapor pressure deficit variation (25 - 58 %). This study contributes {{to our understanding of the}} linkages between molecular and cellular processes related to circadian regulation, and whole-tree processes related to ecosystem gas exchange in the field. © 2013 The Authors. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) {{are associated with the}} increases in slow-wave sleep seen in early HIV infection and the decrease with sleep fragmentation seen in advanced HIV infection. Nocturnal sleep disturbances and associated fatigue contribute to the disability of HIV infection. TNF-alpha causes fatigue in clinical use and promotes slow-wave sleep in animal models. With slow progress toward a vaccine and weak effects from current therapies, efforts are directed toward extending productive life of HIV-infected individuals and shortening the duration of disability in terminal illness. We describe previously unrecognized <b>nocturnal</b> cyclic <b>variations</b> in plasma levels of TNF-alpha in all subjects. In 6 of 10 subjects (1 control subject, 3 HIV-seropositive patients with CD 4 + cell number > 400 cells per microliters, and 2 HIV-positive patients with CD 4 + cell number < 400 cells per microliters), these fluctuations in TNF-alpha were coupled to the known rhythm of electroencephalogram delta amplitude (square root of power) during sleep. This coupling was not present in 3 HIV-positive subjects with CD 4 + cell number < 400 cells per microliters and 1 control subject. In 5 HIV subjects with abnormally low CD 4 + cell counts (< 400 cells per microliters), the number of days since seroconversion correlated significantly with low correlation between TNF-alpha and delta amplitude. We conclude that a previously unrecognized normal, physiological coupling exists between TNF-alpha and delta amplitude during sleep and that the lessened likelihood of this coupling in progressive HIV infection may be important in understanding fatigue-related symptoms and disabilities...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} free-ranging Laughing Kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae), the largest kingfishers, are heterothermic. Their minimum {{recorded}} body temperature (Tb) was 28. 6 °C, and the maximum daily Tb range was 9. 1 °C, which makes kookaburras {{only the second}} coraciiform species and {{the only member of}} the Alcedinidae known to be heterothermic. The amplitude of <b>nocturnal</b> body temperature <b>variation</b> for wild, free-living kookaburras during winter was substantially greater than the mean of 2. 6 °C measured previously for captive kookaburras. Calculated metabolic savings from nocturnal heterothermia were up to 5. 6 ± 0. 9 kJ per night. There was little effect of ambient temperature on any of the calculated Tb-dependent variables for the kookaburras, although ambient temperature did influence the time that activity commenced for these diurnal birds. Kookaburras used endogenous metabolic heat production to rewarm from low Tb, rather than relying on passive rewarming. Rewarming rates (0. 05 ± 0. 01 °C min− 1) were consistent with those of other avian species. Captivity can have major effects on thermoregulation for birds, and therefore the importance of field studies of wild, free-living individuals is paramount for understanding the biology of avian temperature regulation...|$|R
40|$|Lack of the {{physiological}} nocturnal fall {{in blood pressure}} (BP) {{has been found in}} diabetics {{and it seems to be}} related to the presence of diabetic complications. The present study examined the changes in the nocturnal BP pattern of 8 normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic adolescents without nephropathy following improvement in glycemic control induced by an 8 -day program of adequate diet and exercise. The same number of age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. During the first and eighth nights of the program, BP was obtained by ambulatory BP monitoring. After a 10 -min rest, 3 BP and heart rate (HR) recordings were taken and the mean values were considered to represent their awake values. The monitor was programmed to cuff insufflation every 20 min from 10 : 00 p. m. to 7 : 00 a. m. The glycemic control of diabetics improved since glycemia (212. 0 ± 91. 5 to 140. 2 ± 69. 1 mg/dl, P< 0. 03), urine glucose (12. 7 ± 11. 8 to 8. 6 ± 6. 4 g/ 24 h, P = 0. 08) and insulin dose (31. 1 ± 7. 7 to 16. 1 ± 9. 7 U/day, P< 0. 01) were reduced on the last day. The mean BP of control subjects markedly decreased during the sleeping hours of night 1 (92. 3 ± 6. 4 to 78. 1 ± 5. 0 mmHg, P< 0. 001) and night 8 (87. 3 ± 6. 7 to 76. 9 ± 3. 6 mmHg, P< 0. 001). Diabetic patients showed a slight decrease in mean BP during the first night. However, the fall in BP during the nocturnal period increased significantly on the eighth night. The average awake-sleep BP variation was significantly higher at the end of the study (4. 2 vs 10. 3 %, P< 0. 05) and this ratio turned out to be similar to that found in the control group (10. 3 vs 16. 3 %). HR variation also increased on the eighth night in the diabetics. Following the metabolic improvement obtained at the end of the period, the <b>nocturnal</b> BP <b>variation</b> of diabetics was close to the normal pattern. We suggest that amelioration of glycemic control may influence the awake-sleep BP and HR differences. This effect may be due at least in part to an attenuated insulin stimulation of sympathetic activit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nocturnal</b> ionospheric height <b>variations</b> were {{analyzed}} along the meridian of 100 &deg; E by using ionosonde data. Two ionosondes were installed near the magnetic conjugate points at low latitudes, {{and the third}} station was situated near the magnetic equator. Ionospheric virtual heights were scaled every 15 min and vertical E&times;B drift velocities were inferred from the equatorial station. By incorporating the inferred equatorial vertical drift velocity, ionospheric bottom heights with the absence of wind were modeled for the two low-latitude conjugate stations, and the deviation in heights from the model outputs was used to infer the transequatorial meridional thermospheric winds. The results obtained for the September and March equinoxes of years 2004 and 2005, respectively, were compared, and {{a significant difference in}} the meridional wind was found. An oscillation with a period of approximately 7 h of the meridional wind existed in both the equinoxes, but its amplitude was larger in September as compared to that in March. When the equatorial height reached the maximum level due to the evening enhancement of the zonal electric field, the transequatorial meridional wind velocity reached approximately 10 and 40 m/s for the March and September equinoxes, respectively. This asymmetry of the ionosphere-thermosphere system was found to be associated with the previously reported equinoctial asymmetry of equatorial ionospheric irregularities; the probability for equatorial irregularities to occur is higher in March as compared to that in September at the Indian to Western Pacific longitudes. Numerical simulations of plasma bubble developments were conducted by incorporating the transequatorial neutral wind effect, and the results showed that the growth time (e-folding time) of the bubble was halved when the wind velocity changed from 10 to 40 m/s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{pathophysiology}} of slow transit con-stipation {{is poorly}} understood. Both decreased and increased distal colonic motility have been reported. In healthy humans, a 3 {{cycles per minute}} (cpm), periodic rectal motor activity (PRMA) has been des-cribed. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} characteristics of PRMA and to assess its role in the pathogenesis of constipation. A six-sensor solid-state probe was placed with the tip sensor in the mid-transverse colon, with-out sedation, and prolonged colonic motility was recorded in nine patients with slow transit constipation (1 M, 8 F) and in 11 healthy subjects (3 M, 8 F). Subjects were free to ambulate. We examined the frequency, <b>nocturnal</b> vs. diurnal <b>variation,</b> and characteristics of PRMA, and its relationship to proximal colonic motility. All subjects showed PRMA. The rhythm was similar (2. 5 – 4 cpm) in both groups. However, consti-pated patients exhibited a greater (P < 0. 001) number of PRMA cycles than controls. The duration of each cycle and amplitude of pressure waves during PRMA were also greater (P < 0. 05) at night in patients com-pared with controls. In patients, 40 % of PRMA cycles were associated with a proximal colonic motor event compared with 81 % in controls (P < 0. 02). The area under the curve of all colonic pressure waves and incidence of specialized propagating pressure waves was lower (P < 0. 05) in patients during daytime. When compared with controls, constipated patients exhib-ited reduced daytime colonic pressure waves and a higher frequency of PRMA. Most of the PRMA was unrelated to proximal colonic activity in constipated patients in contrast with findings in control patients. In addition to decreased colonic motility, this exces-sive and unco-ordinated phasic rectal activity may further impede stool transport and contribute to the pathogenesis of slow transit constipation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the effort}} to {{characterize}} the masses, radii, and atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, there is an urgent need to find examples of such planets transiting nearby M dwarfs. The MEarth Project is an ongoing effort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect exoplanets as small as 2 Earth radii transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in photometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability that is common among these stars and by the <b>nocturnal</b> cadence, atmospheric <b>variations,</b> and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound observatories. Here we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far, and we present a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly and irregularly-spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters of this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters into its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual transits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates and compare our results to the popular Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) method with simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth Project, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing the false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.
