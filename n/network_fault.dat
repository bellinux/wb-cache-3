40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>faults,</b> such as router failures, cable outages, and {{configuration}} errors, could seriously affect network performance. In this paper, we use <b>network</b> <b>faults</b> very loosely, {{including those}} that will yield unfavorable end-to-end network performance, such as packet reordering and suboptimal routes. Diagnosing <b>network</b> <b>faults</b> on end-to-end paths is a very challenging problem, because it generally involves other domains. Even {{if it can be}} done, the process is very time consuming, because multiple sources of data, which are scattered in different places, are needed for such diagnosis. In this paper, we consider the problem of making the fault diagnosis as automatic as possible. Based on coordinated active measurement from a set of end systems, we propose a procedure of detecting <b>network</b> <b>faults</b> and identifying their locations. Although this procedure cannot be fully automated for the time being, we show that some of the components could be automated, and we are automating them in a preliminary system called MonoScope. We demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure through several real-world cases that we have encountered in our four years of network monitoring experience.

50|$|Wheel speed {{data are}} also vital in a {{brake-by-wire}} system to avoid skidding. The {{design of a}} brake-by-wire car should provide safeguards against missing some of the data samples provided by the safety-critical sensors. Popular solutions are to provide redundant sensors and to apply a fail-safe mechanism. In addition to a complete sensor loss, the electronic control unit may also suffer an intermittent (temporary) data loss. For example, sensor data can sometimes fail to reach the electronic control unit. This may happen due to a temporary problem with the sensor itself or with the data transmission path. It may also result from an instantaneous short circuit or disconnection, a communication <b>network</b> <b>fault,</b> or a sudden increase in noise. In such cases, for a safe operation, the system has to be compensated for missing data samples.|$|E

It can do this {{in a number of different}} ways, via the GPRS radio path, via the GSM radio path or via the telephone line/or IP if that has been chosen. These multiple signalling paths are all present and live at the same time backing each other up to minimise exposure of the property to intruders. Should one fail there is always one form of back up and depending on the manufacturer chosen up to three paths working simultaneously at any one time.

50|$|Also, {{legitimate}} mail {{might not}} get delivered if the retry comes from a different IP address than the original attempt. When the source of an email is a server farm or goes out through {{some other kind of}} relay service, it is likely that a server other than the original one will make the next attempt. For <b>network</b> <b>fault</b> tolerance, their IPs can belong to completely unrelated address blocks, thereby defying the simple technique of identifying the most significant part of the address. Since the IP addresses will be different, the recipient's server will fail to recognize that a series of attempts are related, and refuse each of them in turn. This can continue until the message ages out of the queue if the number of servers is large enough. This problem can partially be bypassed by proactively identifying as exceptions such server farms. Likewise, exception have to be configured for multihomed hosts and hosts using DHCP. In the extreme case, a sender could (legitimately) use a different IPv6 address for each outbound SMTP connection. There is however little technical benefit in this design and no significant reason including fault tolerance why systems cannot retry from the same IP address. Indeed, retries almost always come from a very similar IP address to the first attempt in any case.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{multilevel}} converters (HMCs) {{are more}} attractive than the traditional multilevel converters, such as modular converters, because they offer all the features needed in a modern voltage source converter-based dc transmission system with reduced size and weight, at a competitive level of semiconductor losses. Therefore this study investigates the viability of a HMC that uses dc side H-bridge chain links, for high-voltage dc and flexible ac transmission systems. In addition, its operating principle, modulation and capacitor voltage balancing, and control are investigated. This study focuses on response of this HMC to ac and dc <b>network</b> <b>faults,</b> with special attention paid to device issues that may arise under extreme <b>network</b> <b>faults.</b> Therefore the HMC with dc side chain links is simulated as one station of point-to-point dc transmission system that operates in an inversion mode, with all the necessary control systems incorporated.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} fault ride-through (FRT) {{capability}} of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid during both AC and DC <b>network</b> <b>faults.</b> In this investigation, commonly proposed FRT {{strategies for the}} distributed energy resources and AC and DC microgrids are implemented while the interlinking bidirectional converter is operated in power transfer mode. The investigations have shown that improvement in the AC network voltage is minimal during both AC and DC <b>network</b> <b>faults.</b> However, the DC network voltage improves and rapidly recovers after both AC and DC <b>network</b> <b>faults.</b> This is because while the AC network is relatively weak during the fault, the interlinking bi-directional converter tracks the pre-fault power reference following the fault clearance and assists with restoration of the DC bus voltage. However, this response could be detrimental if the hybrid AC/DC microgrid is operated in an islanded mode. Hence {{it is important to}} design a robust fault ride-through support scheme for the interlinking bi-directional converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid...|$|R

They were the Line, Trunk, Network, Service and Control frames. The [...] "80" [...] represented the 1980s decade which was quickly approaching while Wescom was developing its first commercial digital PBX during the 1975 to 1980 time period. The 580L PBX {{was the first of}} the 580 family of products from Wescom.In addition to an Intel 8080 CPU complex, the heart of the 580 was the digital network frame which implemented a 64 kb time-division multiplexing digital network as the basic switching fabric of the 580 DSS. The first product in the family was the 3072 timeslot 580L-PBX which had a set of six Intel 8080 microprocessor pairs, for handling individual tasks in its control complex (State, Database, Console, Register, Trunk and Line micro complexes(CPU, memory, IPBs). Each of these actually consisted of redundant processor cards, and each micro card had dual 8080 chips using hardware matching between two 8080 chips. Faults detected on any of the online micros would automatically switch to its standby copy. Intercommunication between the various micros was loaded into the appropriate software queues and sent via the hardware Interprocessor buffers (IBPs). The 580L, M and S systems also incorporated a standby Network block which could switch seamlessly into operation without dropping existing calls if a <b>Network</b> <b>fault</b> was detected. The network blocks used memory locations to contain voice data. In smaller sized systems the tasks were combined in fewer physical processors. This led to the term [...] "monogeneric" [...] software and hardware for the various sized systems.|$|E

50|$|Post-copy VM {{migration}} is initiated by suspending the VM at the source. With the VM suspended, a minimal {{subset of the}} execution state of the VM (CPU state, registers and, optionally, non-pageable memory) is transferred to the target. The VM is then resumed at the target. Concurrently, the source actively pushes the remaining memory pages of the VM to the target - an activity known as pre-paging. At the target, if the VM tries to access a page {{that has not yet}} been transferred, it generates a page-fault. These <b>faults,</b> known as <b>network</b> <b>faults,</b> are trapped at the target and redirected to the source, which responds with the faulted page. Too many <b>network</b> <b>faults</b> can degrade performance of applications running inside the VM. Hence pre-paging can dynamically adapt the page transmission order to <b>network</b> <b>faults</b> by actively pushing pages {{in the vicinity of the}} last fault. An ideal pre-paging scheme would mask large majority of <b>network</b> <b>faults,</b> although its performance depends upon the memory access pattern of the VM's workload. Post-copy sends each page exactly once over the network. In contrast, pre-copy can transfer the same page multiple times if the page is dirtied repeatedly at the source during migration. On the other hand, pre-copy retains an up-to-date state of the VM at the source during migration, whereas with post-copy, the VM's state is distributed over both source and destination. If the destination fails during migration, pre-copy can recover the VM, whereas post-copy cannot.|$|R
