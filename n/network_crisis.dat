40|$|Various {{terms such}} as {{organizational}} mortality, organizational death, bankruptcy, decline, retrenchment and failure {{have been used in}} the literature to characterize different forms and facets of organizational crisis. Communication network studies have typically focused on nodes (individuals or organizations), relationships between those nodes, and subsequent affects of these relationships upon the network as a whole. Email networks in contemporary organizations are fairly representative of the underlying communications networks. We show that changes in communication networks and its associated group cohesiveness have implications for studying organizational crisis. In this paper, we analyze the changing communication network structure at Enron Corporation during the period of its crisis (2000 - 2001). Our goal was to understand how communication patterns and structure were affected by organizational crisis. Drawing on communication <b>network</b> <b>crisis</b> and group cohesiveness theory, we tested several propositions using the Enron email corpus: (1) Number of cliques increases, and (2) Communication network becomes increasingly transitive as organizations experience crisis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{properties}} of the global banking network using cross-border bank lending data for 184 countries over 1978 - 2009. Specifically, we analyze financial interconnectedness using network metrics of centrality, connectivity, and clustering. We document a relatively unstable global banking network, with structural breaks in network indicators identifying several waves of capital flows. Interconnectedness rankings, especially for borrowers, are relatively volatile over the period. Connectivity tends to fall during and after systemic banking crises and sovereign debt crises. The 2008 - 09 global financial crisis stands out as an unusually large perturbation to the cross-border banking network.

40|$|The {{origins of}} this paper lie in the {{observation}} that organizations, frequently, fail to learn from crisis. Drawing from theory in field as diverse as actor <b>network,</b> <b>crisis</b> management, institutional and organizational learning the paper considers {{the case of the}} crisis triggered by severe flooding in the UK and Gloucestershire in particular. In this case the available artefacts that were developed prior to the crisis (and afterwards) framed and stabilized a particular set of connections. In this event, the data suggest rigidity amidst a relatively inadequate response. The inadequacy of the response was more marked given the award of Beacon Status to Gloucestershire County Council for its emergency preparedness some months before the extreme weather event. The paper suggests that learning in and from experience, prepares us only to replay what we have learned in order to make sense of and enact practice in a similar scenario; that is, to use that experience to make sense of unfolding events. It is only when a breakdown of coping occurs, when things do not go as intended, that we become aware of the inadequacy of our established practices. We should not be surprised when the lessons we have learned fail to prepare us for unforeseen events, or even when, in similar circumstances, but with different technologies or people involved, outcomes during and after crises are disappointing...|$|E

Engagement Theory emphasizes cooperation, creativity and contribution, which can settle <b>network</b> <b>crisis</b> around universities and have enormous advantages in the literary aesthetic education. When we apply the theory, it should be made scientific, effective and humane. Index Terms—Engagement Theory, literature class, education, cooperation Present university students have tremendous difference with traditional university student. They attach importance to utility value and ignore quality. They study for the material gain but not for humanism. A lot of students study hardy in order to take the credit, deal with the examination, obtain degree, and even graduate students seldom think over making any knowledge. As is even more relevant, present university structure of education are more utilitarian. Humane quality course have been generally compressed at the lessons. The contradiction between being expanded content of courses and reducing lessons day by day is very sharp. Meanwhile, many people point out that students need strengthen humane quality urgently in the situation that market economy is highly praised. In humane quality courses of university, literary aesthetical education has a very important role.

40|$|The {{results of}} a study {{comparing}} the structure and function of the social networks {{of a group of}} first-admission schizophrenics with those of a group of mul-tiple-admission schizophrenics are presented. Structurally, the networks of the first-admission patients are larger and more inter-connected. Functionally, their networks have a greater percent-age of multiplex and nondepen-dent links. On the basis of these data, it is concluded that the most dramatic changes in social net-works develop after the patient's first hospitalization. The dissolu-tion of the patient's network is attributed to the antagonistic at-titudes and reactions of those close to the patient, {{as well as to the}} patient's impaired social com-petence. Schizophrenia seemingly is a <b>network</b> <b>crisis</b> not only for the individual but for the network as a whole. It is suggested that active intervention at the time of the first psychotic episode may be helpful in avoiding network collapse and the patient's resultant social iso-lation. Although it is now well established that schizophrenic patients gener-ally have a paucity of social re-lationships, it is still not well un-derstood at what point in the natu-ral history of the disease social ties begin to diminish. This problem is of critical importance on a theoreti-cal as well as a clinical level. A more precise delineation of the network flux experienced by schizophrenics will illuminate the role of sociocultural factors in schizophrenia, as well as provide the clinician with a better under-standing of how and when to intervene to prevent the schizo-phrenic's network from dissolving. Despite numerous clinical and research reports, the role of social isolation in the schizophrenic process has never been clearly elucidated. Social isolation has been viewed from a variety of perspectives: as a possible etiologi-cal factor in schizophrenia, as a predisposing variable, as a prog-nostic indicator, as a residual symptom characteristic of the syndrome, and as a consequence of the illness...|$|E
40|$|The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 / 1998 are {{two events}} that {{share a common}} characteristic. Both {{can be seen as}} a <b>network</b> <b>crisis,</b> though one is global and the other is regional. The world or region is {{currently}} highly inter-connected and inter-dependent through trade, finance and telecommunication networks that transfer information and property rights that shape behaviour across networks. This can be illustrated through behaviour in highly complex and deep financial markets, such as behaviour in currency markets arising from contagion and inter-action between market forces that create unexpected risks. This paper introduces a Phasor method to capture the often ignored long-tailed black swan risk, also known as rare events. Using the augmented network theory (Sheng, Kwek, Cho, 2009), based on principles of engineering and physics, we model the market movements caused by the confluence of different market forces, by transforming the market movements (x,y) into sinusoidal waves (cosθ, sinθ). In particular, when the two forces collide (cosθ = sinθ), they create directions that are not always predictable, though the amplitude of the sine waves and the cosine waves are predictable. To demonstrate this network effect, nine currencies, i. e. the Indonesian Rupiah, Chinese Renminbi, Hong Kong dollar, Korean Won, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippines Peso, Singapore dollar, and Thai Baht are modeled through the Phasor theory in the currency markets. The results of the study do show that we are able to capture these rare events. While not all directional changes are predictable due to lack of contextual information that we may not be able to capture, there are certain patterns of behaviour that conform with tools common in engineering and physics...|$|E

40|$|Social media play in today's {{societies}} {{a fundamental}} {{role for the}} negotiation and dynamics of crises. However, classical crisis communication theories neglect {{the role of the}} medium and focus mainly on the interplay between crisis type and crisis communication strategy. Building on the recently developed " <b>networked</b> <b>crisis</b> communication model" we contrast effects of medium (Facebook vs. Twitter vs. online newspaper) and crisis type (intentional vs. victim) in an online experiment. Using the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster as crisis scenario, we show that medium effects are stronger than the effects of crisis type. Crisis communication via social media resulted in a higher reputation and less secondary crisis reactions such as boycotting the company than crisis communication in the newspaper. However, secondary crisis communication, e. g. talking about the crisis communication, was higher in the newspaper condition than in the social media conditions because people consider traditional media as more credible. We also found higher levels of anger in the intentional crisis condition than in the victim crisis condition. Anger in turn was related to reputation, secondary crisis communication and secondary crisis reaction. The results stress the need for more complex models of crisis communication. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
