50|$|Another major {{determinant}} is {{the soil}} particle size. Clay particles {{are some of}} the smallest particles commonly found in soils. Due to their structure the spaces between individual clay particles is small and already restricts the passage of water, reducing infiltration and hence drainage. Soils with a high clay content are also easily compacted and affected by man-made discharges. Clay particles have a strong <b>negative</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge</b> and will readily bond to positively charged ions dissolved in the soil-water matrix. Common salts such as sodium ions contained in wastewater can fulfil this role and lead to a localized hardpan in some soil types. This is a common cause of septic system failure due to the prevention of proper drainage in field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Turbidity {{consists}} of suspended material in water, causing cloudy appearance. This cloudy appearance iscaused by scattering and absorption of light by these particles. The suspended matter may be inorganic or organic. Generally {{the small size}} of particles prevents rapid settling of the material. Turbidity can provide food and shelter for pathogens. Solids are present in water in three main forms: suspended particles, colloids and dissolved molecules. Suspended particles, such as sand, vegetable matter and silt range in size from very large particles down to particles with a typical dimension of 10 μm. Colloids are very fine particles, typically ranging from 10 nm to 10 μm. Dissolved molecules are present as individual molecules or as ions. Most suspended solids smaller than 0. 1 mm found in water carry <b>negative</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charges.</b> High turbidity will decrease the amount of sunlight able to penetrate the water, thereby decreasing the photosynthetic rate. When the water is cloudy, sunlight will warm it more efficiently. This occurs because the suspended particles in the water absorb the sunlight, warming the surrounding water. This can lead to other problems associated with increased temperature levels. So in present study researcher tries to assess the waste water temperature of naturally made Nala in Gatora, Bilaspur of Chhattisgarh and its effect on turbidity...|$|R

Both RNA- and DNA-enveloped viruses are shown to be susceptible. The proposed mechanism involves the capacity of squalamine, a cationic amphipathic sterol, to neutralize the <b>negative</b> <b>electrostatic</b> surface <b>charge</b> of intracellular membranes in a way that renders the cell less effective in supporting viral replication.

40|$|AbstractAnionic vesicles {{containing}} acidic phospholipids {{are known}} complement activators. To clarify which <b>negative</b> physicochemical <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charges</b> on vesicles and structural specificities of acidic lipids {{are critical to}} complement activation, the electrostatic properties and activity to complement of two anionic vesicles modified with a carboxylic acid derivative or a conventional acidic phospholipid were compared. Electrophoretic mobility measurements indicated that the negative zeta potential and the electrostatic interactivity of these two anionic vesicles were equal at pH 7. 4. However, the infusion of vesicles containing acidic phospholipid induced significant complement activation, while vesicles containing the carboxylic acid derivative failed to activate complement. These {{results indicate that the}} negative charge on the surface of vesicles is not critical for the activation complement, suggesting that complement activation is specific to the structure of acidic groups.

In this study, the effects of different direct electric currents on the cell surface properties involved in bacterial adhesion were investigated by using a mixed phenol-degrading bacterial culture in the exponential growth phase. The traits investigated were surface hydrophobicity (measured by adherence to n-octane), net surface <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge</b> (determined by measurement of the zeta potential), and the cell surface shape and polymers (determined by scanning electron microscope analysis). The results showed that a lower current (less than 20 mA) induced no significant changes in the surface properties of phenol-degrading bacteria, that an electric current of 20 mA could increase the surface hydrophobicity and flatten the cell shape, and that a higher current (40 mA) could increase the surface extracellular substances and the net <b>negative</b> surface <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge.</b> The results also revealed that the electric current effects on cell hydrophobicity varied with the suspending medium. We suggest that an electric current greater than 20 mA is not suitable for use in manipulation of the movement of the phenol-degrading bacteria, although such a current might favor the electrophoretic movement of the bacterial species.

40|$|Hot surface oxidations are {{commonly}} thought to involve initial free radical hydrogen atom abstraction. Our evidence implicates initial Lewis base deprotonation by O•- atomic oxygen radical anions to form negatively charged carbanions. Subsequent rate determining electron transfers generate free radicals which only then {{give rise to}} combustion. Correlations regarding ignition temperatures and hydrocarbon oxidation product identity are consistent with carbanionic but not free radical effects. Highly polarized surfaces (e. g., quartz and corroded surfaces), and addition of polar compounds to fuel/air mixtures facilitate ignitions.

40|$|The Le Chatelier–Anstett {{test was}} used to study the sulfate {{resistance}} of cement pastes containing calcined paper sludge waste (MC). MC was blended with two types of portland cement (PC) : P 1 with and P 2 without C 3 A (ordinary portland cement, OPC, and sulfate-resistant portland cement, SRPC, respectively). The study of thaumasite formation required the utilization of a third PC, P 3. The results showed that sulfate resistance always decreased at higher ratios of PC replacement by MC. This behavior was attributable to the expansive synergic effect (ESE), originated by the coprecipitation of ettringite from two resources in a gypsum and water medium. Part of the ettringite formed rapidly from the Al 2 O r− 3 in MC, and rapidly or slowly from the C 3 A in P 1, depending on whether its early pozzolanic activity was sufficient or not. Rapid-forming ettringite of both origins was induced by the sufficient specific, fast, and early pozzolanic activity resulting in the indirect stimulation of sulfate-mediated P 1 hydration (its C 3 A content especially) by the metakaolin present in the MC. Where such activity was insufficient, however, slow-forming ettringite was generated, reducing the ESE. The substantial calcite content in MC also played a very significant role in ESE, the result of the stimulation of such hydration, concomitant sulfate attack, and thaumasite formation. Stimulation was both direct (due to initial particle moistening by the mixing water) and nondirect (due, at the very outset, to the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge</b> acquired by their particles during grinding and/or mixing, and subsequently, to the zeta potential originated as PC hydration progressed).

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to develop an electrostatic power generator for future lunar missions that facilitate the utilization of lunar resources. The lunar surface {{is known to be}} negatively charged from the constant bombardment of electrons and protons from the solar wind. The resulting <b>negative</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge</b> on the dust particles, in the lunar vacuum, causes them to repel each other minimizing the potential. The result is a layer of suspended dust about one meter above the lunar surface. This phenomenon was observed by both Clementine and Surveyor spacecrafts. During the Apollo 17 lunar landing, the charged dust was a major hindrance, as it was attracted to the astronauts' spacesuits, equipment, and the lunar buggies. The dust accumulated on the spacesuits caused reduced visibility for the astronauts, and was unavoidably transported inside the spacecraft where it caused breathing irritation [1]. In the lunar vacuum, the maximum charge on the particles can be extremely high. An article in the journal "Nature", titled "Moon too static for astronauts?" (Feb 2, 2007) estimates that the lunar surface is charged with up to several thousand volts [2]. The electrostatic power generator was devised to alleviate the hazardous effects of negatively charged lunar soil by neutralizing the charged particles through capacitive coupling and thereby simultaneously harnessing power through electric charging [3]. The amount of power generated or collected is dependent on the areal coverage of the device and hovering speed over the lunar soil surface. A thin-film array of capacitors can be continuously charged and sequentially discharged using a time-differentiated trigger discharge process to produce a pulse train of discharge for DC mode output. By controlling the pulse interval, the DC mode power can be modulated for powering devices and equipment. In conjunction with a power storage system, the electrostatic power generator can be a power source for a lunar rover or other systems. The negatively charged lunar soil would also be neutralized mitigating some of the adverse effects resulting from lunar dust...|$|E

The activity of PhK increases dramatically as the pH is raised from 6. 8 to 8. 2 (denoted as ↑pH), but Ca 2 + dependence is retained. Little {{is known about}} the structural changes associated with PhK's activation by ↑pH and Ca 2 +, but activation by both mechanisms is mediated through regulatory subunits of the (αβγδ) 4 PhK complex. In this study, changes in the structure of PhK induced by ↑pH and Ca 2 + were investigated using second derivative UV absorption, synchronous fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and zeta potential analyses. The joint effects of Ca 2 + and ↑pH on the physicochemical properties of PhK were found to be interdependent, with their effects showing a strong inflection point at pH ∼ 7. 6. Comparing the properties of the conformers of PhK present under the condition where it would be least active (pH 6. 8 − Ca 2 +) versus that where it would be most active (pH 8. 2 + Ca 2 +), the joint activation by ↑pH and Ca 2 + is characterized by a relatively large increase in the content of sheet structure, a decrease in interactions between helix and sheet structures, and a dramatically less <b>negative</b> <b>electrostatic</b> surface <b>charge.</b> A model is presented that accounts for the interdependent activating effects of ↑pH and Ca 2 + in terms of the overall physicochemical properties of the four PhK conformers described herein, and published data corroborating the transitions between these conformers are tabulated...|$|R

Several laboratory studies found a clear <b>negative</b> influence of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>charge</b> (ESC) on plastic spacers on the delivery of aerosol.  AIMS—To investigate whether ESC on plastic spacers could diminish bronchodilating responses to salbutamol.  METHODS—Ninety asthmatic children (aged 4 - 8 years) were randomised into three groups: metal Nebuchamber, plastic Volumatic, and plastic Aerochamber. The bronchodilating response was measured by the change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) after 100 µg and 400 µg salbutamol. Within the Volumatic and Aerochamber groups, a crossover comparison was made between electrostatic and non-electrostatic spacers.  RESULTS—We found no significant effect of ESC on the bronchodilating response to salbutamol with any of the doses in the Aerochamber and Volumatic groups. For the plastic spacers, the mean difference of the change in PEF after 100 µg salbutamol between non-electrostatic and electrostatic spacers was only + 1. 7 % (95 % CI − 1. 3 % to 4. 7 %). After 400 µg salbutamol this was + 1. 9 % (95 % CI − 1. 4 % to 5. 1 %). A comparable efficacy was found for the Nebuchamber, the Aerochamber, and Volumatic with respect to the change in PEF after 100 and 400 µg salbutamol.  CONCLUSION—This study showed no negative influence of ESC on plastic spacers with regard to clinical efficacy of a β 2 agonist (salbutamol) in children with asthma.
