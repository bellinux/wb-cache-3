5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of most electronic semiconductor devices {{suffers from the}} self-generated heat. In the case of photovoltaic or thermos-photovoltaic cells, their exposure to sun or high temperature sources make them get warm beyond the desired operating conditions. In both incidences, the solution strategy requires effective radiative cooling process, i. e., by selective absorption and emission in predetermined spectral windows. In this study, we outline two approaches for alternative 2 D thin film coatings, which can enhance the passive thermal management for application to electronic equipment. Most traditional techniques use a metallic (silver) layer because of their high reflectivity, although they display strong absorption in the visible and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrums.</b> We show that strong absorption in the visible and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrums</b> due to a metallic layer can be avoided by repetitive high index-low index periodic layers and broadband reflection in visible and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrums</b> can still be achieved. These modifications increase the average reflectance in the visible and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrums</b> by 3 – 4 %, which increases the cooling power by at least 35 W/m 2. We also show that the performance of radiative cooling can be enhanced by inserting an Al 2 O 3 film (which has strong absorption in the 8 – 13 µm spectrum, and does not absorb in the visible and near-infrared) within conventional coating structures. These two approaches enhance the cooling power of passive radiative cooling systems from the typical reported values of 40 W/m 2 – 100 W/m 2 and 65 W/m 2 levels respectively...|$|R

500|$|Ionian lava lakes are {{depressions}} partially {{filled with}} molten lava {{covered by a}} thin solidified crust. These lava lakes are directly connected to a magma reservoir lying below. Observations of thermal emission at several Ionian lava lakes reveal glowing molten rock along the patera margin, caused by the lake's crust breaking up {{along the edge of}} the patera. [...] Over time, because the solidified lava is denser than the still-molten magma below, this crust can founder, triggering an increase in thermal emission at the volcano. For some lava lakes, like the one at Pele, this occurs continuously, making Pele one of the brightest emitters of heat in the <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> on Io. At other sites, such as at Loki Patera, this can occur episodically. During an overturning episode at these more quiescent lava lakes, a wave of foundering crust spreads out across the patera at the rate of about [...] per day, with new crust forming behind it until the entire lake has been resurfaced. Another eruption would only begin once the new crust has cooled and thickened enough for it to no longer be buoyant over the molten lava. During an overturning episode, Loki can emit up to ten times more heat than when its crust is stable.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} to synthesise telluric absorption and emission features both for in-situ wavelength calibration and for their removal from astronomical spectra. While the presented technique is applicable {{for a wide variety}} of optical and infrared spectra, we concentrate in this paper on selected high-resolution <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph to demonstrate its performance and limitation. We find that synthetic spectra reproduce telluric absorption features to about 2 %, even close to saturated line cores. Thus, synthetic telluric spectra could be used to replace the observation of telluric standard stars, saving valuable observing time. This technique also provides a precise in-situ wavelength calibration, especially useful for high-resolution <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> in the absence of other calibration sources.

2500|$|In 1995, {{the study}} of brown dwarfs changed {{substantially}} {{with the discovery of}} two indisputable substellar objects (Teide 1 and Gliese 229B), which were identified by the presence of the 670.8nm lithium line.

Its <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrum</b> clearly exhibited a methane absorption band at 2 micrometres, a feature that had previously only been observed in the atmospheres of giant planets and that of Saturn's moon Titan.

2500|$|Jupiter's intense {{radiation}} belts {{near the}} orbit of Io forced Galileo to come no closer than {{the orbit of}} Europa {{until the end of}} the first extended mission in 1999. Despite the lack of close-up imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries at Io were made during Galileos two-year, primary mission. During the first several orbits, Galileo mapped Io in search of surface changes that occurred since the Voyager encounters 17 years earlier. This included the appearance of a new lava flow, Zamama, and the shifting of the Prometheus plume by [...] to the west, tracking the end of a new lava flow at Prometheus. Starting with Galileos first orbit, the spacecraft's camera, the Solid-State Imager (SSI), began taking one or two images per orbit of Io while the moon was in Jupiter's shadow. This allowed Galileo to monitor high-temperature volcanic activity on Io by observing thermal emission sources across its surface. The same eclipse images also allowed Galileo scientists to observe aurorae created by the interaction between Io's atmosphere and volcanic plumes with the Io flux tube and the plasma torus. During Galileos ninth orbit, the spacecraft observed a major eruption at Pillan Patera, detecting high-temperature thermal emission and a new volcanic plume. The temperatures observed at Pillan and other volcanoes confirmed that volcanic eruptions on Io consist of silicate lavas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions, with volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide serving a similar role to water and carbon dioxide on Earth. During the following orbit, Galileo found that Pillan was surrounded by a new, dark pyroclastic deposit composed of silicate minerals such as orthopyroxene. The Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observed Io on a number occasions during the primary mission, mapping its volcanic thermal emission and the distribution of sulfur dioxide frost, the absorption bands of which dominate Io's <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of the CO_ 2 absorption band at 4. 2 μm in brown dwarf spectra by AKARI {{has made it}} possible to discuss CO_ 2 molecular abundance in brown dwarf atmospheres. In our previous studies, we found an excess in the 4. 2 μm CO_ 2 absorption band of three brown dwarf spectra, and suggested that these deviations were caused by high C and O elemental abundances in their atmospheres. To validate this hypothesis we construct a set of models of brown dwarf atmospheres with various elemental abundance patterns, and investigate the variations of the molecular composition, thermal structure and their effects to the <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectra</b> between 1. 0 and 5. 0 μm. The 4. 2 μm CO_ 2 absorption band in some late-L and T dwarfs taken by AKARI are stronger or weaker than predictions by corresponding models with solar abundance. By comparing CO_ 2 band in the model spectra to the observed <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectra,</b> we confirm possible elemental abundance variations among brown dwarfs. We find that the band strength is especially sensitive to O abundance, but C is also needed to reproduce the entire <b>near-infrared</b> <b>spectra.</b> This result indicates that both C and O abundances should increase and decrease simultaneously for brown dwarfs. We find that a weaker CO_ 2 absorption band in a spectrum can also be explained by a model with lower C and O abundances.
