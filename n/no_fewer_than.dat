40|$|Two cross-modal priming {{experiments}} investigated whether speech segmentation {{is based}} on the occurrence of strong syllables (A. Cutler & D. Norris, 1988) or lexical competition (J. L. McClelland & J. L. Elman, 1986). Auditorily presented words with <b>no,</b> <b>few,</b> or many competitors served as prime for a visual target. Facilitatory effects were larger for primes with <b>no</b> or <b>few</b> competitors <b>than</b> for primes withmany competitors. This difference disappeared when the interstimulus interval between the prime and target was shortened. The differential priming effects are interpreted as evidence for inhibition between competing lexical candidates. © 1995 American Psychological Association.

5|$|The exact {{cause for}} the {{extinction}} of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals.

Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed <b>no</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month.

He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story.
