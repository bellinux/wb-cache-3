5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} thyroid hormone levels within <b>normal</b> <b>limits.</b> Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid hormone production.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their <b>normal</b> <b>limits</b> in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the upper <b>normal</b> <b>limit</b> of serum alanine aminotransferase level in a population-based study in Golestan Province, northeast Iran. Methods: From the randomly invited individuals (2, 292), 698 out of the 916 males and 1, 351 out of the 1, 376 females participated in the study (participation rate: 76. 2 % and 98. 1 %, respectively). One hundred and twenty-one participants were excluded due to positive hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C virus antibody and/or drinking more than 20 grams of alcohol per day. A total of 1, 928 participants (1300 females) were included. The upper <b>normal</b> <b>limit</b> of serum alanine aminotransferase level was defined as the 95 th percentile. Results: The upper <b>normal</b> <b>limit</b> of serum alanine aminotransferase level in normal weight and nondiabetics was significantly lower than the total study group (36 versus 45 U/L). Serum alanine aminotransferase level was independently associated with male gender, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus (OR= 2. 05; 95 %CI: 1. 44 – 2. 94, OR= 2. 76; 95 %CI: 1. 84 – 4. 13, and OR= 2. 96; 95 %CI: 1. 56 – 5. 61, respectively). Conclusion: Considering the lower calculated upper <b>normal</b> <b>limit</b> in <b>normal</b> weight nondiabetic participants in this study, we recommend setting new upper <b>normal</b> <b>limit</b> for serum alanine aminotransferase level. It seems reasonable to set upper <b>normal</b> <b>limit</b> for serum alanine aminotransferase level in males and females separately...|$|R

25|$|Aurobindo {{asserted}} that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, {{and freedom from}} <b>normal</b> <b>limits</b> are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its <b>normal</b> <b>limits,</b> causing knocking and distortion.|$|E
500|$|The prefix hyper- is {{sometimes}} added to describe movement beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>limits,</b> {{such as in}} hypermobility, hyperflexion or hyperextension. The range of motion describes the total range of motion that a joint is able to do. [...] For example, if {{a part of the}} body such as a joint is overstretched or [...] "bent backwards" [...] because of exaggerated extension motion, then it can be described as hyperextended. Hyperextension increases the stress on the ligaments of a joint, and is not always because of a voluntary movement. It may be a result of accidents, falls, or other causes of trauma. It may also be used in surgery, such as in temporarily dislocating joints for surgical procedures.|$|E

Witnesses to the incident said the two men both made threats, with Waterman producing a gun and pointing it at Sinatra. Sinatra walked out of the casino and returned to his Palm Springs home without fulfilling the rest of his three-week engagement there. Waterman was booked on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, but was released without bail.
