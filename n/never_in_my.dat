25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. <b>Never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{entire life}} have I listened {{to such a}} magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, {{with a piece of}} atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|E
25|$|Wagner {{wrote of}} his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan {{in a letter}} to Franz Liszt (December 16, 1854): <b>Never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life having enjoyed the true {{happiness}} of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the ‘black flag’ that waves at the end I shall cover myself over – to die.|$|E
25|$|Murray became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 26 September 1915. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. After the war he wrote to Ian Hamilton, criticising Kitchener in harsh terms, writing that “He seldom told the absolute the truth and the whole truth” {{and that it was}} not until Kitchener left for his inspection of the Dardanelles that Murray was able to inform the Cabinet that volunteering had fallen far below the level needed to maintain a BEF of 70 divisions, requiring the introduction of conscription. The Cabinet insisted on proper General Staff papers being presented in Kitchener's absence. Murray wrote that “I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> forty years’ service done better work than I did during the three months I was CIGS”. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey praised Murray highly as a real “St John the Baptist” to Sir William Robertson, his successor as CIGS.|$|E

500|$|Goldman {{initially}} {{viewed the}} Bolshevik revolution {{in a positive}} light. She wrote in Mother Earth that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented [...] "the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being". By the time she neared Europe, however, she expressed fears about what was to come. She {{was worried about the}} ongoing Russian Civil War and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. [...] "I could <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life work {{within the confines of the}} State," [...] she wrote to her niece, [...] "Bolshevist or otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Though tiki bars {{in general}} {{declined}} in {{popularity in the}} late 1970s and 1980s until {{the revival of the}} style in the 1990s, the Sip 'n Dip survived with few changes. [...] During the 1990s, the idea of having mermaids swim in the pool during evening bar hours was the brainchild of the bar's general manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother, who wanted to add a [...] "fun factor." [...] It began with a single [...] "mermaid" [...] in the pool on New Year's Eve in 1995. [...] Today, [...] Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes herself and said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life believed the mermaid attraction would be such a big hit. People are fascinated with them, and it's not something you'd expect to see in Montana." ...|$|E
500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I <b>never,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E
6000|$|And {{yet most}} men, she knew, {{would have thought}} to {{themselves}} at once, [...] "What a fool I was to come on beyond my proper station, and let myself in for this beastly scrape, just because I'd go a few miles further with a pretty girl I <b>never</b> saw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life before, and will probably <b>never</b> see <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life again, if I once get well out of this precious predicament." ...|$|R

500|$|Haynes {{confirmed}} deliverables {{were completed}} on December 15, 2014. Carrie Brownstein {{stated that the}} first cut was extensive and most of her scenes were left out. [...] In November 2015, Sarah Paulson said that a key scene between Abby and Therese {{as well as some}} of the conversation in a scene with Carol was cut from the film. In January 2016, Rooney Mara revealed that an intimate scene between Therese and Richard was also deleted. Editor Affonso Gonçalves stated that the initial cut was two and a half hours and the final cut ended at 118 minutes. Todd Haynes explained in an October 2015 interview: [...] "We cut a lot of scenes; it was too long, and they were all well-performed and nicely shot—we <b>never,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, cut things because they were poorly executed. It was just a paring-down process, which all movies do." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 1915, nine men {{in teams}} of three began {{the task of}} hauling {{approximately}} [...] of stores from the Cape Evans base on to the Barrier—the scientist Alexander Stevens remained at base camp, alone. This operation was the first stage {{in the process of}} laying down depots at intervals of one-degree latitude (60 nautical miles/110km/69 statute miles), down to Mount Hope [...] {{at the foot of the}} Beardmore Glacier. A large forward base was then established at the Bluff depot, just north of 79°, from which the final journeys to Mount Hope would be launched early in 1916. During these early stages, Mackintosh clashed repeatedly with Joyce over methods. In a showdown on 28 November, confronted with incontrovertible evidence of the greater effectiveness of Joyce's methods over his own, Mackintosh was forced to back down and accept a revised plan drafted by Joyce and Richards. Joyce's private comment was [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> experience came across such an idiot in charge of men." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E

500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1937, Marie fell ill. Her {{personal}} physician, Dr. Castellani, determined she had pancreatic cancer, although her official diagnosis was cirrhosis of the liver. Marie {{had not been a}} drinker and, upon hearing the news, she reportedly said: [...] "then there must be a non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, because I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life tasted alcohol." [...] She was prescribed a diet of cold foods, injections and bed rest. Marie was so weak at times that she could not even pick up a pen. In February 1938, she was sent to a sanatorium in Italy, in hopes that she might recover. There, she was visited by Nicholas and his wife, whom Marie eventually forgave for her transgressions. She was also visited by Princess Helen, whom she had not seen in nearly seven years, and Waldorf Astor. Marie was eventually transferred to a sanatorium in Dresden. Growing weaker and weaker, she requested that she be taken back to Romania, in order to die there. Carol denied her a journey by aeroplane, and she declined a medical flight offered by Hitler, instead choosing to return to Romania by train. She was brought to Pelișor Castle.|$|E

2500|$|Former Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari accused Čech, Michael Ballack and Drogba {{of causing}} his sacking, {{saying that they}} [...] "did not accept my {{training}} methods or my demands". Scolari also claimed that it stemmed from a row {{between him and the}} Czech goalkeeper over the latter's alleged insistence on being given a personal coach. Čech denied the claims saying that he was [...] "disappointed with [...] because <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life have I had a personal goalkeeping coach".|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life played a game of cards. I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{selected}} {{design was}} very controversial, in particular its unconventional design, its black color and {{its lack of}} ornamentation. Some public officials voiced their displeasure, calling the wall [...] "a black gash of shame." [...] Two prominent early supporters of the project, H. Ross Perot and James Webb, withdrew their support once they saw the design. Said Webb, “I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wildest dreams imagined such a nihilistic slab of stone.” [...] James Watt, Secretary of the Interior under President Ronald Reagan, initially refused to issue a building permit for the memorial due to the public outcry about the design.|$|E

2500|$|The Jay Pritzker Pavilion {{received}} the first permanent outdoor LARES {{system in the}} US in 2004. The very visible system is held above the audience of 11,000 on a slender network of curved steel tubes called a [...] "trellis" [...] by architect Frank Gehry. LARES loudspeakers are positioned adjacent to the normal distributed sound system loudspeakers, to bring appropriately delayed reinforcement sound as well as synthesized ambience to each listener. Steve Robinson of classical radio station WFMT said [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life heard sound projected so faithfully and beautifully over such a great distance... It was an ethereal experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 December 2010, Lidström {{recorded}} his first career hat-trick, at 40 years of age, against the St. Louis Blues, sealing a 5–2 Detroit victory. After the game, {{he was asked}} {{how it feels to}} score his first hat-trick, responding, [...] "It feels great, I've <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life been able to notch three goals in a game." [...] The hat-trick made him the oldest player in NHL history to record his first hat-trick (previously held by Scott Mellanby at 36 years of age), and the oldest defenceman in NHL history to record a hat-trick (previously held by Mathieu Schneider at 37 years of age).|$|E
2500|$|... “I <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life blamed slavery on 'black Africans … {{abetted by}} dark-skinned Arabs',” said Horowitz. “What idiot {{would not know}} that white Europeans {{conducted}} the Atlantic Slave Trade, which trafficked in 11 million black African chattel? The sentence Berlet mangles is not a historical statement about slavery but a polemical response to the proponents of reparations who are demanding that only whites pay blacks for an institution—slavery—that has been eradicated {{in the western world}} (but not Arab and black Africa) for more than 100 years. It is intended to remind people that the slaves transported to America were bought from African and Arab slavers—not to blame Africans and Arabs for sole responsibility for slavery.” ...|$|E
