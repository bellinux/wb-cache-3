5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E

Prior to being cast in the role, Robinson knew little of the Star Trek franchise and had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> episode of any of the television series.|$|E

According to Ball, Morton claimed he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> episode of I Love Lucy due to his hectic work schedule. Ball immediately installed Morton in her production company, teaching him the television business and eventually promoting him to producer.

He believes the events in a writer's life have only a vague relationship to the fiction, like a dream from which a drama emerges. Of Hemingway's earliest stories, Benson claims [...] "his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare". In his essay [...] "On Writing", Hemingway wrote that [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was a story in which imaginary events were made to seem real: [...] "Everything good he'd ever written he'd made up....

[...] Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named [...] "We got everybody but Scotty" [...] and so Scotty was replaced with [...] "Welshie". William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy recorded their lines together, which was unusual as actors usually record solo. Following his work on Futurama, Goodman went on to join the writing staff on Star Trek: Enterprise.|$|E

In 1993, Nancy Reichardt of The Los Angeles Times stated: [...] "Victor Newman is one of those characters.

His portrayal proved so dynamic that this [...] "minor" [...] plot point has been ignored over the years. Today, Braeden is one of the show's leading men. The character has never lost his edge, but his knife-wielding days are long forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1880, Lowell was {{informed}} of his appointment as Minister to England, his nomination made without his knowledge {{as far back}} as June 1879. He was granted a salary of $17,500 with about $3,500 for expenses. While serving in this capacity, he addressed an importation of allegedly diseased cattle and made recommendations that predated the Pure Food and Drug Act. Queen Victoria commented that she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> ambassador who [...] "created so much interest and won so much regard as Mr. Lowell". Lowell held this role until the close of Chester A. Arthur's presidency in the spring of 1885, despite his wife's failing health. Lowell was already well known in England for his writing and, during his time there, befriended fellow author Henry James, who referred to him as [...] "conspicuously American". Lowell also befriended Leslie Stephen many years earlier and became the godfather to his daughter, future writer Virginia Woolf. Lowell was popular enough that he was offered a professorship at Oxford after his recall by President Grover Cleveland, though the offer was declined.|$|E

500|$|Males find females by {{following}} their scent trails, sometimes tracking them {{for hundreds of}} meters a day. If a female is found and flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel [...] "flowing" [...] behavior, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together {{for one or two}} days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behavior before culminating in the dramatic [...] "adder dance." [...] In this act, the males confront each other, raise up the front part of the body vertically, make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Interestingly, Appleby (1971) notes that he has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate. There are no records of any biting taking place during these bouts.|$|E
500|$|Karen Moore, a Paramount executive, {{suggested}} to Bennett that Nicholas Meyer, writer of The Seven-Per-Cent Solution {{and director of}} Time After Time, could help resolve the screenplay issues. Meyer had also <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> episode of Star Trek. He had {{the idea of making}} a list consisting of everything that the creative team had liked from the preceding drafts"it could be a character, it could be a scene, it could be a plot, it could be a subplot, [...] it could be a line of dialogue"so that he could use that list as the basis of a new screenplay made from all the best aspects of the previous ones. To offset fan expectation that Spock would die, Meyer had the character [...] "killed" [...] in the Kobayashi Maru simulator in the opening scene. The effects company required a completed script in just 12 days. Meyer wrote the screenplay uncredited and for no pay before the deadline, surprising the actors and producers, and rapidly produced subsequent rewrites as necessary. One draft, for example, had a baby in Khan's group, who is killed with the others in the Genesis detonation. Meyer later said: ...|$|E
500|$|Connor, {{despite being}} {{the son of}} two [...] "vampires," [...] {{is meant to be}} [...] "human" [...] with {{otherwise}} super powers. Due to this, he wasn’t given the vampire makeup of the series. Kartheiser expresses his simultaneous joy and dismay at this, considering makeup an added benefit for the character and agreeing that the lack of it saved him much time. Connor was initially clad in clothes made of animal skin, and his attire was said to resemble 'Peter Pan' and 'Robin Hood'. He was also wearing, as a trophy, a necklace made of parts of demons he killed in hell. After he settles in this world, he drops the necklace and is given a more casual set of clothes: jeans, T-shirts, and jackets. The concept behind Connor’s wardrobe was that, unconcerned with this world’s fashion sense, he [...] "just took whatever was available." [...] Yet, one interviewer notices his clothing to be [...] "conservative [...] for somebody who's <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> advert". Connor's hairstyle at the start was short and choppy as if cut with a knife. Afterward he's given a modern and cleaner look with longer, styled hair. Kartheiser was critical of the new hair style calling it 'David Cassidy hair-do' and feeling it was a 'little bit heavy'.|$|E

[...] was perfection. Perfection!" [...] Christopher Hahn, General Director of the Pittsburgh Opera, observed: [...] "It's very unusual for a young child to have a voice that sounded so rich and developed." [...] "I thought she was just lovely, sweetly compelling". Hahn particularly praised Evancho's phrasing. Composer Tim Janis commented that Evancho [...] "takes a classical piece and makes it friendly and accessible. ... Her voice is so pure and natural, there's no flaw in it. People say 'I can hear her potential coming,' but no, it's here, it's now." [...] Claudia Benack, Assistant Professor of musical theatre at Carnegie Mellon University, said that Evancho [...] "has an unusually adult feel for the repertoire. ... She sings to the important part of the phrase, and then backs off. That's instinctual. ... She takes breaths sometimes where an adult would not, but that's just because she's young and little. ... She sings from the healthy part of her voice." [...] Jia Tolentino of The New Yorker later called Evancho's YouTube audition for AGT [...] "supernaturally blissful", and commented that she delivered [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] with [...] "graceful phrasing, a controlled, slow vibrato, and a tone that resonates impersonally, like a bell." [...] Critic Tim Page, however, wrote that Evancho [...] "has many years of work ahead of her before she becomes any sort of musician." [...] Doctor Clark Rosen, director of the University of Pittsburgh Voice Center, noted that Evancho's talent is made possible by how her brain coordinates her body for singing.|$|E
500|$|... "Millennium" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the entry [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "visually captivating", particularly praising the installment's [...] "use {{of light and}} dark symbolism". Ultimately, he noted that [...] "it's good to once again see Mulder and Scully temporarily set free from the show's overarching conspiracy." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "there were a lot of big, big things going on in this ep , starting with Millenniums ace profiler Frank Black [...] reluctantly helping Mulder and Scully solve the apparent suicides of four FBI agents." [...] Rosell ultimately concluded that the reason the episode was a success was due to Mulder and Scully's kiss, a moment he called [...] "inevitable" [...] although he did note that [...] "many think [...] really signaled the beginning of the end." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review and called it [...] "highly entertaining" [...] and [...] "cause for celebration". He noted that, while he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> episode of Millennium, the series mythology and story-arcs [...] "integrated seamlessly into this episode" [...] in a way that non-Millennium fans could still enjoy it. John Drake of Xposé considered the episode [...] "excellent" [...] and rated it 5 stars out of 5. Drake commended Lance Henriksen's performance, saying that [...] "not only provides continuity with Millennium, but adds a new dimension as Frank tries to leave the wreckage of his professional life behind". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". He called the entry [...] "tired" [...] and wrote that it was [...] "both too ambitious and not epic enough" [...] to bring closure to Millennium. Furthermore, he felt that the story's basic plot was too confusing and almost laughable. Despite this, he enjoyed Johnson's role as the villain, calling him [...] "interesting", and he wrote that the scene with Mulder and Black in the cellar was [...] "kind of cool" [...] because of the [...] "creepy zombie sequences".|$|E
