5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four <b>notebooks</b> of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these <b>notebooks</b> and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
50|$|A <b>notebook</b> {{interface}} (also {{called a}} computational <b>notebook</b> or data science <b>notebook)</b> {{is a virtual}} <b>notebook</b> environment used for literate programming. It pairs the functionality of word processing software with both the shell and kernel of that <b>notebook's</b> programming language. Examples of the <b>notebook</b> interface include the Mathematica <b>notebook,</b> Maple worksheet, MATLAB <b>notebook,</b> IPython/Jupyter, R Markdown, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Spark <b>Notebook,</b> and the Databricks cloud.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of using a <b>notebook</b> stand on the physical load when working with a <b>notebook</b> in a home environment. Sixteen subjects evaluated working with a <b>notebook</b> by performing three different tasks using two <b>notebook</b> stands and without using a <b>notebook</b> stand. Body posture, productivity, perceived fatigue and comfort / discomfort and personal preference were measured. The authors found that subjects have significantly less neck flexion when using a <b>notebook</b> stand compared to using only a <b>notebook.</b> They also rated significantly less subjective fatigue in the neck when using a <b>notebook</b> stand. From this study, it can be concluded that the neck posture is objectively more neutral and subjectively less fatiguing. www. humanfactors. n...|$|R

5|$|After Shanina's death, the diary, {{consisting}} of three thick <b>notebooks,</b> was {{kept by the}} war correspondent Pyotr Molchanov for twenty years in Kiev. An abridged version {{was published in the}} magazine Yunost in 1965, and the diary was transferred to the Regional Museum of Arkhangelsk Oblast. Several of Shanina's letters and some data from her sniper log have also been published.|$|E
5|$|Galileo also {{observed}} the planet Neptune in 1612. It appears in his <b>notebooks</b> {{as one of}} many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise {{that it was a}} planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Marta Sebregondi read The Songlines and {{proposed}} to her employer, Modo & Modo, an Italian design and publishing company, that they produce moleskine <b>notebooks.</b> In 1997, {{the company began}} to sell these books and used Chatwin's name to promote them. Modo & Modo was sold in 2006, and the company became known as Moleskine SpA.|$|E
40|$|A <b>notebook</b> {{integrates}} most of {{the typical}} components of a desktop computer, including a display, a keyboard, a pointing device (a touchpad, {{also known as a}} track pad, and/or a pointing stick) and speakers into a single unit. A <b>notebook</b> can be used away from an outlet using a chargeable battery. Usually, <b>notebook</b> is powered by AC supply from single phase 240 V. When the <b>notebook</b> is depending on the AC supply, it cannot recharge whenever in rural area where there is no AC supply. In this project, the solar powered <b>notebook</b> that implement solar energy is represented in order to give supply to a <b>notebook.</b> The solar <b>notebook</b> concept is a laptop with complete power independent. This is due to powerful batteries that are recharged by any solar panel attached to the computer. The solar panel that attached to the <b>notebook</b> is able to convert solar energy to DC power that can give power to the <b>notebook.</b> It is expected that the <b>notebook</b> can switch on without AC power as it energized by solar energy...|$|R

Dylan had helped to curate this project, in which songs unfinished when Williams died in 1953 were completed and recorded {{by a variety of}} artists, including Dylan himself, his son Jakob Dylan, Levon Helm, Norah Jones, Jack White, and others.|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria {{had given}} Beatrice {{the task of}} editing the {{journals}} for publication, which meant removing private material as well as passages that, if published, might be hurtful to living people. Beatrice deleted so much material that the edited journals are only a third {{as long as the}} originals. The destruction of such large passages of Queen Victoria's diaries distressed Beatrice's nephew, King George V, and his wife Queen Mary, who were powerless to intervene. Beatrice copied a draft from the original and then copied her draft into a set of blue <b>notebooks.</b> Both the originals and her first drafts were destroyed as she progressed. The task took thirty years and was finished in 1931. The surviving 111 <b>notebooks</b> are kept in the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} promise and burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 <b>notebooks</b> and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E

5|$|Artist Samir Mondal {{composed}} Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held {{a workshop}} with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's. Mondal also instructed Khan on a painter's typical mannerisms and movements. Gupte created {{the rest of}} Ishaan's artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaan's flipbook. The art department's designs for Ishaan's school <b>notebooks</b> disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} {{publications}} of Leaves of Grass, Whitman had financial difficulties {{and was forced}} to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's Daily Times starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed <b>notebooks</b> and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the {{numbering}} scheme that is still used nowadays, in parallel with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his <b>notebooks</b> but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter x) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.|$|E
5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the <b>notebooks</b> of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E
