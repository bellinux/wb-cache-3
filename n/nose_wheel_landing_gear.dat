50|$|The ASP S15 is a two-seat single-engined, all {{composite}} construction, {{powered sailplane}} {{with the engine}} mounted in the center fuselage. The cockpit has room for two in side-by-side configuration. It has a shoulder wing, a conventional T-tail and a retractable <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> It can also be fitted with a 2-axis autopilot and external underwing payload pods.|$|E
40|$|During the {{conceptual}} design phase of aircraft {{the integration of}} undercarriage system is very important and {{it is often difficult}} to achieve on the first time. The <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> preferred configurations for light naval trainer aircraft. The main objective of this project is to improve the static strength criteria and fatigue life of Nose Landing Gear Barrel considered. The investigations includes preliminary design layout for Nose Landing Gear Barrel and initial sizing has been done. It has been designed and evaluated for strength criteria. A method of analysis for the design of Nose Landing Gear Barrel made up of Al-Cu alloy (BS L 168 T 6511) with static loads of axial, bending and normal loads are applied. The geometric modeling of the Nose Landing Gear Barrel was carried out using CAD package CATIA V 5 R 19 and pre and post processing was done through MSC/PATRAN. The stresses and displacements are obtained with the application of MSC/NASTRAN finite element software. ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{link the}} yoke, control stick, or rudder {{directly to the}} wheel used for steering. Manipulating these controls turns the steering <b>wheel</b> (the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> for tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> and the tail wheel for taildraggers). The connection may be a firm one in which any movement of the controls turns the steering wheel (and vice versa), {{or it may be}} a soft one in which a spring-like mechanism twists the steering wheel but does not force it to turn. The former provides positive steering but makes it easier to skid the steering wheel; the latter provides softer steering (making it easy to overcontrol) but reduces the probability of skidding. Aircraft with retractable gear may disable the steering mechanism wholly or partially when the gear is retracted.|$|R
25|$|The PC-24 {{is powered}} by a pair of Williams FJ44-4A {{turbofan}} engines. A unique feature of the FJ44-4A powerplant is the Quiet Power Mode; in addition to providing thrust and main power, standby power is also drawn from the main engines in Quiet Power Mode, in place of a separate auxiliary power unit (APU). An additional 5 per cent is available via an Automatic Thrust Reserve feature. The engines are mounted on the upper portion of the rear fuselage to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) during operations at rough airstrips. Other FOD-reduction measures include the enlarged flaps and chines on the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The exhaust ducts of the engines feature an aerodynamic modification, having been shaped so the outflow contributes to the thrust vector during takeoff, reducing the takeoff roll distance.|$|R
500|$|The {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} were controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the wing flaps and ailerons {{on one side and}} lowering them on the other provided roll. The V-tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. [...] Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high angle of attack (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking. [...] To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of [...] "commercial off-the-shelf" [...] components were used, including an F-15 <b>nose</b> <b>wheel,</b> F/A-18 main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.|$|R
40|$|In many {{installations}} of castering rubber-tired wheels {{there is}} a tendency for the wheel to oscillate violently about the spindle axis. This phenomenon, popularly called 'shimmy,' has occurred in some airplane tail wheels and has been corrected in two ways: first by the application of friction in the spindles of the tail wheels; and, second, by locking the wheels while taxiing at high speeds. Shimmy is common with the large <b>wheels</b> used as <b>nose</b> <b>wheels</b> in tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> and, since it is impossible to lock the wheels, friction in the nose-wheel spindle has been the sole means of correction. Because the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> is larger than the conventional tail wheel and usually carries a greater load, the larger amounts of spindle friction necessary to prevent shimmy are objectionable. the present paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the problem of the stability of castering <b>wheels</b> for airplane <b>landing</b> <b>gears.</b> On the basis of simplified assumptions induced from experimental observations, a theoretical study has been made of the shimmy of castering wheels. The theory is based on the discovery of a phenomenon called 'kinematic shimmy' and is compared quantitatively with the results of model experiments. Experimental checks, using a model having low-pressure tires, are reported and the applicability of the results to full scale is discussed. Theoretical methods of estimating the spindle viscous damping and spindle solid friction necessary to avoid shimmy - lateral freedom - is introduced...|$|R
