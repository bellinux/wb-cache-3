5|$|In vocal music, noisy <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllables</b> {{were used}} to imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Clément Janequin made these devices famous in his {{programmatic}} chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in {{the first version of}} his melodrama, Königskinder. This style of performance {{is believed to have been}} used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900–11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930–32), and for chorus in Die Glückliche Hand (1910–13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977–78, amongst other works). A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady. Another form of unpitched vocal music is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.|$|E

25|$|In vocal jazz, scat {{singing is}} vocal {{improvisation}} with wordless vocables, <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllables</b> or without words at all. In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice {{as an instrument}} rather than a speaking medium.|$|E
25|$|Singing and {{percussion}} are {{the most}} important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical vocables (<b>nonsense</b> <b>syllables).</b> Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle tremolos, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for singers and dancers.|$|E
25|$|The {{specificity}} of bird calls {{has been used}} extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllables</b> or line diagrams. Common terms in English include words such as quack, chirp and chirrup. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the white-throated sparrow's song, given in Canada as O sweet Canada Canada Canada and in New England as Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody (also Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the barred owl produces a motif which some bird guides describe as Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all? with the emphasis placed on you.|$|E

In addition, each <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllable</b> appeared an equal amount of times; the trials were split evenly in terms of counting by either three or four. No successive items contained the same letters, and the time between signal for recall and the next trial was always 15 seconds. In addition, the examiner and participant were instructed to enunciate in rhythm with a 120 BPM metronome, such that two letters or numbers were spoken per second.|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} {{evidence of}} religion in the text is meager. The phrase divina misericordia in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei, where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, {{and the use of the}} phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity on closer inspection only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a lamella, or metal leaf. Such “magic words” often include <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllables</b> and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllable</b> {{is widely}} used to {{describe}} non-lexical vocables used in music, most notably in scat singing but also in many other forms of vocal music.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purposes}} of this investigation were two-fold: 1) to prospectively investigate the effect of pro-longed lack of binaural amplification in the unaided ears of adults with bilaterally symmetrical sensorineural hear-ing impairment (BSSHI) fitted monaurally; and, 2) to prospectively investigate the effects of amplification on speech-recognition performance in the aided ears of monaurally and binaurally fitted subjects. Subjects con-sisted of 19 monaurally aided adults, 28 binaurally aided adults, and 19 control adults. Both ears of the experimen-tal subjects (binaurally and monaurally aided adults) had BSSHI. The speech measures included the W- 22 CID suprathreshold speech-recognition test, <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllable</b> test, and speech-perception-in-noise test. Initial testing was done between 6 and 12 weeks following hearing-aid fitting. Retests were performed approximately 1 year following the initial test. The results revealed that the mean aided minus unaided ear score for the <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllable</b> and W- 22 tests increased significantly from the initial test to retest, reflecting a slight improvement in speech performance in the aided ear and a slightly greater decrement in the unaided ear.

2500|$|Doo-wop is a {{genre of}} music that was {{developed}} in African-American communities of New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles in the 1940s, achieving mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s.

In addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of musical quotation. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his scatting. This is called using a compression. The 1958 song [...] "Witch Doctor" [...] by Ross Bagdasarian Sr., creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks, employs the technique of humorous scatting in its chorus of <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllables</b> (oo ee oo ah ah).|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{abilities}} such as {{attention or}} working memory can support older adults during speech perception. However, cognitive abilities {{as well as}} speech perception decline with age, leading to the expenditure of effort during speech processing. This longitudinal study therefore investigated age-related differences in electrophysiological processes during speech discrimination, and assessed the extent of enhancement to such cognitive auditory processes through repeated auditory exposure. For that purpose, accuracy and reaction time were compared between 13 older adults (62 - 76 y) and 15 middle-aged (28 - 52 y) controls in an active oddball paradigm which was administered at three consecutive measurement time points at an interval of two weeks, while EEG was recorded. As a standard stimulus, the <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllable</b> /'a:ʃa/ was used, while the <b>nonsense</b> <b>syllable</b> /'a:sa/ and a morphing between /'a:ʃa/ and /'a:sa/ served as deviants. N 2 b and P 3 b ERP responses were evaluated {{as a function of}} age, deviant, and measurement time point using a data-driven topographical microstate analysis. From middle age to old age, age-related decline in attentive perception (as reflected in the N 2 b-related microstates) and in memory updating and attentional processes (as reflected in the P 3 b-related microstates) was found, as reflected in both lower neural responses and later onsets of the respective cortical networks, and in age-related changes in frontal activation during attentional stimulus processing. Importantly, N 2 b- and P 3 b-related microstates changed as a function of repeated stimulus exposure in both groups. This research therefore suggests that experience with auditory stimuli can support auditory neurocognitive processes in normal hearing adults into advanced age.
