5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E
5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the independence and unity of Ireland: {{the specifics of}} independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up {{many of the same}} ideas.|$|E

5000|$|Adaptation can {{mitigate}} the adverse impacts of climate change, {{but it will}} incur costs and will not prevent all damage. The IPCC points out that many adverse {{effects of climate change}} are not changes in the average conditions, but changes in the variation or the extremes of conditions. [...] For example, the average sea level in a port might <b>not</b> be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the level during a storm (which causes flooding); the average rainfall in an area might <b>not</b> be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> has how frequent and severe droughts become.|$|R
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter his senses, and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle. Upon leaving he is given a bow with magical arrows, a belt with twelve priceless diamonds, an enchanted flask of elvish concoction, a copy of a poem he wrote and presented for the Agaetí Blödhren, and the blessing of Oromis and Glaedr.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E
