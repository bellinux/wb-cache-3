Thermodynamic stability studies indicated that substitution of guanosine by 8 -methoxy- or 8 -benzyloxyguanosine significantly decreased the thermodynamic stability of RNA duplexes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: alpha-Momorcharin (alpha MMC) {{is a type}} I ribosome-inactivating protein. It {{inhibits}} {{protein synthesis}} by hydrolytically removing a specific adenine residue from a highly conserved, single-stranded loop of rRNA. RESULTS: Here we describe the determination and refinement of the crystal structures of alpha MMC in the native state and in complexes with the product, adenine, and a substrate analogue, formycin 5 '-monophosphate (FMP) at high resolution. Both adenine and the base of FMP are tightly bound; the ribose of bound FMP adopts a strained, high-energy conformation, which may mimic {{the structure of the}} transition state. CONCLUSIONS: These structures indicate that residues Tyr 70, Glu 160 and Arg 163 of alpha MMC are the most critical for catalysis. We propose that the strained conformation of the ribose in the target adenosine weakens the glycoside bond. Partial protonation mediated by Arg 163 then facilitates <b>N-glycoside</b> bond cleavage, leading to the formation of an oxycarbonium ion intermediate which is stabilized by the negatively-charged Glu 160.

Lipid-linked precursors {{of this type of}} glycoconjugates (Lechner et al., 1985 a) exhibit the following unusual features: The carrier lipid is a C 60 -dolichol rather than a bacterial undecaprenol. Sulfation of the saccharides is completed whilst they are linked to the lipid, and does not occur after transfer of the saccharides to the protein. The sulfated oligosaccharide is bound to the dolichol via a monophosphate rather than a pyrophosphate bridge. Some lipid oligosaccharides contain an additional 3 - 0 -methylglucose residue (Lechner et al., 1985 b). This methylated sugar is peripherally linked to the lipid-saccharide intermediates and occurs exclusively at the lipid linked level, but is absent when the oligosaccharide is linked to protein. When S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of this glucose residue is inhibited in vivo in halobacteria, sulfated glycoprotein synthesis is depressed as well.

Crucial features addressed by the methodology are: the ability to synthesize nucleosides analogs with a variety on 42 ̆ 7 -C-alkyl substituents; exceptional stereocontrol over the C 42 ̆ 7 stereogenic center; and a semi-convergent synthesis, allowing the late stage N-glycosylation of heterocyclic bases.

The specific activity was enriched 4 – 5 -fold in a crude membrane fraction. The transferase was purified 10 – 12 -fold in a membrane fraction that bands on top of 1. 1 M sucrose. This fraction was also enriched in nucleotidyldiphosphatase. The enriched fraction was deficient in glucose- 6 -phosphatase, an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Approx. 80 % of the transferase activity was latent, and unavailable to protease. Purified membranes were either subjected to phase separation in Triton X- 114, or sodium carbonate extraction or sonication. In each case, the transferase behaved as an intrinsic membrane protein. Several secreted and lysosomal proteins are modified by the enzyme. These data support the idea that the GlcNAc transferase is present an an integral Golgi membrane protein and that at least the catalytic center of the transferase is on the lumenal side of the vesicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} control tensor {{properties}} of organic crystals is a goal of crystal engineering. In organic crystals this implies organisation of the supra-molecular arrangement. In this work one aspect of crystal engineering is explored, namely whether hydrogen bonding {{can be used to}} overcome the natural tendency of molecules with large ground state dipole moments to align in an anti-parallel fashion. A potential application of this is the favourable alignment of polar chromophoric groups in organic crystals for Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) of laser light. The testing of powder crystalline samples by the method of Kurtz and Perry also allows a rapid screening of materials with such favourable arrangements. The use of chiral auxilliaries attached to the chromophores ensures that an SHG signal must be observed but cannot ensure pseudo-centrosymmetry is eliminated. By using sugars as the chiral auxilliaries and a variety of anilines as the chromophores, we have synthesised families of <b>N-glycoside</b> derivatives, which offer the prospect of a variety of packing arrangements based upon their unique H-bonding capabilities. The glycoside products were tested for crystallinity and powder SHG efficiencies measured. Where possible structure-property relationships between the SHG efficiency and the orientation of the chromophores in the material were studied by single-crystal X-ray structure determination. Our findings can be divided into four chromophore groups, small π-chromophores based on PNA which are hydrophobic or hydrophilic and extended chromophores based on donor-acceptor substituted tolanes or stilbenes which are either hydrophobic or include a hydrophilic group. The glycosides from small hydrophobic chromophores were generally highly crystalline and a wide dynamic range of SHG signals were found. Several compounds were efficient. (eg L-Fuc- 20 Me-PNA = 650 x sucrose). The hydrophilic analogues were, surprisingly, rather less crystalline but one high efficiency material (2 -DeoxyGlc- 2 -OH-PNA 2900 x sucrose) was identified. The best materials were found to crystallise in monoclinic system and had their charge transfer axes oriented between 30 - 60 degrees to the crystllographic 2 -fold. The hydrophobic extended chromophores could not be successfully oriented by this approach. The compounds were either non-crystalline {{or in the case of}} the stilbene derivatives were always found in anti-parallel arrangement. When a hydrophilic substituent was attached to the tolane, both crystallinity and the maximum SHG efficiencies were greatly enhanced. The ability of hydrogen bonding in overcoming centrosymrnetry was also shown in the chromophore itself (CH 2 OH-Tol) which had a powder SHG of 1100 x sucrose. Our studies show that these mostly ambiphilic molecules crystallise by molecular aggregations to form hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic regions may be either 1 -D channels or form 2 -D sheets. Analysis of the SHG results on our crystalline glycoside families, together with previous results from our group on PNA and MNA glycosides clearly indicate that optimal SHG materials are only ever seen for sugars with three hydroxyl groups, either pentoses or deoxy-hexoses. Hexose based glycosides which have four hydroxyl groups, or those from 2 -Deoxyribose, which has only two hydroxyls invariably had only medium to weak SHG efficiencies. In conclusion successful control of the degree of hydrogen bonding, and the aggregation to form supra-molecular arrays, can be achieved in certain cases, and is critical to obtaining optimal alignments of chromophore away from anti-parallel orientation...|$|E

In this thesis the first aim {{of this study was to}} use three different techniques to analyze the synthetic biological bivalent <b>N-glycosides.</b> The gas phase fragmentation of this series of synthetic bivalent Nglycosides (1 - 6) have been studied by electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and quadrupole ion-trap mass spectrometry, in conjunction with using different “in-time” and “in-space” tandem mass spectrometers. In the second aim of this study, MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS and MALDI-TOF/TOFMS/ MS analyses were used which have proven to be a powerful analytical tool capable for ionizing both small and large lignin oligomers. The MALDI mass spectra of the CIMV (CIMV is a world first for the manufacture of whitened paper pulp, sulfur free linear lignin and xylose syrup from annual fiber crops and hardwood). -extracted wheat straw lignin were recorded in the positive ion mode with a high-resolution MALDITOF/ TOF-MS/MS. The positive ion mode MALDI-MS indicated the exact presence of a multitude of oligomers, from which 30 specific oligomeric ions were identified. The structural characterization of this novel series of 30 specific related oligomers was achieved by calculating the exact molecular masses measured by high-resolution MALDI-TOF-MS. High-energy collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometric analyses MALDI-CID-TOF/TOF-MS/MS provided unique dissociation patterns of the complete series of novel precursor ions. These MS/MS analyses provided diagnostic product ions, which enabled us to determination of the exact molecular structures and arrangement of the selected 30 different related ionic species...|$|R

These data require that a non-covalent event, fast {{in the case of}} the <b>N-glycosides</b> but slow {{in the case of the}} O-glycosides, precedes bond-breaking, and that bond-breaking involves substantial charge development on the glycone and near-perpendicularity of the C 2 -H bond to the planar oxocarbonium ion system. A model meeting these requirements is that the non-covalent event is a conjoint change of protein and substrate conformation which puts the pyranose ring in the 2, 5 B conformation of the bond-breaking transition state. This model also explains the contrast between the powerful inhibition of the enzyme by deoxynojirimycin (Ki = 23 +/- 3 microM) and feeble inhibition by castanospermine [Saul, Chambers, Molyneux & Elbein (1983) Arch.

Starting from the synthesis of 14 glycosyl azides, a library of carbohydrate-oxazolidinone conjugates and a library of carbohydrate-cyclopamine conjugates with biological interests were synthesized based on a highly efficient 2 ̆ 2 click reaction 2 ̆ 2 assisted by sonication. Some of the conjugates have improved solubility and enhanced anticancer activity. A library of neomycin B derivatives with various modifications at the 52 ̆ 2 position has been synthesized. Two leads exhibit prominent activity against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Antibacterial activities were measured when combined with other clinically used antibiotics and significant synergistic activities were observed. Three different classes of aryl <b>N-glycosides</b> have been synthesized by employing 1, 4 -naphthoquinone and glycosyl azides undergoing a [2 + 3] cycloaddition. Alkyl azides can also undergo the same cycloaddition. After the removal of the protecting group, a library of 9, 10 -anthraquinone derivatives with potential anticancer activity and a library of 2 -aminomethylene- 1, 3 -indanediones with novel antibacterial activity have been developed, respectively. A one-pot three-component [2 + 3] cycloaddition for the synthesis of 1 -alkyl 1 H-naphtho[2, 3 -d][1, 2, 3]triazole- 4, 9 -dione and 2 -alkyl 2 H-naphtho[2, 3 -d][1, 2, 3] triazole- 4, 9 -dione has been developed. By taking the advantage of their difference in basicity, both products can be obtained in good purity. Using an allylic azide rearrangement, a convenient method has been developed for the synthesis of several 22 ̆ 7, 32 ̆ 7 -dideoxyaminoglycosides. The antibacterial activity of these novel aminoglycosides also confirms the indispensable role of the 22 ̆ 7 -NH 2 group for both neomycin and kanamycin classes of aminoglycosides.

40|$|The aim {{of crystal}} {{engineering}} is to design new solids with desirable {{physical and chemical}} properties, utilizing the understanding of molecular packing in crystalline materials. In this project we have demonstrated the ability to engineer one such crystal tensor property, that of Second Harmonic Generation of laser light. Only materials which are noncentrosymmetric will be SHG active. Since, saccharides are chiral, all saccharide-derived compounds will crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric point group, and show SHG activity. By coupling nonlinear optical chromophore such as PNA {{to a wide range}} of saccharides, a series of compounds, <b>N-glycosides,</b> can be formed with widely varying SHG efficiencies. By study of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns, each compound was found to have its own unique molecular packing arrangement. Details of a number of these have been revealed by single crystal X-ray structure analysis. The crystal structures confirm that the compounds are β-N-aryglycosides and that the packing of these ambiphilic molecules is dominated by hydrogen bonding, such that each crystal contains hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. The hydrogen bond arrangement between saccharide moieties in the hydrophilic domain may affect the relative orientations of the hydrophobic chromophores to which they are attached, thus modifying their SHG efficiency. In D-Ara-PNA, a favourable packing arrangement is found such that the charge transfer axis of the chroniophores forms an angle of 50. 7 ° with respect to the Crystallographic b-axis. This leads to a high SHG efficiency. Other crystals studied such as D-Gal-PNA have a less favourable arrangement with the molecular charge transfer axes nearly orthogonal to the monoclinic 21 axis. Our studies show that for these families of saccharide adducts about 10 % should crystallize in the more favourable monoclinic symmetry class and have acceptable chromophore orientations with respect to the crystallographic b-axis. Since 15 - 20 crystalline saccharide derivatives can be made for a given chromophore, this offers an attractive approach to optimizing its SHG response in the solicl-state...|$|R
40|$|Chloro {{derivatives}} of benzimidazole {{were found}} to be 2 to 3 times more active than corresponding methyl derivatives in causing inhibition of Lee virus multiplication in chorioallantoic membrane cultures in vitro. The most active benzimidazole derivative thus far tested is 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB); it caused 75 per cent inhibition of Lee virus multiplication in membrane cultures at a concentration of 0. 38 x 10 – 4 M. On the other hand, 5, 6 -dimethyl- 1 -alpha;-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, the moiety present in vitamin B 12, failed to inhibit Lee virus multiplication at a concentration of 35 x 10 – 4 M. Other <b>N-glycosides</b> of 5, 6 -dichlorobenzimidazole were considerably less active than DRB. In single cycle experiments, the degree of inhibition of Lee virus multiplication by DRB in membrane cultures was not dependent on the amount of virus in the inoculum. This compound did not inactivate the infectivity of extracellular Lee virus, had no effect on virus-erythrocyte interaction, did not interfere with the adsorption of the virus by the host tissue, nor affect the release of newly formed virus from the membrane. The inhibitory effect of DRB on Lee virus multiplication, in contrast to that of 2, 5 -dimethylbenzimidazole, persisted after transfer of infected membranes into fresh culture medium not containing the compound. Both DRB and the 2, 5 -dimethyl compound caused 99 per cent inhibition of Lee virus multiplication without affecting oxygen uptake of the membrane. Tissue proliferation of membrane pieces in roller tube culture was not significantly affected by DRB at inhibitory concentration, whereas at equivalent concentration the 2, 5 -dimethyl compound did restrict cellular growth. At higher concentrations, both compounds caused retardation of cell proliferation. This effect was reversible on removal of either compound from the medium. The multiplication of several strains of influenza A and B viruses, i. e. Lee, MB, PR 8, and FM 1, was inhibited to the same degree by each of the two compounds; DRB was 35 times more active than the 2, 5 -dimethyl compound relative to each of the strains. DRB caused inhibition of Lee virus multiplication in intact embryonated chicken eggs and in mice without causing significant signs of toxicity in either host. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the mechanism of the inhibition of influenza virus multiplication...|$|R
