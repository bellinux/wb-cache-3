Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past.

With her marvellous brain she sharpened people's wits." [...] Her granddaughter thought her [...] "formidable, but never intimidating... a supremely honest woman, full of commonsense and modesty." [...] Victoria wrote her own typically forthright epitaph {{at the end}} of her life in letters to and conversation with her son: [...] "What will live in history is the good work done by the individual & that has nothing to do with rank or title...

500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E

Foster saw Inside Man as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee: [...] "Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making. Basically, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would because it didn't seem like his stories or subject matter were ever going to include me. So, I'm just as excited as I can be." [...] She described her character as a woman with [...] "a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody — she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me." ...|$|E
500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't hurt me now, I got away from you, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E

500|$|The Browns next {{faced the}} Los Angeles Rams in the {{championship}} game. Groza came into the game as the NFL's leading kicker, {{both in terms of}} points scored and accuracy. He had a success rate of 68.4% in an era when most teams made fewer than half of their attempts. The Rams went ahead early in the game on a touchdown pass from star quarterback Bob Waterfield and a scoring run by Dick Hoerner. But Graham and the Browns came back with four touchdowns, two to receiver Dante Lavelli. As time wound down in the fourth quarter, however, the Rams were ahead 28–27, and Cleveland had a final chance to win the game. Graham drove the offense to the Rams' nine-yard line and set up a Groza field goal attempt. The 16-yard try sailed through the uprights with 28 seconds left, giving the Browns a 30–28 victory. It was the biggest kick of Groza's career. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would miss", he said later. After the season, Groza was named to the first-ever Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game.|$|E
500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Love {{was ordered}} into {{lockdown}} rehab by a California judge {{after a series}} of legal issues and controlled substance charges. After her release in 2006, she published a memoir, , and started recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled [...] "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told Billboard: [...] "My hand-eye coordination was so bad , I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise ... I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would work again." [...] Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of [...] "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released.

500|$|At age 17, {{in a bid}} to {{show people}} he was {{prepared}} for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he [...] "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." [...] He added: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion." [...] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.|$|E

The transitional section that begins [...] "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" [...] of the Masser song has the same melody as [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" [...] of Lightfoot's song.

2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned.

[...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic felt [...] "...the Soulful British crooner James Blunt's wistful debut infuses the {{listener}} – in order – with rainy-day hope, the wistful comfort of unattainable love, and finally, world-weary resignation. While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley-era Rod Stewart {{with a healthy}} dose of Antony and the Johnsons, it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam." [...] Q magazine and Common Sense Media awarded the album four stars out of five. RocknWorld stated [...] "It's hard to describe James Blunt or his music without falling prey to many a cliché or hyperbole. Comes from the UK, serves in the army then makes an album of movingly sincere ballads which make a huge impression on his homeland and Australia, thus allowing him to enjoy phenomenal, chart topping success. However, in this case, the music Blunt is making does really deserve and warrant the hype surrounding him. Strangely enough, even with his music being all over the radio here in Australia, I cannot begrudge the fact that Blunt is truly talented and has made himself a damn good debut record." [...] BBC Collective said [...] "It's very rare I give an album 5 stars. Many have come close, but just missing it. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>i</b> would say this, but Back To Bedlam has not got one bad track on it. I've listened to it 3 times back to back, just to make sure." [...] Slant Magazine said, in a three and a half star review, that [...] "Bedlam is an overall raw listening experience" [...] and that though [...] "Blunt's writing often juxtaposes love with death" [...] that it's [...] "More reason for American girls to go gaga over this able British bloke." ...|$|E
