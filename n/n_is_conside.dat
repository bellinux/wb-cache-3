40|$|The task {{of placing}} sensors for {{purposes}} of feedback control is vital {{in order to obtain}} information necessary for accurate state estimation. In this paper, we present a method for optimal location of sensors which is motivated by the feedback control law for the distributed parameter system.

We use this information in an algorithm which computes Centroidal Voronoi Tesselations, yielding optimal locations for sensors. This placement is compared with three others to show that location can be more important than number of sensors. 1 Introduction Sensor location and design for control of thermal fluid problemsis of great importance to obtain practical, efficient controllers.

The alkali-soluble, acid-insoluble sludge fraetíon (humic-like) was isolated after exhaustive lipid extraetion, and analyzed by chemical degradation followed by eombined gas ehromatography mass spectrometry. It was observed that this sludge fraction contai-ned an important amount of lipid compounds (more than 40 % by weight). Most of this lipid material can be physically removed, but the residual polymer fractions were also found to be highly aliphatic in nature. The high yields upon degradation of several types of alkanoic acids and the relatively high proportion of polypeptides (30 % by weight), as well as carbohydrates, suggested that the humic-like fraetions from both the eomposted and uneomposted sludges consisted of slightly altered microbial and residual biopoly-mers.
