6000|$|Joe saw how Wetzel {{used this}} ability, {{but what it}} really was baffled him. He {{realized}} that words were not adequate to explain fully this great art. Its possession required a marvelously keen vision, an eye perfectly familiar with every creature, tree, rock, shrub and thing belonging in the forest; an eye so quick in flight as to detect instantly the slightest change in nature, or anything unnatural to that environment. The hearing must be delicate, {{like that of a}} deer, and the finer it is, the keener will be the woodsman. Lastly, there is the feeling that prompts the old hunter to say: [...] "No game to-day." [...] It is something in him that speaks when, as he sees a night-hawk circling low near the ground, he says: [...] "A storm to-morrow." [...] It is what makes an Indian at home in any wilderness. The clouds may hide the guiding star; the <b>northing</b> may be lost; there may be no moss on the trees, or difference in their bark; the ridges may be flat or lost altogether, and there may be no water-courses; yet the Indian brave always goes for his teepee, straight as a crow flies.

After walking half an hour we turned eastward into a feeder of the Surr, the Wady el-Khulasah, whose aspect charmed me: this drain of the inner Jedayl block was the replica of a Fiumara in Somali-land, a broad tree-dotted flat of golden sand, bordered on either side by an emerald avenue of dense Mimosas, forming line under the green-stone hills to the right, and the red-stone heights to the left. The interior, we again remarked, is evidently more rained upon, and therefore less sterile and desolate, than the coast and the sub-maritime regions; and here one can well imagine large towns being built. At last, after walking {{about an hour and a}} half (= four miles and a half) towards the Shárr, with our backs turned upon our goal, the rat-faced little intriguer, Hasan, declared that he knew nothing about El-Khulasah, but that Zibayyib lay there! pointing to a bright-red cliffy peak, [...] "Abá'l-bárid," [...] on the left bank of the Wady, and to others whose heads were blue enough and low enough to argue considerable distance.
