5|$|Phase 2: Vahan, <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> huge cavalry {{maneuver}} of the Muslims, {{ordered his}} cavalry to group together, {{but was not}} quick enough; before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the front and the flank {{while they were still}} moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate.|$|E

An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E
5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) comforts her upset co-worker, Yelina (Monique Curnen), and {{learns that}} Yelina's fiancé, who was immigrating from Cuba {{illegally}} {{with the help}} of a coyote, is missing. Rita asks Dexter to look into the problem using his police connections, and he finds a list of subjects from a past police case. He investigates Jorge Castillo, a salvage yard owner, and after Yelina's fiancé washes up dead on a beach, he discovers that Castillo is murdering the smuggled immigrants who cannot pay for their freedom. Dexter leads Castillo into a trailer in his salvage yard, but as he prepares to kill him, Castillo's wife Valerie (Valerie Dillman) arrives. Dexter realizes that the couple are working together, and decides to kill both Jorge and Valerie in the trailer. After killing them, he dumps their bodies in the ocean and frees their Cuban prisoners, not <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> person watching him from the trunk of a car in the yard.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had become {{infected}} with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in the Castro, and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too sick to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating {{dinner in the}} detached dining room when he noticed smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E

5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|The agents later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives the agents permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. <b>Noticing</b> <b>the</b> plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E
5|$|The film {{concerns}} a middle-aged railway pointsman, Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), {{who lives in}} a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within.|$|E

5|$|The {{first use}} of these tactics by the Tangmere Wing was used on 6 May 1941. The Wing engaged Bf 109Fs from Jagdgeschwader 51 (Fighter Wing 51), led by Werner Mölders. <b>Noticing</b> <b>the</b> {{approaching}} Germans below and behind them, the Spitfires feigned ignorance. Waiting for the optimum moment to turn the tables, Bader called for them to break, and whip around behind the Bf 109s. Unfortunately, while the tactic had been successful in avoiding a surprise attack, the break was mistimed. It left some Bf 109s still behind the Spitfires. In the battle that followed the Wing shot down one Bf 109 and damaged another, although Dundas was shot down {{for the second time}} in his career—and once again by Mölders, who had remained behind the British. Dundas was able to nurse his crippled fighter back to base and crash-land.|$|E
5|$|The stacks {{belonged to}} Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. <b>Noticing</b> <b>the</b> way the light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, {{to bring him}} two canvases, one for sunny and one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, {{dark clouds}} began {{to close in}} on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after <b>noticing</b> <b>the</b> reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.|$|E
