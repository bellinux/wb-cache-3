5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did <b>not</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included.

5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002.

Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did <b>not</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> proper land use planning.|$|E

The problems that are being treated may or may <b>not</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves {{all members of the}} team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
