5|$|Despite being {{originally}} {{intended as a}} defensive weapon for military personnel whose primary role is <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> with small arms (such as vehicle drivers), most sales of the P90 have been to special forces and counter-terrorist groups who use it for offensive roles.

5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> as {{equipped}} as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E
5|$|Serbs who {{neglected}} {{to join the}} uprising were brutalized in equal measure. Males who could not produce an adequate excuse for why they were <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> were killed and their houses torched. While most of the rebels were Serbs, the Pashalik's Romani (Gypsy) residents, the majority of whom were Muslim, also actively {{took part in the}} revolt. In 1806, the rebels twice dispatched the diplomat Petar Ičko to Constantinople to negotiate with the Porte. The two parties eventually reached an understanding, which {{came to be known as}} Ičko's Peace, in which the Ottomans agreed to grant the rebels extensive autonomy. Due to the Balkans' poor communications and transport infrastructure, it took several months for news of the Porte's offer to reach the rebels. In August 1806, the rebels defeated the Ottomans at the Battle of Mišar. Later that month, they scored another victory at the Battle of Deligrad. Smederevo was captured in November and made the capital of Karađorđe's revolutionary state. Belgrade, with the exception of its imposing fortress, fell in early December. The outbreak of the Russo-Ottoman War that month, compounded by Russia's avowal to provide extensive materiel and financial support to the rebels should they continue fighting, convinced Karađorđe not to accept anything short of complete independence. He promptly refused to accept the terms of the agreement negotiated by Ičko. In March 1807, Karađorđe issued a promise to Suleiman Pasha, the Governor of Belgrade, that he and his garrison would be granted safe passage if they vacated the city's besieged fortress. When Suleiman and his garrison emerged from the fortress, they were ambushed. Adult men were killed on the spot. Women and girls were converted to Christianity, and forced to marry or re-marry the men that had captured them, while children were placed in the care of Christian families. One contemporary account suggests that as many as 3,000 non-Christians – mostly Muslims, but also Jews – were converted. Jews that resisted conversion were either killed or expelled. The city's mosques were destroyed or turned into churches.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the British Army in 1938 was for Army Tank Brigades, attached as Corps troops, to work alongside the Infantry divisions and break into the enemy defensive positions. The Mobile Division, supported Territorial Army Motor divisions each of two motorised infantry brigades supported by two artillery regiments but no tanks, was to then to create a breakthrough. Initially, the mechanised cavalry regiments of the division, were designed as reconnaissance <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> formations. The motorised infantry, according to John Burnett-Stuart on 8 September 1937, {{was not meant to}} fight {{side by side with the}} tanks they were to protect them during resting and replenishing periods.|$|E

A clear call for the confederation would also allow the Germans to recruit more men for the Waffen-SS from the occupied countries, and {{to force them to}} bolster their war effort in personal and material spheres. Also, the confederation would deter the neutral countries of Europe from siding with the Allied camp.|$|E

25|$|The letters also stigmatise Pitt's actions {{towards a}} peace with France as appeasing the French nation, {{which was the}} wrong way to act in Burke's view. Burke was {{confident}} that the war against France was waged against what Revolutionary France represented, and that the English were <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> against the French nation but against the revolutionaries that were spreading an ideology. In the third letter, Burke mentions that the French had a fleet that could have sent troops into Ireland and aid the Irish in rebelling against Britain. The French, {{at the same time that}} they stated that they wanted to continue negotiating peace were sending troops to invade. As such, Burke hints at a possible impeachment of Pitt for seeking peace with France.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} involve mock battles among different “battalions” of “soldiers” which is {{loosely based on}} the historic Battle of Puebla which occurred on May 5, 1862. These occur at various {{times of the day}} and continue until those that represent the French Imperial Army loses. The battles can result in enough gun smoke from the powder used in participants’ muskets to cover the town. When <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> the soldiers either parade, often to the music of live bands. Parades of the battalions start by circling the main square twice, with each battalion followed by a live band. Traditional tunes include La marcha de Zacatecas, Juana Gallo and ¡Que chula es Puebla! played as the soldiers dance and constantly set off their muskets.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} losses affected everyone. Banks {{and insurance companies}} were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure {{was about the same}} whether or <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer {{at the end of the}} war than at the beginning.|$|E

25|$|Duryodhana {{approached}} Bhishma {{one night}} and accused him of <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> the battle to his full strength because of his affection for the Pandavas. The angry Bhishma took a vow that either he will kill Arjuna or will make Lord Krishna break his promise of not picking up any weapons during the war. On the next day there was an intense battle between Bhishma and Arjuna. Although Arjuna was very powerful, he {{was no match for}} Bhishma. Bhishma soon shot arrows which cut Arjuna's armour and then also his Gandiva bow's string. Arjuna was helpless before the wrath of his grand-uncle. As Bhishma was about to kill Arjuna with his arrows, Sri Krishna who took vow of not raising a weapon in the war, lifted a chariot wheel and threatened Bhishma. Arjuna stopped Lord Krishna. Arjuna convinced Krishna to return to the chariot and put down the wheel, promising to redouble his determination in the fight. Thus Bhishma fulfilled his vow.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, the WBO made Álvarez the {{mandatory}} challenger {{to the world}} middleweight title, skipping the previous number 1, Avtandil Khurtsidze, which was considered controversial, due to Álvarez currently <b>not</b> <b>fighting</b> at middleweight. Khurtsidze, who had ten days to appeal decision, decided not to. On December 24, Álvarez and his team gave Chávez a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7m, or he would consider other options. On January 12, 2017 De La Hoya and Álvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chávez Jr. and urged him to sign it. A day later, Chávez Jr. claimed he had agreed all the demands set by Álvarez and was {{said that he would}} sign the contract. According to Chávez Jr. the new demands included a weight limit set at 164.5 pounds and a $6 million base purse plus PPV revenue percentages.|$|E
25|$|Jack Johnson, {{the heavyweight}} champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, {{met in a}} 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested {{throughout}} that the men were <b>not</b> <b>fighting,</b> and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that {{it was observed that}} he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.|$|E
