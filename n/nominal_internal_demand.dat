40|$|<b>Nominal</b> <b>Internal</b> and External Topic and Focus: Evidence from Mandarin Taking the Cartographic Approach, I {{argue that}} the left {{periphery}} of nominals in Mandarin (i. e., the domain before demonstrative) has properties similar to the split-CP domain proposed by Rizzi (1997). In addition, I {{argue that the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>internal</b> domain (i. e., under demonstrative but outside of NP) encodes information structure in a way similar to the sentence-internal Topic and Focus that has been put forth in the literature. In this paper, I show that identifying Topic and Focus within a nominal at such two distinct domains helps to explain various so-called “reordering ” and extraction phenomena affecting nominal elements, their interpretation, and their associated discourse functions. The result of this paper supports the parallelisms between noun phrases and clauses and it provides a new perspective to evaluate such theoretical implication, that is, the interaction between syntax and information structure...|$|R
50|$|Coping {{responses}} {{are the product}} of a person processing external or <b>internal</b> <b>demands</b> that can drain a person’s mental or physical resources (Foulton, 1982). External demands could be need for warmth, chores around the house or job, and cleanliness. <b>Internal</b> <b>demands</b> could be hunger, happiness, and control over environment. There are two parts to coping responses: first is the process of coping responses and second is the relationship between the person and outside forces.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSynchronization of EEG alpha {{activity}} has {{been referred to}} as being indicative of cortical idling, but according to more recent evidence it has also been associated with active internal processing and creative thinking. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate to what extent EEG alpha synchronization is related to <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands</b> and to specific cognitive process involved in creative thinking. To this end, EEG was measured during a convergent and a divergent thinking task (i. e., creativity-related task) which once were processed involving low and once involving high <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands.</b> High <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands</b> were established by masking the stimulus (after encoding) and thus preventing further bottom-up processing. Frontal alpha synchronization was observed during convergent and divergent thinking only under exclusive top-down control (high <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands),</b> but not when bottom-up processing was allowed (low <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands).</b> We conclude that frontal alpha synchronization is related to top-down control rather than to specific creativity-related cognitive processes. Frontal alpha synchronization, which has been observed in a variety of different creativity tasks, thus may not reflect a brain state that is specific for creative cognition but can probably be attributed to high <b>internal</b> processing <b>demands</b> which are typically involved in creative thinking...|$|R

The research underlines the fact that, starting with the mid-September 2008, the macroeconomic landscape of the analyzed countries changed radically, registering a decrease of the economic activities determined both by a diminished export activity and by a reduced <b>internal</b> <b>demand,</b> with effects on the firms’ profitability and on the deterioration of the labour market situation. The results show that the severity of the financial global crisis effects was different in the analyzed countries, as a response to various “paths” of economic development, with less or more important vulnerabilities, with differences in {{the extent to which the}} economies are based on external demand and on credit activity induced from abroad. The countries that are suffering the deepest recessions are those that registered not only a decline of exports, but also a collapse of the <b>internal</b> <b>demand,</b> as a result of stopping the credit activities that were a support for the <b>internal</b> <b>demand.</b> economic growth; global financial crisis; external demand; consumption...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relation}} between university management and open access scholarly publishing in Sweden. Open access is generally promoted in Swedish national research policy, referring to internationally adopted recommendations on free access to knowledge by researchers and citizens alike. In principle, the conditions for universities to not only promote but also actively contribute to open access by hosting open access scholarly journals could therefore be deemed adequate. In reality, however, many universities choose to adapt only to external systems of assessment and disregard <b>internal</b> <b>demands</b> from the research community. Since hosting open access scholarly journals is not favored by existing external systems of assessment, university management that does not also act on <b>internal</b> <b>demands</b> from the research community {{runs the risk of}} becoming an obstacle rather than an enabler of open access scholarly publishing...|$|R

30|$|This {{process has}} left Spain {{with a massive}} debt {{overhang}} problem: as of 2014 Q 1 Spain’s {{net international investment position}} is a negative trillion euros. This creates a binding constraint as {{it is difficult to see}} how Spain’s traditional growth model based on expansion of the <b>internal</b> <b>demand,</b> which typically translates into a deteriorating current account balance, can be operational this time given Spain’s limited capacity to add liabilities against the rest of the world. Given the obvious challenges associated with restructuring Spain’s external (and internal) liabilities and the grim prospects of debt monetization, it seems that the country is heading towards a sustained period of current account surpluses through repression of <b>internal</b> <b>demand,</b> while a new growth model is put in place. Indeed, for the first time in more than three decades Spain had a positive current account balance in 2013.|$|R
