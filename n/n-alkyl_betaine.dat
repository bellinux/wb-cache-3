40|$|For {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a steady growth of {{interest}} in the use of superficially porous particles with a solid core and a porous shell (also known as fused core, core-shell or porous shell) for fast and highly efficient separation of low molecular weight solutes to large and complex analytes, while avoiding excessive back pressure. In this work, four different sub- 2 µm thin shell particles were synthesised by the seeded growth method: Three with shell thickness of 50 nm were designated as TS 1. 5 - 50 (solid core 1. 4 µm), TS 1. 7 - 50 (solid core 1. 6 µm) and TS 1. 9 - 50 (solid core 1. 8 µm); and the fourth with 100 nm shell layer as TS 1. 7 - 100 (solid core 1. 5 µm). A sub- 2 µm core shell particle (solid core 1. 4 µm, 150 nm shell layer) was also synthesised for comparison and designated as EiS 1. 7 - 150. All the unmodified shell particles were characterised by SEM, TEM, DLS (dynamic light scattering) and BET analyses. The thin shell particles TS 1. 5 - 50, TS 1. 7 - 50 and TS 1. 9 - 50, including the core shell particle EiS 1. 7 - 150 were chemically functionalised with C 18 ligand. A new zwitterionic <b>N-alkyl</b> <b>betaine</b> stationary phase containing quaternary ammonium ion and carboxylate ion groups was also functionalised on a 3. 0 µm porous silica particle (ExsilTM pure) by silane chemistry and further quaternisation with sodium chloroacetate for HILIC separation of polar analytes. All bonded phase materials were characterised by microanalysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The bonded thin shell and core shell particles were slurry packed in narrow bore columns (2. 1 mm ID x 50 mm) and labelled as TS 1. 5 - 50 -C 18, TS 1. 7 - 50 -C 18, TS 1. 9 - 50 -C 18 and EiS 1. 7 - 150 -C 18 respectively. Kinetic studies performed on the bonded thin shell columns using naphthalene and 55 % acetonitrile in water yielded retention coefficients in the range 1. 26 - 1. 35 and 5. 6 for the core-shell particle and minimum reduced plate height range from 3. 89 - 4. 26 for the thin-shell particles and 2. 03 for the core-shell particle. The unmodified TS 1. 7 - 100 particle packed in 4. 6 mm ID x 100 mm column was applied as a HILIC stationary phase for rapid determination (< 1 min) of uric acid and creatinine in human urine samples giving calculated concentrations in the range 782 - 1206 µg/mL and 535 - 862 µg/mL respectively. Percentage recoveries of uric acid and creatinine were evaluated between 86. 7 - 92. 1 % and 92. 7 - 94. 3 % and the limit of detection (LoD) at 0. 03 µg/ml and 0. 05 µg/ml respectively. The resulting <b>N-alkyl</b> <b>betaine</b> bonded material packed in 4. 6 mm ID x 100 mm column and labelled as Nab-HILIC was investigated for HILIC selectivity characteristics using the Tanaka testing method and the results revealed close selectivity properties with the commercially available ZIC®-HILIC column containing sulfobetaine stationary phase. The effects of pH, buffer concentration and organic solvent composition changes on retention and selectivity were investigated using anionic, cationic and zwitterionic analytes to decipher the retention mechanisms of different polar analytes on the new stationary phase using HILIC mode. Nab-HILIC column evaluation and measurement of nonreduced HETP using homovanillic acid (HVA), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and cytosine (CS) was performed with resulting retention coefficients of 0. 52, 0. 93 and 1. 53 respectively and non-reduced HETP (H) of 5. 8, 9. 1 and 6. 7 respectively compared to 14. 2, 4. 3 and 4. 7 for ZIC®-HILIC column...|$|E
40|$|An underbalanced {{drilling}} using foam {{drilling fluid}} {{is one of}} the most effective solutions which are capable of preventing formation damage, differential sticking, or circulation lost. Nevertheless, the limitation of using foam drilling fluid is the stability of its rheological properties which would affect its lubricity characteristics. Therefore, a research study was carried out to determine the stability and effectiveness of water soluble polymers as an additive in foam drilling fluid. To produce the required and most stable foam, four types of surfactants had been tested, namely sodium dodecyl sulfate (anionic), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (cationic), T× 100 (non ionic), and <b>n-alkyl</b> <b>betaines</b> (amphoteric). Then, the water soluble polymers, namely xanthan gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, and carboxymethyl cellulose, were evaluated as a stabilizer in the said foam drilling fluid. The laboratory works involved lubricity and rheological properties tests, which were conducted at ambient condition. The experimental results showed that the use of xanthan gum with anionic surfactant produced the most stable foam drilling fluid compared to other polymers. Rheological properties of the polymer foam drilling fluid were compared with water-based mud, and it was revealed that polymer foam drilling fluid could perform as effective as the latter. The significant advantage of using polymer foam drilling fluid was its coefficient of friction which was found to be lower than the water-based mud...|$|R
