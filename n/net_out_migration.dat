40|$|Migration is a {{universal}} phenomenon. From time immemorial women and men have travelled in search of better living. Historical nomadic instinct of man had been in tune with his necessities – more endurable climate, adequate water supply, fertile land and general availability of resources have attracted the human being always. It is expected that with development migration of due to Push factors will decrease while that due to Pull factors will increase. One of the important facets of labour market is therefore the profile of migrant workers {{and the nature of}} their movements. In spite of extensive work on migration in Indian context, recent studies on migration in India have focussed mainly on rural-urban migration or on migration from/between specific regions. The present paper explores the post reform nature of migration in India with special focus on migrant workers. Types of movement, profile of migrants vis-a-vis the natives, occupational distribution, and wages received by them have been examined. This has been contrasted with the pre-reform situation. Whether wage setting process is different for migrants is also examined through estimation of the wage function. Results suggest that migration among males are more of an ‘assured’ type rather than a ‘search’ type, in response to regular wage employment, where the better endowed / skilled / trained are moving. Pull factors are definitely playing more important role than push factors in this regard, though in post-reform period push factors have strengthened. Though better-off states with lower incidence of poverty and higher per capita income have higher migration rates, <b>net</b> <b>out</b> <b>migration</b> rates are considerably higher for poorer states indicating that condition of the source region is perhaps {{the most important factor in}} migration decisions. ...|$|E
40|$|During the 1930 s {{the federal}} {{government}} embarked upon an ambitious series of grant programs designed to counteract the Great Depression. Public works and relief programs combated unemployment by hiring workers and building social overhead capital while the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) sought to raise farm incomes by paying farmers not to produce. The amounts distributed varied widely {{across the country and}} potentially contributed to population shifts. We examine the extent to which New Deal spending affected domestic migration patterns {{in the second half of}} the 1930 s. We estimate an aggregate discrete choice model, in which household heads choose among 466 economic subregions.

40|$|Different {{regions are}} endowed with {{production}} factors and characteristics that offer different opportunities for specialization, {{which can be}} transform to a regional comparative advantage. Many outlying regions (peripheral regions) suffer from {{a high rate of}} unemployment, low level of per capita income and <b>net</b> <b>out</b> <b>migration.</b> Outlying areas attract less investment in comparison to central regions. This is because of the low marginal productivity of factors of production in the outlying areas. In order to alleviate these hardships, inflicted on outlying regions, central governments often devise incentive and investment programs whose main objective is to reduce the gap between regions in the country and thus reduce regional inequalities. To attract high tech industries to outlaying regions is now in vogue. In reality we observe a distinct geographical distribution between centers of R&D and large mass production plants. This is due primarily to agglomeration economies and industrial cluster in central regions. Mass production, because of their needs for a large number of relatively unskilled labors gravitates towards the edge of Metropolitan regions and the outlying areas. But then their contribution to the wellbeing of the population in these regions is limited. Public/private investment in large scale facilities (or infrastructures), like highways and railways, Technological Incubators, R&D Centers, universities and hospitals, are among the projects proposed in order to facilitates economic growth in outlying areas. However investing in these projects is not necessarily the panacea for outlaying areas. Because of scarce resources it is paramount to select the most cost-effective program which will take into account the profile of the region under consideration, its natural endowments, and the administrative and political structure of the local government and its ability, together with the region's population, to turn the chosen program to a success. In this paper we critically discuss the spatial implications of selected public investment programs design to facilitate the development of peripheral regions. ...|$|E
40|$|An initial {{reaction}} among many observers of urban America to recently released data showing a <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>out</b> of its metropolitan areas {{is that this}} phenomenon must reflect {{nothing more than an}} accelerated expansion of these areas beyond their conventionally defined borders. This paper tests this hypothesis by tracing out the behavior of the Hoover index for five levels of areal disaggregation in the US. In Statistical Geography, Duncan and his collaborators found that for the period 1900 - 1950 there was dispersal at the finest and coarsest grains of areal disaggregation (reflecting city - suburb and East - West dispersal, respectively) and concentration at intermediate grains (reflecting rural - urban migration). We find that, by 1970, dispersal was occurring at all levels of areal disaggregation. That is, using the county as our basic unit of analysis, and building up increasingly more aggregated regions based on these units, we are unable to find an increase in concentration at any level of areal aggregation. We conclude that dispersal is more than a statistical artifact {{of the way in which}} metropolitan areas are defined. ...|$|R
40|$|This study models {{population}} {{in the state of}} Arkansas using a small econometric model, and is similar to a previous demographic model developed by Fullerton and Barraza de Anda (2008). The components of population change consist of births, deaths, and net migration. Births minus deaths equal natural increase, and {{population in}} the current period is population from the previous period plus natural increase plus net migration. Births and deaths are modeled as functions of a one period autoregressive lag as well as national trends. Net migration is also modeled as a one period lag of itself in addition to relative labor market conditions. Results confirm that births and deaths contain strong inertial components. National trends positively affect births and deaths as well. Net migration also contains a strong inertial component. Additionally, relative labor market conditions also influence migration. Specifically, if employment in Arkansas increases relative {{to the rest of the}} country, Arkansas will experience positive <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> <b>Out</b> of sample simulations are conducted in order to further test model validity. Simulation results are reasonable and follow recent trends. Natural increase and net migration are expected to decrease. Accordingly, population growth is expected to slow down. Experimentation with alternate specifications in addition to using different assumed growth rates for the exogenous variables is suggested. Furthermore, modeling population in nearby regions may assist in confirming, or rejecting, the results obtained in this study. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{pointed out}} in this article, small island economies are diverse in their nature and in the {{challenges}} they face. A taxonomy of these economies is provided. The overview takes account of small island economies that are satellites of large countries {{as well as those}} which are independent nation states. Nevertheless, the emphasis here is on small island economies that are remote from central economies or disadvantaged in other ways. These include many island nations in the Pacific and elsewhere. Such economies suffer from diseconomies of scale in economic activity, are prone to imperfect market competition, and experience high transport and trading costs {{for a variety of reasons}} which are outlined. The gravitational pull of stronger central economies and central places favours <b>net</b> <b>out</b> <b>migration</b> from these economies, particularly a brain drain, as well as net private capital outflows. These tendencies often stifle local economic development. Such economies frequently depend on aid from foreign or overseas places for maintaining the levels of income of their inhabitants; income levels which in many cases are relatively low. Income levels may be precarious in such economies because they are vulnerable to variations in economic, natural and political forces. They usually lack diversity in their natural resources and in their exports. A natural disaster can devastate their whole island economy so that little resilience remains to deal with the disaster by relying on the island’s own resources. Whether or not such economies are particularly prone to political disturbances is unclear, but when such disturbances occur they tend to impoverish those areas because net migration and net capital outflows increase and inbound tourism (which is often an important source of income for such economies) dwindles. The environmental situation facing small island economies varies. Some have undergone rapid urbanisation and centralization of their populations and this has caused significant pollution problems and water availability problems. Furthermore, some are at considerable risk from climate change. Using mathematical relationships, it is demonstrated that small island nations will lose (on average) proportionately more of their land mass as a result of sea-level rises than larger nations. Increased urbanisation of such economies usually increases their economic vulnerability because it is normally associated with greater dependence on international market exchange and results in increasing urban-bias in politics. small island economies, globalisation, Pacific, International Development, International Relations/Trade, Political Economy,...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{regional}} policy nowadays {{is an important}} subject in the European institutions, the involvement of regional and local authorities in the programming, management, evaluation and monitoring of operations {{is essential for the}} success of EU level policy. A Regional Problem is defined as a problem that arises in an area of a country where there is dependence on a narrow industrial base often faced with declining manufacturing activity, and lack of general infrastructures. Other challenges include low levels of GDP and a <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>out</b> of a country or region. The EU is trying to overcome these challenges by using the Structural funds financing programs to help firms in these regions. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the innovation policy and the industrial policy at the national and regional levels in Ireland and Finland, over the 1990 s. In both countries the period from 1991 - 99 was marked by expansion, as measured by steady output growth for manufacturing as a whole (albeit at substantially lower levels in Finland than in Ireland). In general, the evidence presented in this paper suggests a positive relationship between innovation policy as reflected in financial support to firms for R&D and business level investment in R&D and innovation activity. R&D financial assistance to firms has been a significant feature of the industrial development policy in Ireland since the 1980 s. At the same time, the proportion of manufacturing firms undertaking R&D, product and process innovations increased steadily throughout the 1990 s. In Ireland the construction industry boosted economic development as foreign businesses could find favourable conditions for setting up their businesses. Initially tax and grant incentives were given to firms which were later on complemented by high killed labour that could be utilized in high tech businesses. zeqavete@gmail. com khanomair 82 @gmail. co...|$|R
