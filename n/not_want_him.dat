5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E

In 2009, after performing to an enthusiastic crowd in Bolivia, A.B. decided to continue recording music.|$|E

50|$|Jorge Rodríguez-Gerada immigrated {{with his}} family from Cuba to the US in 1970, to settle in North Plainfield, New Jersey. It wasn’t until his twenties that he {{realized}} that the move was because his parents had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> and his two elder brothers to grow up under the then newly implemented system of control in Cuba. His father spent three years cutting sugar cane in order to gain visas.|$|R

5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle. As a result, {{he was invited to}} his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined his}} {{hometown}} football club, AIK Bačka Topola, as a youngster, and graduated {{to the senior}} side in 1998–99. He began as a centre back, but soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending. Žigić's parents did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> to take football seriously until he completed his education, and he remained with AIK Bačka Topola until 2001, scoring 68 goals in 76 matches in the Serbian League Vojvodina, the third level of Yugoslav football. When military service took him to Bar, {{he was able to}} play for the local club, Mornar, for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 2001–02 Second League of FR Yugoslavia. After trials in France with Saint-Étienne and Créteil came to nothing, Žigić returned home where he played 8 matches for third-tier club Kolubara, scoring 3 goals.|$|E

Hunter Bell had witnessed one of her meetings with Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) and Nicky, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> to expose her, she killed him. Jered witnessed the murder and now that the dead body was found, Nicky killed her too so she will not talk.|$|R

5|$|In 1933, {{the physics}} {{department}} at Cornell {{was looking for}} a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with Nevill Mott at the University of Bristol for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935. Before leaving for the United States, he visited the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen in September 1934, where he proposed to Hilde Levi, who accepted. However, the match was opposed by Bethe's mother, who did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> marrying a Jewish girl, despite being Jewish herself, and Bethe broke off their engagement a few days before their wedding date in December. Niels Bohr and James Franck were so shocked by Bethe's behavior that he was not invited to the Institute again until after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert she did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert {{is in love with}} him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment {{not only on}} the team, but in the entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him,</b> and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E
50|$|The {{photos of}} the couple add to Ruth's sense of isolation, and she decides {{to work in the}} tunnel as a nurse.

Heartbroken at her unexplained departure, McAllan throws himself into the project, alienating Robbins in the process.|$|R

"Why, Mr. Balfour," [...] replied Alan, [...] "by {{all that}} I could hear, {{there were two}} ways of it: either ye liked David and would pay to get him back; or else ye had very good reasons for <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him,</b> and would pay for us to keep him.

25|$|Scopes never testified {{since there}} was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution.

25|$|Roommate {{conflicts}} {{inside the}} residential dorms {{can lead to}} active bullying. In fall 2012, a Rutgers University student committed suicide after his roommate had been filming him and his boyfriend engaging in sexual activities and posted the video online for all to see. The roommate said he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> dead, but wanted his friends {{to know he was}} disgusted by his behavior.|$|E

50|$|Fielding was a {{standout}} sprinter for Metuchen High School in Metuchen, New Jersey. Fielding's speed {{was such that}} the Metuchen athletic director steered <b>him</b> toward track, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> to get hurt playing football. He soon became a statewide success and {{was followed by the}} state's largest newspaper, the Newark Star Ledger. Fielding ran the 40 yard dash in 4.2 seconds, a United States schoolboy record at the time, the 100 yard dash in a wind-assisted 9.2 seconds, and the 220 yard sprint in under 21 seconds.|$|R
25|$|Twain {{moved his}} family to Hartford, Connecticut, where he {{arranged}} {{the building of a}} home starting in 1873.

In 1874, Susan had a study built apart from the main house so that Twain would have a quiet place in which to write. Also, he smoked cigars constantly, and Susan did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> to do so in her house.|$|E
25|$|The infighting in Los Zetas {{referred}} to confrontations between two factions in that criminal organization, Mexico's most violent, one led by Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, alias El Lazca {{and the other}} led by Miguel Treviño Morales, alias Z-40. The rumors of the split appeared in mid-2012, when public banners and music videos on the web alleged betrayals between the two leaders. After the death of Lazcano {{it was confirmed that}} the leaders were not confronting each other, but rather that some men within Morales' faction did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> as leader.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, Anthony {{spoke to}} Japanese rock {{magazine}} Burrn!, claiming the brothers did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> on the 2004 reunion tour, although Hagar did (and would not play without Anthony), {{but he had}} to agree to reduced royalties and end absolutely all association with the band after the tour in terms of rights to using the name to promote himself.

5000|$|Smurthwaite {{invested}} £500,000 {{into the}} playing budget {{in order to}} help Micky Adams strengthen the squad. Despite <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> to resign, once Adams left the club Smurthwaite initiated a policy of experimenting with young players in the hope of turning a profit from player sales in the future. Smurthwaite did cause controversy however by telling a reporter that supporters who only attended away matches (due partly to Vale Park's high ticket costs) [...] "disgusted" [...] him and that they should [...] "go and support another club".|$|R

This conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal. During the preliminary stages of a retrial Mr Justice Mitchell, the trial judge, ruled that there was [...] "no foundation for a manslaughter case", and, consequently, Van Hoogstraten was formally acquitted.|$|R
60|$|But {{the worst}} of her ways was about powder, and her <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> to have it, or <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> to have it where there was fire. She would never let him come near the stove with it, {{after one of the}} fellows had tried to dry his powder on the stove when it had got wet from being pumped on in his jacket-pocket while he was {{drinking}} at the pump, and the fellow forgot to take it off the stove quick enough, and it almost blew his mother up, and did pretty nearly scare her to death; and she would not let him keep it in a bottle, or anything, but just loose in a paper, because another of the fellows had begun to pour powder once from a bottle onto a coal of fire, and the fire ran up the powder, and blew the bottle to pieces, and filled the fellow's face so full of broken glass that the doctor was nearly the whole of that Fourth of July night getting it out. So, although she was a good mother in some things, she was a bad mother in others, and these were the great things; and they were what gave him the right to run off.|$|R
