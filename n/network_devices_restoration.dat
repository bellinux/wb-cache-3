40|$|MasterDesktop environment’s {{mobility}} {{is enabled}} {{by the development}} of mobile devices and virtualization technology. Thus users can use their desktop anywherehowever, desktop mobility has some drawbacks like lack of I/O devices. For instance, mobile devices have small screen and inconvenient input devices. Desktop virtualization solutions only use basic devices virtualized by VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor). So it is needed to extend I/O devices in such environments. This problem can be solved to allocate <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> to user’s desktop dynamically. But users must know <b>network</b> <b>device’s</b> address and driver s/w to use the devices. It isn’t proper solution in a dynamically changing environment. Thus, new device virtualization layer is required to support desktop mobility. The device virtualization layer must manage <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> dynamically and has extensibility for new <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> In addition, the device virtualization should support that a desktop which want to use <b>network</b> <b>device</b> can access device virtualization layer without additional work. In this paper, we propose new device virtualization layer which satisfy above requirements. The device virtualization layer has new management protocol about allocation and management of <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> Thanks to the protocol, the user can allocate and de-allocate a <b>network</b> <b>device</b> dynamically. In addition, device virtualization layer can be accessed through a web browser. So users don’t need any early action to use the <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> Finally, device virtualization layer adopts a way that <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> supply their drivers. Because of the way, parts to be modified in the existing <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> could be minimized, and new <b>network</b> <b>device</b> can easily support device virtualization layer...|$|R

40|$|Distributed Large-Volume Metrology (LVM) {{systems are}} mainly used for {{industrial}} applications concerning assembly and dimensional verification of large-sized objects. These systems generally {{consist of a}} set of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> distributed around the measurement volume, and some targets to be localized, in contact with the measured object's surface or mounted on a hand-held probe for measuring the points of interest. Target localization is carried out through several approaches, which use angular and/or distance measurements by <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper presents a new methodology to support the design of <b>networks</b> of <b>devices</b> for distributed LVM systems based on triangulation (i. e., systems in which <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> perform angular measurements only). It is assumed that these systems use multi-sensor networks including two typologies of devices: some are accurate but expensive and other ones are less accurate but cheaper. The goal of the methodology is establishing a link between the following parameters: (i) density of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> (ii) mix between the two typologies of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> (iii) measurement uncertainty, and (iv) cost. The methodology allows to estimate the most appropriate density and mix between the two typologies of <b>network</b> <b>devices,</b> so that the distributed LVM system is conforming with the required measurement uncertainty and cost. The methodology relies on a large number of simulated experiments, defined and implemented using a dedicated routine; feasibility and practicality is tested by preliminary experiments on a multi-sensor photogrammetric system, developed at Politecnico di Torino - DIGEP...|$|R
