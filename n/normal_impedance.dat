40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{indicated}} that the acoustical behavior of partially reticulated noise control foams can be sensitive to small mounting details. It is thus reasonable to expect that the surface <b>normal</b> <b>impedance</b> of a foam sample placed in a standing wave tube {{will depend on the}} degree to which the sample is constrained at its edges. Here a two-dimensional version of the Biot theory governing wave propagation in elastic porous materials has been used to investigate the effect of such an edge constraint. First, the allowed modes of propagation within a constrained foam layer were identified. Those modes were then used to predict the response of the constrained layer to an incident plane wave. A comparison of that prediction with the surface <b>normal</b> <b>impedance</b> of an unconstrained half-space of the same material has shown that the principal effect of the edge constraints is to stiffen the sample at frequencies below the cut on of the first shearing mode within the constrained layer.

40|$|Abstract. The {{eigenfrequencies}} and {{the optimal}} driving frequencies for flux tubes embedded in uniform but wave-carrying surroundings are calculated, based on matching conditions formulated {{in terms of}} the <b>normal</b> acoustic <b>impedances</b> at the flux tube boundary. The requirement of the equality of the <b>normal</b> acoustic <b>impedance</b> of the transmitted wave field with the <b>normal</b> acoustic <b>impedance</b> of the outgoing wave field selects the eigenmodes, while the equality of the ingoing and the transmitted <b>normal</b> acoustic <b>impedance</b> selects the optimal driving frequencies (Keppens 1996). Even if the flux tube is uniform, the eigenfrequencies can be complex due to leakage of wave energy into the surroundings. The case of uniform flux tubes has been considered previously (e. g. Cally 1986), and serves as a testcase of our formalism. We extend Cally’s results by taking a radial stratification of the flux tube into account. The non-uniformity of the flux tube can introduce another cause for energy loss, namely resonant absorption internal to the flux tube. When resonant absorption occurs, we must incorporate the appropriate jump conditions over the dissipative layer(s). This can be done using a simple numerical scheme as introduced by Stenuit et al.

The aeroacoustic environment is assumed to contain forward and backward-traveling acoustic waves, consisting of multiple modes, and uniform mean flow.

The Single Mode Method assumes that the sound pressure level and phase decay rates of a single progressive mode can be extracted from this measured complex acoustic pressure profile.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a process to predict noise field interior to the ejector and in the farfield for any liner design for a mixer-ejector of arbitrary scale factor. However, a number of assumptions, not verified for the current application, utilized in this process, introduce uncertainties in the final result, especially, on a quantitative basis. The <b>normal</b> <b>impedance</b> model for bulk with perforated facesheet is based on homogeneous foam materials of low resistivity. The impact of flow conditions for HSCT application {{as well as the}} impact of perforated facesheet on predicted impedance is not properly accounted. Based on the measured <b>normal</b> <b>impedance</b> for deeper bulk samples (i. e., 2. 0 in.) the predicted reactance is much higher compared to the data at frequencies above 2 kHz for T-foam and 200 ppi SiC. The resistance is under predicted at lower frequencies (below 4 kHz) for these samples. Thus, the use of such predicted data in acoustic suppression is likely to introduce inaccuracies. It {{should be noted that the}} impedance prediction methods developed recently under liner technology program are not utilized in the studies described in this report due to the program closeout. Acoustic suppression prediction is based on the uniform flow and temperature conditions in a two-sided treated constant area rectangular duct. In addition, assumptions of equal energy per mode noise field and interaction of all frequencies with the treated surface for the entire ejector length may not be accurate. While, the use of acoustic transfer factor minimizes the inaccuracies associated with the prediction for a known test case, the assumption of the same factor for other liner designs and with different linear scale factor ejectors seems to be very optimistic. As illustrated in appendix D that the predicted noise suppression for LSM- 1 is lower compared to the measured data is an indication of the above argument. However, the process seems to be more reliable when used for the same scale models for different liner designs as demonstrated for Gen. 1 mixer-ejectors...|$|E
