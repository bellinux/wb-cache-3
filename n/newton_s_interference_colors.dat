40|$|Abstract. The study {{describes}} the <b>interference</b> <b>color</b> of anodic TiO 2 nanotube arrays on titanium foil. TiO 2 nanotube arrays are prepared by oxidizing titanium foil {{in an aqueous}} electrolyte solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF, 0. 5 wt. %). The morphologies of the oxide film are characterized by FESEM. The empirical color properties are obtained using the L*a*b * system. The different <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> of oxidized Ti samples are obtained depending on the anodization time. The anodization time clearly indicates a strong effect on the reflectance at the visible wavelength region, thus confirming the observed color differences. Consequently, the <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> can be controlled by the anodization time. By observing the coloration of Ti during the anodization, the <b>interference</b> <b>colors</b> can be utilized to identify the thickness of oxide layer {{and the formation of}} nanotubes on Ti sheet...|$|R

Triad twinning is the intergrowth of three orthorhombic crystals that turn at their center and form hexagonally shaped crystals. Nyerereite is biaxial negative, and has a 2v of 29 degrees.

40|$|A recent {{paper by}} Erik Verlinde [1] argues that gravity {{should be viewed}} not as a {{fundamental}} force, but as an emergent thermodynamic phenomenon due to some yet undetermined microscopic theory. Using well-established thermodynamic principles along with the holographic principle, Verlinde proposes that gravity {{can be seen as}} an entropic force as opposed to a fundamental one. Using this idea, Verlinde claims to be able to derive <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> 2 nd law, <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> law of universal gravitation, and Einstein gravity. We present a challenge to this reformulation of gravity. Our contention is that a detailed examination of Verlinde s argument shows that such a theory cannot correctly give <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> laws or Einstein gravity. We find that the Poisson equation for Newtonian gravity is not uniquely determined using Verlinde s theory. We are also able to show that Verlinde s theory does not uniquely determine Einstein s field equations. Specific calculations can also be done in the Reissner-Nordstrom and Schwarzschild metrics to show that the entropy of these black holes do not agree with accepted values of these entropies. _x 000 D_We will begin by introducing results by Hawking, Unruh, and Bekenstein that motivate the relationship between gravity and thermodynamics. We then summarize Verlinde s proposal of gravity being a thermodynamic phenomenon. From this new theory, we can make calculations using the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics to determine if Verlinde s theory is compatible with well-known calculations for the temperature and entropy of black holes with these metrics. Finally, we will present a detailed explanation as to why we believe Verlinde s derivation of the Poisson equation and Einstein s field equations is flawed...|$|R

However, the oxide layer on tungsten cannot reach as great a thickness. Hafnium does not anodize {{in the same way}} as zirconium but is similar to tantalum. By measuring the <b>interference</b> <b>color</b> and capacitative thicknesses on zirconium (Grades I and III) and a 2. 5 wt. % tin ailoy, the film was found to grow less rapidly in terms of capacitance than in terms of iaterference colors. This was interpreted to mean that cracks develop in the oxide as it thickens. The effect was most pronounced on Grade III zirconium and least pronounced on the tin alloy. The reduction in capacitative thickness was especially noticeable when white oxide appeared. Comparative measurements on Grade I zirconium and 2. 5 wt. % tin alloy indicated that the thickness of the oxide film on the tin alloy (after 16 hours in water) increased more rapidly with temperature than the film on zirconium. Tin is believed to act in ways to counteract the tendency of the oxide to form cracks, and to produce vacancies which promote ionic diffusion. (auth...|$|R
40|$|At {{equilibrium}} {{thin films}} of symmetric diblock copolymers exhibit a morphology where the lamellar microdomains are oriented {{parallel to the}} external surfaces.
