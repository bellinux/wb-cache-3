Currently, clinically available small-molecule inhibitors targeting STAT 3 are lacking. Here, we report that <b>nifuratel,</b> an antiprotozoal and antifungal drug, is a potent inhibitor of STAT 3. We found that <b>nifuratel</b> significantly suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Studies of the mechanism of action of <b>nifuratel</b> indicated that it acts by inhibiting the constitutive and interleukin- 6 -induced STAT 3 activation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that <b>nifuratel</b> may be a novel, clinically accessible STAT 3 inhibitor in gastric cancer cells.

40|$|Bacterial vaginosis is {{characterized}} by a shift of the physiological flora to a diverse spectrum of bacteria, where Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae are the most important markers. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of <b>nifuratel</b> against G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and lactobacilli was compared with that of the two currently used antibiotics metronidazole and clindamycin. Results suggest that <b>nifuratel</b> has a better spectrum of activity, being highly active against G. vaginalis and A. vaginae without affecting lactobacilli...|$|E
40|$|As {{bacterial}} vaginosis (BV) {{is a potential}} cause of obstetric complications and gynecological disorders, there is substantial interest in establishing the most effective treatment. Standard treatment - metronidazole or clindamycin, by either vaginal or oral route – is followed by relapses in about 30 % of cases, within a month from treatment completion. This inability to prevent recurrences reflects our lack of knowledge {{on the origins of}} BV. Atopobium vaginae has been recently reported to be associated with BV in around 80 % of the cases and might be involved in the therapeutic failures. This review looks at the potential benefits of <b>nifuratel</b> against A. vaginae compared to the standard treatments with metronidazole and clindamycin. In vitro, <b>nifuratel</b> is able to inhibit the growth of A. vaginae, with a MIC range of 0. 125 - 1 µg/mL; it is active against G. vaginalis and does not affect lactobacilli. Metronidazole is active against A. vaginae only at very high concentrations (8 - 256 µg/mL); it is partially active against G. vaginalis and also has no effect on lactobacilli. Clindamycin acts against A. vaginae with an MIC lower than 0. 125 µg/mL and is active on G. vaginalis but it also affects lactobacilli, altering the vaginal environment. These observations suggest that <b>nifuratel</b> is probably the most valid therapeutic agent for BV treatment...|$|E
40|$|A test {{included}} 40 {{women in}} the reproductive age with clinical symptoms of vaginitis and microbiologycal examination.

40|$|The minimum {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} <b>nifuratel</b> for 205 randomly selected isolates from urinary tract infections were tested by tube dilution. Of these, 177 (86 · 3 %) were resistant {{to more than}} 6 μg/ml and 140 of 141 (99 · 3 %) strains of Escherichia coli were resistant to more than 3 μg/ml. Urine levels of <b>nifuratel</b> were examined in two groups: one group had 400 mg given once and the other group had 2 g given over 24 hours. In both groups samples of urine were collected every hour for seven hours after the last dose. After one 400 -mg dose the maximum urine level achieved by any subject was 2 · 0 μg/ml and the mean maximum level was 0 · 75 μg/ml.

40|$|Prompted by the {{sensitivity}} of trichomonads to metronidazole and <b>nifuratel</b> in clinical practice, a {{study was conducted in}} 1971 - 1972 of 63 consecutive strains of Trichomonas vaginalis isolated from women with clinically refractory vaginal discharge. Their susceptibility to metronidazole, tinidazole, and <b>nifuratel</b> was tested, using a serial tube dilution technique. The minimum concentrations which in 48 hrs caused immobilization and lysis of trichomonads cultured in Diamond's medium was assessed. No differences in drug potency could be determined. The median trichomonistatic and trichomonicidal concentrations were 0 - 1 and 0 - 6 mug/ml. respectively when using an inoculum of 10, 000 organisms per ml. An inoculum of 100, 000 per ml. resulted in inhibitory concentrations of 1 - 0 and killing concentrations of 3 - 3 mug. /ml. These levels are readily attained in blood and vaginal tissue after oral ingestion of the two imidazole derivatives. Thus, metronidazole has maintained its efficacy since it was first introduced more than a decade ago. The few therapeutic failures with metronidazole and tinidazole are considered to have been caused by pharmacokinetic deficiencies in the patients, or by re-infection...|$|E

40|$|According to the WHO, {{giardiasis}} {{incidence rate}} in {{children in the}} world is 15 to 20 %. In Russia, over 130, 000 cases of giardiasis are registered annually, of which children under 14 years account for more than 70 %. The study of 124 children with giardiasis conducted by the authors has shown that giardiasis in children always triggers development of chronic duodenitis, in 55 % of cases that coupled with lymphostasis, in 45 % — that with atrophy of duodenum mucous lining. In 40 % of cases, chronic duodenitis with giardiasis is accompanied with duodenogastric reflux, in 88 % — with development of lactase deficiency, in 81 % — by functional biliary system distress and in all cases with intestinal tract microbiocenosis distress. Along with clinical manifestations of the disease, the researchers have studied immunological modifications in children with giardiasis, and have evaluated the information content of various diagnostic techniques, efficiency of medication. The authors have demonstrated that mono therapy with any of anti giardiasis drugs (metronidazole, <b>nifuratel,</b> albendozole) has low efficiency.

40|$|Background: Medical {{misuse of}} {{antibiotics}} {{is associated with}} the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance, resulting in a lack of effective drugs and increased health-care cost. Nevertheless, inappropriate antibiotic use in China remains common and the situation requires urgent improvement. Here, we analyzed the prescriptions of antibiotics and evaluated the rationality of antibiotic use among outpatients in Beijing general hospitals during 2015. Methods: We collected basic medical insurance claim data from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 in 507 general hospitals of Beijing. A descriptive analysis of outpatient antibiotic prescribing was performed. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification/defined daily doses system was used to evaluate the rationality of antibiotic use. Results: Over the study, an estimated 721, 930, 613, 520, and 822, 480 antibiotics were dispensed in primary, secondary, and tertiary general hospitals corresponding to 5. 09 %, 5. 06 %, and 2. 53 % of all prescriptions, respectively. Antibiotic combinations represented 2. 95 %, 7. 74 %, and 10. 18 % of the total antibiotic prescriptions, respectively. Expenditure for the top twenty antibiotics in primary, secondary, and tertiary general hospitals was RMB 42. 92, 65. 89, and 83. 26 million Yuan, respectively. Cephalosporins were the most frequently prescribed class of antibiotic in clinical practice. The antibiotics used inappropriately included azithromycin enteric-coated capsules, compound cefaclor tablets and <b>nifuratel</b> nysfungin vaginal soft capsules in primary hospitals, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium dispersible tablets (7 : 1) and cefonicid sodium for injection in secondary hospitals, cefminox sodium for injection and amoxicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions: Antibiotic use in Beijing general hospitals is generally low; however, inappropriate antibiotic use still exists. Inappropriately used antibiotics should be subject to rigorous control and management, and public policy initiatives are required to promote the judicious use of antibiotics...|$|E
