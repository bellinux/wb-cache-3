5|$|As he grew older, he {{retained}} his famed elasticity but show signed of age {{in other}} areas, especially at the walk, which was his weakest skill in the dressage ring. Bonfire was retired from competition after the 2000 Olympic Games. To celebrate his retirement, there was a ceremony in Van Grunsven's home town and a farewell ride at an international jumping competition in Maastricht, Netherlands. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> she would find another horse {{as good as he}} was; however, his successor Salinero proved to be even more successful.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{groups that}} were <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} today. With highly flexible joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Prior to May 18, Kehoe had {{loaded the}} back seat of his truck with metal debris capable of {{producing}} shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought a new set of tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting the explosives. He made many trips to Lansing for more explosives, {{as well as to the}} school, town, and his house. A neighbor allegedly saw Kehoe carrying objects into the school building at night numerous times but <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to mention it to anyone.|$|E

5|$|The next day, an {{argument}} erupts between Santosh and Subramaniam {{during which the}} former becomes emotional and shouts that he has lost so many small things in life because of Subramaniam. But he preferred to stay calm as {{he does not want}} to hurt his father. Subramaniam realises his mistake and apologises to everyone saying that he always wanted to take care of his family members so well but had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that they are sacrificing a lot to make him happy.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though {{he felt he had}} retired too early, and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.|$|E

25|$|He was {{friendly}} toward them, but never let them forget the might of English weapons… Realizing {{that the very}} existence of the colony depended on peace, he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.|$|E
25|$|Sydney Newman, {{who would}} later go on to {{spearhead}} the creation of Doctor Who for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of The Avengers. In his memoir, The Avengers and Me, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to get one for The Avengers.|$|E
25|$|Nyong'o is {{involved}} in the organization Mother Health International, which is dedicated to providing relief to women and children in Uganda by creating locally engaged birthing centers. She said she’d <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much about birthing practices until her sister introduced her to MHI executive director Rachel Zaslow. Nyong'o felt bringing attention to such important but overlooked issues is a mandate for her as an artist. She was honored for her work at 2016 Variety's Power of Women.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{argue for}} the {{necessity}} of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard, who viewed belief in God as a leap of faith that sometimes directly opposed reason. This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark's presuppositional apologetics, with the exception that Clark <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also Fideism).|$|E
25|$|The Teens in Action {{program is}} built on Camp Fire's long {{tradition}} of recognizing youth {{as part of the}} solution to, and not the problem with, today’s social challenges. Working together with young people, Teens in Action strives to improve the communities where youth live, to challenge youth to learn new skills and provide leadership in areas they <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> possible. Programs of this nature inspire and honor community responsibility, contribute to the future of American volunteerism and encourage a sense of caring for others.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 2000, Lu {{was elected}} vice president. She {{was awarded the}} World Peace Corps Mission's World Peace Prize in 2001. Controversy erupted over this in Taiwan, with Lu's {{political}} opponents accusing her of vastly overstating the significance and value of that award. She was also the ROC's first elected vice president to adopt a Western first name. In her interview with TIME Asia Magazine, she said the KMT <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> they would transfer their regime to her {{on behalf of the}} freedom fighters.|$|E

25|$|In July 1945, as Soviet police ranks were {{converted}} to a military uniform system, Beria's rank was officially converted to that of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Although he had never held a traditional military command, Beria made {{a significant contribution to}} the victory of the Soviet Union in World War II through his organization of wartime production and his use of partisans. Stalin personally <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much of it, and neither commented publicly on his performance nor awarded him recognition (i.e. Order of Victory) as he did for most other Soviet Marshals.|$|E
25|$|Suho {{also stated}} that he had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about the sales numbers {{after the release of}} the album, and just wanted to bring new music to fans of the band. He said that the only thing in the members' mind whilst making the album was for the {{listeners}} to enjoy it. He also concluded by saying {{that it would be a}} new start for EXO, after the lawsuits of former band members Luhan and Kris, and that the members would show a brighter, fresher side to their fans.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{called the}} Wild Hearts (two words), the band {{originally}} included singers Snake (ex-Tobruk) and Dunken F. Mullett (ex-Mournblade), who both joined for short periods. Nine demos {{were recorded in}} 1989 and 1990 with Snake singing on four and Dunken on five. These demos remain unreleased and displayed a sound resembling Guns N' Roses, with the Wildhearts sound still to be developed. Some of the demos were produced by Ric Browde and intended for an EP release that never materialized, though these demos are occasionally found on unofficial releases. In March 1991, Ginger reluctantly took over on lead vocals despite his reservations, as he has <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> himself a good singer.|$|E
