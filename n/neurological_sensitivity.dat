50|$|Early {{theories}} of vigilance explained {{the reduction of}} electrophysiological activity over time associated with the vigilance decrement {{as a result of}} neural habituation. Habituation is the decrease in neural responsivity due to repeated stimulation. Under passive conditions, when no task is performed, participants exhibit attenuated N100 Event Related Potentials (ERP) that indicate neural habituation, and it was assumed that habituation was also responsible for the vigilance decrement. More recent ERP studies indicate that when performance declines during a vigilance task, N100 amplitude was not diminished. These results indicate that vigilance is not the result of boredom or a reduction in <b>neurological</b> <b>sensitivity.</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The antemortem {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer disease (AD) requires time-consuming and costly procedures. Therefore, biochemical tests that can direct the physician rapidly {{to the correct}} diagnosis are highly desirable. Measurement of single biochemical markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as total tau protein and beta-amyloid peptide 42 (Abeta 42), shows robust alterations that highly correlate with the clinical {{diagnosis of}} AD but generally lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy. OBJECTIVE: To study the combination of CSF phosphorylated tau protein (phospho-tau) and Abeta 42 as biochemical markers for AD. METHODS: We combined CSF measurements of phospho-tau and Abeta 42 in 100 consecutive patients who under-went diagnostic workup for dementia and in 31 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: We found that the calculated ratio of phospho-tau to Abeta 42 was significantly increased in patients with AD and provided high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing patients with AD from healthy control subjects (sensitivity, 86 %; specificity, 97 %), subjects with non-AD dementias (sensitivity, 80 %; specificity, 73 %), and subjects with other <b>neurological</b> disorders (<b>sensitivity,</b> 80 %; specificity, 89 %). CONCLUSION: The diagnostic usefulness of the CSF ratio of phospho-tau to Abeta 42 is superior to either measure alone and can be recommended {{as an aid to}} evaluating individuals suspected of having dementia...|$|R
40|$|Aim Few {{data are}} {{available}} on the use of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in combination with other electrophysiological tools to assess prognosis of comatose survivors from cardiac arrest (CA). Methods Retrospective analysis of data from all adult patients (> 18 years of age) admitted to our Dept of Intensive Care after CA over a 6 -year period who were comatose (Glasgow Coma Scale < 9) on admission, had been treated with targeted temperature management and had BAEP testing. We collected variables related to CA, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) findings, N 20 somatosensory evoked potentials, and the presence of I, III and/or V waves on BAEP testing. Outcome was assessed at 3 months using the Cerebral Performance Categories (3 – 5 = poor outcome). Results We studied 65 patients; 48 (74 %) had a poor neurological outcome. BAEP assessment was performed day 3 [3, 4] after the CA. At least one of the three waves was absent bilaterally in 34 patients (52 %); of these patients, 29 (85 %) had a poor <b>neurological</b> outcome (<b>sensitivity</b> 60 %, specificity 71 %, positive predictive value [PPV] 85 % and negative predictive value [NPV] 39 %). Three patients (5 %) had bilateral absence of all three waves, all of whom had a poor neurological outcome. Conclusions In this series of patients after CA, {{at least one of the}} BAEP waves was absent bilaterally in half the survivors; however, their use for prediction of poor neurological outcome remains limited.

40|$|Background : Paramedics {{require an}} {{effective}} prehospital tool to eliminate stroke mimics and {{to assist in}} the identification of suitable candidates for thrombolytic therapy. The Faster Access to Stroke Therapies study combined two validated stroke assessment tools (the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen, LAPSS, and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, CPSS) to form the Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Screen (MASS), and performed an in-field validation by Australian paramedics. Methods : Over a 12 -month period, 18 paramedics participated in the Faster Access to Stroke Therapies study and prospectively collected data contained in the MASS on all stroke dispatches, and for other patients with a focal <b>neurological</b> deficit. <b>Sensitivity</b> and specificity analysis of the LAPSS, CPSS and MASS was calculated and equivalence analysis performed. Results : Paramedics completed 100 MASS assessments for 73 (73 %) stroke/transient ischemic attack patients and 27 (27 %) stroke mimics. The sensitivity of the MASS (90 %, 95 % CI: 81 - 96 %) showed statistical equivalence to the sensitivity of the CPSS (95 %, p = 0. 45) and superiority to the LAPSS (78 %, p = 0. 008). The specificity of the MASS (74 %, 95 % CI: 53 - 88 %) was equivalent to that of the LAPSS (85 %, p = 0. 25) and superior to the CPSS (54 %, p = 0. 007). All patients misidentified by the MASS (7 strokes, 7 mimics) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. Conclusion : The MASS is simple to use, with accurate prehospital identification of stroke. It distinguishes stroke mimics, with good recognition of suitable patients for thrombolytic therapy. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{assessment of}} general movements (GMs) {{has been shown}} to be a better predictor of neurological outcome than the traditional neurological examination in brain-damaged preterm infants. The aim of this study was to compare the results of the two techniques in term infants. Off-line assessment of GMs from videorecordings and neurological examinations were carried out, from birth till about 6 months of postterm age, in a group of 58 term infants, the majority of which were affected by mild to severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. The agreement between the two techniques and their predictive power, with respect to the neurological outcome at 2 years, were evaluated for four age groups. The range of agreement between neurological and GM findings was between 78 and 83 %. At all ages the results of GM observation correlated highly with the <b>neurological</b> outcome; their <b>sensitivity</b> and specificity with respect to outcome were consistently slightly superior to those of neurological examination. If infants normalize after an initial period of transient abnormalities, GMs normalize earlier than the neurological results...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a growing}} {{evidence}} base that points to and supports the notion that adults also show signs of sensory processing difficulties. In the United Kingdom early research and improved clinical outcomes for clients assessed as having sensory processing difficulties is indicating that the therapy may be an appropriate treatment. The adult clients show a range of presentations including autism and Asperger's syndrome, as well as developmental coordination disorder and some mental health difficulties. Therapists suggest that these presentations may arise from the difficulties adults with sensory processing difficulties encounter trying to negotiate the challenges and demands of engaging in everyday life. [...] It is important when treating adults not only to focus upon sensory regulation but to also help them develop and maintain social supports. Adults who are sensory over-responsive have very high correlated anxiety and depression levels compared to adults {{who do not have}} sensory over-responsiveness. This is correlated to the perceived absence of social supporters. Sensory processing disorder can also be correlated with sleep quality in adults. This correlation can be seen especially in adults who have low <b>neurological</b> thresholds (sensory <b>sensitivity</b> and sensory avoidance). These individuals are more sensitive to tactile, auditory and visual stimuli which often impacts their quality of sleep.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) {{epidemic}} in Nagpur, India, we identified some suspected Chikungunya patients with neurological complications. Early and cost-effective diagnosis {{of these patients}} remains problematic despite many new advanced diagnostic methods. A reliable diagnostic test, which could be performed in any standard pathology laboratory, would help to obtain definitive early diagnosis of CHIKV patients with neurological complications. In our laboratory, in-house ELISA protocol for viral antigen, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG detection has been developed and assessed for the diagnosis of CHIKV patients with neurological complications. Method Cerebrospinal fluid samples of forty-six patients who developed neurological symptoms within two months of CHIKV infections along with control subjects {{were included in the}} study and were analyzed for the presence of antigens and of IgM and IgG using an ELISA protocol. Results The ELISA method for antigen detection yielded 80 % sensitivity and 87 % specificity for the diagnosis of CHIKV patients with <b>neurological</b> complications. The <b>sensitivity</b> for detection of IgM 48 % or IgG 63 % was significantly lower than the antigen assay (80 %). Conclusion The detection of viral antigen in CSF of CHIKV patients with neurological complications by ELISA method gave a more reliable diagnosis than antibodies detection {{that can be used to}} develop an immunodiagnostic assay with increased sensitivity and specificity. </p...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Median nerve {{somatosensory}} evoked potentials (SEP) monitoring {{performed in}} deep hypothermic circulatory arrest {{is useful in}} determining when brain cooling may sufficiently permit circulatory arrest, and to immediately indicate when brain injury occurs. The aim of this retrospective study, including 58 patients, is to determine SEP sensitivity, specificity and impact on the surgical strategy. METHOD: Sensitivity was determined on patients presenting new neurological complications. Specificity was measured on the patients without any new neurological defect. The impact of intraoperative SEP on the surgical strategy was determined when the occurrence of SEP alterations had provoked a modification of the surgical procedure. RESULTS: Five patients died intraoperatively due to non-neurological complications. Fourteen patients presented new <b>neurological</b> complications. SEP <b>sensitivity</b> reaches 64. 3 % when all the complications are included, but increases to 100 % in our series if late postoperative complications, paraplegia and tibial posterior nerve lesion are excluded because median nerve SEP {{are not able to}} detect such complications. SEP monitoring was uneventful in the 39 patients whose did not present neurological complication: thus SEP specificity is absolute in our series. SEP {{had an impact on the}} surgical procedure whenever neurological complications due to hemodynamic disturbances occurred. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study shows the interest of intraoperative SEP as an useful tool for promptly identifying and preventing the neurological complication of hypothermic circulatory arrest...|$|R

The Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale was used to define patients’ outcome at 180  days after OHCA (CPC 1 – 2 : good–CPC 3 – 5 : poor neurological outcome). Using mean BIS and SR values calculated per hour, receiver operator characteristics curves were constructed to determine the optimal time point and threshold to predict poor neurological outcome. At 180  days post-cardiac arrest, 39 patients (51 %) had a poor neurological outcome. A mean BIS value[*]≤[*] 25 at hour 12 predicted poor neurological outcome with a sensitivity of 49 % (95 % CI 30 – 65 %), a specificity of 97 % (95 % CI 85 – 100 %) and false positive rate (FPR) of 6 % (95 % CI 0 – 29 %) [AUC: 0.722 (0.570 – 0.875); p[*]=[*] 0.006].

40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of 109 patients with tumor {{of the spine}} MIOM was performed during the surgical procedure between March 2000 and December 2005. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of MIOM techniques used to monitor spinal cord and nerve root function during surgical procedure of spinal tumors. MIOM become an integrated procedure during surgical approach to intramedullar and extramedullar spine tumors. The combination of monitoring ascending and descending pathways may provide more sensitive and specific results than SEP alone giving immediate feedback information regarding any neurological deficit during the operation. Intraoperative sensory spinal and cerebral evoked potential combined with EMG recordings and motor evoked potential of the spinal cord and muscles were evaluated and compared with postoperative clinical neurological changes. One hundred and nine consecutive patients with spinal tumors of different aetiologies were monitored by the means of MIOM during the entire surgical procedure. Eighty-two patients presented true negative findings while two patients monitored false negative, one false positive and 24 patients true positive findings where neurological deficits after the operation were present. All patients with neurological deficit recovered completely or to pre-existing <b>neurological</b> situation. The <b>sensitivity</b> of MIOM applied during surgery of spinal tumors has been calculated of 92 % and specificity 99 %.

40|$|We {{compared}} saline (S) {{and sodium}} dodecyl sulphate (SDS) extracts from Taenia solium (homologous species - HO) and Taenia crassiceps (heterologous species - HE) metacestodes in order to detect Ige by ELISA and immunoblot assay (IBA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of human neurocysticercosis (NC). CSF samples were obtained from 93 patients. of these, 40 had NC, five had a diagnosis of probable NC, nine had central nervous system schistosomiasis or strongyloidiasis and 39 had other neurological alterations. Samples were analysed by ELISA {{and the results were}} compared with IBA in all samples with confirmed and probable NC diagnosis, in all samples with other central nervous system parasitic infection, and in 10 of those with another <b>neurological</b> alterations. ELISA <b>sensitivity</b> was 100 %, 85 %, 95 % and 87. 5 % for the S-HO, S-HE, SDS-HO and SDS-HE extracts, respectively, and ELISA specificity was 100 % for S-HO, S-HE, SDS-HO extracts and 97. 9 % for SDS-HE antigen. Immunodominant peptides detected by IBA were, by decreasing percentage of recognition: 64 - 68 and 45 kDa for S-HO; 108 - 114, 92 - 95, 64 - 68, 83 and 88 kDa for S-HE; 64 - 68, 108 - 114, 77 and 86 kDa for SDS-HO; and 108 - 114, 88 and 92 - 95 kDa for SDS-HE. Overall the homologous antigenic extracts showed higher sensitivity than the heterologous extracts in the diagnosis of NC in CSF samples.

40|$|Aim]To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} regional brain oxygen saturation (rSO 2) at hospital arrival and neurological outcomes at 90 days in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). [Methods]The Japan-Prediction of neurological Outcomes in patients post cardiac arrest (J-POP) registry is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study to test whether rSO 2 predicts neurological outcomes after OHCA. We measured rSO 2 in OHCA patients immediately after hospital arrival using a near-infrared spectrometer placed on the forehead with non-blinded fashion. The primary endpoint was “neurological outcomes” at 90 days after OHCA. [Results]EMS providers {{are not permitted to}} terminate CPR in the field in Japan, and so most patients with OHCA who are treated by EMS personnel are transported to emergency hospitals. Among 1017 OHCA patients, 672 patients including 52 comatose patients with pulses detectable (8 %) and 620 cardiac arrest patients (92 %) at hospital arrival were enrolled prospectively and consecutively. Twenty-nine patients with good neurological outcome had a significantly higher value of rSO 2 at hospital arrival than 643 patients with poor neurological outcome (mean [±SD] 55. 6 ± 20. 8 % vs. 19. 7 ± 11. 0 %, p 42 % for predicting good <b>neurological</b> outcome, with <b>sensitivity</b> 0. 79 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 60 – 0. 92), specificity 0. 95 (95 % CI, 0. 93 – 0. 96), positive predictive value, 0. 41 (95 % CI, 0. 28 – 0. 55), negative predictive value, 0. 99 (95 % CI, 0. 98 – 1. 00), and area under the curve 0. 90 (95 % CI, 0. 88 – 0. 92).

40|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) is {{increasingly}} used {{to assist in}} outcome prediction for patients with a postanoxic coma after cardiac arrest. Current literature shows that neurological outcome is invariably poor if the EEG remains iso-electric or low-voltage at 24 h after cardiac arrest or if it shows burst-suppression with identical bursts; such patterns are observed in approximately 30 - 50 % of patients. Return of continuous EEG rhythms within 12 h after cardiac arrest predicts good <b>neurological</b> outcome with <b>sensitivities</b> {{in the range of}} 30 to 50 % at specificities near 100 %. In previous work, we reported on the Cerebral Recovery Index to assist in the visual assessment of the EEG. In this paper, we explore a deep learning approach, using a convolutional neural network for outcome prediction in patients with a postanoxic encephalopathy. Using EEGs from 287 patients at 12 h after cardiac arrest and 399 patients at 24 h after cardiac arrest, we trained and validated a convolutional neural network with raw EEG data (18 channels, longitudinal bipolar montage). As the outcome measure, we used the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC), dichotomized between good (CPC score 1 - 2) and poor outcome (CPC score 3 - 5). Using 5 minute artifact-free epochs from the continuous EEG recordings partitioned into 10 s snippets, we trained the convolutional neural network using 80 % of the patients. Validation was performed with EEGs from the remaining 20 % of patients. Outcome prediction was most accurate at 12 h after cardiac arrest, with a sensitivity of 58 % at a specificity of 100 % for the prediction of poor outcome. Good neurological outcome could be predicted at 12 h after cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 58 % at a specificity of 97 %. In conclusion, we present a classifier for the prediction of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest, based on a convolutional neural network, providing reliable and objective prognostic information...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of CSF and serum diagnostic autoantibodies in autoimmune encephalitis, there are still very limited CSF biomarkers for diagnostic and monitoring purposes in children with inflammatory or autoimmune brain disease. The cause of encephalitis is unknown in up {{to a third of}} encephalitis cohorts, and it is important to differentiate infective from autoimmune encephalitis given the therapeutic implications. To study CSF cytokines and chemokines as diagnostic biomarkers of active neuroinflammation, and assess their role in differentiating demyelinating, autoimmune, and viral encephalitis. We measured and compared 32 cytokine/chemokines using multiplex immunoassay and APRIL and BAFF using ELISA in CSF collected prior to commencing treatment from paediatric patients with confirmed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n = 16), anti-NMDAR encephalitis (anti-NMDAR E, n = 11), and enteroviral encephalitis (EVE, n = 16). We generated normative data using CSF from 20 non-inflammatory <b>neurological</b> controls. The <b>sensitivity</b> of CSF cytokine/chemokines to diagnose encephalitis cases was calculated using 95 th centile of control values as cut off. We correlated CSF cytokine/chemokines with disease severity and follow up outcome based on modified Rankin scale. One-way hierarchical correlational cluster analysis of molecules was performed in different encephalitis and outcome groups. In descending order, CSF TNF-α, IL- 10, IFN-α, IL- 6, CXCL 13 and CXCL 10 had the best sensitivity (> 79. 1 %) when all encephalitis patients were included. The combination of IL- 6 and IFN-α was most predictive of inflammation on multiple logistic regression with area under the ROC curve 0. 99 (CI 0. 97 - 1. 00). There were no differences in CSF cytokine concentrations between EVE and anti-NMDAR E, whereas ADEM showed more pronounced elevation of Th 17 related (IL- 17, IL- 21) and Th 2 (IL- 4, CCL 17) related cytokine/chemokines. Unlike EVE, heat map analysis showed similar clustering of cytokine/chemokine molecules in immune mediated encephalitis (ADEM and anti-NMDAR E). Th 1 and B cell (CXCL 13 and CXCL 10) molecules clustered together in patients with severe encephalopathy at admission and worse disability at follow up in all encephalitis. There was no correlation between CSF neopterin and IFN-γ or IFN-α. A combination panel of cytokine/chemokines consisting of CSF TNF-α, IL- 10, IFN-α, IL- 6, CXCL 13 and CXCL 10 measured using multiplex immunoassay may be used to diagnose and monitor intrathecal inflammation in the brain.
