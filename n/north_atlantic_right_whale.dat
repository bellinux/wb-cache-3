5|$|The {{leading cause}} of death among the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> which migrates through some of the world's busiest {{shipping}} lanes while journeying off the east coast of the United States and Canada, is being struck by ships. At least 16 ship-strike deaths were reported between 1970 and 1999, and probably more remain unreported. According to NOAA, 25 of the 71 right whale deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes.|$|E
5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (E. glacialis).|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5000|$|<b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> {{are highly}} endangered. In the early 1900s, the {{population}} was reduced to {{only a few hundred}} whales as a result of commercial whaling. [...] Although whales were protected from commercial whaling since 1935, the population still has not fully recovered. In 2011 the population of western <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> estimated about 465 whales. [...] Despite recent small growth in population, the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> remain critically endangered.

5|$|Vessel strikes cause {{death for}} a number of marine mammals, {{especially}} whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with marine mammals. Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on marine mammals by interfering with their natural behavior.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They have rarely been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one of the smallest species.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the life span of right whales. One of the few {{well-documented}} cases is of a female <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{species of}} right whale was {{proposed}} by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century - the so-called Swedenborg whale. The description {{of this species}} {{was based on a}} collection of fossil bones unearthed at Norra Vånga, Sweden, in 1705 and believed to be those of giants. The bones were examined by Swedenborg, who realized they belong to a species of whale. The existence of this species has been debated, and further evidence for this species was discovered during the construction of a motorway in Strömstad, Sweden in 2009. To date, however, scientific consensus still considers Hunterius swedenborgii to be a <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> According to a DNA analysis conducted by scientists, it was later confirmed that the fossil bones are actually from a bowhead whale.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E

5|$|Whaling {{decreased}} substantially after 1946 when, {{in response}} to the steep decline in whale populations, the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004. As of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 bowhead whales off Alaska and two from the western coast of Greenland, 620 grey whales off Washington state, three common minke whales off the eastern coast of Greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 fin whales from the west coast of Greenland, nine humpback whales from the west coast of Greenland and 20 off St. Vincent and the Grenadines each year. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the North Atlantic population is functionally extinct. Conversely, the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the North Atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of Canada, Greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the European coastline.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The Southern right whale was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E

25|$|Baleen whales, Mysticeti, {{are often}} taken in gill-nets and in {{fisheries}} that use vertical lines to mark traps and pots. Large cetaceans such as humpback and right whales may carry off gear after entanglement. This explains the large scars borne by whales along the U.S. Atlantic coast. Analyses show that 50-70% of Gulf of Maine humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, and <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Whale,</b> Eubalaena glacialis, have been entangled {{at least once}} in their lifetime. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> {{is one of the most}} endangered large cetaceans and only 300-350 individuals remain.

25|$|A {{result of}} {{shipping}} traffic {{has been the}} potential for increased collisions between ships and the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> In 2003, the Canadian Coast Guard adjusted shipping lanes crossing prime whale feeding areas {{at the entrance to}} the Bay of Fundy to lessen the risk of collision.|$|E

25|$|Collisions with {{commercial}} ships {{are the greatest}} threat to <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b> Both summer feeding ranges and winter calving grounds are located in busy shipping channels. E. japonica does not frequent shipping channels. In the North Pacific, this threat is probably smaller, but it still exists.|$|R
25|$|In its 2013 {{evaluation}} of the threats to survival of the North Pacific right whale, NOAA examined the possible impacts of entanglement in fishing gear and ingestion of marine debris. Entanglement in fishing gear is {{a major threat to}} the survival of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> Marine debris includes, among other items, abandoned or lost fishing gear and small plastic items that could be ingested.|$|E
25|$|E. japonica {{is a very}} large, thickset baleen whale. It {{very closely}} resembles the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (E. glacialis) the {{southern}} right whale (E. australis), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, E. japonica may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.|$|E
500|$|As of 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{recognized}} 86 cetacean species, 40 {{of which}} are considered whales.

50|$|Adult <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> average 13 - 16 m {{in length}} and weigh {{approximately}} 40000 to 70000 kg, they are slightly smaller on average than the North Pacific species.

500|$|On February 6, 2006, NOAA {{proposed}} its Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes to <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Whales.</b> The proposal, {{opposed by}} some shipping interests, limited ship speeds during calving season.

500|$|During {{the mating}} season, which can occur {{at any time}} in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> gather into [...] "surface-active groups" [...] made up of as many as 20 males consorting a single female. The female has her belly to the surface while the males stroke her with their {{flippers}} or keep her underwater. The males do not compete as aggressively against each other as male humpbacks. The female may not become pregnant but she is still able to assess the condition of potential mates. The mean age of first parturition in <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> is estimated at between 7.5 and 9 years. Females breed every 3–5 years where the most commonly seen calving intervals are 3 years and may vary from 2 up to 21 years due to multiple factors.|$|R
