40|$|Abstract. <b>Natural</b> <b>light</b> is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} natural element, and renewable natural resources. Rational and effective application of <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> in modern architectural design, reduces the consumption of energy, cuts down on architectural operation, maintenance, and management costs. It {{is an issue that}} must be taken into consideration and resolved for modern and future architects in design. The architectural world that we live in is composed of various materials. To choose the right materials, integrate and construct an ideal environment with <b>natural</b> <b>light,</b> and create architectures that communicate with people, are the objective of designers. 1 The relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> materials for modern protective structure outside architectures To explicitly express oneself, things have to be presented in <b>natural</b> <b>light,</b> {{so that it can be}} perceived and accepted by our optic nerves. Modern protective structure outside architectures is the “shell ” of architectural space. It has functions of sheltering, introducing in <b>natural</b> <b>light,</b> and air exchange. The main relationship between materials of protective structure outside architectures and <b>natural</b> <b>light,</b> is that light can distinctively display the status the materials for protective structure. At the same time, the selection of materials, on some degree, determines the relationship between architecture an...|$|R

5|$|Sharmishtha Gooptu {{discusses}} {{the idea that}} the idyllic village life portrayed in Pather Panchali represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of Partition in 1947. She suggests that the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal, and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village. In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used eye-level shots, <b>natural</b> <b>lighting,</b> long takes and other techniques to achieve realism. Mainak Biswas has written that Pather Panchali comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc panels on the exterior {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc on the exterior were later changed to stainless steel due to costs. Designed by Mayne and the DLR Group, the building was to be built using concrete and steel with a goal of earning Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for sustainability, with large amounts of <b>natural</b> <b>lighting</b> designed to help secure that distinction. On the outside many security measures were incorporated into the design. The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service. Despite security concerns as a federal building, the architect and judge Michael Robert Hogan sought to have an open feel to the structure. Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E

In this study, the effect of <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> on the architectural space quality was examined. Contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> in three different dimensions as the readability of the space, the effect of the space, and its aesthetical evaluation was taken into consideration and discussed in the given order. The study involves a review of the related architecture literature, various books, articles, essays, and opinions. The major objective of this research is to explain the place of <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> in architectural design and its different aspects through its functional and semantic dimensions in the space. In this respect, contributions of <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> to the identity of the space were examined based on three renowned Turkish architects and their significant works. The paper focuses on the contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>light</b> to the space, emphasizing its qualitative aspects; whereas its physical and measurable aspects are beyond the scope of the paper.
