50|$|<b>Necopidem</b> {{is a drug}} in the imidazopyridine family, {{which is}} related to the better known drugs {{zolpidem}} and alpidem. It is therefore considered a nonbenzodiazepine and as such may have sedative and anxiolytic effects, given its structural similarity to other nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An expeditious one-pot, ligand-free, Pd(OAc) 2 -catalyzed, three-component {{reaction}} for {{the synthesis}} of 2, 3 -diarylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines was developed under microwave irradiation. With the high availability of commercial reagents and great efficiency in expanding molecule diversity, this methodology is superior to the existing procedures for {{the synthesis of}} 2, 3 -diarylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines analogues. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines are extremely popular amongchemists and medicinal chemists due to their remarkable biological and pharmacological activities 1 such as anticancer, 2 anti-inflammatory, 3 antibacterial, 4 antiprotozonal, 5 antiviral, 6 antiulcer, 7 and antifungal. 8 Within the imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine family, several products have progressed to market, including alpidem (anxiolytic), 9 <b>necopidem</b> (anxiolytic), 10 saripidem (anxiolytic), 11 zolpidem (insomnia), 12 olprinone (cardioton-ic), 13 minodronic acid (bisphosphonate), 14 divalpon (anxio-lytic), 15 and zolimidine (antiulcer). 16 The imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine derivatives, 2, 3 -diarylimidazo-[1, 2 -a]pyridines also exhibit {{a wide range of}} biologica...|$|E
40|$|Drugs such as <b>necopidem,</b> saripidem, alpidem, zolpidem, and {{olprinone}} contain nitrogencontaining bicyclic, condensed-imidazo 1, 2 -Î±pyridines as bioactive scaffolds. In this work, {{we report}} a high-yield one pot synthesis of 1 -(2 -methyl- 8 -aryl-substitued-imidazo 1, 2 -Î± pyridin- 3 -yl) ethan- 1 -onefor the first-time. Subsequently, we performed in silico mode-ofaction analysis and {{predicted that the}} synthesized imidazopyridines targets Phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2). In vitro analysis confirmed the predicted target PLA 2 for the novel imidazopyridine derivative 1 -(2 -Methyl- 8 -naphthalen- 1 -yl-imidazo 1, 2 -Î±pyridine- 3 -yl) -ethanone (compound 3 f) showing significant inhibitory activity towards snake venom PLA 2 with an IC 50 value of 14. 3 Î¼M. Evidently, the molecular docking analysis suggested that imidazopyridine compound was able to bind to the active site of the PLA 2 with strong affinity, whose affinity values are comparable to nimesulide. Furthermore, we estimated the potential for oral bioavailability by Lipinski's Rule of Five. Hence, it is concluded that the compound 3 f could be a lead molecule against snake venom PLA 2.
