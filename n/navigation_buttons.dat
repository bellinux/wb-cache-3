500|$|The Dream's {{exterior}} uses a soft, matte plastic shell, and {{was made}} available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive [...] "chin" [...] on the bottom, which houses 5 <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> ("Call", [...] "Home", [...] "Menu", [...] "Back", and [...] "End Call") and a clickable trackball {{in the center}} {{which can be used}} for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a [...] capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320×480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard—as the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting multitouch at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack, requiring an adapter for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) [...] "ExtUSB" [...] port located {{on the bottom of the}} device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus.|$|E
500|$|The Dream was {{released}} to mixed reviews. The {{design of the}} Dream {{was considered to be}} solid and robust; Joshua Topolsky of Engadget considered its hardware design a contrast to that of the iPhone, due to its numerous <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> (in comparison to just a home button) and its [...] "charming, retro-future look; like a gadget in a 1970's sci-fi movie set in the year 2038." [...] The Dream's keyboard, as the only method of text input prior to Android 1.5's introduction of a virtual keyboard, was considered to be sufficient, although some felt that its keys were too small. Its display was considered sufficient for a phone of its class, but John Brandon of TechRadar felt that it was not good enough for watching videos due to its poor contrast and small size in comparison to the iPhone. Android itself was considered to still be in its infancy (primarily due to its bare-bones functionality in certain areas, limited application catalog, lack of multitouch gestures, or syncing with certain enterprise platforms), but showed promise through its customizable interface, increased flexibility over iOS, its notification system, ability to display security permissions when downloading apps, and its heavy integration with Google services.|$|E

500|$|LG's Android {{interface}} design received mixed reviews; TechRadar gave it {{a positive}} review, describing it as being [...] "easy enough for novice and expert smartphone users alike", and noting its dynamic elements and customization features. [...] Its increased customization abilities (including different lock screen and home screen animations, {{and the ability to}} change the background and layout of the on-screen <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons)</b> was noted by reviewers. The usefulness of the [...] "Slide Aside" [...] feature was questioned due to the availability of other, more efficient means to switch apps. LG's software was generally panned for being unpolished in places, suffering from feature creep, and containing too many unneeded visual effects and skeuomorphic elements (the latter having generally fallen out of favor). The G2's software was also panned for containing usability digressions in comparison to stock Android, such as the notification tray being taken up by options, not using Android 4.2's updated [...] "Complete action using" [...] menu and behavior, and, despite using on-screen buttons, continued use of the [...] "Menu" [...] key which was officially deprecated by Google in its Android human interface guidelines for Android 4.x (on apps which comply with the HIG, overflow menus are intended to be displayed within the apps themselves. The device's Menu key is replaced by a [...] "Recent apps" [...] key, and a small [...] "Menu" [...] key appears to the side when needed). The Nexus 5 was released by LG shortly afterwards and shares much of the G2's hardware albeit with a lower-quality rear camera and smaller battery to hit a lower price point; the Nexus 5 has been touted as a clean Android software alternative with the added advantage of running the latest Android 4.4 [...] "KitKat" [...] while the G2 had to make do with a bloatware-filled Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] for a time.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Google's Jeff Chang {{announced}} to Chromium developers that Google was considering further large-scale interface changes. Under consideration were eliminating the [...] "Omnibox" [...] URL bar and combining the two line layout which has tabs on one line and <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons,</b> menu and URL bar {{on a second}} line into one single line, thus freeing up more screen space for content. (Such a layout was later adopted by Internet Explorer 9.) Chang acknowledged that this would result in URLs not always being visible to the user, that navigation controls and menus may lose their context and that the resulting single line could be quite crowded. Other proposed changes include being able to log into multiple accounts in different windows and improved URL suggestions from the user's history. By the middle of 2011, after some experimentation, the developers decided that eliminating the URL bar was too risky and shelved the idea.|$|E

50|$|The Palm Zire and Palm Zire 21 were {{inexpensive}} and are differentiated {{from the rest}} of Palm's line by having monochrome screens without backlighting, having only two quickbuttons instead of four, and a traditional up/down <b>navigation</b> <b>button</b> instead of a 5-Way Navigator, though both of these entry-level models are lightweight (3.8oz or 108g), sporting a white front with a matte gray plastic back.|$|R
50|$|Treo 600 was a {{smartphone}} {{developed by}} Handspring, and offered under the palmOne brand (later Palm, Inc.) after {{the merger of}} the two companies.

40|$|Ideally, the SEP {{web pages}} should be rich in content, free of clutter, and quick to download. We suggest two basic types of web pages: table-of-contents pages that contain lists of {{annotated}} links, and content pages that contain mostly text and figures. The author of an SEP web page should attract search engines, maintain a consistent layout for related pages, {{and include a}} simple, universal <b>navigation</b> <b>button</b> that returns the reader to the SEP home page. Finally, the SEP source that corresponds to a web page should be equipped with a simple makefile target www that exports the software to the web site...|$|R

50|$|Wink is a {{freeware}} {{screen capture}} and tutorial-creation program. It supports many {{features such as}} input-based capture and text annotations. <b>Navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> {{can be added to}} any presentation and the bitmaps for all presentation controls can be edited.|$|E
50|$|Like other Android devices, the Tablet S has no {{hardware}} <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons,</b> {{which are}} all implemented via persistent on-screen buttons. The only physical buttons present on the device are the power button and volume rocker located in the recessed area on one side.|$|E
50|$|Multiple timers {{can be set}} to run simultaneously. The zoom {{button on}} a timer replaces the {{background}} with the Windows accent colors, hides other timers and the ribbon, and enlarges the time shown. Arrow <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> allow users to switch between timers in this view.|$|E
50|$|Since the F3 {{had only}} two lines of fixed icons {{on the top and}} bottom of the display, as well as one line of six 14-segment {{characters}} and another line of six 7-segment numbers available on its display, the user interface was very different from the usual menu structure normally found on mobile phones. The only thing resembling a (flat) menu was accessed by pressing left/right on the central button: It allowed writing an SMS, reading a saved SMS, call history, choosing the ringtone (out of seven melodies), setting date and time, and setting the alarm clock. The menu was visualized by fixed icons in the bottom row, following the left/right pattern of the <b>navigation</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Navigation</b> and {{function}} <b>buttons</b> such as Mga Eksena (Scenes), Panimula (Home), Nauna (Previous), Ulitin (Repeat), Nilalaman (Content Map), Kasunod (Next), Ikubli ang Teksto (Hide Text), and Bolyum (Volume).|$|R
5000|$|The Sony Ericsson K850i was a {{high-end}} mobile phone when released in October 2007. It {{was announced in}} June 2007 as the flagship product in Sony Ericsson's K ("Kamera") series, with a 5 megapixel CMOS camera sensor. The K850 was the first Sony Ericsson phone released outside of NTT DoCoMo to support microSD and microSDHC along with Sony's traditional M2. It also introduces the usage of three touch-sensitive softkeys right under the display and {{a new form of}} <b>navigation</b> <b>button,</b> omitting the classic joystick introduced with the Ericsson T68. The camera interface has been revamped to resemble the format of cybershot digital cameras. According to the manufacturer the UMTS talk time has been significantly increased to 3 hours 30 min over its predecessor, the K800 and K810. (K800 2 hrs 30 min). It was Sony Ericsson's first 3.5 HSDPA supporting mobile phone, and was also the first 3G [...] "global" [...] mobile with supporting all major operating network frequency in the world including GSM 850, GSM 900, GSM 1800, GSM 1900, HSDPA, UMTS 850, UMTS 1900, UMTS 2100.|$|R
50|$|October, 2009 saw {{the release}} of Aura Diamond Edition, a device upgrade with 18 carat gold plating and 34 {{diamonds}} around its screen and <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons.</b> Due to the more premium materials, it had a US$5,730 price tag at launch. Both the Diamond and Celestial editions were showcased at Mobile World Congress 2010.|$|E
50|$|Newer models {{such as the}} LaserJet 600 series {{now include}} a full color LCD display. Two {{directional}} arrow buttons and a Ok button replace the multiple menu <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> of the 4000 series. A numeric keypad and other specialized buttons are also included for job storage, copy, and fax usage on models with those features.|$|E
50|$|A {{common problem}} with this phone is the top half (the screen and <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons)</b> {{detaching}} from the bottom half (the keypad). This problem is caused by four loose screws that hold the top half to a swiveling metal plate attached to the bottom half. It is possible for one to fix this on their own.|$|E
50|$|The 3410 is a compact, but {{somewhat}} heavy phone (weight:114 g, battery included). It employs up {{and down}} <b>buttons</b> for menu <b>navigation.</b> The on/off/profile <b>button</b> is a stiff black button located {{on the top of}} the phone.|$|R
50|$|IXI {{was around}} {{the size of a}} credit card and had a LCD screen and <b>navigation</b> and volume <b>buttons.</b> Four {{prototype}} models were built and a pre-production model went on sale at the APRS exhibition at Earls Court in London.|$|R
50|$|The Pocket DJ is {{compatible}} with many music stores and formats, such as WMA (Windows Media Audio), and MP3. It also sports a blue 160 by 104 pixel screen, although easy for most people to read in the daylight, {{it can be difficult}} to read at night, because the blue reduces the clarity of the screen. The buttons also light up on the front, providing easy <b>navigation.</b> The <b>buttons</b> include, Back, Home, Previous/Rewind, Play/Pause, and Next/FastForward.|$|R
50|$|According to The Economic Times, the {{two most}} notable {{features}} of Paranoid Android are the Halo and the Pie. The Halo is a floating bubble that lets users see notifications without leaving the current screen, and the Pie is a replacement for onscreen <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> that stays off screen and lets users swipe in from the edge to see the buttons.|$|E
50|$|The {{branding}} {{consisted of}} various brand {{images on the}} background, <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons,</b> splash screen and links to specific web pages that related to the brand of the company. MediaBrower also had a space for ads to display {{at the bottom of}} the web browser. MediaBrowser's MicroTron was also included in every MediaBrowser branding to display brand-related video content to the user.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the {{previous}} smartphones that Sony has released, the Sony Xperia TX has a curvy and inwards arching design with a plastic finish. On {{the back of the}} device, Sony Ericsson's liquid energy logo still can be seen with the Xperia branding. The device does not feature any physical <b>navigation</b> <b>buttons</b> as the buttons are integrated into the software.|$|E
30|$|A <b>navigation</b> <b>button</b> {{located at}} the bottom-right of the screen offered ‘previous’ and ‘next’ arrows, enabled the {{learners}} to move between topics. This type of button also indicated the learners’ current location {{and the number of}} remaining topics. The instructional materials were always located on the white background area at {{the left side of the}} screen. The instructional materials were presented in dark text on a white background to facilitate ease of reading for learners who may have had colour perception deficiencies (McCracken and Wolfe 2004). To ensure that all information was seen in the one place, no scrolling of the screen was required. Therefore, to reduce extraneous cognitive load during learning, the instructional interface was designed consistently in terms of the usability and relating to the appearance, functionality and instructional ordering. Appearance meant using consistent ‘visual elements’ such as: layout; text style; colour and graphics throughout the instructional system. Functionality meant the same ‘(knowledge) navigation element’ such as ‘previous’ and ‘next’ arrows on each screen which allowed the learners to navigate through the topics. Instructional ordering meant the screen organisation remained consistent throughout the WMIS, for instance the navigational button located at bottom-right of each screen (Galitz 2007).|$|R
50|$|Bootstrap is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, <b>buttons,</b> <b>navigation</b> and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.|$|R
50|$|In Windows 8.0, Getting Started was {{completely}} removed. Windows 8.1 {{introduced a new}} app called Help + Tips that was pinned to the Start screen. It features a primary screen with a search box six tiles that focus exclusively on features new to Windows 8: Start and apps, Get around, Basic actions, Your account and files, Settings, and What’s new. The info in each tile’s section is viewed with horizontal scrolling. In addition to the app, Windows 8.1 features hints for finding hidden <b>navigation</b> menus, <b>buttons,</b> and flyouts.|$|R
