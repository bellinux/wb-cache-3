5|$|In Evansville, Indiana, Mission Broadcasting {{acquired}} then-independent station WTVW (now a CW affiliate) in 2011 {{with its}} former owner Nexstar Broadcasting retaining operational duties under an SSA. WTVW consolidated news operations with ABC affiliate WEHT, for which Nexstar traded WTVW to Mission {{in exchange for}} acquiring WEHT from Gilmore Broadcasting Corporation, and had its <b>newscast</b> output reduced through the reductions of its weekday morning <b>newscast</b> from four hours to two and its 6:00p.m. <b>newscast</b> – except on Sundays, where it remained one hour – from one hour to 30 minutes (leaving only a two-hour morning <b>newscast,</b> half-hour noon and 6:30p.m. newscasts and an hour-long <b>newscast</b> at 9:00p.m.). Both stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as Eyewitness News.|$|E
5|$|KWGN and KPLR moved The CW's primetime lineup {{one hour}} later (to 8:00 p.m.) than the network-recommended timeslot, and shifted their evening newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (weekend {{editions of the}} evening newscasts were {{discontinued}} with the move; KPLR has since expanded its 7:00 p.m. <b>newscast</b> to Saturday and Sunday evenings) to avoid competing with KDVR and KTVI's 9:00 p.m. newscasts; KWGN retained its weekday morning <b>newscast</b> (which competes directly with KDVR's morning <b>newscast),</b> but canceled its 5:30 p.m. – and later, 11:00 a.m. – newscasts. In contrast, KPLR (which had run a primetime <b>newscast</b> for much of its history) eventually added hour-long midday and late afternoon newscasts. The two LMA arrangements became legal duopolies in December 2013, once Tribune finalized its acquisition of Local TV.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was one of}} the {{original}} founders of QAP, a <b>newscast</b> that aired between 1992 and 1997. He was attracted to the project by the promise of editorial and journalistic independence.|$|E
50|$|Omni Alberta {{formerly}} produced local <b>newscasts</b> {{aimed at}} the Cantonese, Mandarin, and South Asian communities across the province. While there were newsgathering teams in both Edmonton and Calgary, {{the production of the}} <b>newscasts</b> themselves were based out of CKEM's studios in Downtown Edmonton. The <b>newscasts</b> were discontinued and replaced by Omni's national <b>newscasts</b> in September 2011; the national <b>newscasts</b> still featured contributions from Edmonton-based reporters.|$|R
50|$|CHNM-DT {{presently}} broadcasts 12½ {{hours of}} locally produced <b>newscasts</b> each week (with 2½ hours on weekdays); the station {{does not produce}} <b>newscasts</b> on Saturdays and Sundays. The station airs daily <b>newscasts</b> in Cantonese, Mandarin, Punjabi. The station also produced Korean and Tagalog <b>newscasts</b> but this has since been discontinued.|$|R
50|$|CKSA's <b>newscasts</b> {{air from}} 5:00 to 5:30 p.m. on weekdays, {{and there are}} no weekend <b>newscasts.</b> Beginning September 1, the local CKSA <b>newscasts</b> were cut back to a half-hour at 5:00 p.m. on weekdays only to {{accommodate}} Global National at 5:30 p.m. and the <b>newscasts</b> from Edmonton Global O&O CITV-DT.|$|R
5|$|This {{incident}} focused {{media attention}} on the church, and in May 4, 1997 the accusations were broadcast on Mexico's most-watched <b>newscast</b> on Televisa.|$|E
5|$|Capaldi's actions {{received}} favourable {{coverage from}} the Autism Daily <b>Newscast,</b> an official Google News website reporting on current events and news {{of interest to}} those on the autism spectrum, with site journalist Jo Worgan noting that the actor had devoted himself while {{on the set of}} Doctor Who to spending time with an autistic girl who was a fan of the show. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the Time Lord character took time to support the mental well-being of a child in addition to his duties of protecting the universe from harm.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Reynolds {{fell ill}} with {{multiple}} myeloma, {{a type of}} blood cancer that often attacks the bones, {{and was forced to}} stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly <b>newscast.</b> ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.|$|E
50|$|Upon Gray's {{resumption}} {{of control over}} WAGT on March 28, 2016, new in-house 5:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. <b>newscasts</b> premiered to replace the Media General-produced <b>newscasts.</b> They are produced from a separate set with alternate anchors to differentiate them from WRDW's <b>newscasts.</b> All other <b>newscasts</b> carried by WAGT are simulcast from WRDW.|$|R
50|$|With the {{consolidation}} of WXXA with WTEN, the ABC affiliate took over production of channel 23's <b>newscasts.</b> The two stations' reporting staffs were merged immediately following Shield Media's purchase of WXXA was completed. On January 24, 2013, WXXA discontinued its weeknight 5:00 and 11:00 p.m. <b>newscasts,</b> in order {{to focus more on}} the morning and 10:00 p.m. newscasts; in an announcement on its Facebook page; the station redirected viewers of the canceled <b>newscasts</b> to the WTEN <b>newscasts</b> in those time slots. The weekday morning (7:00-9:00 a.m.) and nightly 10:00 p.m. <b>newscasts,</b> which do not compete against WTEN's <b>newscasts,</b> remain on the station.|$|R
50|$|KPNX {{presently}} broadcasts 29 {{hours of}} locally produced <b>newscasts</b> each week (with 4½ hours on weekdays, 3½ hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays); KPNX's <b>newscasts</b> {{are among the}} highest-rated local <b>newscasts</b> in Arizona during evening timeslots, with <b>newscasts</b> during that time period having dominated ratings for several years, particularly since the 1994 affiliation switches.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} first nationally {{telecast}} bulletin about the shooting was made by Kathleen Sullivan {{as part of a}} standard <b>newscast</b> on Cable News Network; Sullivan reported that Lennon had been shot but his condition was not known {{at the time of the}} bulletin. NBC-TV momentarily broke into its East Coast feed of The Best of Carson for its bulletin of Lennon's death before returning in the middle of a comedy piece being performed by Johnny Carson.|$|E
5|$|The episode's five flashbacks {{focus on}} the {{reactions}} and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is shown crying while watching a <b>newscast</b> confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he answers {{that he does not}} know. Miles Straume (Ken Leung) is a medium hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs. Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a Dharma Initiative collar buried in the Tunisian desert. Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the <b>newscast</b> and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) for his choice in her coworkers.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, WCBS {{announced}} {{that for the}} 2003–04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People's Court after WNBC, which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut, dropped it from its lineup. WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local <b>newscast</b> once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were {{compounded by the fact}} that there were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E
50|$|Under Equity's {{management}} of the station, KUTH began airing weeknightly <b>newscasts</b> at 5 and 10 p.m. The <b>newscasts</b> were produced out of the company's headquarters in Little Rock, with reports filed by Salt Lake City-based reporters. The <b>newscasts</b> were canceled in June 2008, after Equity instituted a companywide suspension of news programs on its Univision-affiliated stations. Local <b>newscasts</b> would not return to KUTH until September 30, 2013, when Univision launched weeknight 5 and 10 p.m. <b>newscasts</b> branded Noticias 32 Salt Lake City.|$|R
50|$|KTKA-TV {{presently}} broadcasts 16 {{hours of}} locally produced <b>newscasts</b> each week (with three hours on weekdays, and a half-hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); all <b>newscasts</b> {{on the station}} are simulcasts or tape-delayed broadcasts of <b>newscasts</b> originating from sister station KSNT. Unlike most ABC affiliates, the station does not carry <b>newscasts</b> on weekday middays or in the early evenings on Saturdays and Sundays.|$|R
5000|$|During the 2000s, the 6:00 and 9:00 p.m. <b>newscasts</b> {{focused on}} the Pennyrile region of Western Kentucky, the 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. <b>newscasts</b> {{focused on the}} [...] "Queen City", which is the Clarksville area, and the 10pm <b>newscasts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Inquirers local {{coverage}} area includes Philadelphia, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey. In Pennsylvania, The Inquirer maintains bureaus in Conshohocken; Doylestown; Media; West Chester; and Norristown, while in New Jersey it has bureaus in Cherry Hill and Margate. In September 1994 The Inquirer and WPHL-TV co-produced a 10:00p.m. <b>newscast</b> called Inquirer News Tonight. The show lasted {{a year before}} WPHL-TV took complete control over the program and was renamed WB17 News at Ten. In 2004, The Inquirer formed a partnership with Philadelphia's NBC station, WCAU, giving the paper access to WCAU's weather forecasts while also contributing to news segments throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening <b>newscast</b> spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the <b>newscast.</b> Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E
50|$|KNEP (as KOTA's {{satellite}} KDUH-TV) once produced its own full-length <b>newscasts</b> as well. However, due to {{cutbacks in}} later years, KDUH's <b>newscasts</b> {{have been reduced}} to inserts in KOTA's weeknight <b>newscasts</b> with a few personalities locally based in Scottsbluff.|$|R
50|$|CFJC-TV {{presently}} broadcasts 10 {{hours of}} locally produced <b>newscasts</b> each week (with two hours on weekdays); the station {{does not produce}} any <b>newscasts</b> on Saturdays or Sundays. On May 18, 2012, CFJC-TV began broadcasting its local <b>newscasts</b> in high definition.|$|R
50|$|When WJHL-DT2 {{switched}} from MeTV to ABC on February 1, 2016, WJHL's morning, 11 p.m., and weekend <b>newscasts</b> began simulcasting on the subchannel. In addition, WJHL-DT2 airs <b>newscasts</b> at 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., with ABC World News Tonight broadcast {{in between the}} two <b>newscasts</b> on a 30-minute tape-delay at 7 p.m. The <b>newscasts</b> are branded ABC Tri-Cities News and are exclusive to WJHL-DT2.|$|R
5|$|Electronic media {{include two}} radio {{stations}} and one public television station, as well as student-produced television. BGSU's Public Broadcasting Service affiliate, WBGU-TV, broadcasts to nineteen counties in northwestern and west central Ohio and hosts PBS programming, local programming and BG24 News, a student-run television <b>newscast</b> airing live at 5:30pm twice a week. The campus is home to two student-operated radio stations {{as part of the}} Department of Telecommunications. WBGU 88.1 FM and WFAL Falcon Radio. WBGU-FM serves as an independent radio, non-commercial educational (NCE), FCC-licensed station that focuses mostly on independent music programming and broadcasts women's basketball and hockey; while WFAL Falcon Radio, formerly WFAL 1610 AM, is a student-run commercial radio station that broadcasts music including Modern rock, Top 40, Hip hop and talk shows. Both radio stations host news and sports talk shows and BGSU athletic events through partnerships with other student-media organizations. The Bowling Green Radio News Organization (BGRNO) provides radio news coverage Monday-Friday through student-produced shows; while the Bowling Green Radio Sports Organization (BGRSO) broadcasts BGSU athletic events on WBGU-FM and WFAL as well as local high school sports on WFAL.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television <b>newscast,</b> the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} partnered {{through a}} sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior {{partner in the}} LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated {{with one of the}} three largest broadcast television networks). The stations may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate <b>newscast</b> on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station. Alternatively, the stations may consolidate their news programming under a single joint brand.|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, 2012, WDAZ began {{presenting}} {{its local}} <b>newscasts</b> in [...] widescreen standard definition, while {{the morning and}} weekend <b>newscasts</b> originating from WDAY are presented in high definition. WDAZ began presenting its locally produced <b>newscasts</b> in high definition on October 15, 2013.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} that Trans TV <b>newscasts</b> will supplied by CNN Indonesia, according to many sources from Facebook. Finally on May 29, 2016, all Reportase <b>newscasts</b> was ended, and on May 30, 2016, CNN Indonesia <b>newscasts</b> begin their broadcasts on Trans TV.|$|R
50|$|KALW {{provided}} Chinese language simulcasts of KGO-TV <b>newscasts</b> in the 1970s, before local Asian language <b>newscasts</b> became established.|$|R
5|$|The video {{starts off}} with a cable car looking over a large city (Barcelona, from the West looking East) while a German <b>newscast</b> {{featuring}} Alexander von Roon plays on TV and switches to a luxurious-looking hotel in Plaça de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater. It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake {{in front of a}} white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.|$|E
5|$|As a {{promotion}} for the film, Warner Bros. Entertainment released , {{a series of}} narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 <b>newscast</b> marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. The other was a short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after the tabloid magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. DC Comics reissued Watchmen #1 for the original cover price of $1.50 on December 10, 2008; no other issues are to be reprinted.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2011, WFIE began {{broadcasting}} {{its local}} newscasts in high definition during the station's 5 p.m. <b>newscast,</b> {{becoming the first}} station in the Evansville market to begin offering local newscasts in high definition. On September 12, 2011, WFIE debuted a 4 p.m. <b>newscast</b> that competes against the 4 p.m. <b>newscast</b> on ABC affiliate WEHT; Jackie Monroe (currently the anchor of the station's 10 p.m. <b>newscast</b> and the 9 p.m. <b>newscast</b> seen on digital channel 14.2) serves as anchor of the new late-afternoon <b>newscast,</b> which lasted until 2013.|$|E
50|$|KETK {{is one of}} {{only three}} former ComCorp {{stations}} that produced their <b>newscasts</b> in-house (the others being fellow NBC affiliates KTSM-TV in El Paso and WVLA-TV in Baton Rouge, Louisiana). Due to insufficient funds for most ComCorp stations to produce their own <b>newscasts,</b> KETK served as a hub for the news operations for most of ComCorp's television stations, it produced pre-recorded <b>newscasts</b> for most of its Fox affiliates including Longview-licensed sister station KFXK-TV, KWKT in Waco and its College Station satellite KYLE, and KMSS-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana. Previously, the station also provided pre-recorded <b>newscasts</b> for the Baton Rouge virtual duopoly of WVLA and Fox-affiliated sister WGMB (it produced in-studio news segments for WVLA's evening <b>newscasts</b> from 2009 to 2010, when that station began producing its evening <b>newscasts</b> locally once again following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill; however, WVLA's weekend <b>newscasts</b> were still pre-recorded at the KETK studios).|$|R
50|$|The station began {{producing}} <b>newscasts</b> at its 1968 inception. However, due to {{the problems}} mentioned above caused by WMAZ's dominance of the market, WCWB's <b>newscasts</b> struggled in the ratings for years, and were mostly discontinued by the early 1970s. It made a modest attempt at <b>newscasts</b> again later in the decade. However, {{within a few months}} following its start in 1982, WGXA's <b>newscasts</b> surged to second place in the market (behind WMAZ), because its news product was perceived as far more modern than that of the <b>newscasts</b> seen on WCWB. Once again, due to low viewership, channel 41 shut down its news department in 1992. For the next 12 years, {{it was one of the}} few Big Three affiliates that did not air any <b>newscasts</b> at all.|$|R
50|$|The network's two {{remaining}} private affiliates air <b>newscasts</b> at 6:30 pm, after simulcasting {{one of the}} network-owned stations' <b>newscasts.</b>|$|R
