40|$|Abstract. The {{accuracy}} and traceability of measurement at nano-scale {{are directly related}} to <b>nano-fabrication.</b> Nanostep is typical structure, so the measurement and characterization of nanosteps are important to improve the accuracy of <b>nano-fabrication.</b> This paper studies on the relationship between the morphologic features of nanosteps and the processing parameters of a dual beam Focused Ion Beam (FIB). Nanosteps are fabricated with different depth of 50 nm and 30 nm. The experimental results show the depths of the nanosteps are affected by the sequence of the process and the processing energy. Although the relationship between the depth and process duration is linear, the depths of the nanosteps are not consistent with the design. The dimensions of the nanosteps at different positions are not constant because of the varying slope of the bottom and sidewall. It is necessary to optimize the processing parameters to achieve the designed dimensions...|$|E

The nano-CDW characteristically shows negative resistance above the threshold fields, which monotonously increased with decreasing temperature. The <b>nano-fabrication</b> is completed via two steps procedure. 1 st: Hydrogen ion beam irradiation to the K,,MoO, crystal makes no-CDW layer by hydrogen atoms as excess-donar at 40 - 100 nm depth, where CDW at {{the surface of the}} crystal was isolated £ram the bulk side. 2 nd: Scanning focused silicon ion beam makes amorphous MOO, in l i e and space patterns, where CDW at the surface are isolated as real one-dimensional region. The one-dimensionality of electrons has been confirmed by negative magnetic resistance, which magnitude should be reduced with decreasing dimensionality. One-dimensional (l-D) conductor shows the characteristic phenomena due to the Charge-Density-Wave (CDW) structure with the Peierls transition The quantum tunneling of the sliding motion of CDW has been argued in a great deal whether it could be experimentally observed[l].
