Five locomotives had arrived, but Perseverance did not compete, having been damaged {{on the way}} to Rainhill, and Cyclops, powered by two horses in a frame, was not a serious entry. Challenging Rocket was Novelty, built by John Ericsson and John Braithwaite in London, and Sans Pareil, built at the Shildon railway works by Timothy Hackworth, the locomotive supervisor of the S&DR. None of the locomotives were ready on Wednesday. The following day at 10:30 am Rocket started its 70 mi journey forwards and backwards across the 1½-mile (2.4-kilometre) course. It covered the first thirty-five miles in 3 hours and 12 minutes, the coke and water were replenished for fifteen minutes, and completed the course in another 2 hours 57 minutes. It had run at an average speed of 12 mph, and the highest speed reached was over 29 mph. Novelty still had to run, and was the favourite, although George is recorded as saying [...] "Eh mon, we needn't fear yon thing, her's got <b>nae</b> goots"; she <b>tried</b> to run that Saturday but a steam pressurised joint rapidly failed.

40|$|The {{clients of}} the social {{institution}} called "Dům na půli cesty" are young people who spent part of their life in an orphanage, educational institution, or they are leaving an imprisonment, {{or some kind of}} protective treatment. These people were separated from common life in society from different reasons which makes their comeback complicated. Such people usually live on the margin of society and this brings many problems. The ex-prisoners often start over commiting crimes and the young people from the educational institution often start to behave in a socio-pathological way to meet their needs. The goal of "Dům na půli cesty" is to help these people to integrate into the society and provide them with support and a place to stay for some time. The attention is paid to the young people that have expiated a punishment, with focus on factors that may play a role on the way of an individual to prison. Most attention is paid to the institutional education because most of the clients come from such institutions. It describes the conditions from which the children are placed in the institutional education. This work deals with the essential function of family as a key driver and tries to show the issue of integration in the society after leaving the institution. A specific example of "Dům na půli cesty" is described in the practical part of the research. The whole chapter is focused on the function of this institution in Český Krumlov. It describes the work of the employees who are almost indispensable here. Services and connected demands that are provided here are described as well. The main goal of this research is to describe the role of "Dům na půli cesty" in the system of integration young people into the society through monitoring of the activity of the chosen institution. It also tries to find out the view of the clients on the help provided there and on the degree of motivating the clients to get integrated in independent life. The research was focused on gathering answer on the research question: What particular actions done by "Dům na půli cesty" in Český Krumlov support the independence of the clients? A qualitative research was conducted to get the required information. This was achieved by the method of questioning, more specifically using the technique of half- structured interview. The interviews were conducted with seven clients of the "Dům na půli cesty" v Českém Krumlově. Records of these interviews were taken and rewritten with the permission of the communicating partners. The method of coding was used as well. The results were processed by the clustering method. The results of the interviews show that the clients of "Dům na půli cesty" in Český Krumlov are young people missing good family background who got in a difficult life situation which they cannot deal with on their own. Their biggest problems are: insufficient funds and inability of communication. The financial problems are mainly caused not only by the lack of education connected with unemployment, but also the absence of any money management. The inability of communication with the surroundings is connected mainly with the fact that these people were not given the chance to acquire such ability in the institution. "Dům <b>na</b> půli cesty" <b>tries</b> to help dealing with these problems. The clients see the provided help positively, they find this service necessary and are satisfied with it overall. This research highlights the problem connected with the location of the "Dům na půli cesty" in Český Krumlov. The main aims of the clients are: independence, finishing the studies and learning how to use money effectively. The independence of the clients is supported by these arrangements: motivation letters, duties, individual planning and supporting interviews. The acquired data will serve as a tool for improving the quality of the services in this institution. It will help to understand the life situation of clients of "Dům na půli cesty"...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} and substantial {{growth of the}} microwave (MW) telecommunication industry has boosted the demand for dielectric resonators. Dielectrically loaded antennae for mobile handsets require 25 ? ?r ? 120, Q×fo > 5, 000 GHz, and ?f = ± 10 ppm/°C. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of various substitutions on the crystal structure, microstructure and MW dielectric properties of Ca 5 Nb 5 O 17 -based ceramics for dielectrically loaded antennae. The samples were prepared via a solid state reaction method and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and vector network analyzer (VNA). Na substituted Ca 5 Nb 5 O 17 (i. e. NaCa 4 Nb 5 O 17) formed single phase ceramics with monoclinic (P 21 /b) structure. The maximum intensities XRD peaks changed with increasing sintering temperature which was previously ascribed to the orthorhombic (Pnnm) symmetry; however, the Rietveld analysis showed that the change in peak intensities was due to the preferred orientation of the (0, 10, 0) plane, consistent with the change in microstructure with an increase in sintering temperature from 1200 to 1350 oC. The optimum MW dielectric properties of NaCa 4 Nb 5 O 17 were measured to be ?r 44, Q×fo 13, 838 GHz and ?f - 120 ppm/°C. The entire substitution of Ta for Nb was useful in decreasing its negative ?f towards zero and the optimum MW dielectric properties (?r 41, Q×fo 11, 595 GHz and ?f - 13. 9 ppm/°C) were achieved for monoclinic (P 21 /b) NaCa 4 Ta 5 O 17. Partial substitution of K for <b>Na</b> was also <b>tried</b> to decrease the high negative ?f (- 120 ppm/°C) of NaCa 4 Nb 5 O 17 and a number of compounds in the Na 1 -xKxCa 4 Nb 5 O 17 (x = 0 - 1) composition series were investigated. At x = 0. 25 and 0. 75, CaNb 2 O 6 was detected as a second phase along with the major (Na,K) Ca 4 Nb 5 O 17 phase. K was useful in decreasing the high negative ?f. The microstructural analysis revealed the formation of rod-shaped grains. The optimum MW dielectric properties (i. e. ?r 47, Q×fo 5047 GHz and ?f - 23 ppm/°C) were obtained at x = 0. 5 which indicated that ?f could be tuned through zero at x = 0. 54. The substitution of Sr for Ca in NaCa 4 Nb 5 O 17 (i. e. NaCa 4 -xSrxNb 5 O 17 with x = 0 4) gave optimum MW dielectric properties (i. e. ?r 57, Q×fo 4628 GHz and ?f - 41 ppm/°C at x = 1). Here again ?f could tuned through zero at x = 1. 4. The crystal structure changed from monoclinic (P 21 /b) to orthorhombic symmetry (x ? 2). Other substitutions like La and Nd with Na/Ca at the A-site, and Ti with Nb at the B-sites of Ca 5 Nb 5 O 17 were also tried but these attempts were not successful in achieving phase pure layered perovskites. Therefore, Nb was entirely replaced by Ti, Ga and Al, and Na/Ca by La and Sr with general formulae La 5 -xSrxTi 4 +xGa 1 -xO 17 (x = 0 - 1) and La 5 -xSrxTi 4 +xAl 1 -xO 17 (x = 0 0. 3). The sintered compounds were single phase with an orthorhombic structure. The microstructure comprised elongated rods and plate-like grains. The optimum MW dielectric properties (?r 51. 02, Q×fo 15290 GHz and ?f - 2. 2 ppm/°C) for La 5 xSrxTi 4 +xGa 1 -xO 17 were achieved at x = 0. 5. Similarly, La 5 -xSrxTi 4 +xAlxO 17 exhibited ?r 47. 07, Q×fo 16678 GHz and ?f - 4. 8 ppm/°C at x = 0. 25...|$|R

Amplia-se a necessidade de estudos que demonstrem de que modo a Informática, como ferramenta pedagógica no contexto escolar, pode contribuir para a construção do conhecimento. Cada educador tem sido levado a realizar profunda reflexão em seus valores e a repensar sua prática, pois a ferramenta exige a postura de mediador e orientador do processo de construção do conhecimento. Na busca de tornar o mundo compreensível, a Informática pode ajudar o aluno a conhecer e começar a operar com aqueles procedimentos e explicações que, como ciência, as Geociências produzem. Assim, é {{fundamental}} o uso de diferentes recursos na busca de informações e como forma de expressar interpretações, hipóteses e 'conceitos. Com o objetivo de investigar o uso da Informática no desenvolvimento de conteúdos de Geociências, buscou-se criar condições para que o Professor atuasse como mediador entre o aluno e a informação, o aluno passasse a ser um sujeito ativo no processo de construção do conhecimento e a máquina, por sua vez, se tornasse a ferramenta que subsidiaria o processo. O eixo norteador do trabalho fora a Informática como ferramenta para o aluno desenvolver um conjunto de tarefas por intermédio do computador. A metodologia consiste na sensibilização do Professor para o uso da Informática com aplicações práticas e reflexivas na ilustração das aulas, elaboração de trabalhos e, sobretudo como eficiente recurso na construção do conhecimento em Geociências. A experiência oferece argumentos e reflexões sobre a nova postura do Professor frente ao uso da Informática: (1) os benefícios que este recurso possa trazer à Educação e os desafios a superar; (2) a ampliação das capacidades intelectuais do homem diante das possibilidades que a tecnologia oferece; (3) o desenvolvimento de competência para se trabalhar com informações, pesquisa-las, associa-las e aplica-las às situações de interesse; (4) a gênese do conhecimentoIt {{has been}} broadIy recognized that technoIogical deveIopment caused transformations, impacts and challenges in many knowIedge fieIds, which incIude Education. The {{objective of this}} research is to evaluate the use of computer for the deveIopment of Geosciences contents. Since computers have been adopted as a pedagogical tooI in the schooI context, every educator has been Ied to cany through a deep reflection in his/her values and to rethink his/her practices. Students need to use computers to acquire knowIedge as Iong as the teacher should supervise them as the process deveIops. The tooI demands the person who orientates the process (the teacher) to assume a position of mediator. Therefore it can be found a growing need for studies on whether computers can effectiveIy contribute for the construction of the knowIedge. Computers can heIp students to understand many procedures and scientific expIanations produced by Geosciences ando at the same time, they can offer different resources for the search of information and as a way to communicate interpretations, hypotheses and concepts. The investigation was carried out &om the point-of-view of <b>na</b> assistant who <b>tried</b> to create conditions for the teacher to act as the process of the construction in knowIedge of the machine., by its tom, became the tooI that would subsidize the processo The methodoIogy incIudes, first, the sensitization of the professor for the use of computers; as a second and resulting stage, many practical and reflexive applications for illustration of Iessons and elaboration of works have been derived.

The investigation alIows recognizing that computers are na efficient resource in the search and treatment of specific information and knowIedge.
