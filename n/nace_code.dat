30|$|The {{first step}} {{required}} was the cleaning of the NACE codes attached to enterprises. This was necessary as in some cases, employment records of workers {{working for the}} same firm (as given by its enterprise code) had been assigned different NACE codes. Moreover, over time, some firms change their NACE codes; {{this is not necessarily}} due to error—if firms change their product mix, their <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> should change—but it will cause complications if the sectoral composition of firms changes over time. For this reason, a two stage procedure to produce ‘corrected’ NACE codes was employed. In the first stage, within each year, the modal value of NACE over each employment record for a given enterprise was calculated, and within each establishment this <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> was substituted for the recorded <b>NACE</b> <b>code.</b> In the second stage, the modal value of the <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> for each enterprise over all years of data was calculated, and again, that modal value was used to replace the recorded value {{in the case of a}} discrepancy between the two.|$|E

30|$|<b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> give us good {{information}} about {{the activity of the}} facilities operated by shippers on their own-account, because all these facilities are logistics facilities that serve the core activity of the shipper. However, <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> are often inappropriate tools to distinguish between logistics facilities operated by logistics providers depending on their activities, for two reasons. First, some <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> are too broad compared to the segmentation of the logistics market. Four <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> (49.41 A, 49.41 B, 52.10 B, 52.29 B, see Table 1) describe 44 % of logistics facilities of the database, but give little {{information about the}} market segment of their operators, and no information {{about the role of the}} facility in the transport networks of their operator when the facility is part of such a network. Second, <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> are self-referenced by the companies, and two facilities operated by the same kind of company (and sometimes the same company) for the same activity can be described by two different <b>NACE</b> <b>codes.</b> Even if some <b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> describe a specific activity (as 59.29 A, see Table 1), some facilities that are used for this activity may not be described by these codes but by generic ones (as 49.41 B, 49.41 A or 52.29 B, see Table 1).|$|R

30|$|First, all {{employment}} {{records for}} whom the legal form of the job was ‘statutory body’ were classified as public sector. Next, employment records with the following NACE codes were classified as public sector: 6411; 8411 – 8430; 8520; 8531; 8532. Next, employment records with legal form not equal to ‘private limited company’ and with the following NACE codes were classified as public sector: 8542; 8610; 8690; 9101; 9102. Next, employment records with the following NACE codes were classified as semi-state: 0240; 0892; 3513; 4910; 4931; 5310. Next, employment records for the largest firms (in terms of employment) {{within each of the}} following NACE codes were classified as semi-state: 3511; 3523; 4939; 5223; 6020; 6512. Next, employment records for firms with <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> 5222 and with legal form equal to ‘statutory body’ were reclassified as semi-state. Finally, the employment records of any firm that had a valid <b>NACE</b> <b>code,</b> a missing legal form value, and that had not been assigned a value for the public sector variable by the above procedure were classified as private sector.|$|E
30|$|Because of the {{different}} wage-setting mechanisms that pertain in {{the public and private}} sectors, we supplement our overall analysis with separate examinations of these sectors. While there is no public sector identifier in the JC data, the enterprise’s <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> and its ownership structure can be combined to give a good indication of which sector an individual works in.

3000|$|We {{define the}} public sector as <b>NACE</b> <b>Code</b> L, which is [...] "Public Administration and defence, {{compulsory}} social security" [...] (Public Administration for short). The remaining NACE categories are defined as private and we conduct most of our analysis in these terms. However, {{in light of the}} fact that, in some countries, some portion of the health and education sectors is public, we pay special attention to NACE categories M (Education), and N (Health, social work). There is no public sector indicator in the data and it is, therefore, impossible to define and analyse the broader public sector with precision. In our sample, for most countries, the health and education sectors have a pay disadvantage, suggesting that policy concern should be focused on Public Administration relative to the remaining sectors.|$|E
30|$|There are {{limitations}} to both approaches. First, studies on specific logistics services {{have the advantage}} of using very definite and often precise datasets. But, by nature, their perspective on logistics activities is narrowed by the scope of their analysis. Second, the use of generic establishment databases creates several challenges that are difficult to overcome [29]. Depending on the purpose of the file (administrative, fiscal, commercial) and the methodology of investigation (self-administered, surveyed, observed), the precision of <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> can be very inconsistent [29], because “the complexity of modern supply chain and logistics presents difficulties in defining facilities and sites that house logistics activities” [8]. Then, a significant portion of logistics and transport services are performed on own account by the shippers themselves. These shippers, who belong to various sectors (industry, wholesaling, retail, agriculture…), can have their own warehouses which are not coded as logistics activities, but rather are registered with the company’s activity code.|$|E

We first distinguish three innovation system functions (knowledge exploitation, knowledge exploration, and organizational control) operating in regions and study their interactions using entropy statistics. The functions and their interactions are measured by analysing the distribution of firms in terms of geographical location, organizational size (number of employees), technologies (<b>NACE</b> <b>codes</b> of the OECD), and ownership (foreign versus domestic share in registered stock) in the 2005. Synergy is defined as mutual information among the three dimensions; a fourth dimension is added {{in order to bring}} internationalization (FDI) into the model. The factor is relevant since the four-dimensional model explains the GDP contributions to regional development in Hungary, whereas the three-dimensional model does not.

While a small transport terminal delivering the outer suburbs of the Paris region and an international hub in Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport may be operated by the same company, share the same <b>NACE</b> <b>code</b> and have essentially the same activity (transshipment), their roles in their respective transport networks are completely different, as are their potential for relocation, and the flows of goods they are generating. Considering the prominent place of this activity in urban logistics, public policy seeking to ensure the sustainability of parcels and isolated pallet deliveries at the local scale should consider the structures of the groupage networks that enable the sustainability of parcels and isolated pallets transportation at a regional, continental, or global scale. Given the concentration of activities in Paris (the localization of facilities delivering Paris and up to 20 [*]km in its suburbs), the size of Paris region (several transport terminals for each groupage network), Paris’s place in the French highway network (presence of regional hubs) and the European airport network (presence of global hubs), understanding the deployment of groupage transport networks in the Paris region requires taking account of all geographic scales, from the global to the local.|$|E

Based on our findings on this exploratory study we also aim {{to search for}} theoretical explanation of the observed behaviour and to give insights to support future development of quantitative measurements of initial business models. Design: The paper is empirically investigating initial configurations and business models of NTBFs {{in the first years}} of start-up, with data compiled from case studies of 8 Swedish NTBFs. Firms were selected based on Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (<b>NACE)</b> <b>codes</b> considered high-tech and the year of founding. Findings: The study illustrate how founders structure their business activities in the start-up, and which components of the business model that they consider most important (e. g. identify value proposition and create relationship to customers). We could also recognise signs of isomorphic behaviour among the NTBFs, which suggest that institutional theory could be a fruitful area for future research on business models. Originality/value: The paper adds value to business model research by describing how NTBFs’ structure their initial business activities and which dimensions of the initially business model that are perceived as more crucial during the early years of NTBFs. Furthermore, we also contribute to future development of quantitative measurements of initial business models. </html...|$|R
40|$|MultiREG is a multiregional {{input-output}} {{model that}} extends previous work on single-region models for Austria both in its geographic scope and its theoretical foundations. In a first version {{the model was}} completed in late 2004 and has already been used in long-term economic projections {{as well as in}} regional impact analysis. MultiREG is based on make and use tables for the nine Austrian regions (Bundesländer), distinguishing between 57 activities and commodities (2 -digit <b>NACE</b> <b>codes),</b> which in the model itself are aggregated to 32 groups. These tables, as well as a matrix of interregional trade relations (for which a dedicated survey among Austrian firms was conducted), are derived for the year 2000. A block of econometric equations, which were estimated on regional time series of key variables (e. g., sectoral output, value added, investment, or employment), introduces strong dynamic elements into the static input-output framework. This block comprises private consumption and investment as well as cost functions which were derived in a General Leontief cost function framework. Additional dynamic adjustment is introduced by implementing time-varying input coefficients into the model.
