5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> to the Ronald Reagan Washington <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> with the law specifying that no money be spent to {{implement}} the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change {{the name of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> Station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Blue Line {{began on}} July 1, 1977, on 18 {{stations}} between <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> in Arlington and Stadium-Armory in Washington – the first link of the Metro to Virginia. The line was extended by three stations to Addison Road on November 22, 1980. Service south of <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> began on June 15, 1991 when Van Dorn Street opened. The original {{plan for the}} line was completed when this link was extended to Franconia–Springfield on June 29, 1997. Two new stations in Maryland – Morgan Boulevard and Largo Town Center – opened on December 18, 2004.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Orange Line {{began on}} November 20, 1978 between <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> and New Carrollton, with five new {{stations}} {{being added to}} the existing network from Stadium–Armory. When the line from Rosslyn to Ballston–MU was completed on December 11, 1979, Orange Line trains began following this route rather than going to the <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> station. The line was completed on June 7, 1986, when it was extended by four stations to Vienna in the I-66 median.|$|E
50|$|On June 5, 1948, Republic Act 224 {{created the}} <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> Corporation which {{was charged with}} the {{management}} and operations of all <b>national</b> <b>airports.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Canadian Airports Council (CAC) is the Canadian trade {{association}} for Canada's airports and {{a division of}} Airports Council International-North America. Formed in 1991, as the devolution of airports to local control was beginning under Canada's <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> Policy, the CAC has 46 members that represent more than 180 airports. These include all of the <b>airports</b> in Canada's <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> System and other commercial airports in every province and territory.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} earthquake, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop along the East Coast, causing some flight delays. The Air Traffic Control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. Flights were delayed at several airports, {{including}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington <b>National</b> <b>Airport,</b> Dulles International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At Ronald Reagan <b>National</b> <b>Airport,</b> ceiling tiles fell in one terminal, and flights were halted.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1943, the {{aircraft}} {{was displayed at}} Washington <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> as a war prize. In 1944, it was recalled to North Island {{for use as a}} training plane for rookie pilots being sent to the Pacific. A model 52 Zero, captured during the liberation of Guam, was later used as well.|$|E
5|$|On January 20, 2003, during {{construction}} of a new canopy at the <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> station, Metro began running trains through the center track even though it had not been constructed for standard operations, and a Blue Line train derailed at the switch. No injuries resulted but the crash delayed construction by a number of weeks.|$|E
50|$|Part of the <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> System, {{the airport}} is owned by Transport Canada and {{operated}} by the Greater Fredericton Airport Authority.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, Transport Canada {{also began}} privatizing the {{operation}} of large airports, and divesting itself of small airports altogether (typically handing them over to municipalities). Following the 1994 <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> Policy, Transport Canada retains ownership of most airports with 200,000 or more annual passenger movements, {{as well as the}} primary airports serving the federal, provincial, and territorial capitals, but leases most of these airports (which make up the <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> System) to outside operators; currently, there are 26 airports in the system.|$|R

5|$|From {{its opening}} on November 20, 1978, until December 11, 1979, the Orange Line was co-aligned with the Blue Line from <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> to Stadium-Armory, with the Orange Line {{continuing}} east from Stadium-Armory to New Carrollton. Beginning December 1, 1979, the Orange Line diverged westward from Rosslyn to Ballston. The Blue and Orange Lines remain co-aligned from Rosslyn to Stadium-Armory and the Silver Line is co-signed {{along the same}} route as well.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2007, Vick was {{scheduled}} to lobby on Capitol Hill, hoping to persuade lawmakers to increase funding for after-school programs. Vick missed a connecting flight in Atlanta on Monday to Reagan <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> in Arlington, Virginia. He {{failed to show up}} for another seat booked for him later that evening. On Tuesday morning, he did not attend his scheduled appearance at a congressional breakfast where he was to be honored for his foundation's work with after-school projects in Georgia and Virginia. Vick's mother, Brenda, accepted the award from the Afterschool Alliance.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> Policy of 1994 {{turned over}} control of 90 {{airports}} to local organizations. Additionally, air navigation services were sold in 1996 to Nav Canada, a private organization.|$|R

5|$|Service on the Yellow Line {{began on}} April 30, 1983, adding Archives {{to the system}} and linking the two already-built {{stations}} of Gallery Place and Pentagon with a bridge across the Potomac River. It was extended beyond <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> by four stations to Huntington on December 17, 1983, the first station outside of the Capital Beltway. When the Green Line link to U Street opened on May 11, 1991, it acted {{as an extension of}} the Yellow Line until the southern Green Line branch was completed. When Green Line service began, the Yellow Line was truncated at Mount Vernon Square, where a pocket track exists to relay trains.|$|E
5|$|The line shares tracks {{with the}} Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza northward to Fort Totten. It {{is a quick}} link between {{downtown}} Washington and <b>National</b> <b>Airport,</b> and shares nearly all of its track with either the Green or Blue Line. The Yellow Line has only two stations that are not shared by any other lines (Eisenhower Avenue and Huntington), and only two sections of track that are not shared by any other lines – the section {{at the south end}} of the line, and the section between the Pentagon and L'Enfant Plaza stations, crossing the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Doria dropped 3.85inches (98mm) {{of rain in}} Washington <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> in Washington, D.C. In Maryland, {{the storm}} {{resulted}} in tides 2.7feet (0.8m) above normal in Fort McHenry. Rainfall in the state peaked at 4.39inches (112mm) in Baltimore, while wind gusts reached a maximum of 63mph (101km/h) at the United States Coast Guard station in Ocean City. The storm produced 5.09inches (129mm) of rain in Wilmington, Delaware and a storm tide of 3.2feet (1m) above normal in Lewes. In Pennsylvania, the passage of Tropical Storm Doria resulted in 6.57inches (167mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 73mph (117km/h) in Philadelphia. Moderate winds downed trees and power lines in Pennsylvania, and one person died in the state. Several rivers in the southeastern portion of the state experienced record-breaking flooding.|$|E
50|$|Following the new <b>National</b> <b>Airports</b> Policy {{announced}} by Transport Canada in 1994, {{ownership of the}} airport was transferred to a private corporation, Développement de l'aéroport Saint-Hubert de Longueuil (DASH-L), on 1 September 2004.|$|R

5|$|In June 2004, Fletcher's {{aircraft}} {{caused a}} security scare that triggered a brief evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court building. Shortly after takeoff {{en route to}} memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan, the transponder on Fletcher's plane malfunctioned, leading officials at Reagan <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace. Two F-15 fighters were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher's plane was escorted to its destination by two Blackhawk helicopters. The plane, a 33-year-old Beechcraft King Air, was the oldest of its model still in operation. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher's plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted air space. The investigation determined that miscommunication by air traffic controllers sparked the panic, and {{in the aftermath of}} the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.|$|E
5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan <b>National</b> <b>Airport</b> arrived within minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E
5|$|Gusty winds downed several trees across Alexandria, causing about $2million {{in damage}} (2003USD, $2.3million 2008USD). In Arlington County, {{flooding}} and downed trees destroyed twohouses and damaged 192homes, 46severely. The storm surge flooded {{a parking lot}} at the Reagan <b>National</b> <b>Airport.</b> Damage in the county totaled $2.5million (2003USD, $2.9million 2008USD). Falling trees caused major damage to 15homes in the city of Fairfax, and damage throughout Fairfax County totaled $18million (2003USD, $21million 2008USD). Four homes and 20businesses in King George County were severely damaged, with an additional 150–200 reporting lesser damage from winds and falling trees. Gusty winds forced the closure of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge. In Prince William County, seven homes were destroyed, with 24homes and three businesses experiencing major damage. Several roads were closed due to downed trees. The Marine Corps Base Quantico reported severe damage amounting to $9.5million (2003USD, $11million 2008USD). Damage included a destroyed marina from flooding, with falling trees damaging buildings and vehicles. Additionally, fallen trees severely damaged 31homes and caused minor damage to 68more in Stafford County. The roof of a shelter in Mathews County was partially blown off. A power outage in Northumberland County caused the NOAA Weather Radio Station in Heathsville to go off the air {{during the height of the}} storm, leaving the transmitter out of service for several days.|$|E
