Since Dassault {{was one of the}} major clients of IBM in France, an agreement was negotiated for IBM to sell CATIA. It was a <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> with 50/50 revenue sharing where CATIA would be sold by IBM as an IBM product. This agreement was extremely successful for both companies and it is considered [...] "one of the fundamental success factors in the history of Dassault Systèmes".|$|E

30|$|Although the {{original}} design and its intellectual property was developed and retained by CSIR, the effort was made so as to allow and encourage crowdsourcing the design improvement of the soleckshaw through <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licencing.</b> The experience of the user in developing a newer prototype for design improvement and commercialisation was crowdsourced. As a result, large number of variants of the electric rickshaw came into the market through technology diffusion; this technology diffusion was propelled through open innovation whereby manufacturers could modify and improve the existing design thereby creating a large market share and allowing rapid proliferation.|$|R

The Lord Chancellor's Department are considering options for the future marketing of the Statute Law Database. These options include free Internet access, the granting of <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licences</b> to legal information publishers and the provision of a subscription on-line service." [...] In September a demonstration version of the database was made available on the Syntegra Track Record website, containing legislation for the years 1985 to 1995, though this was quickly removed.|$|R
30|$|Innovation is {{a process}} of {{integrated}} thinking. The interactions between technology, market and the need for technology remain unconnected. Connecting these unconnected dots leads to a market disruption, paving the way for an economically viable innovation. India has various national-level programmes that foster innovation environments for the creation of economic empowerment. This paper looks at one such innovation: the soleckshaw: solar electric rickshaw. The emergence of these electric rickshaws came from enhancing the design of already existing cycle rickshaws to create better rickshaws, which are socially acceptable as they reduce human drudgery and are environment friendly, leaving a low-carbon footprint. The case being highlighted here, that existing knowledge connected with existing technology to address a need, leads to new consumers and new markets and eventually causing a technology-led policy intervention. The paper also looks at the role <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licencing</b> plays in the absorption and dissemination of an innovation.|$|R

This range was later abandoned, but the company then {{obtained}} a <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> to produce hardback Doctor Who short story collections. Eventually, this licence ended, and the collections went out of print. The company subsequently returned to Benny books and other Doctor Who spin-offs, but have kept with the hardback format.|$|E

30|$|The soleckshaw {{disrupted}} the rickshaw market by demonstrating {{that there is}} a need to change the existing cycle rickshaw model and allowing technology to intervene. Supported by a liberal technology transfer agreement with a nominal fee, the <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licencing</b> and crowdsourcing of the design improvement effort allowed for the rapid proliferation of the electric rickshaw into the market, and since the assembly technology already existed, the commercialisation was easy. The project did so by adhering to standard rules and regulations. The endeavour shows how technology directs policy initiatives; the existing policy comes under scrutiny, and their redundancy gets tested when a market disruption occurs. The ability of decision makers to adapt simultaneously to the changing market would allow technologies to reach a wider consumer base and diffuse easily. This is an ideal example of how innovation ecosystem plays an important role in market acceptability of any product.|$|R

In 1999, Big Finish obtained a <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> to produce official Doctor Who plays, beginning with the multi-Doctor story The Sirens of Time.

5000|$|Robert Elz {{had been}} {{assigned}} the role of administrator of the [...]au top-level domain by Jon Postel since 1989, an arrangement that worked quite satisfactorily through the early 1990s when the Internet was largely of interest only to tertiary educational and research institutions. The AFR article caused Melbourne University {{to be aware of}} the possible commercial value of the rights to assign domain names, but also of the damage to the University’s reputation if the registration of com.au domain names was not transferred to a competent commercial organization. The Head of the Computer Science Department persuaded Mr Elz to transfer the administration of com.au names to the University’s subsidiary Melbourne IT, which he did by way of a <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licence,</b> to be reviewed after five years. Melbourne IT was awarded a grant of $100,000 by the Government of Victoria in 1996 in return for registering the backlog of over 2,000 com.au applications free to the applicants, and used this money to build its first domain name registration software platform.|$|E
40|$|A key {{controversy}} in negotiating the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, and the likely long-term {{effectiveness of the}} agreement, {{is the way in}} which the intellectual property provisions are interpreted and applied to the key genetic resources forming the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system of International Agricultural Research Centres' (IARC) collections. This paper reviews the intellectual property provisions in the treaty and examines the likely consequences from patenting under the Patents Act 1990 over materials derived from these collections. The consequence is argued to be significant and, over time, these practices are likely to deplete the usefulness of these collections and undermine the relevance of the treaty. The paper concludes that Australia's interests might best be served by arguing that access to these collections, and the other materials under the treaty, be subject to a <b>non-exclusive,</b> royalty free <b>licence</b> for any use of the derived materials to develop useful new plant varieties.

E-learning research, as an emergent field in the UK, is highly political in nature (Conole & Oliver, 2007, p. 6) occupying a complex landscape which houses policy-makers, researchers and practitioners. Increasingly and more interestingly, the landscape is being shaped by the narratives and experiences of the learners themselves (Creanor et al., 2006, Conole et al., 2006) {{and the use of}} Web 2. 0 technologies. However, as Laurillard (2007, p. xv) reminds us we still, ‘tend to use technology to support traditional modes of teaching’ and ‘we scarcely have the infrastructure, the training, the habits or the access to the new technology, to be optimising its use just yet’ (p. 48). Web 2. 0 spaces, literacies and practices offer the possibility for new models of education (Mayes & de Freitas, 2007, p. 13) which support iterative and integrative learning but as educators and higher educational establishments are we prepared and ready to re-think our pedagogies and re-do (Beetham & Sharpe 2007, p. 3) our practices? This concise paper will reflect upon how the use of new learning landscapes such as eportfolios might offer us the opportunity to reflect upon the implications of letting in the e-learning eportfolio Trojan mouse (Sharpe & Oliver, 2007, p. 49) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of an {{analysis}} of 80 copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) with particular regard to their effect on author self-archiving. It shows the number of CTAs asking for copyright assignment, the time of assignment and what happens when copyright cannot be assigned. It outlines the warranties required of the author, and the exceptions granted back to the author by which they may use their own work. In particular it focuses on the number of CTAs allowing self-archiving and the conditions under which they may do so. It concludes that whether an author can safely self-archive or not depends on a complex matrix of the following factors: i) whether copyright assignment or a <b>non-exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> is required; ii) the time of copyright assignment; iii) if (and when) CTA?s actually allow self-archiving; iv) if publishers do not allow self-archiving, but do not see it as ?prior publication?; v) whether the preprint is legally a separate copyright work to the refereed postprint; and vi) whether the author wishes to self-archive a pre-print, postprint or both...|$|E
