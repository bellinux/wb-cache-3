We discuss a chain of developments building on real number theorem proving in PVS. This leads from the verification of aspects of an air traffic control system, through work on the integration of computer algebra and automated theorem proving to a new tool, NRV, first presented here that builds on the capabilities of Maple and PVS to provide a verified and automatic analysis of <b>Nichols</b> <b>plots.</b> This automates a standard technique used by control engineers and greatly improves assurance compared with the traditional method of visual inspection of the <b>Nichols</b> <b>plots.</b> Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|In {{feedback}} control design, {{the plot is}} useful for assessing the stability and robustness of a linear system.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{discussion}} on the robustness and performance properties of a proportional-derivative controller applied to a very flexible joint. Because of the flexible mode due to in-joint compliance, the classical collocated control does not allow to obtain good rigid mode dynamics with a correct phase margin in low and high frequency, and the non-collocated control does not allow to damp correctly the rotor mode. The simultaneous analysis of discrete root loci and <b>Nichols</b> <b>plots</b> leads to a phase control law with a derivative term built from both input and output velocities. Simulations taking into account various real non-linearities and measurement imperfections are proposed to validate this improved control design...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{characterization}} of low-pass linear filters is nowadays {{a simple question}} relying on eigenvalue criteria, Bode diagram, Nyquist or <b>Nichols</b> <b>plots.</b> For nonlinear systems, the problem is more tricky. The present work tempts to develop a methodology for the {{characterization of}} " low-pass filtering " for nonlinear systems. Inspired by the DiPerna-Lions theory and relying on the theory of characteristics, the proposed method associates to the nonlinear ODE a linear transport PDE. A characterization of " low-pass filtering " is then deduced from developments on the PDE. Smooth ODE's of the form ẋ = F (x) are considered where the vector field F (x) is perturbed by an additive, rapidly oscillating, noise m which may have a big magnitude F (x + m). An intuitive observation is proved in this first contribution: if F has bounded derivatives, then the sensitivity of x to m decreases as the bound gets smaller or as m fluctuates faster...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{frequency}} domain analysis the describing function of a rate limiting element is derived using the Fourier transformation. A method is derived to calculate the describing function of the complete highly augmented aircraft system. The method is verified by a comparison with non-linear simulations in the time domain. The influence of rate limiting elements on handling qualities of augmented aircraft is discussed using five characteristic examples. The effects of rate saturation in the closed loop of the flight control system are presented by evaluations of the describing function in <b>Nichols</b> <b>plots.</b> Handling qualities evaluations using the Neal-Smith criterion show {{the effects of the}} rate limiters in the forward path of the flight control system on the tendency to pilot-induced oscillations. A new handling qualities criterion according to systems with rate saturation is proposed. (orig.)

NPS Hall of Fame author (Presented February 23, 2006) This thesis {{contains}} a compilation and comparison {{of some of}} the techniques in use today for synthesizing and analyzing servomechanisms. The techniques are divided into the categories of Trial and Error Design Methods and Analytical Design Methods. Trial and Error Design Methods include such items as Root Locus techniques, Bode and <b>Nichols</b> <b>plots,</b> and other frequency plane plots. Considerable space is devoted to the Mitrovic method and to the Ross-Warren/Mariotti technique of compensation. Analytical Design Methods are generally considered to be those which use some definition of error as a performance index, where the objective is to minimize (or maximize) the performance index. Considerable space is allocated to those methods published by Newton. Some effort is also devoted to the problem of obtaining a proper statement of specifications. [URL] Navy (U. S.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the formulation of}} a flight clearance criterion as a convex optimization problem. The criterion is the stability margins criterion which is specified as an allowable phase and gain margin of a certain loop transfer function. The satisfaction of the criterion amounts to the <b>Nichols</b> <b>plot</b> of the loop transfer function being outside a specified trapezoidal region. It was shown previously that the exclusion condition from an ellipsoidal region is implied by using the generalized stability margin bPC and its calculation was performed frequency-wise by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. In this paper we formulate the calculation of a lower bound on bPC as a convex optimization problem using Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) and avoid the gridding procedure in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we formulate the problem of obtaining a lower bound on the perturbed stability margin, which {{is defined as the}} worst-case bPCover variations in real uncertain parameters...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{effects have}} been studied on carbon steel in {{solutions}} containing different amines. These compounds were dissolved in some petroleum/water corrosive mixtures containing acetic acid and NaCl. Corrosion inhibition afforded by propylamine (PA), iso-propylamine (i-PA), butylamine (BA), tert-butylamine (t-BA), hexylamine (HA), ethylenediamine (EDA), diethanolamine (DEA), 3 -amino- 1 -propanol (3 -AP), 2 -dimethylethanolamine (2 -DEA), cyclohexylamine (CHA), N-methylcyclohexylamine (N-MCA) and dicyclohexylamine (DCHA), have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a carbon steel rotating disc electrode at 25 ºC. In the previous works, the corrosion inhibition behavior of aliphatic and cyclic substituents amines has not been compared. The aim of this work is to introduce a simple graphical approach for comparison of corrosion inhibition behavior of the above mentioned amine compounds. The complex plane and Bode plots were {{used for this study}} but these graphical methods were not adequate to understand the effect of inhibition behavior due to small structural changes in the amines. Therefore, a logarithm of impedance magnitude versus phase angle (<b>Nichols)</b> <b>plot</b> of EIS data was used for this purpose and the results showed that this graphical method provides a good interpretation of corrosion inhibition behavior. Finally, a guideline to select the best inhibitor for carbon steel protection in petroleum/water system was drawn...|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} half of the twentieth century {{information}} engineers developed the fundamental theory of electronic circuit and filter design, telecommunications, signal processing, and control engineering. Much of this theory was rooted in linear differential equations, complex variable theory, and Fourier and Laplace transforms. Yet when it came to practical design, engineers developed a range of techniques that enabled them to exploit the power of the mathematical models underpinning their technological devices and systems without recourse to the classic formalism of the mathematics. Many of these techniques were graphical in nature, such as: the normalised time and frequency response curves of linear systems; the Bode <b>Plots,</b> <b>Nichols</b> Charts and pole-zero plots used in circuit and control system design; the Smith Chart and signal constellation diagrams used in telecommunications; and so on. These methods led to engineers talking a new language based on the characteristics of the graphical representations. Rather surprisingly, the humble decibel, originally a simple logarithmic expression of sound intensity, proved a particularly useful measure in this new graphical world. This paper will demonstrate how these quintessentially engineering tools freed designers in the information engineering field from having to solve differential equations or deal with the niceties of complex variable theory. Perhaps rather surprisingly, most of these techniques have recently achieved a new lease of life as part of the interface between modern computer-aided design tools and designers themselves. ...|$|R
