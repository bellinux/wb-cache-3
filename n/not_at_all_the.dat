5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E

25|$|Prominent {{blood vessels}} (telangiectasia) {{over the white}} (sclera) of the eyes usually occur {{by the age of}} 5–8 years, but {{sometimes}} later or <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> absence of telangiectasia does not exclude the diagnosis of A-T. Potentially a cosmetic problem, the ocular telangiectasia do not bleed or itch, though they are sometimes misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis. It is their constant nature, not changing with time, weather or emotion, that marks them as different from other visible blood vessels. Telangiectasia can also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin, especially the face and ears. They occur in the bladder as a late complication of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, have been seen deep inside the brain of older people with A-T, and occasionally arise in the liver and lungs.|$|E
25|$|When his {{reconnaissance}} parties made {{no contact}} with the enemy at the Guadalquivir, Vedel concluded that Reding had shifted his division to another point along the line. Dufour sent back alarming reports from Guarromán, convincing Vedel that 10,000 Spaniards—perhaps Reding's division, he warned—were marching on the mountains to their rear. This was too much. Gathering his exhausted division, Vedel hurried to Dufour's aid on July 17, arriving at Santa Carolina the next day. Dufour's fatal blunder was soon revealed. Vedel discovered that the small band of irregulars roaming about were <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> threat Dufour had described; {{for the third time}} the Spaniards had stolen a march from him, and Reding still hovered somewhere around Mengibar, out of sight. Worse yet, an enormous gap now existed between Dupont and Vedel, and not a single battalion remained to prevent Reding from seizing the central position at Bailén.|$|E

25|$|Android's {{source code}} is {{released}} by Google under an open source license, although most Android devices ultimately ship {{with a combination}} of free and open source and proprietary software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services. Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices. Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. The extensive variation of hardware in Android devices causes significant delays for software upgrades, with new versions of the operating system and security patches typically taking months before reaching consumers, or sometimes <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> success of Android has made it a target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, several {{developments}} in observational cosmology, especially {{the discovery of}} the accelerating universe from distant supernovae in 1998 (in addition to independent evidence from the cosmic microwave background and large galaxy redshift surveys), have shown that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to dark energy. While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> cosmological constant is the simplest possible form of dark energy since it is constant in both space and time, and this leads to the current standard model of cosmology known as the Lambda-CDM model, which provides a good fit to many cosmological observations.|$|E
500|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to broadly [...] in shape, covered with small wart-like {{projections}} (tubercules), and have dimensions of 6–8.5 by 5.5–8µm.

500|$|He commented later: [...] "I took an {{appointment}} to the bench, as did a number of liberal judges, {{and we had to}} uphold the law of the country. It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> moral dilemma came up when I had to apply the law." [...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts. There was a fine dividing line between applying moral standards and promoting political doctrines, but Goldstone believed that [...] "in my view, if a judge is to err, it should be on the side of defending morality." [...] He took the view that [...] "judges have a duty to act morally, and if they're dealing with laws which have an unjust effect, I think it's their duty – if they can, within the powers they've got legitimately – to interpret the laws and give judgments which will make them less harsh and less unjust." [...] Being a judge in apartheid-era South Africa was a challenge, but it had its rewards; [...] "I hated in the morning the thought of having to do this for another day, [...] {{by the end of the}} day, I was exhilarated at the reaction and how important the work was." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> (<b>the</b> World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a {{perceived}} lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been [...] "100% in support of Diệm". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow [...] "the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt." [...] In May 1961, Nhu said [...] "he least you can say ... is that the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> attitude the President would have expected". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to [...] "unify all elements of the country", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying [...] "You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting", accusing them having [...] "duped" [...] innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the Times of Vietnaman English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponentsto meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of [...] "American support of and complicity in the coup". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers.|$|E
