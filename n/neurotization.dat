50|$|Brachial plexus {{injuries}} {{can cause}} paralysis to various {{regions in the}} arm, forearm, and hand depending on the severed nerves. The resulting palsy has been clinically treated using the phrenic nerve as a donor for <b>neurotization</b> of the musculocutaneous nerve and the median nerve. This treatment has a high success rate (84.6%) in partial to full restoration of the innervation to the damaged nerve. Furthermore, this procedure has resulted in restored function to nerves in the brachial plexus with minimal impact to respiratory function of the phrenic nerve. The instances where pulmonary vital capacity is reduced have typically been a result of use of the right phrenic as the donor for the <b>neurotization</b> whereas use of left phrenic nerve has not been significantly linked to reduced pulmonary vital capacity.|$|E
40|$|In severe {{obstetrical}} {{brachial plexus}} palsy with proximal nerve root involvement, {{there is an}} insufficient number of motor axons to reconstruct the entire plexus, and <b>neurotization</b> procedures are the only possibility to achieve useful upper extremity function. One of the most useful <b>neurotization</b> procedures is intercostal nerve transfer. In our practice, intercostal nerve transfer was used for direct <b>neurotization</b> of primary nerve targets or for <b>neurotization</b> of transferred muscles. The best results were seen after intercostal nerve transfer to musculocutaneous nerve and triceps branch.

40|$|AbstractContralateral C 7 (CC 7) <b>neurotization</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} approach for brachial plexus injury (BPI). Patients can achieve relatively good grasping function driven by the proximal extrinsic hand muscle (flexor digitorum, FD) after CC 7 <b>neurotization,</b> whereas the thumb opposition function driven by the distal intrinsic muscle (abductor pollicis brevis, APB) is poor. The present study aimed to investigate the brain reorganization patterns of the recovery processes of intrinsic and extrinsic hand functions after repairing the median nerve by CC 7 <b>neurotization.</b> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to evaluate the cerebral plasticity in one BPI patient after CC 7 <b>neurotization.</b> After the CC 7 <b>neurotization,</b> the patient showed improvements in the paralyzed hand. Combination of TMS and fMRI investigations demonstrated different cortical reshaping patterns of APB and FD. It was also found that the activated cortical areas of FD were located in bilateral motor cortices, but the area of APB was only located in ipsilateral motor cortex. The cerebral plasticity procedure appeared to be different in the gross and fine motor function recovery processes.

40|$|Early {{surgical}} {{intervention in}} obstetrical brachial plexus palsy started with sophisticated microsurgery techniques about 20 years ago. However, the indication {{for the operation}} is still controversial. A new classification of obstetrical brachial plexus palsy is advocated to establish systematic surgical planning. It {{is based on the}} mode of delivery and type of paralysis at 1 month old. It consists of four main types: type I, vertex delivery–upper type palsy; type II, vertex delivery–total type palsy, incomplete; type III, vertex delivery–total type palsy, complete; type IV, breech delivery–upper type palsy. Two types are added to cover the whole spectrum of this condition. Type O is neurapraxia and is clinically unimportant. Type V is a miscellaneous type, which should be considered individually. Most of the cases are classified into one of the four main types. The first priority for reconstruction is given to upper root function in types I and IV, posterior cord function in type II, and hand function in type III. The surgical procedure is intraplexal <b>neurotizations</b> in type I, and a combination of intraplexal and extraplexal <b>neurotizations</b> is a choice in types II and III. In type IV, extraplexal <b>neurotizations</b> are necessary. Surgical results are also discussed briefly in this article...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we present the {{outcomes}} of primary nerve reconstruction and results of secondary procedures performed to restore or enhance {{the function of the}} upper extremity. Ninety-nine patients were operated between 1978 and 2000; the results are analyzed for 84 patients with adequate follow-up. Seventy-five patients underwent 77 primary brachial plexus reconstructions and 24 patients underwent only secondary procedures. Nerve reconstruction included microneurolysis, direct end-to-end and direct end-to-side <b>neurotizations,</b> indirect <b>neurotizations</b> with interposition nerve grafting, and direct nerve-to-muscle <b>neurotizations.</b> Muscle (n[*]=[*] 135 pedicled and 48 free) and tendon (n[*]=[*] 80) transfers were used to enhance function. The results were analyzed in relation to the type of the injury (Erb's versus global paralysis) and the denervation time. The results of reconstruction showed improvement in all muscles tested at a statistically significant level (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The results were good and excellent for 84. 87 % of biceps, 73. 55 % of supraspinatus, 71 % of deltoid, and 67. 8 % of triceps restoration. The Mallet scores and the Gilbert-Raimondi scores improved after reconstruction in all patients at a statistically significant level. The outcomes in general were better if the number of avulsed roots was fewer. The denervation time (DT) affected primarily the outcome of the hand function.

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Neurotization</b> of denervated muscles {{has been}} shown to improve muscle bulk, but the {{neuronal}} regeneration response has not been compared previously in different surgical techniques of <b>neurotization.</b> Thus, using a rat model of experimental skeletal muscle denervation, we studied neuronal regeneration following sensory <b>neurotization</b> by two methods: sensory nerve to motor branch of muscle and direct sensory nerve implantation to muscle. Material and methods: The lateral head of the gas-trocnemius muscle was denervated in 36 rats, of which the first 12 served as denervated controls. In the second group of 12, the sural nerve was anastomozed to the motor branch of the gastrocnemius muscle (sensory-to-motor nerve <b>neurotization)</b> and in the remaining 12 rats the sural nerve was split into 4 fascicles and embedded into 4 quadrants of the muscle (direct sensory nerve-to-muscle <b>neurotization).</b> Immunohistochemistry was used to examine nerve fibers in muscle containing the sensory neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and general neuronal marker protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5). Results: Semiquantitative analysis showed that, compared to the control side, the number of nerve fibers on the experimental side was highest (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) for group III (direct sensory nerve-to-muscle <b>neurotization)</b> for all 3 markers.

The {{purposes of this}} study were to test the hypotheses that I) muscle-nerve-muscle (M-N-M) <b>neurotization</b> can be induced in feline laryngeal muscles and 2) M-N-M <b>neurotization</b> can restore movement to a paralyzed vocal fold. Muscle-nerve-muscle <b>neurotization</b> can be defined as the reinnervation of a denervated muscle via axons that are induced to sprout from nerves within an innervated muscle and that then traverse a nerve graft interposed between it and the target denervated muscle. A paralyzed laryngeal muscle could be reinnervated by axons from its contralateral paired muscle, thus achieving motion-specific reinnervation. Eighteen adult cats were divided into sham, hemilaryngeal-denervated, and M-N-M-reinnervated thyroarytenoid muscle groups.

40|$|Purpose: We {{conducted}} a clinical study {{to evaluate the}} effects of <b>neurotization,</b> especially comparing the total contralateral C 7 (CC 7) root transfer to hemi-CC 7 transfer, on total root avulsion brachial plexus injuries (BPI). Methods: Forty patients who received <b>neurotization</b> for BPI were enrolled in this prospective study. Group 1 (n 5 20) received hemi-CC 7 transfer for hand function, while group 2 (n 5 20) received total-CC 7 transfer. Additional <b>neurotization</b> included spinal accessory, phrenic, and intercostal nerve transfer for shoulder and elbow function. The results were evaluated {{with an average of}} 6 years follow-up. Results: Group 1 had fewer donor site complications (15 %) than group 2 (45 %); group 2 had significantly better hand M 3 and M 4 motor function (65 %) than group 1 (30 %; P 5 0. 02). There was no difference in sensory recovery. Significantly, better shoulder function was obtained by simultane-ous <b>neurotization</b> on both suprascapular and axillary nerves.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} a new method of DIEP flap <b>neurotization</b> using a reliably located recipient nerve. We hypothesize that <b>neurotization</b> by this method (with either nerve conduit or direct nerve coaptation) will have a positive effect on sensory recovery. Methods: Fifty-seven deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps were performed on 35 patients. Neurotizations were performed to the third anterior intercostal nerve by directly coapting the flap donor nerve or coapting with a nerve conduit. Nine nonneurotized DIEP flaps served as controls and received no attempted <b>neurotization.</b> All patients were tested for breast sensibility in 9 areas of the flap skin-island and adjacent postmastectomy skin. Testing occurred at an average of 111 weeks (23 – 309) postoperatively. Results: At a mean of 111 weeks after breast reconstruction, <b>neurotization</b> of the DIEP flap resulted in recovery of sensibility that was statistically significantly better (lower threshold) in the flap skin (P < 0. 01) and statistically significantly better than in the native mastectomy skin into which the DIEP flap was inserted (P < 0. 01). Sensibility recovered in DIEP flaps neurotized using the nerve conduit was significantly better (lower threshold) than that in the corresponding areas of the DIEP flaps neurotized by direct coaptation (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: DIEP flap <b>neurotization</b> using the third anterior intercostal nerve is an effective technique to provide a significant increase in sensory recovery for breast reconstruction patients, while adding minimal surgical time.

40|$|Abstract Background The lack of {{recovery}} of active external {{rotation of the}} shoulder is an important problem in children suffering from brachial plexus lesions involving the suprascapular nerve. The accessory nerve <b>neurotization</b> to the suprascapular nerve is a standard procedure, performed to improve shoulder motion in patients with brachial plexus palsy. Methods We operated on 65 patients with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP), aged 5 - 35 months (average: 19 months). We assessed the recovery of passive and active external rotation with the arm in abduction and in adduction. We also looked at {{the influence of the}} restoration of the muscular balance between the internal and the external rotators on the development of a gleno-humeral joint dysplasia. Intraoperatively, suprascapular nerve samples were taken from 13 patients and were analyzed histologically. Results Most patients (71. 5 %) showed good recovery of the active external rotation in abduction (60 °- 90 °). Better results were obtained for the external rotation with the arm in abduction compared to adduction, and for patients having only undergone the <b>neurotization</b> procedure compared to patients having had complete plexus reconstruction. The <b>neurotization</b> operation has a positive influence on the glenohumeral joint: 7 patients with clinical signs of dysplasia before the reconstructive operation did not show any sign of dysplasia in the postoperative follow-up. Conclusion The <b>neurotization</b> procedure helps to recover the active external rotation in the shoulder joint and has a good prevention influence on the dysplasia in our sample.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{different}} effects of implanting sensory nerve tracts or blood vessel on the osteogenesis, vascularization, and <b>neurotization</b> of the tissue-engineered bone in vivo, we constructed the tissue engineered bone and implanted the sensory nerve tracts (group SN), blood vessel (group VB), or nothing (group Blank) {{to the side}} channel of the bone graft to repair the femur defect in the rabbit. Better osteogenesis was observed in groups SN and VB than in group Blank, and no {{significant difference was found}} between groups SN and VB at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. The neuropeptides expression and the number of new blood vessels in the bone tissues were increased at 8 weeks and then decreased at 12 weeks in all groups and were highest in group VB and lowest in group Blank at all three time points. We conclude that implanting either blood vessel or sensory nerve tract into the tissue-engineered bone can significantly enhance both the vascularization and <b>neurotization</b> simultaneously to get a better osteogenesis effect than TEB alone, and the method of implanting blood vessel has a little better effect of vascularization and <b>neurotization</b> but almost the same osteogenesis effect as implanting sensory nerve...|$|E

40|$|Background: A chance {{observation}} of return of excellent facial movement, after 18 {{months following the}} first stage of cross-face nerve grafting, without free functional muscle transfer, in a case of long-standing facial palsy, lead the senior author (RBA) to further investigate clinically. Patients and Methods: This procedure, now christened as cross-face nerve extension and <b>neurotization,</b> was carried out in 12 patients of very long-standing facial palsy (mean 21 years) in years 1996 - 2011. The mean patient age and duration of palsy were 30. 58 years and 21. 08 years, respectively. In patients, 1 - 5 a single buccal or zygomatic branch served as a donor nerve, but subsequently, we used two donor nerves. The mean follow-up period was 20. 75 months. Results: Successive patients had excellent to good return of facial expression with two fair results. Besides improved smile, patients could largely retain air in the mouth without any escape and had improved mastication. No complications were encountered except synkinesis in 1 patient. No additional surgical procedures were performed. Conclusion: There is experimental evidence to suggest that <b>neurotization</b> of a completely denervated muscle can occur by the formation of new ectopic motor end plates. Long-standing denervated muscle fibres eventually atrophy severely but are capable of re-innervation and regeneration, as validated by electron microscopic studies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report a}} series of 18 {{patients}} who underwent microsurgical repair {{of the facial nerve}} using different techniques and to discuss the indications and results of facial reinnervation procedures. METHODS: Eighteen patients with post-surgical facial palsy underwent facial reinnervation using different techniques. 'These included classic hypoglossal-facial anastomosis in 13 cases, one-stage hemihypoglossal-intratemporal facial nerve anastomosis and translabyrinthine removal of residual intra-canalar acoustic schwannoma in 3, hemihypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis in one, and <b>neurotization</b> of facial muscles through a nerve graft in one. RESULTS: The facial muscle function improved in all patients, up to grade III in 7 cases (39 %), grade IV in 9 (50 %) and grade V in 2 (11 %).

Latissimus dorsi (LD) was used in 37 cases, gracilis in 28, rectus femoris (RF) in seven, and vastus lateralis in one. Five LD and five gracilis were transferred for elbow extension. Patients younger than 15  years yielded better results than older patients for elbow flexion. When LD was transferred, the mean muscle grading (MG) was 3. 33 [*]±[*] 0. 25 when the <b>neurotization</b> was from intercostals; these outcomes were statistically significant when compared with outcomes of free gracilis transfer (MG 2. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 6). There was also a statistically significant difference when free LD was neurotized with three intercostals as compared with two intercostals nerves. RF yielded also good results when neurotized from contralateral C 7 (cC 7; MG 3. 67 [*]±[*] 0. 6). For elbow extension, the better outcomes of LD were not statistically significant. Among all the free muscle transfers for upper extremity reconstruction, elbow reanimation yielded the most rewarding outcomes. The selection of powerful muscle units was more important than the effect of <b>neurotization</b> which was not as strong as it was in muscle transfers for facial or hand reanimation...|$|E
40|$|Adult {{traumatic}} {{brachial plexus}} injuries are devastating, {{and they are}} occurring with increasing frequency. Patient evaluation consists of a focused assessment of upper extremity sensory and motor function, radiologic studies, and, most important, preoperative and intraoperative electrodiagnostic studies. The critical concepts in surgical treatment are patient selection {{as well as the}} timing and prioritizing of restoration of function. Surgical techniques include neurolysis, nerve grafting, <b>neurotization,</b> and free muscle transfer. Results are variable, but increased knowledge of nerve injury and repair, as well as advances in microsurgical techniques, allow not only restoration of elbow flexion and shoulder abduction but also of useful prehension of the hand in some patients. Brachial plexus lesions frequentlylead to significant physical dis...|$|E
40|$|Intercostal nerve {{transfer}} {{is a valuable}} procedure in devastating plexopathies. Intercostal nerves are a very good choice for elbow flexion or extension and shoulder abduction when the intraplexus donor nerves are not available. The best results are obtained in obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients, when direct nerve {{transfer is}} performed within six months from the injury. Unlike the adult posttraumatic patients after median and ulnar nerve <b>neurotization</b> with intercostal nerves, almost all obstetric brachial plexus palsy patients achieve protective sensation in the hand {{and some of them}} achieve active wrist and finger flexion. Use in combination with proper muscles, intercostal nerve transfer can yield adequate power to the paretic upper limb. Reinnervation of native muscles (i. e., latissimus dorsi) should always be sought as they can successfully be transferred later on for further functional restoration...|$|E
40|$|Soft tissue sarcomas are {{investigated}} by {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) both for initial staging and follow-up. We describe the presence of increased signal on T 2 -weighted images caused by a neurotized muscle flap following reconstructive surgery. This raised concern about possible sarcoma recurrence that was not clinically evident. On post-operative imaging of sarcomas the presence of recurrent tumour is indicated by a mass and high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images. However, high signal changes in skeletal muscle on T 2 -weighted images are not specific. In this case, the free functioning muscle transfer with <b>neurotization</b> of the flap mimicked recurrence on MR scan. High signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images in muscle {{is an indication of}} either a physiological change or a pathological condition and must be taken in context of the clinical picture...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic {{brachial plexus}} {{injuries}} are a devastating injury {{that results in}} partial or total denervation of {{the muscles of the}} upper extremity. Treatment options that include neurolysis, nerve grafting, or <b>neurotization</b> (nerve transfer) has become an important procedure in the restoration of function in patients with irreparable preganglionic lesions. Restoration of elbow flexion is the primary goal in treating patients with severe brachial plexus injuries. Nerve transfers are used when spinal roots are avulsed, and proximal stumps are not available. In the present study, we analyze the results obtained in 20 patients treated with phrenic–musculocutaneous nerve transfer to restore elbow flexion after brachial plexus injuries. A consecutive series of 25 adult patients (21 men and 4 women) with a brachial plexus traction/crush lesion were treated with phrenic–musculocutaneous nerve transfer, but only 20 patients (18 men and 2 women) were followed and evaluated for at least 2  years postoperatively. All patients had been referred from other institutions. At the initial evaluation, eight patients received a diagnosis of C 5 - 6 brachial plexus nerve injury, and in the other 12 patients, a complete brachial plexus injury was identified. Reconstruction was undertaken if no clinical or electrical evidence of biceps muscle function was seen by 3  months post injury. Functional elbow flexion was obtained in the majority of cases by phrenic–musculocutaneous nerve transfer (14 / 20, 70 %). At the final follow-up evaluation, elbow flexion strength was a Medical Research Council Grade 5 in two patients, Grade 4 in four patients, Grade 3 in eight patients, and Grade 2 or less in six patients. Transfer involving the phrenic nerve to restore elbow flexion seems to be an appropriate approach for the treatment of brachial plexus root avulsion. Traumatic brachial plexus injury is a devastating injury that result in partial or total denervation of the muscles of the upper extremity. Treatment options include neurolysis, nerve grafting, or <b>neurotization</b> (nerve transfer). <b>Neurotization</b> is the transfer of a functional but less important nerve to a denervated more important nerve. It has become an important procedure in the restoration of function in patients with irreparable preganglionic lesions. Restoration of elbow flexion is the primary goal in treating patients with severe brachial plexus injuries. Nerve transfers are used when spinal roots are avulsed, and proximal stumps are not available. Newer extraplexal sources include the ipsilateral phrenic nerve as reported by Gu et al. (Chin Med J 103 : 267 – 270, 1990) and contralateral C 7 as reported by Gu et al. (J Hand Surg [Br] 17 (B) : 518 – 521, 1992) and Songcharoen et al. (J Hand Surg [Am] 26 (A) : 1058 – 1064, 2001). These nerve transfers have been introduced to expand on the limited donors. The phrenic nerve and its anatomic position directly within the surgical field makes it a tempting source for nerve transfer. Although not always, in cases of complete brachial plexus avulsion, the phrenic nerve is functioning {{as a result of its}} C 3 and C 4 major contributions. In the present study, we analyze the results obtained in 20 patients treated with phrenic–musculocutaneous nerve transfer to restore elbow flexion after brachial plexus injuries...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar de forma crítica os fatores que influenciam os resultados da neurotização do nervo ulnar no ramo motor do músculo bíceps braquial, visando a restauração da flexão do cotovelo em pacientes com lesão do plexo braquial. MÉTODOS: 19 pacientes, 18 homens e uma mulher, com idade média de 28, 7 anos foram avaliados entre fevereiro de 2003 e maio de 2007. Oito pacientes apresentavam lesão das raízes C 5 -C 6 e 11, das raízes C 5 -C 6 -C 7. O intervalo de tempo médio entre a injúria e o tratamento cirúrgico foi 7, 5 meses. Quatro pacientes apresentavam fraturas cervicais associadas à lesão do plexo braquial. O seguimento pós-operatório foi de 15, 7 meses. RESULTADO: Oito pacientes recuperaram força de flexão do cotovelo MRC grau 4; dois, MRC grau 3 e nove, MRC OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the factors influencing {{the results of}} ulnar nerve <b>neurotization</b> at the motor branch of the brachial biceps muscle, aiming at the restoration of elbow flexion in patients with brachial plexus injury. METHODS: 19 patients, with 18 men and 1 woman, mean age 28. 7 years. Eight patients had injury to roots C 5 -C 6 and 11, to roots C 5 -C 6 -C 7. The average time interval between injury and surgery was 7. 5 months. Four patients had cervical fractures associated with brachial plexus injury. The postoperative follow-up was 15. 7 months. RESULTS: Eight patients recovered elbow flexion strength MRC grade 4; two, MRC grade 3 and nine, MRC < 3. There was no impairment of the previous ulnar nerve function. CONCLUSION: The surgical results of ulnar nerve <b>neurotization</b> at the motor branch of brachial biceps muscle are dependent on the interval between brachial plexus injury and surgical treatment, the presence of associated fractures of the cervical spine and occipital condyle, residual function of the C 8 -T 1 roots after the injury and {{the involvement of the}} C 7 root. Signs of reinnervation manifested up to 3 months after surgery showed better results in the long term. Level of Evidence: IV, Case Series...|$|E
