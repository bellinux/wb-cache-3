5000|$|Alfred Einhorn (February 27, 1856 - March 21, 1917) was a Jewish German chemist {{most notable}} for first synthesizing {{procaine}} in 1905 which he patented {{under the name}} <b>Novocain</b> [...] Until that time the primary anesthetic in use was cocaine, however its undesirable side effects (including toxicity and addiction) led scientists to seek out newer anesthetic drugs.Novocain {{was found to be}} comparatively safe and effective, although its anesthetic effects were weaker than cocaine and some patients proved highly allergic. However, none of the other anesthetics developed during this period proved more effective and <b>Novocain</b> quickly became the standard local anesthesia. Although its use has largely been replaced by lidocaine, it is still in use today, most frequently in dentistry.|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century new dental {{techniques}} and technology were invented such as: the porcelain crowns (1903), <b>Novocain</b> (a local anesthetic) 1905, precision cast fillings (1907), nylon toothbrushes (1938), water fluoridation (1945), fluoride toothpaste (1950), air driven dental tools (1957), lasers (1960), electric toothbrushes (1960), and home tooth bleaching kits (1989) were invented. Inventions {{such as the}} air driven dental tools ushered in a new high speed dentistry.|$|E
50|$|Procaine {{is a local}} {{anesthetic}} drug of {{the amino}} ester group. It is used primarily to reduce the pain of intramuscular injection of penicillin, {{and it is also}} used in dentistry. Owing to the ubiquity of the trade name <b>Novocain,</b> in some regions, procaine is referred to generically as novocaine. It acts mainly as a sodium channel blocker. Today it is used therapeutically in some countries due to its sympatholytic, anti-inflammatory, perfusion-enhancing, and mood-enhancing effects.|$|E
50|$|Having {{continued}} doing freelance art {{during his}} medical training, including some work for his professors, he {{fell back on}} medical art to supplement his income. In particular, pharmaceutical companies began seeking Netter for illustrations to help sell new products, such as <b>Novocain.</b> Soon after a misunderstanding wherein Netter asked for $1,500 {{for a series of}} 5 pictures and an advertising manager agreed to and paid $1,500 each - $7,500 for the series - Netter gave up the practice of medicine.|$|E
50|$|Injections without anesthetics, or dry needling, and {{injections}} including saline, {{local anesthetics}} such as procaine hydrochloride (<b>Novocain)</b> or articaine without vasoconstrictors like epinephrine, steroids, and botulinum toxin provide more immediate relief {{and can be}} effective when other methods fail. In regards to injections with anesthetics, a low concentration, short acting local anesthetic such as procaine 0.5% without steroids or adrenalin is recommended. High concentrations or long acting local anesthetics as well as epinephrine can cause muscle necrosis, while use of steroids can cause tissue damage.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{it becomes}} clear that Teddy is unable to get Bob free, Louise places a call to Dr. Yap. Since his job as a dentist {{involves}} heavy use of adhesives and solvents, he tells a skeptical Bob that he is the best person for the job at that exact moment. Yap decides the best way to free Bob, given the limited resources they have, is to inject <b>Novocain</b> into his butt and pull him off the toilet with a rope. Unfortunately, it does not work and Bob remains stuck.|$|E
5000|$|McCulloch {{retired from}} {{coaching}} at Michigan State Normal College in 1936, but he remained the school's athletic director for another 20 years. At {{the time of}} the 1930 U.S. Census, McCulloch remained in Ypsilanti, and his occupation was listed as a teacher at the Normal College. In 1951, the press reported on rumors that Michigan State Normal's football players had been [...] "doped" [...] with <b>novocain</b> to allow them to play through injuries.

50|$|Tittle {{came back}} in the third period, but he needed cortisone, <b>Novocain,</b> and heavy taping and bandaging just to continue. For {{the rest of the}} game, Tittle was forced to throw off his back foot (poor {{mechanics}} for a quarterback). An interception on a screen pass by the Bears' Ed O'Bradovich was brought deep into Giant territory, setting up Wade's 1-yard touchdown to give Chicago a 14-10 lead. The score held up, and the Bears iced the game on Richie Petitbon's interception in the end zone with 10 seconds left. It was Tittle's 5th interception. At the end of the game, defensive coordinator George Allen was given the game ball due to his defense's spectacular play.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Gass, {{a patent}} {{attorney}} and amateur woodworker with {{a doctorate in}} physics, {{came up with the}} idea for SawStop's braking system in 1999. It took Gass two weeks to complete the design, and a third week to build a prototype based on a [...] "$200 secondhand table saw." [...] After numerous tests using a hot dog as a digital analog, in spring 2000, Gass conducted the first test with a real human finger: he applied <b>Novocain</b> to his left ring finger, and after two false starts, he placed his finger into the teeth of a whirring saw blade. The blade stopped as designed, and although it [...] "hurt like the dickens and bled a lot," [...] his finger remained intact.|$|E
5000|$|Novak {{signed with}} the New York Knicks for the veteran's minimum of $1.4 million on December 21, 2011. At {{the end of the}} 2011-12 NBA season, Novak led the league in 3-point {{percentage}} at 47.2% and tied Kevin Durant for third in total 3-point shots made (133). He became an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season. On July 9, 2012, Novak agreed to re-sign with New York for a four-year deal worth $15 million. While playing with New York, Steve Novak accrued a large fanbase. Walt Frazier nicknamed him [...] "Novakaine" [...] after the drug <b>Novocain.</b> Novak competed in the 2012-13 Foot Locker Three-Point Contest during All-Star Weekend. His turnover percentage of 2.63 turnovers committed per 100 plays during the 2012-13 season is the lowest single-season turnover percentage in league history. The NBA did not start recording individual turnovers until the 1977-78 season.|$|E
5000|$|A {{problem with}} illegal cocaine use, {{especially}} in the higher volumes used to combat fatigue (rather than increase euphoria) by long-term users, is the risk of ill effects or damage caused by the compounds used in adulteration. Cutting or [...] "stepping on" [...] the drug is commonplace, using compounds which simulate ingestion effects, such as <b>Novocain</b> (procaine) producing temporary anesthaesia, as many users believe a strong numbing effect {{is the result of}} strong and/or pure cocaine, ephedrine or similar stimulants that are to produce an increased heart rate. The normal adulterants for profit are inactive sugars, usually mannitol, creatine or glucose, so introducing active adulterants gives the illusion of purity and to 'stretch' or make it so a dealer can sell more product than without the adulterants. The adulterant of sugars allows the dealer to sell the product for a higher price because of the illusion of purity and allows to sell more of the product at that higher price, enabling dealers to significantly increase revenue with little additional cost for the adulterants. A 2007 study by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction showed that the purity levels for street purchased cocaine was often under 5% and on average under 50% pure.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, Turner {{was arrested}} for {{practicing}} dentistry without a license, and the case concluded in January 1971 with a guilty verdict, fining him $500., and restricting him from doing dental work for a year. Later, Turner gave his explanation of the case to a friendly newspaper columnist. Regarding the license issue, he told the columnist that he, himself, had advocated licensing of dental laboratories “so old people and poor people can get their false teeth made less expensively,” but because of his advocacy, dentists were “out to get him.” He was arrested after had made teeth {{for a man who}} turned out to be a Georgia Bureau of Investigation informant. There were also claims that investigators had found drugs. Regarding this, he told the columnist, “It’s been embarrassing. One of the papers said I was arrested with some drugs. It was some old <b>Novocain</b> that came in a dentist’s bag a friend gave me some time ago. But it sounded like I was a pusher or something, and I’ve felt bad because I do a lot of work with young kids and I keep expecting one of them to come up with something like, ‘Daddy-o, what are you on?’” ...|$|E
5000|$|Peggy Mondo played several {{roles in}} the series. She played the heavyset {{daughter}} of a Polynesian chief, Little Flower, who is {{always looking for a}} husband such as Ensign Parker or even Binghamton. Mondo also played Fifi in [...] "French Leave for McHale" [...] and a few episodes as Mama Giovanni and Rosa Giovanni when the crew is in Italy. Stanley Adams played a native chief, the Shah of Durani, and political boss Frank Templeton in the last episode [...] "Wally for Congress". Richard Jury played Lt.

5000|$|De Monet {{manages to}} {{convince}} the king that the revolution is building {{and he needs to}} go into hiding, so they will need a stand-in to pretend to be him. Thus Jacques (also Brooks), the garçon de pisse (a.k.a. [...] "piss-boy"), is chosen to impersonate the real king. Later that night, Mlle Rimbaud, unaware of the subterfuge, arrives and offers herself to the piss-boy who is dressed as the king. As she invites him to take her virginity, he pardons her father without requiring the sexual favors. After Mlle Rimbaud and her senile father (Spike Milligan) return from the prison, the peasants burst into the room and capture the piss-boy “king” and Mlle Rimbaud. They are taken to the guillotine for the crimes committed by the crown. When asked if he would like a blindfold or any last words, Jacques declines. However, when they test the guillotine, Jacques make a final request for <b>Novocain.</b> The executioner declares [...] "there is no such thing known to medical science", to which Jacques replies [...] "I'll wait". Just as Jacques is about to be beheaded Mlle Rimbaud muses that [...] "only a miracle can save him now", and Josephus arrives in a cart pulled by Miracle, the horse from the film's Roman Empire segment.

5000|$|The {{show was}} rehearsed each day until its two Friday tapings. Differently colored cue cards (black, blue, green, and red) {{were used for}} each major {{performer}} ("Carol Burnett: Bump-Up The Lights"). The second taping was fairly routine until Tim Conway came aboard as a guest star.As a recurring guest star from the show's launch and later a regular cast member, Conway provided unrehearsed bits to sketches that became known to the staff as [...] "Conway's Capers". Conway would play the first taping straight, but ad-lib bizarre scenarios during the second. Some notable clips included Conway as a Nazi interrogator berating an American captive (Lyle Waggoner). Using a Hitler puppet and a pencil as a [...] "club", Conway sang three verses of [...] "I've Been Working on the Railroad" [...] as Waggoner {{tried in vain to}} ignore him. Some, like the Hitler puppet, made it into the final broadcast; others, like a notably convoluted story about Siamese elephants joined at the trunk (ad-libbed during a 1977 [...] "Mama's Family" [...] sketch), were edited, the uncensored version only appearing years later on CBS specials. Conway's favorite victim was Harvey Korman, who often broke character reacting to Conway's zaniness, such as when Conway played a dentist misusing <b>Novocain</b> or the recurring role of [...] "The Oldest Man" [...] - an elderly, shuffling, senile man who slowly rolled down stairways and fell prey to various mechanical mishaps (including an electric wheelchair and an automated dry-cleaning rack).|$|E

40|$|According to {{the focal}} {{cortical}} theory of absence epilepsy, spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) have a cortical focal {{origin in the}} perioral region of the somatosensory cortex in rats. In the present study the role of peripheral afferents of the perioral (snout) region in the occurrence of spontaneous SWDs was investigated in the WAG/Rij (Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk) rat model of absence epilepsy {{in order to examine}} whether an input from peripheral sources is imperative for the occurrence of SWDs. Twelve male WAG/Rij rats were chronically equipped with cortical EEG electrodes. Peripheral afferents of the perioral region of the snout nervus trigeminus were pharmacologically blocked with a local injection of 2 % <b>Novocain,</b> a blockade of nervus facialis and saline injections were used as controls. ECoGs were recorded before and after bilateral injection of the drug. Blockade of the n. trigeminus decreased the incidence and duration of SWD, while similar injections with <b>Novocain</b> near the n. facialis had no effect. Injections with saline were also not effective. Our data demonstrate that intact peripheral afferent input may be primarily involved in the initiation of SWDs. It suggests that the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits need the peripheral stimulations from the snout and vibrissae for an initiation of the spontaneous SWDs...|$|E

40|$|Experience {{with war}} wounds has taught {{surgeons}} {{the necessity of}} repairing damaged arteries early, in order to re-establish and maintain circulation in a salvageable extremity. Fractures and crushing injuries seen in civilian practice are also frequently complicated by severe damage to soft structures. Injury to main arteries in certain areas means loss of the extremity, unless repair is prompt and successful. If traumatized tissues have their blood supply decreased by vaso-Spasm, shock, or direct injury to an artery, infection may develop in lacerations and com-pound-fracture wounds, and tissue repair be decelerated. Chemotherapy is only effective {{in direct proportion to}} the blood supply. Shock can be combatted by blood transfusions and control of hemorrhage. Vaso-spasm can be controlled by sympathetic <b>novocain</b> block or by one of the newer drugs, stnch as tetra-ethyl-ammonium chloride, unless shock is present. Lacerated or traunma-tized arteries with thrombi must be treated promptly by surgery, if a main vessel is involved; otherwise, gangrene will develop, and a potentially useful extremity will be lost.

40|$|The use of {{penicillin}} in {{the treatment}} of root canal infections has already been reported by Weiner (1). Large doses were given (5, 000 to 30, 000 units) by infiltration at the root apex with <b>novocain,</b> and also by syringing the root canal. No mention is made of any treatment left in the canal between visits. The num-ber of cases was too small for statistical conclusions but a great deal of promise was evidenced. Adams (2) reported the use of penicillin in root canal therapy by the method of injecting into the canal with a suitable 27 gauge needle. A total of 12 cases is included in the report. The author, himself, stated a difficulty in evaluating the method: "We {{have no way of knowing}} how much of the solution flows back out of the canal after the infected area is filled. " Considering the dense nature of bone and the incompressibility of fluids, it is very likely that the "injection " of 2 cc. of penicillin containing 5, 000 units, really constitutes an irrigation of the canal, rather than an injection into tissue.

40|$|One of {{the strains}} of Bacterium {{granulosis}} isolated by Noguchi in 1926 has been maintained in culture and in monkeys {{and continues to be}} capable, after 3 years, of inducing a chronic granular conjunctivitis in monkeys. Cultures of this strain have been recovered from the monkey lesions as late as 3 years after inoculation and have been shown to reproduce the granular disease in monkeys. Six additional strains of Bacterium granulosis have been isolated from cases of trachoma occurring in the Indian schools of Arizona. The cultures thus obtained are identical morphologically and culturally with those isolated by Noguchi and have induced the same chronic granular conjunctivitis in monkeys. Advanced untreated cases are more favorable for cultural study than treated cases. Cultures of Bacterium granulosis kept on semisolid medium containing 10 per cent rabbit serum ("leptospira medium") remain viable for many months at room temperature, and sealed ampoules of such cultures have been found to retain their pathogenicity for the monkey conjunctiva for at least 69 days at room temperature and at least 284 days at 4 ° to 6 °C. Several additional cultural and biological characteristics of Bacterium granulosis have been described. Of outstanding importance is the fact that cocaine, in contradistinction to <b>novocain,</b> has a bactericidal effect on the organism. This fact, in view of the common use of cocaine for anesthesia, may explain the negative results of cultivation experiments reported by some workers...|$|E

A dissection of a buccal area mucous membrane portion, with a 0. 5 x 0. 7 cm size, was made in experimental animals under a local anesthesia (0. 4 ml of a <b>novocain</b> solution 2 %). Two groups of animals participated in experiment: in the 1 st group a wound was applied with a common scalpel; in the 2 nd group — with a radiowave device («Surgitron Dentosurg», Ellman firm), mode № 2 (dissection and coagulation); a power — 4 — 4. 5 units. The both group animal withdrawal from experiment was made under an ether effect, with investigating medium collection in 1, 3, 7, 24, 48 and 72 h after wound simulation. The tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin according to Van-Hison. A period of observation was 3 days, which is stipulated by a low traumatism of the simulated wounds and a rapid healing (up to 3 — 4 days). A system of computer quantitative morphometry was used for analysis of cytological and histological preparations. Results. A synthesis of fibroblasts, a granular tissue forming and maturation are observed at the earlier dates, at a radiosurgical method in rat tissues, and an area of tissue necrosis, i. e. a damaging effect at investigation, is practically absent. A delayed regeneration with the tissue edema phenomenon conservation and the circulation disorders in postoperative period are observed at a traditional use of the cutting tools. Conclusion.
