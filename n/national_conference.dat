40|$|<b>National</b> <b>conferences</b> {{became the}} most {{important}} participatory policy {{at the national level}} in Brazil. Brazil has had a tradition of <b>national</b> <b>conferences</b> since the early 40 's when Vargas government called a <b>national</b> health <b>conference.</b> Since 1988 the forms of civil society participation envisioned by the Constitution in the areas of health and social assistance led to the institutionalization of <b>national</b> <b>conferences.</b> However, the great boost of <b>national</b> <b>conferences</b> took place after 2003 with the election of Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva for president. In the last 20 years 80 <b>national</b> <b>conferences</b> took plac in the following areas: 21 in health related issues; 20 in minority related themes; 6 in environment themes; 22 on State, economy and development; 17 on education, culture and social assistance; and 11 on human rights. These paper show the finding of a national survey applied in July 2011 on a sample of 2, 200 people. Its results show that the pattern of inclusive participation that emerged at the local level in Brazil is expanding to the national level...|$|R

5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted {{in the emergence of}} a new babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first <b>national</b> <b>conference</b> of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.|$|E
