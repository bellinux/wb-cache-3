40|$|The tensile {{properties}} of three carbon matrix composites reinforced with SiC (Nicalon) fibers (materials A, B, C) have been measured {{with and without}} notches. One of the three materials (material B) had a relatively low strength and exhibited <b>notch</b> <b>brittleness.</b> This material had both a high interface sliding stress and a low fiber bundle strength, caused by particulates in the matrix. These characteristics {{have been shown to}} result in a change in failure mechanism that leads to the inferior properties exhibited by material B. The notch properties of the higher-toughness materials were shown to involve splitting, which alleviates the notch stress concentration and diminishes the notch sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{toughness}} of bone is {{an important}} feature in preventing it from fracturing. We consider the notch sensitivity in impact, and the associations between <b>brittleness,</b> <b>notch</b> sensitivity and post-yield energy absorption of mammalian mineralized tissues. Specimens of bone-like tissues covering {{a wide range of}} mineralization were broken, either notched or un-notched, in impact. The greater the mineral content, the greater was the notch sensitivity. Also, the more brittle tissues dissipated the least post-yield energy and were the most notch sensitive. It is suggested that since antler bone, the least mineralized of all known mammalian mineralized tissues, seems to be notch insensitive in impact, no adaptive purpose would be served by having mineralized tissues of a lower mineralization than antler. This may explain the lower cut-off in mineralization seen in mammals...|$|R
