However, allowing for violations makes the policy instruments less effective. The <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> needs to be higher or the number of permits issued smaller, in order to obtain the required emission reduction.

40|$|The {{personal}} income tax is not harmonised in the European Union that’s why there are different systems of the {{personal income}} tax which reflects in different <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> different allowances, deductions and tax credits. The comparisons based on <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> predicate the real rate of taxation insufficiently because of these differences. More objective way how to measure the tax circumstances of the taxpayers in individual countries are relative indicators such as the tax incidence of the taxpayer with an average wage, the calculation of an effective <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> or measuring the tax progressiveness. The index of the tax progressiveness {{which is based on}} the effective <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> predicates the effective tax burden and the relationship between the change of the income and the tax burden.

40|$|An {{income tax}} is {{equivalent}} to a uniform tax on all expenditures, including expenditures on commodity tax payments. This will compound the tax being applied to any taxed commodity. In {{the presence of an}} income tax, therefore, any expenditure tax (including a pollution tax) will produce a higher effective tax than its <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> would suggest. For example, a nominal Pigouvian tax applied to a polluting good will be equivalent to an effective tax higher than this. These observations are used to shed light on recent debate surrounding the double dividend hypothesis. From this vantage point, the present analysis finds that the double dividend hypothesis is valid and that the optimal eff ctive pollution tax is always the Pigouvian rate, although the presence of an income tax implies a correspondingly lower nominal pollution tax rate. The analysis also concludes that second-best optimal taxation implies a cleaner, not a dirtier, environment than for the first-best case, and that a higher marginal cost of public funds will raise the optimal tax on polluting goods and lower the optimal level o...|$|E
40|$|Within the EU the {{relation}} between financial and tax accounting will be significantly influenced by the regulation adopted in June 2002 that obliges all listed companies to prepare their consolidated accounts according to International Accounting Standards / International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS). Since dependency of financial and tax accounting according to different degrees prevails in all EU member states a linkage between IAS/IFRS and tax accounting seems to be possible. Compared to national GAAP the advantage of IAS/IFRS {{as a starting point}} for tax accounting derives from the advantages of the creation of a common tax base in the EU. However, the adoption of IAS/IFRS has to be restricted to those standards that are convenient for tax purposes. In particular, this means that tax accounting still has to follow the realisation principle as a general principle; the IAS/IFRS "fair value-accounting" therefore cannot be adopted for tax purposes. In this paper we present estimates for the consequences of IAS/IFRS-based tax accounting on the comparative effective tax burdens of companies in 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the USA). Therefore, certain provisions of IAS/IFRS were considered {{as a starting point for}} the tax base. The effective tax burdens are calculated on the basis of the European Tax Analyzer model which was enhanced for the purposes of this study. A further question arises as to what extent an exclusive harmonisation of the tax base will effectively reduce the current EU-wide differences of effective company tax burdens. It turns out that a common tax base cannot alleviate the current EU-wide differences of effective company tax burdens. A major finding of our study reveals that the effective tax burdens in all countries considered here (except Ireland) tend to increase slightly since the tax bases tend to become broader. This offers the possibility to member states to reduce the <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> leaving the overall effective tax burden unchanged. A tax policy of tax cut cum base broadening would not only tend to increase the attractiveness of the member states as a location for companies. At the same time, this would reduce dispersions of effective tax burdens across industries. Therefore, such a tax policy is in line of the long term Community goals to become more competitive in international terms...|$|E

The purpose of the dissertation research was to identify the effects of inflation upon the taxation of income and capital within the nonfinancial corporate sector. A partial equilibrium approach was used to address two areas: (1) to identify the magnitude and variation of the effects of inflation upon the taxation of corporate income and capital, given the existing nominal income tax system, and (2) to identify the effects of using a price-level-adjusted taxable income measure upon the aggregate magnitude and distribution of corporate income tax payments. The study used financial statement data from the annual industrial COMPUSTAT tapes. A subset of 864 nonfinancial corporations was selected for the study within 26 two-digit standard industry classifications. An algorithm was developed to perform the following: (1) to estimate taxable income, (2) to estimate price-level-adjusted pre-tax income and price-level-adjusted taxable income, and (3) to estimate the tax payments based upon historical cost taxable income and price-level-adjusted taxable income. Real and nominal tax rates were computed for each firm and capital maintenance conditions were used to determine the incidence of capital erosion and the degree of capital maintenance within each industry group. The analysis was cross-sectional and encompassed the years 1976, 1977 and 1978. The results indicate that the real tax rate was significantly greater than the <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> for most firms and industries in the study. The exceptions to this general finding were explained by using a form of sensitivity analysis. The results also indicate that there was a substantial variation in the real tax rate among firms and industry groups. In addition, {{it was found that the}} use of a price-level-adjusted taxable income measure would alter the magnitude and the distribution of tax payments within the corporate sector. It was concluded that the effects of inflation upon corporate income taxation have resulted in intersectoral and intrasectoral misallocations of capital. In particular, the most obvious economic effect of the increase in the real corporate tax rate is a reduction in the rate of corporate capital formation. Moreover, the substantial variation of the real tax rate implies a source of capital misallocation within the corporate sector. It was also concluded that the use of a price-level-adjusted taxable income measure would result in some serious problems for income tax policy formulation. In particular, the policy change would result in a reduction in the tax revenue obtained from the corporate sector. In addition, the policy change would cause a shifting of tax payments among firms and industries...|$|E

Moving to a semi-dual income tax offers both advantages and disadvantages in addressing the pension system long term goals and challenges, and represents a compromise between domestic and international competing considerations an open economy faces in designing a tax regime. The adoption may be a result of a clear tax reform strategy or simply an outcome of particular economic, demographic, political and social circumstances.

40|$|The growing {{mobility}} of {{capital in the}} wake of globalization has a major effect on how countries with free-market economies raise their revenues. The focus is clearly shifting from taxation of income onto taxation of consumption and labour. But even though corporate income taxes ("CIT") are becoming less and less important as a source of revenue to finance state expenses, countries do continue to compete on this arena, including on <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Today, multinationals choose to site their projects less on the basis of geography but more in reliance on comparisons of competition drivers, such as internal market, legal and political stability, labour costs, education and, last but not least, business taxation. On the most general plane, this thesis seeks to assess the competitiveness of the Polish system of business income taxation. It is assumed as a starting point that taxation levels across countries cannot be rationally compared unless through the use of effective <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> because <b>nominal</b> rates do not in themselves reveal much about the actual tax charge on the business bottom line. The present paper analyses a number of well-known methods of calculating the effective CIT rate, used mainly in econometrics and statistics, but finds that none of them is free from weaknesses. Above all, these methods omit deferred taxes, without which any measurement of only current income tax expense will distort the picture of actual tax burden. As a result, the method considered the most authoritative and useful given the purpose of this thesis is the effective <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> (ETR) method. ETR is computed {{in the same way as}} it is done by thousands of firms in Poland and abroad which use International Financial Reporting Standards to prepare their financial statements. ETR takes account of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, therefore generally eliminating measurement distortions that arise from temporary differences between tax and accounting recognition of income or loss. The main purpose of this thesis is to define the actual relationship between nominal and effective income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> on businesses in Poland using the ETR methodology. No such research has been done before. Given the purpose of the work but also its effectiveness, a monographic study of a sample of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange is considered to be the most appropriate research method. The data has been analysed in detail and interpreted, and additional complementary research has been done in the form of interviews with individual representatives of selected companies and a comparative analysis of the results of an independent survey of the effective taxation of 250 medium-sized and large Polish enterprises. The outcome of the research corroborates the author's working thesis statement that the average ETR varies substantially above the nominal CIT rate of 19 %. The average ETR for 194 WSE-listed companies over three consecutive years was 20. 3411 %. The thesis also carefully presents and analyses how different industries and origin of capital display different sensitivities to ETR drivers. The research results are used in an attempt to explain the observed differences between effective and <b>nominal</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> to the extent their causes are attributable to tax law and accounting law. This analysis focuses in particular on the regulations of the Polish Corporate Income Tax Act. It has also be found out that there is a major factor in accounting law that causes permanent differences to arise between accounting and tax recognition of profit or loss. Taking into account global and European trends in the development of corporate taxation, including the EU proposals for CCCTB and the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting guidelines, the author discusses possible directions for potential future changes of the Polish system of taxation. The thesis winds up with postulates de lege ferenda. Certain changes to Polish tax law are suggested with a primary view to limiting "excessive" differences between effective and nominal income taxation. "Excessive" differences are taken to mean those which harm Poland's competitive position on the international investment market but which do not have a sufficient fiscal or economic justification. Such differences are "excessive" also in the sense that they are more common in Poland than in a number of other European countries that are important competitive benchmarks for the Polish economy. Some foreign tax jurisdictions endorse a rule that the accounting balance sheet is an authoritative source of data for tax purposes. This authoritativeness rule, which is described in more detail in the thesis, brings the tax base closer to accounting profit/loss. The Polish tax system does not have such a rule and, therefore, facilitates overrepresentation of differences between accounting and tax recognition of income, a feature that deteriorates Poland's investment competitiveness. If such differences are not sufficiently justified by important fiscal or systemic considerations, it is advisable to restrict them by making changes to relevant laws and regulations...|$|R
