25|$|Firstly it is {{underlined}} {{that the}} MGK is a consultative body, {{now with a}} civilian majority.

In addition, the MGK no longer has unlimited access to all civil institutions. The MGK no longer has a representative in the Supervision Board of Cinema, Video and Music. It was however still represented in civil institutions such as the High Board for Radio and TV (RTÜK) and the Commission for Higher Education (YÖK), but after critics in the 2003 European Commission report this representation was withdrawn from both institutions in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, in 2007, {{fifteen years}} of {{investigation}} led {{to the conclusion that}} the 1992 assassination of DINA Colonel Gerardo Huber was most probably related to various illegal arms traffic carried out, after Pinochet's resignation from power, by military circles very close to himself. Huber had been assassinated a short time before he was due to testify in the case concerning the 1991 illegal export of weapons to Croatian army. The deal involved 370 tons of weapons, sold to Croatia by Chile on 7 December 1991, when the former country was under a United Nations' embargo because of the support for Croatia war in Yugoslavia. In January 1992, the judge Hernán Correa de la Cerda wanted to hear Gerardo Huber in this case, but the latter may have been silenced to avoid implicating Pinochet in this new case—although the latter was <b>not</b> <b>anymore</b> President, he remained at the time Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Pinochet was at the center of this illegal arms trade, receiving money through various offshores and front companies, including the Banco Coutts International in Miami.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} Army transformation, it was re-organized in 1993. The {{division}} of the territory in military regions and zones was kept, with {{the reduction of the}} number of regions, but with the raising of the Airborne Troops Command (using the structure of the previous Air Force's Paratroopers Command) and the Santa Margarida Military Camp as two special territorial commands. The regiments of the Army became again designed by numbers and <b>not</b> <b>anymore</b> by the place where they were based. The assigned numbers were not consecutive, as in previous organizations, but were the historical numbers previously used by each unit or by its predecessor in the same garrison place. The old 1950's plans to equip the Army with light aviation assets were resumed, with the raising of a Light Aviation Unit that was intended to operate helicopters. However, the reception of the planned helicopters was delayed successively until being finally canceled and the unit disbanded. The military regions and zones continued to be responsible for keeping territorial defense brigades and battle groups, mostly maintained only in cadre strength in time of peace. The Army now would have an increased permanent operational force with three brigades: the Independent Airborne Brigade (BAI), the Independent Mechanized Brigade (BMI) and the Light Intervention Brigade (BLI). The BAI resulted from the old Air Force's Light Paratrooper Brigade, also absorbing the parachute qualified members of the disbanded Commando Regiment. The BMI resulted from the fully mechanization of the previous 1st Composite Brigade. The BLI would be a completely newly raised motorized infantry brigade, although inheriting part of the disbanded Special Forces Brigade. Operationally, each of the three brigades had a similar organization that included three maneuver (infantry / armoured) and one field artillery battalion, engineering, signals and services companies, an armored reconnaissance squadron and an anti-aircraft battery. Administratively however each of the brigades had completely different organizations, with the BAI being entirely maintained by the Airborne Troops Command in several of its regiments and other units spread across the country, with the BMI being entirely maintained by the Santa Margarida Military Camp concentrated in a single place and with the BLI being maintained by the several military regions in their several regiments spread across the country.|$|E

Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he [...] "wanted to work with someone into the heavy-music scene, and Rubin's <b>not</b> <b>anymore.</b> I wanted somebody who knows what's hot, knows what's selling, knows the new techniques, and will keep me on my toes." [...] Rubin recommended two producers, although the first producer was not going to work out personality-wise according to Hanneman.

The band was pleased with Hyde's work on [...] "Bloodline" [...] and hired him to produce the entire album. [...] "Bloodline" [...] was also briefly used in the 2009 film Law Abiding Citizen.

2500|$|After the First World War, Brody was <b>not</b> <b>anymore</b> {{a border}} city hub. It lost its geo-commercial and geo-cultural value. The borders of new Poland moved further eastwards {{and with the}} Holocaust {{there was no more}} Jewish Brody, and Brody as [...] "city" [...] itself, because Brody was 88% Jewish city. The {{following}} incorporation of Brody into the Soviet Ukraine and Ukrainiazation of the city, due to the influx of local Ukrainian peasantry from the rural areas basically into emptied (of urban Poles and Jews) Galician cities after 1944 turned Brody into a provincial town. The changes that occurred within basically 50 years are dramatic. The deeply changing character of Brody reflects and exemplifies at its best the cross-cultural historic experience of East Galician past. History of the Jews in Brody provides a demonstration of Jewish commercial and intellectual rise and decline in Eastern Galicia.|$|E

2500|$|Brain {{death is}} used as an {{indicator}} of legal death in many jurisdictions, but it is defined inconsistently. Various parts of the brain may keep functioning when others do <b>not</b> <b>anymore,</b> and the term [...] "brain death" [...] has been used to refer to various combinations. For example, although a major medical dictionary says that [...] "brain death" [...] is synonymous with [...] "cerebral death" [...] (death of the cerebrum), the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the brainstem. The distinctions can be important because, for example, in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem, the heartbeat and ventilation can continue unaided, whereas in whole-brain death (which includes brain stem death), only life support equipment would keep those functions going. Patients classified as brain-dead can have their organs surgically removed for organ donation.|$|E
