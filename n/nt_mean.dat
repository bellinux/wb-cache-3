Methods A prospective case control study compared 55 patients; symptomatic cholelithiasis - 30 (14 male, median age 36 years; mean BMI - 25. 1 kg/m 2), gallstone pancreatitis - 9 (3 male, median age 35 years; mean BMI - 24. 86 kg/m 2) and IP - 16 (9 male, median age 34 years; mean BMI - 23. 34 kg/m 2) with 30 controls (15 male, median age 38 years; mean BMI = 24. 5 kg/m 2) undergoing laparotomy for conditions {{not related to the}} gall bladder and bile duct. Ultrafiltered bile from the common hepatic duct in patients and controls was incubated in anaerobic conditions and examined by polarized light microscopy to assess bile nucleation time (NT).

The naive gauge pre-fix a(t) =const is clearly forbidden, causing evolution to freeze altogether, so pre-fixing the scale factor, say a(t) =t, necessarily introduces explicit time dependence into the Lagrangian. Invoking Dirac's prescription for dealing with constraints, we construct the corresponding mini superspace time dependent total Hamiltonian, and calculate the Dirac brackets, characterized by {n,ϕ}_D≠ 0, which are promoted to commutation relations in the quantum theory.

The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was higher in ST than in NT group. Error and SD of the signal increased with increasing force levels in both groups. Despite higher absolute force levels of the ST group, SD and Error were the same in both groups for a given MVC percentage. Signal to noise ratio values showed inverted U-shapes for both groups, with no significant differences between groups on various force levels. The power spectral density analysis disclosed significant differences between groups, with more power in the lowest frequency band (1 - 6 Hz) for the ST group. It is concluded that strength training of arm muscles has no negative effect on the stability of sustained contractions of finger muscles.

To this purpose, we measured renal hemodynamics, renal sodium handling, and renal oxygenation in normotensive (NT) and hypertensive (HT) subjects after 1 week of a high-sodium and 1 week of a low-sodium diet. Renal oxygenation was measured using blood oxygen level–dependent magnetic resonance. Tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of R 2 * maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneys. The mean R 2 * values in the medulla and cortex were calculated, with a low R 2 * indicating a high tissue oxygenation. Ten male <b>NT</b> (<b>mean</b> age: 26. 57. 4 years) and 8 matched HT subjects (mean age: 28. 85. 7 years) were studied. Cortical R 2 * was not different under the 2 conditions of salt intake. Medullary R 2 * was significantly lower under low sodium than high sodium in both NT and HT subjects (28. 10. 8 versus 31. 30. 6 s 1; P 0. 05 in NT; and 27. 91. 5 versus 30. 30. 8 s 1; P 0. 05, in HT), indicating higher medullary oxygenation under low-sodium conditions. In NT subjects, medullary oxygenation was positively correlated with proximal reabsorption of sodium and negatively with absolute distal sodium reabsorption, but not with renal plasma flow. In HT subjects, medullary oxygenation correlated with the 24 -hour sodium excretion but not with proximal or with the distal handling of sodium. These data demonstrate that dietary sodium intake influences renal tissue oxygenation, low sodium intake leading to an increased renal medullary oxygenation both in normotensive and young hypertensive subjects.

Whilst {{the science of}} X-ray computed tomography (CT) has greatly matured since its first fossil applications in the early 1980 s, the applications and limitations of neutron tomography (NT) remain relatively unexplored in palaeontology. These highest resolution neutron tomographic scans in palaeontology to date were conducted on a specimen of Austrosequoia novae-zeelandiae (Ettingshausen) Mays and Cantrill recovered from mid-Cretaceous (Cenomanian; ~ 100 – 94 Ma) strata of the Chatham Islands, eastern Zealandia. Previously, the species has been identified with in situ fossil resin (amber); the new neutron tomographic analyses demonstrated an anomalously high neutron attenuation signal for fossil resin. The resulting data provided a strong contrast between, and distinct three-dimensional representations of the: 1) fossil resin; 2) coalified plant matter; and 3) sedimentary matrix. These data facilitated an anatomical model of endogenous resin bodies within the cone axis and bract-scale complexes.

40|$|Accurate {{forecasting}} of {{the change}} of the Earth's internal magnetic field over short intervals of time (e. g., less than five years) has many applications for government, academic and commercial users. Forecasting {{can be achieved by}} making a number of reasonable assumptions about how the main field interacts with the flow in the liquid outer core. In particular, the magnetic field can be considered to be entrained in the large scale flow along the core‐mantle boundary surface over short time periods, giving rise to measurable change at the Earth's surface. The observed change (or secular variation) at or above the surface of the Earth can thus be inverted to produce flow models; these can be used to propagate fluid parcels threaded by the field forwards in time to forecast the non‐linear change of the magnetic field. In addition to prediction of field change by flow models, it would be advantageous to include observations of the field from satellite measurements or ground‐based observatories. We therefore present a method using Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) to produce an optimal assimilation between magnetic field change as forecast from core flow models and direct observations of the field. We show, by assuming a steady flow and assimilating field observations annually, it is possible to produce a forecast over five years with less than 30 <b>nT</b> root <b>mean</b> square difference from the ‘true’ field – within an assumed error budget.

The results of weight loss and roughness values were submitted to the ANOVA followed by the Tukey's test (p = 0. 05). Results: The mean weight loss of material L was statistically higher (p 0. 05). Only for L, toothbrushing increased the surface roughness. After toothbrushing, {{there was no significant difference}} between the roughness values of materials L and <b>NT.</b> The highest <b>mean</b> weight loss during the simulated toothbrushing tests was observed for L. Before the toothbrushing tests, the NT exhibited the highest mean roughness. Conclusion: Brushing resulted in increase in roughness only for resin L...|$|R
40|$|A Joss-Waldvogel type {{disdrometer}} {{was installed}} at Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Sreeharikotta (SHAR) during various periods. This paper presents {{results from the}} analysis of the data. Drop Size Distribution (DSD) and rainfall rate for each minute were computed from the disdrometer data, and the entire data for each month were sorted by rainfall rate. The data were then divided into different ranges of rainfall rate and DSD computed for each. The average DSD for each range was fitted with a lognormal distribution function of the form N(D) = (a 0 /D) exp (- 0. 5 (ln (D) -a 1) /a 2) 2 where D = drop diameter, N(D) = number of drops/m 3 /mm interval. The results show the following: For the lowest rainfall intensity, the distribution is narrow and is dominated by small drops. With increase in intensity, the distribution spreads out and more larger drops appear. However, in some cases, the data does not follow the lognormal distribution. The total number of drops, <b>NT,</b> geometric <b>mean</b> diameter, Dg and standard geometric deviation, σ was derived from the ai. NT showed a tendency to increase slightly with rainfall rate. Dg followed a simple power relationship of the form Dg = b 0 R b 1. The standard geometric deviation did not show any significant dependence on rainfall rate. The characteristics of rainfall in terms of the three parameters for coastal stations on the west coast are similar. The rate of increase of NT is higher at SHAR than at Kochi. NT is higher at SHAR than at Kochi for any particular rainfall rate, indicating that, unlike Kochi and other stations on the western coast, rainfall at SHAR is made up of more number of smaller drops...|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} and hyperinsulinemia {{has been reported}} as linked with essential hypertension. In this study, to clarify the pathophysiological significance of insulin sensitivity and compensative hyperinsulinemia in essential hypertension, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and eug-lycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp were performed in 26 essential hypertensives (EHT) and 16 normotensive subjects (NT). During the clamp, 40 mU/min/m? insulin was infused continuously, and 20 % glucose solution was infused simultaneously at the rate to maintain the basal glucose level. The mean glucose infusion rate (M value) {{was used as an}} indicator of insulin sensitivity. Blood and urine samples were collected immediately before {{and at the end of}} 2 -hour hyperinsulinemia. There was no significant difference between NT and EHT in fasting blood sugar and fasting plasma insulin levels. In the oral glucose tolerance test, the plasma insulin level at 90 and 120 min-utes, and the summation of plasma insulin level of 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after glucose loading (ΣIRI) were significantly higher in EHT than in NT. M value was significantly lower in EHT than in <b>NT.</b> The <b>mean</b> blood pressures measured immediately before glucose loading were significantly correlated with insulin levels at 90 minutes, 120 minutes and ΣIRI after glucose loading. After hyperinsulinemia for 120 minutes glucose clamp, urinary sodium excretion and fractional excretion of sodium were decreased, and plasma norepinephrine, renin activity and aldosterone level were in-creased in both EHT and NT. In these changes, no significant difference was observed between EHT and NT. These results indicate that insulin {{resistance and}} compensative hyperinsulinemia exist in Japanese essential hypertensives, and insulin actions for renal sodium retention and augmentation of pressor systems are not disturbed in these patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Activation of {{the enzyme}} telomerase, {{which has been}} {{associated}} with cellular immortality, may constitute a key step in the development of human cancer. Telomerase is repressed in most normal human somatic cells. This study was conducted, using a genetic complementation approach, with the aim of identifying and mapping the genes responsible for repressing telomerase and, simultaneously, to establish the effect of experimentally induced telomerase repression on human tumor cell growth. METHODS: Individual human chromosomes isolated from normal diploid cells and tagged with bacterial antibiotic resistance genes (for later selection) were introduced into cells of the human breast carcinoma cell line 21 <b>NT</b> by <b>means</b> of microcell transfer. Selected hybrid clones were screened for telomerase activity by use of the polymerase chain reaction-based telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, and the proliferative fate of the hybrid clones was determined. Regions of the introduced chromosomes associated with telomerase repression were mapped using segregant hybrids and a deletion analysis that employed microsatellite DNA markers. RESULTS: Strong repression of telomerase was observed following transfer of human chromosome 3 into 21 NT cells but not after transfer of chromosomes 8, 12, or 20. The vast majority of hybrid clones with repressed telomerase entered permanent growth arrest after 10 - 18 population doublings. Deletion analysis of nonrepressed segregant monochromosome 3 hybrids indicated two regions on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3 p 21. 3 -p 22 and 3 p 12 - 21. 1) where telomerase regulator genes may be located. CONCLUSIONS: Telomerase in human breast cancer cells is efficiently repressed by a gene or genes on normal human chromosome 3 p, and this repression is associated with permanent growth arrest of the tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNo-tillage (NT) with residue {{retention}} {{is often}} suggested {{as an option}} to adapt cropping systems to drier conditions because yield in rain fed systems could benefit from increased soil water. But under wetter conditions, NT may lower yields, depending on soil and crop characteristics. In a future climate, inter-annual variability in wet and dry conditions is projected to increase in central Europe, in spite of drier mean conditions. Thus, long-term benefits of NT for yield stability remain uncertain. We addressed this question by analyzing the variability of absolute and relative yield {{in relation to the}} atmospheric water balance (P-ET 0) using data from a long-term experiment near Bern (Switzerland) comparing NT and conventional plough tillage (CT) on slightly humic sandy loam soil. There {{was no significant difference between}} CT and <b>NT</b> in <b>mean</b> yield for any of the crops, but for peas and beans, c. v. (%) was clearly higher under CT. In contrast, differences in c. v. between CT and NT for winter barley, winter wheat and maize were marginal. Relative yield (Yrel=YNT/YCT) varied across years for all crops. For peas, beans and winter wheat Yrel varied in relation to P-ET 0 during the period March to May. For peas and bean, Yrel was > 1 when P-ET 0 was negative, but showed no trend when positive, thus indicating yield improvements under NT after drier springs. In contrast, Yrel for winter wheat increased with increasing P-ET 0 indicating positive effects of NT under wetter springtime conditions. During the duration of the experiment (1994 - 2013), inter-annual variability of P-ET 0 for March-May was larger than during periods of equal length since 1900. Thus, in a future climate with more variable springtime conditions, the yield-effect of NT for each crop may be negative, positive or neutral, and in the long run NT appears to have only a marginal adaptation potential...|$|R
40|$|After 3 weeks' {{nortriptyline}} (<b>NT)</b> treatment the <b>mean</b> {{plasma concentration}} of its 10 -hydroxy metabolite (10 -OH-NT) (599 +/- 207 nmol l- 1) {{was higher than}} that of the parent drug (433 +/- 199 nmol l- 1) in 25 depressed patients. Also in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the mean level of 10 -OH-NT (67 +/- 20 nmol l- 1) was {{higher than that of}} NT (39 +/- 23 nmol l- 1). There was a strong correlation (P less than 0. 001) between the CSF and plasma concentration of both NT (r = 0. 92) and 10 -OH-NT (r = 0. 77). The interindividual variation in the CSF/plasma ratio of both compounds was small, compared to the variation in plasma levels. These results show that 10 -OH-NT passes the blood-brain barrier as it is present in concentrations higher than those of NT in the CSF. 10 -OH-NT has previously been shown to be a potent blocker of noradrenaline uptake and to have much less affinity for muscarinic receptors than NT itself. This active metabolite might therefore be a potential antidepressant with less disturbing anticholinergic side-effects...|$|R

In this note we show the equivalence between the Ahmad (1992) and the Hollander & Proschan (1975) test statistic, constructed to test exponentiality against the alternative that it is new better than used in expectation, but not exponential. Some key words: Exponential distribution; Mean residual life; New better than used in expectation. Ahmad (1992) proposes a method for testing {{the null hypothesis}} S€o: fi(t) is constant, against the alternative Hf,: it is strictly decreasing, but not constant, where <b>n(t)</b> denotes the <b>mean</b> residual life function of the distribution function F(t) and is defined by fj?F(s) ds/F(t) ifF(r) > 0, to otherwise, with F(t) = l — F(t). Because of the one-to-one correspondence between the distribution F(t) and the mean residual life function /*(f) the null hypothesis Xo {{is equivalent to the}} exponentiality of F(t) with unspecified mean. Both S€o and 3 ?, are scale invariant. So statistics designed to test the hypotheses should be scale invariant The measure of the deviation from the null hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of Investigator B tapes was {{extended}} to use a statistical screening of individual data points in each grid cell over the map area. The mean value of data from each cell was computed and all data values more than 4 <b>nT</b> from the <b>mean</b> were rejected. The revised {{mean and standard deviation}} was computed. The average standard deviation for all map grid cells was 1. 4 nT for the scalar anomaly map and about 2 nT for the vector component anomaly maps. At this stage, the grid cell is larger and spatial resolution lower for the vector maps than for the scalar maps, because the vector components are considerably more disturbed and more data points were rejected. An approach for altitude adjustment is in progress so that corrections can be made and data reduction procede. To evaluate the use of scalar and vector MAGSAT data for the production of regional magnetic charts, charts of the north, east, vertical, and scalar field derived from MAGSAT and from Canadian aeromagnetic data were compared. It appears possible to retrieve crustal signals from the horizontal vector components despite external disturbance fields at high latitude...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the piezomagnetic effect is a plausible mechanism in explaining variations in the magnetic field that occur synchronously with the propagation of teleseismic waves, a set of solutions are derived for the electromagnetic field. The situation is considered in which the Earth's conductivity has a stratified structure and seismic waves are expressed as a plane wave. The piezomagnetic field in this situation is expressed by an analytically closed form. Using the obtained solution, quantitative aspects of the piezomagnetic field that accompanies seismic Rayleigh waves are discussed. It is shown that the finite conductivity of the Earth's crust sometimes acts as an enhancer {{of the magnitude of}} the piezomagnetic field. However, the expected piezomagnetic field is substantially small. Even in the case that the initial magnetization around the observation site is as large as 5 A m– 1, the expected amplitudes in the piezomagnetic field are at most 0. 1 <b>nT.</b> This result <b>means</b> that the piezomagnetic effect is not a reasonable mechanism to sufficiently explain variations in magnetic fields that occur synchronously with ground motions, if the initial magnetization is horizontally uniform...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA self-standing {{nanotubes}} (NTs) array electrode {{is produced}} by electron beam evaporation of Pt on porous alumina templates. <b>NTs</b> have a <b>mean</b> diameter ranging from 150 to 300 nm, a length of 150 nm and a wall thickness of 20 nm. The ultrathin electrode has a density ranging between 10 (9) and 4 x 10 (9) NTs CMgeo- 2 with a corresponding catalyst loading of 100 mu g(Pt) cm(geo) (- 2). The NTs are assembled on a Nafion (R) membrane to obtain a NTs Array based Membrane Electrode Assembly (NTA-MEA) for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) application. Ex-situ half-cell tests are carried out on 0. 5 cm(geo) (2) samples to characterize the electrochemical properties of the NTs array electrode. PEMFC tests are also performed on 17 cm(geo) (2) samples to demonstrate the great potential of this architecture as fuel cell cathode under real operating conditions. Comparisons with Pt/C dispersions are made to draw conclusions on {{the advantage of the}} NTs array on conventional electrodes in terms of catalyst utilization. The NTs array shows improved catalyst accessibility due to the absence of the porous carbon support. Double current density per catalyst unit surface over Pt/C dispersions is measured at 0. 6 V during PEMFC tests under dry O- 2 and air with 30 %RH humidification. (C) 2014 Elsevier BY.
