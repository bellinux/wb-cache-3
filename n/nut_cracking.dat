ABSTRACT: Among the variety of activities in which wild chimpanzees use tools, {{some of the most}} complex behaviors are seen during <b>nut</b> <b>cracking.</b> As studies of <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> have been limited to a few habituated groups of chimpanzees located in a specific area in Taï National Park, we now question whether other groups without contact with the previously studied groups develop the same behavior of <b>nut</b> <b>cracking.</b> Thus, we conducted this study on a group of partially habituated chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Djouroutou in the southwest of Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. Over a one year period, we collected observational data on chimpanzee feeding behavior, mainly on <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> activities. Evidence was found that these chimpanzees crack five species of nuts (Coula edulis, Parinari excelsa, Panda oleosa, Sacoglottis gabonensis and Detarium senegalensis) using only stones as hammers for opening the nuts {{to gain access to the}} nutritious kernel. This chimpanzee group spends 21. 43 % of the year cracking one type of nut Sacoglottis gabonensis. These findings revealed that other groups in Taï National Park developed <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviors with some unique features compared to other groups living in the same forest block.

40|$|After {{processing}} the palm fruit for oil, the nut is usually dried {{in order to}} loosen the kernel from the shell. The drying is necessary to enhance the release of whole kernel when the <b>nut</b> is <b>cracked.</b> A study was carried out to determine the optimum moisture content of nuts for high yield of whole kernels during cracking. Thirteen identical groups of fresh palm nuts with 240 nuts per group were subjected to oven drying at a temperature of 105 oC. Before starting, the initial mass of each nut was noted and at 2 h-intervals, a group was randomly selected {{and each of the}} 240 <b>nuts</b> <b>cracked</b> by impact after weighing for the determination of the nut moisture content.

The percentage of <b>cracked</b> <b>nuts</b> yielding whole kernels after impact cracking was used to determine the optimum moisture content the average value of which was 2. 5 % wet basis or 2. 57 % dry basis. At this moisture content the proportion of evaporable water retained in the intact nuts was estimated to be about of 11. 2 %.

40|$|Various {{authors have}} {{suggested}} behavioural similarities between tool use in early hominins and chimpanzee <b>nut</b> <b>cracking,</b> where <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> might {{be interpreted as}} a precursor of more complex stone flaking. In this paper, we bring together and review two separate strands of research on chimpanzee and human tool use and cognitive abilities. Firstly, and in the greatest detail, we review our recent experimental work on behavioural organization and skill acquisition in nut-cracking and stone-knapping tasks, highlighting similarities and differences between the two tasks that may be informative for the interpretation of stone tools in the early archaeological record. Secondly, and more briefly, we outline a model of the comparative neuropsychology of primate tool use and discuss recent descriptive anatomical and statistical analyses of anthropoid primate brain evolution, focusing on cortico-cerebellar systems. By juxtaposing these two strands of research, we are able to identify unsolved problems that can usefully be addressed by future research in each of these two research areas. " (source éditeur...|$|E
40|$|We apply archaeological {{methods to}} extend our {{knowledge}} of chimpanzee material culture. The chaîne opératoire conceptual framework, as introduced by ethnography, established technology as a phased process. Prehistoric archaeology adopted this concept to elucidate technological variability in tool-making procedures, based on knowledge of tool functions or subsistence patterns. We focused on the detection of operational sequences by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) when <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> with lithic implements at the sites of Bossou and Diecké, Guinea, West Africa. Thus, while it has recently been claimed that chimpanzees leave behind recognizable assemblages of stone hammers that can be morphologically distinguished from Oldowan hammers, {{this is the first}} study to focus specifically on the existence of operational sequences during the utilization of stone tools by wild chimpanzees. By combining primatological and archaeological methods and examining ecological areas inhabited by different chimpanzee groups, we sought technological variability and identified variables influencing regional diversity in tool typology and technology. We compared three case studies: (1) Bossou [...] direct recording of experimental nut-cracking sessions; (2) Bossou [...] direct and indirect monitoring of nut-cracking sites in the wild; (3) Diecké [...] indirect monitoring of nut-cracking sites in the wild. Results suggest that chimpanzees perform sequences of repeated tool transport and <b>nut</b> <b>cracking.</b> Data show discrimination of tool functions based on tool features.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impinging}} velocitythat gives that maximum cracking {{efficiency of}} a vertical shaft centrifugal palm <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> machine was determined in this study. A <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> energy instrument {{which consists of}} a hammering mass falling vertically on palm nuts placed on a base {{was used to determine}} potential energy required to crack the nuts. This energy was equated to the kinetic energy required to crack the nuts in a centrifugal palm <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> machine, from which the average impinging velocity was determined. Experiment was carried out to generate cracking energy data for both Dura and Tenera varieties of palm nuts available in the study area. For Dura type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 32. 50 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 15 m, 0. 25 m and 0. 30 m for nuts sorted into diameter ranges of d < 15 mm, 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 18 mm, and 18 mm ≤ d ≤ 22 mm respectively. For the Tenera type, highest percentage of fully cracked (FC) nuts and average impinging velocity of 39. 56 m/s were obtained when the height of the hammering mass was set at 0. 09 m, 0. 10 m and 0. 13 m for nuts sorted into diameter ranges of 9 mm <d < 13 mm, 13 mm ≤ d ≤ 15 mm, and 15 mm ≤ d ≤ 20 mm respectively. The overall average impinging velocity of 36 m/s was obtained for both varieties of palm nut and which was used in the design and construction of a centrifugal palm nut cracker.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{preliminary}} report on the differences and similarities in material culture among four neighbouring chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) communities. One of these communities includes Bossou, a long-term field site of wild chimpanzees, in Guinea, West Africa. We also conducted surveys of three new sites. Two of those surveyed areas, Seringbara in Guinea and YealÃ© in CÃ´te d'Ivoire, are located less than 12 km away from Bossou in the Nimba Mountains region, which forms a natural boundary between Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire. The third, DiÃ©ckÃ©, is situated further south-west, closer to the border with Liberia. During the surveys, we gathered behavioural information about these neighbouring populations of chimpanzees. The differences, as well as similarities, in material culture were tabulated based on our findings. The three behavioural variants found so far involve differences in <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviour {{with regard to the}} species of nut cracked. Some variation in materials used for <b>nut</b> <b>cracking</b> has also been recorded. However, we still need to establish whether these local variations {{can be explained by the}} demands of the physical and biotic environments in which the populations of chimpanzees live. If these alternative hypotheses can be excluded with continuing research at the study sites, these differences are likely to be cultural behaviours that are influenced by the social context and mode, i. e. horizontal, vertical or oblique, of transmission, by the social structure and organisation of each community and/or perhaps by some form of social norms prevalent within these communities...|$|E
40|$|Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) {{are known}} to make and {{use a variety of}} tools, {{activities}} which require them to employ their hands in a skilful manner. The learning process underlying the acquisition of tool-using skills, and the degree of laterality evident in both immature and mature performers are investigated here focusing on the use of leaves for drinking water by members of the Bossou chimpanzee community in Guinea, West Africa. In addition, comparisons are drawn between the present findings and our previous data on the cracking of oil-palm nuts (Elaeis guineensis) using stone tools by members of the same community. The use of leaves for drinking water emerges approximately 2 years earlier than <b>nut</b> <b>cracking,</b> at around the age of 1. 5 years, although the manufacture of leaf tools begins only at 3. 5 years of age. In addition, in clear contrast with <b>nut</b> <b>cracking,</b> the majority of chimpanzees are ambidextrous in their use of leaves, with only certain individuals showing a bias for one hand. We discuss possible explanations for the earlier emergence and increased ambidextrousness that characterises leaf-tool use in comparison with other forms of tool use by wild chimpanzees. In summary, our results provide the first detailed description of the acquisition process underlying leaf-tool use along with the accompanying patterns of handedness, while also being the first to provide comparisons of the development of different forms of tool use within the same wild chimpanzee population...|$|E
