The exceptional quality of the polymer enables them {{to be used as}} bio-material precursor. Seaweed is a natural abundance resource that contains gelators as the primary source of commercially available refined gelator. Its production cost is significantly low compared to existing commercial bio-materials due to simple solvent removal method. In order to improve end-product qualities, their density and physicochemical properties have to be controlled. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) were employed to study these changes besides other physical tests including Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA). moisture absorption and tensile strength characterizations...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation {{erosion and}} fatigue tests were cariied out for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials; epoxy resin, polypropylene, {{high-density}} polyethylene and polyamide 66, {{and the relationship}} between cavitation erosion resistances and mechanical properties was examined. Resistance of cavitation erosion for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials is ranged between half and 30 times in comparison with that for carbon steels. Cavitation erosion for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials is caused by fatigue as well as metals. As <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials have relatively small acoustic impedance, impact loads applied by collapse of bubbles becomes so small. Therefore, the resistance and incubation period of cavitation erosion for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials can be evaluated by strain energy in fatigue by taking account of impact energy due to collapse of bubbles...|$|R

40|$|Investment casting {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as the best option in producing TiAl components with key benefits of accuracy, versatility and integrity. The collapsibility of ceramic moulds for investment casting is critical in the manufacturing process of TiAl components due to TiAl’s intrinsic brittleness at room temperature. The aim of the present research {{is to provide a}} method for production of TiAl components by investment casting in ZrO 2 ceramic moulds with improved collapsibility. Slurries prepared with <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> additions were utilized during the preparation of ceramic moulds. The stress/strain curves obtained from green and baked ceramic moulds demonstrate that the green strength was increased with the application of <b>high</b> <b>polymer,</b> while baked strength decreased, thus the collapsibility of ceramic moulds was improved. It is suggested that this result is related to the burn-out of <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> which left a lot of cavities.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>high</b> <b>polymers</b> in solution {{has been}} extensively investigated by many methods, but the diffusion of <b>high</b> <b>polymers</b> has received little attention experimentally, and limited {{progress has been made}} in its theoretical treatment. According to these theories, the rate of diffusion is governed in large measure by the shape of the polymer chain which, however, need not be the same in different solvents. Evidence for a change of shape in different solvents is obtained indirectly from experiments on viscosity, osmotic pressure, sedimentation velocity, and streaming birefringence, while direct evidence is provided by measurements of light scattering. Experimental studies on the diffusion of <b>high</b> <b>polymers</b> should therefore be of interest from two points of view, (i) to provide data by which to examine the validity of existing theories, and (ii) to obtain additional information about the extent to which a polymer may alter its configuration in different solvents.
