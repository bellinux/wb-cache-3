The variables considered in this study are rotation speed, back pressure, barrel heater temperatures, <b>nozzle</b> <b>heater</b> temperature, dwell time and injection velocity profile. A set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been developed to predict the effect of the operating conditions on the melt temperature during plastication. The dwell period is treated as a heat conduction problem. A free boundary model for the injection phase is developed to simulate the temperature development and melt flow due to the forward motivation of the screw. The overall prediction of nozzle melt temperature is in good agreement with the experimental measurement, validating the proposed procedure combining ANNs and mathematical modeling.

40|$|A process {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} systematically to quantify how the melt temperature at the nozzle exit {{is affected by the}} operating conditions during the plastication, dwell and injection phases in a thermoplastics injection molding process. The following process variables are considered in this study: rotation speed, back pressure, barrel heater temperatures, <b>nozzle</b> <b>heater</b> temperature, dwell time and injection velocity profile. The three consecutive phases, plastication, dwell, and injection are studied and modeled separately. A set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been developed to predict the effect of the operating conditions on the melt temperature during plastication. One dimensional heat conduction model is used to simulate the dwell period. A free boundary model for the injection phase is developed to simulate the melt flow pushed by the forward movement of the screw, and the finite element method (FEM) is used to solve this model. The over-all prediction of the nozzle melt temperature is in good agreement with the experimental measurements.

40|$|The project synthesizes phase pure Yttria {{particles}} using flame spray pyrolysis, and to experimentally {{determines the}} effect of various process parameters like residence time, adiabatic flame temperature and precursor droplet size on the phase of Yttria particles generated. Further, through experimentation {{and based on the}} understanding of the process, conditions that produce pure monoclinic Y 2 O 3 particles were found. An ultrasonic atomization set-up was used to introduce precursor droplets (aqueous solution of yttrium nitrate hex hydrate) into the flame. A hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flame was used to realize the high temperature aerosol synthesis. The particles were collected on filters and analyzed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Individual process parameters (flame temperature, residence time, precursor concentration, precursor droplet size) were varied in continuous trials, keeping the rest of the parameters constant. The effect of the varied parameter on the phase of the product Yttria particles was then analyzed. Pre-flame heating was undertaken using a <b>nozzle</b> <b>heater</b> at variable power. Precursor solution concentrations of 0. 026 mol/L, 0. 26 mol/L, and 0. 65 mol/L were used. Residence time was varied by means of burner diameter (9. 5 mm and 1. 6 mm ID). Large precursor droplets were removed by means of an inertial impactor. The higher flame temperatures and precursor heating favor the formation of monoclinic yttrium oxide. The fraction of the cubic phase is closely related to the particle diameter. All particles larger than a critical size were of the cubic phase. Phase pure monoclinic yttrium oxide particles were successfully synthesized. The end conditions included a precursor concentration of 0. 65 mol/L, a pure hydrogen-oxygen flame and a 1. 6 mm burner. The precursor droplets entrained fuel gas was passed through a round jet impactor and preheated at full power (130 VA). The particles synthesized were in the size range of 0. 350 to 1. 7 ?m...|$|E

The microstructure and tensile properties indicated that the Alloy 600 was susceptible to primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) providing that a high tensile stress (applied + residual) was present. The residual stress distributions at the inside diameter surface and at different depths below the surface were measured in Alloy 600 <b>nozzle</b> and <b>heater</b> sleeve mockups. Surface residual stresses on the nozzle mockup ranged from- 350 to + 830 MPa. For the heater sleeve mockup, the surface residual stresses ranged from- 330 to + 525 MPa.

The precursors used were Cadmium chloride and selenourea for deposition. Various parameters to synthesize the CdSSe thin films were the surface temperatures, distance between surface <b>nozzle</b> and substrate <b>heater</b> and the pressure were optimized initially out of which substrate temperature was kept constant at 2750 C + 50 C, distance between spray <b>nozzle</b> and <b>heater</b> was kept 27 cm. The as deposited thin films of CdSSe were annealed in the nitrogen atmosphere {{for half an hour}} before characterization. The nitrogen annealed thin CdSSE films were studied for Photosennsing and Photo luminescent properties. Present investigation describes the effect of increase in incident intensity of li 8 ght on the CdSSE thin films. The light intensity was varied by using the incandescent bulb, maximum photosensitivity of CdSSe thin films was found to obtained 42000. In Photoluminescence study the peaks observed in were in close agreement with the reported peaks of the photoluminescence spectra for CdSSe thin films [...] The blue shift observed in PL emission spectra corresponds to nanocrystalline effect.

40|$|The prior project {{consisted}} of two main project lines. First, characterization of novel nanomaterials for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) applications. Second, studying more traditional model systems for HDS such as vapor-deposited silica-supported Mo and MoSx clusters. In the first subproject, we studied WS 2 and MoS 2 fullerene-like nanoparticles as well as WS 2 nanotubes. Thiophene (C 4 H 4 S) {{was used as the}} probe molecule. Interestingly, metallic and sulfur-like adsorption sites could be identified on the silica-supported fullerene-particles system. Similar structures are seen for the traditional system (vapor-deposited clusters). Thus, this may be a kinetics fingerprint feature of modern HDS model systems. In addition, kinetics data allowed characterization of the different adsorption sites for thiophene on and inside WS 2 nanotube bundles. The latter is a unique feature of nanotubes that has not been reported before for any inorganic nanotube system; however, examples are known for carbon nanotubes, including prior work of the PI. Although HDS has been studied for decades, utilizing nanotubes as nanosized HDS reactors has never been tried before, as far as we know. This is of interest from a fundamental perspective. Unfortunately, the HDS activity of the nanocatalysts at ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions was close to the detection limit of our techniques. Therefore, we propose to run experiments at ambient pressure on related nanopowder samples as part of the renewal application utilizing a now-available GC (gas chromatograph) setup. In addition, Ni and Co doped nanocatalyts are proposed for study. These dopants will boost the catalytic activity. In the second subproject of the prior grant, we studied HDS-related chemistry on more traditional supported cluster catalysts. Mo clusters supported by physical vapor deposition (PVD) on silica have been characterized. Two reaction pathways are evident when adsorbing thiophene on Mo and MoSx clusters: molecular adsorption and dissociation. PVD Mo clusters turned out to be very reactive toward thiophene bond activation. Sulfur and carbon residuals form, which poison the catalyst and sulfide the Mo clusters. Sulfided silica-supported MoSx samples are not reactive toward thiophene bond activation. In addition to S and C deposits, H 2, H 2 S, and small organic molecules were detected in the gas phase. Catalyst reactivation procedures, including O 2 and atomic hydrogen treatments, have been tested. Cluster size effects have been seen: thiophene adsorbs molecularly with larger binding energies on smaller clusters. However, larger clusters have smaller activation energy for C 4 H 4 S bond activation than smaller clusters. The latter is consistent with early catalysis studies. Kinetics and dynamics parameters have been determined quantitatively. We spent a significant amount of time on upgrades of our equipment. A 2 nd-hand refurbished X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) has been integrated into the existing molecular beam scattering system and is already operational (supported by the DoE supplemental grant available in October 2009). We also added a time of flight (TOF) system to the beam scattering apparatus and improved on the accessible impact energy range (new <b>nozzle</b> <b>heater</b> and gas mixing manifold) for the beam scattering experiments. In addition, a GC-based powder atmospheric flow reactor for studies on powder samples is now operational. Furthermore, a 2 nd UHV kinetics system has been upgraded as well. In summary, mostly single crystal systems have so far been considered in basic science studies about HDS. Industrial catalysts, however, can be better approximated with the supported cluster systems that we studied in this project. Furthermore, an entirely new class of HDS systems, namely fullerene-like particles and inorganic nanotubes, has been included. Studying new materials and systems has the potential to impact science and technology. The systems investigated are closely related to energy and environmental-related surface science/catalysis.

30|$|To {{trace the}} effect of doping on the hole capture process of the same sample, we used the {{hydrogen}} passivation technique. Hydrogen is commonly used in Si-based photovoltaic cells to neutralize shallow acceptor [17, 18] and donor [19] impurities, to passivate deep recombination [20] and nonradiative centers [21]. In our experiments, atomic hydrogen was introduced into the samples by a treatment from a remote radio-frequency plasma at a substrate temperature of 300 °C for 15 and 30 min. The passivation system consists of a quartz tube (diameter of 1 cm) with ring-like electrodes through which H 2 flowed at 200 cm 3 /min at a pressure of approximately 1 mbar. Radio frequency radiation (40.7 MHz, 70 W) generated the plasma inside the tube, and the sample was located 8 cm downstream from the tube <b>nozzle</b> on a <b>heater</b> block.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was performed to examine the expected heat transfer rates that will occur within the NASA-Ames 100 megawatt arc <b>heater</b> <b>nozzle.</b> This nozzle was tentatively designed and identified to provide research for a directly connected combustion experiment specifically related to the National Aerospace Plane Program (NASP) aircraft, {{and is expected to}} simulate the flow field entering the combustor section. It was found that extremely fine grids, that is very small mesh spacing near the wall, are required to accurately model the heat transfer process and, in fact, must contain a point within the laminar sublayer if results are to be taken directly from a numerical simulation code. In the present study, an alternative to this very fine mesh and its attendant increase in computational time was invoked and is based on a wall-function method. It was shown that solutions could be obtained that give accurate indications of surface heat transfer rate throughout the nozzle in approximately 1 / 100 of the computer time required to do the simulation directly without the use of the wall-function implementation. Finally, a maximum heating value in the throat region of the proposed slit nozzle for the 100 megawatt arc heater was shown to be approximately 6 MW per square meter...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the operation of a RBCC at ramjet and scramjet flight conditions using a direct-connect test facility. The apparatus being tested is a single strut-rocket within a dual-mode ram/scramjet combustor. The gaseous hydrogen/oxygen, linear strut-rocket was supplied by Aerojet Propulsion Company. The hardware is being tested in the Direct Connect Supersonic Combustion Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. The test facilities hydrogen/oxygen vitiated heater is capable of flight total enthalpies to Mach 8. A Mach 2. 5 facility <b>nozzle</b> mates the <b>heater</b> to the combustor duct. The rocket ejector will ordinarily operate in a fuel-rich mode. Additional fuel injection is provided by a pair of parallel injectors located at the base of the strut body. Instrumentation on the test apparatus includes a unique, direct thrust measurement system. Performance predictions for the anticipated test conditions have been made using a one-dimensional, thermodynamic analysis code. Results from the code show the dependence of overall thrust and specific impulse on rocket chamber pressure, rocket fuel equivalence ratio, and overall fuel equivalence ratio. Once the experimental test series begins, the inferred combustion efficiency as a function of axial location and the thermal choke region (where applicable) can also be determined using this code. Upon completion of the experimental test series, measurements will be used to calculate thrust, specific impulse, etc. Measured and calculated values will be compared to those found analytically. If appropriate, the code will be tailored to better predict hardware operation. Conclusions will be drawn as to the fuel-rich rocket's overall effect on ramjet and scramjet performance. Also, comparisons will be made between the integrated thrust calculated from the static pressure taps located along the duct and the thrust measured by the direct thrust measurement system...|$|R
40|$|Micropropulsion for {{spacecraft}} is an {{enabling technology}} for many future missions, and {{may increase the}} performance and drastically reduce the mass required for advanced propulsion systems. The Swedish activities in micropropulsion at The Angstrom Space Technology Centre (ASTC) are outlined. The research targets two major issues: the development of system parts, and the research into integration techniques and strategies. This paper collects a multitude of devices relevant to the micropropulsion system design, together with representative functional demonstrations. The items are mainly intended for chemical micropropulsion systems or fuel-feed systems for electric propulsion. In particular, gas handling devices, sensors, and actuators are presented. These include silicon <b>nozzles,</b> thin film <b>heaters,</b> suspended microcoil heaters, proportional piezoelectric valves, proportional and isolation valves using phase-change material, thermal throttle flow-regulators, high-pressure regulators, 3 D-particle filters, and sensors for strain, pressure, flow, and thrust. Moreover, integration techniques and interface structures are presented, for example low-temperature plasma-assisted silicon wafer bonding, multiwafer bonding, thin film soldering, hermetic electric through-wafer via connections, and multiconnector through-wafer vias. Emphasis is on how these items are designed to allow for system integration in a multiwafer silicon stack, comprising a complete micropropulsion system. In this manner, all items form a parts collection available to the system design. This strategy is exemplified by three micropropulsion systems researched at the ASTC. First, the cold/hot gas micropropulsion system is suitable for small spacecraft or when the demands on stability and pointing precision are extreme. The system performance depends strongly {{on the use of}} gas flow control. The complete gas handling system of four independent thrusters is integrated in the assembly of four structured silicon wafers. Each independent thruster contains a proportional valve, sensors for pressure, temperature, and thrust feedback, a converging-diverging micronozzle, and a suspended microcoil heater. The mass of the system is below 60 g. In total, this will provide the spacecraft with a safe, clean, low-powered, redundant, and flexible system for three-axis stabilization and attitude control. Second, a Xenon feed system for ion propulsion is heavily miniaturized using microsystems technology. Basically, a micromachined high-pressure regulator receives the gas from the storage, and the flow is further modulated by a thermally controlled flow restrictor. The flow restrictor microsystem comprises narrow ducts, thin film heaters, suspended parts for heat management, and flow sensors. Hereby, the amount of xenon required by the electric propulsion systems can be promptly delivered. The complete system mass is estimated to 150 g. Third, within the EU IST program, the ASTC participates {{in the development of a}} micro-pyrotechnic actuator system (Micropyros), suitable for short-duration space propulsion. The Micropyros integrate a full matrix of minute solid combustion rocket engines into panels situated on the spacecraft hull. The thrusters can be individually ignited, and each deliver thrust in the millinewton range. The ASTC focuses on the integration of the propulsion part by low-temperature bonding, and the characterization of the complete system...|$|R
