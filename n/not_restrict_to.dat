50|$|In mathematics, in {{the realm}} of group theory, a power {{automorphism}} of a group is an automorphism that takes each subgroup of the group to within itself. It is worth noting that the power automorphism of an infinite group may <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> an automorphism on each subgroup. For instance, the automorphism on rational numbers that sends each number to its double is a power automorphism even though it does <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> an automorphism on each subgroup.|$|E
50|$|This {{connection}} between transfer and fusion is credited to , where, in different language, the focal subgroup theorem was proved along with various generalizations. The requirement that G/K be abelian was dropped, so that Higman also studied Op(G) and the nilpotent residual γ∞(G), as so called hyperfocal subgroups. Higman also did <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> a single prime p, but rather allowed π-groups for sets of primes π and used Philip Hall's theorem of Hall subgroups {{in order to}} prove similar results about the transfer into Hall π-subgroups; taking π = {p} a Hall π-subgroup is a Sylow p-subgroup, and the results of Higman are as presented above.|$|E
50|$|The {{activities}} of the Archives did <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> the document accumulation. The old record books were managed (described, numbered, assigned to fonds) and bound up. There were also inventories of the old record books, as well as place-name indexes arranged. The stock of the accumulated documents served as a base to provide offices and private persons with archival certificates or legal document extracts. Some historical sources have been published. As a matter of fact, the selection of such documents for publication was rather slanted as they mainly served the purpose of leaving {{no doubt about the}} “North-western Krai” as an inherent part of Russia. Scientists and other outsiders were rarely admitted to the research of the historical sources - it was possible only with the permission of the highest or local authorities.|$|E

30|$|Erlotinib is an {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR)-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The wide inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of erlotinib may impact treatment outcome and/or toxicity. Recent in vivo studies reported a nonlinear uptake transport of erlotinib into the liver, suggesting carrier-mediated system(s) to mediate its hepatobiliary clearance. Erlotinib has been identified in vitro as a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters which expression does <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> hepatocytes and may impact the tissue uptake of erlotinib in vivo.|$|E

This generalizes previous results in two directions: First, we do <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> Banach spaces and second, we do not require the partial order to be admissible nor normal. As a second main result and application we prove weak synchronization by noise for stochastic porous media equations with additive noise. Comment: 25 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Zielonka’s theorem {{shows that}} each regular set of Mazurkiewicz traces can be {{implemented}} as a system of synchronized processes provided with some distributed control structure called an asynchronous automaton. This paper gives a new algorithm for the synthesis of a non-deterministic asynchronous automaton from a regular Mazurkiewicz trace language. Our approach {{is based on an}} unfolding procedure that improves the complexity of Zielonka’s and Pighizzini’s techniques: Our construction is polynomial {{in terms of the number}} of states but still double-exponential in the size of the alphabet. As opposed to Métivier’s work, our algorithm does <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> acyclic dependence alphabets. ...|$|E

In 2005, Rouquier has given the first examples of algebras of representation dimension greater than three. Here, we give the first general method for establishing lower bounds for the representation dimension of given algebras or families of algebras. The classes of algebras for which we explicitly apply this method include (but do <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to)</b> most of the previous examples of algebras of large representation dimension, for some of which the lower bound is improved to the correct value...|$|E

We also identify a topological phase transition, through which the charges of the nodal surface changes by absorbing or emitting an integer number of Weyl points. Our result indicates that in the band theory, topologically charged objects are <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> zero dimension as in a Weyl point, and thus pointing to previously unexplored opportunities for the design of topological materials.

Currently wide range of experimental data is also available however rarely these data sets can be summarized in simple output data, e. g. in categorical form. Moreover it may not even be appropriate to do so. The proposed setup allows modeling not only the observed data and parameters of interest but most importantly to incorporate prior knowledge. Additionally the setup easily extends to facilitate more popular data-driven analysis...|$|E
