Mandler spoke to MTV News, stating [...] "I think that with this song and the meaning of this song and how loaded it all is, <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended,</b> how much imagery and perhaps symbolism that is loaded in this song, {{the only way to do}} it was to do something that was visually challenging".

5000|$|Though Biggie and {{his entire}} camp have {{continuously}} denied that “Who Shot Ya?” was directed towards 2Pac, {{the timing of}} its release and the perceived subliminal shots (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> lead {{us to believe that}} this was most likely a diss record.|$|E
5000|$|Alex Strachan of Canada.com said, {{in regards}} to ratings, [...] "Wonderland’s future may well depend on a change of scenery — a new day and time, <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended</b> — {{where it can be}} given room to breathe and find an audience" [...] as the series faces {{competition}} with The Big Bang Theory.|$|E
5000|$|After debuting the satirical comedy, {{the creators}} of the show {{addressed}} their intent. [...] "One thing that was really important... was not to do [...] "mean-spirited" [...] comedy," [...] says Mirza, who ultimately respects the famous family for their savvy [...] "force in popular culture." [...] And considering the Kardashians frequently wind up as the butt of a joke (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> on late-night television, {{it was important to}} establish a character in Kam Kardashian that made sense to anyone watching it.|$|E

Following Great Britain's defeat 3-1 defeat to Australia in the bronze playoff game, Fair was not one of the five Olympians selected for the England squad chosen to go to the 2012 Champions Trophy. which is very unfair. <b>No</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended</b> ...|$|E

Nettles commented on the song, saying it [...] "is just plain, unashamed, Sugar-fun! It sticks in your brain, <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended.</b> To me it feels young, hip and of course sassy”! ...|$|E
5000|$|James Plath of Movie Metropolis {{was more}} positive, saying that [...] "For some viewers, the agony will be {{watching}} Charlton Heston (over)act, and the ecstasy Rex Harrison.

5000|$|Weikath and vocalist Andi Deris agreed {{there would}} be [...] "haters" [...] to pan the album, but they {{intended}} to keep a [...] "liberal attitude towards heavy metal: to do anything we want — and not follow the directions the know-it-alls would have pushed on us. We remained unfazed and acted out our vision of 'anything goes' in the songwriting process to 'My God-Given Right' because {{we believe that it}} is our god-given-right (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> to do as we please and fulfill our musical vision without any boundaries." [...] Deris also said the album is an attempt to please all generations of fans.|$|E
5000|$|We had {{two weeks}} rehearsal, so {{we talked about}} it until we were about to pass out. I think I had known Blake for three or four days, before we shot scenes. That was the first week of {{shooting}}. It was just about trusting Blake and Oliver, like you do on any set. I was just glad it was over with, to be honest. It's very awkward to do. It's such a big part of Chon and who he is. That's how you meet him, so it's a pretty intense reveal, <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended.</b> It's all part of it, but I was glad it was in the first week. — Kitsch on shooting the sex scenes ...|$|E
40|$|A third {{straight}} week of cooler than average weather has slowed crop progress across Iowa. Sporadic rainfall has limited field work, {{and for many}} fields weeds are a growing concern (<b>pun</b> <b>intended).</b> There has been slow weed response to herbicides, especially with glyphosate. The answer to this lies in getting some warmer weather to stimulate growth. So patience is a virtue...|$|R
5000|$|He {{refers to}} {{his time at}} work as being [...] "buried alive … not even {{certified}} death can ever {{take the place of}} that". Dan’s workplace is at the terminus, {{the end of the line}} (<b>pun</b> <b>intended),</b> and, with its [...] "‘rest-couch and velvet hangings’, the office seems womblike, but a [...] "wombtomb", a womb after life rather than before." ...|$|R
5000|$|In her {{review of}} the song, Bianca Gracie of Idolator wrote, [...] "the featherlight tune (<b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> is a {{beautiful}} and delicate mid-tempo that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike."

5000|$|Alternative Press {{gave the}} album four stars {{out of five}} and said it [...] "feels every bit as massive as the world it sets up. It's not just the {{heaviest}} record in Coheed's arsenal; it's {{also one of the}} strongest." [...] The Boston Globe gave it a favorable review and stated that [...] "The record is further evidence of the quartet's easy chemistry. The band is both bold and geeky, creating a signature sound that typically triggers strong reaction; one man's progressive is another's pretentious." [...] Melodic.net similarly gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "Coheed and Cambria always find new ways to bring in their audience and give them all that they have (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended).</b> This is a great album and I think one of their best to date." ...|$|E
5000|$|Graham welcomed Georgina's return {{following}} her previous arc that began during the episode, Southern Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. [...] "Of course, {{to balance the}} cute we need something evil and no character manages that better than good old Georgina Sparks. Her mere moments in the episode rank as my other high point as {{not only do we}} discover that the Poppy Lifton issue has been resolved. (The only problem with this scene: HOW did she resolve the issue?) but also that she will be back!"With the return of Georgina in the finale, Graham expressed high hopes for her character for the next season, stating [...] "Perhaps this will be the spark (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> required to shake Blair’s cobwebs off and get her back to her queen bee fighting weight." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{had been}} {{thinking}} about making works that dealt with layers, physically, materially and conceptually. I wanted to produce works that were about both exposure and revealing and at the same dealt with closure and covering. Given the nature of the lyrics {{and the power of the}} music I was working with, I felt justified in attempting to make works that alluded to the apparently contradictory imagery of pain and healing. I wanted to make beautiful surfaces that partially revealed the visceral rawness of open wounds beneath. The mixed media work 'Wound' was the first piece I tackled in this vein (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> and it became the cover of the album. It is made of plaster, acrylics, oils, rusted metals, insects, moths, blood (mine), wax, varnishes, and surgical bandaging on a wooden panel.|$|E
5000|$|Sarah Maines from The TV Chick {{said that}} this episode was another boring one. [...] "Another week, another stiff and boring episode of Secret Circle. All of the pieces are there to create an fun show, but the magic still isn’t there (horrible <b>pun</b> <b>intended).</b> One day, I hope this show figures out {{that it needs to}} be a plot heavy show; sadly, today was not that day." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was a man}} {{who entered}} a local paper's pun contest. He sent in ten {{different}} puns, in the hope {{that at least one of}} the puns would win. Unfortunately, <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> in ten did.|$|R
50|$|The film {{shows the}} American army {{preparing}} for World War Two and is laughable (<b>pun</b> <b>intended)</b> for the antiquated tactics and equipment shown. Much {{of the film}} is about a mounted cavalry unit training for war. As the film was released in October 1941, two months before Pearl Harbor, but well after the fall of France (1940) and the invasion of Russia (1941), the obvious superiority of tanks made this film seem very outdated.|$|R
5000|$|I suppose [...] "canon" [...] {{means what}} Gene Roddenberry decided it was. Remember, {{we were making}} it up as we went along on the {{original}} series (and on the animated one, too). We had a research company to keep us on {{the straight and narrow}} as to science, projected science based on known science, science fiction references (we didn’t want to step on anyone's exclusive ideas in movies, other TV shows, or printed work). They also helped prevent contradictions and common reference errors. So the so-called canon evolved in its own way and its own time. For whatever reason, Gene Roddenberry apparently didn’t take the animated series seriously (<b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended),</b> although we worked very hard to do original STAR TREK stories and concepts at all times in the animated series.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} by Steve 'Flash' Juon {{the album is}} {{explained}} as, Hailed as an underground classic, [...] "2000 Fold" [...] took us to styles beyond average hip-hop, <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> <b>intended.</b> Ryu and Takbir crafted refreshingly different raps: [...] "Easy Back it Up," [...] "Spies Like Us" [...] and [...] "Winnetka Exit" [...] {{just to name a}} few. The duo seemed to delight in challenging the conventions of rap with every word, by turns imagining themselves as fly secret agents that could out bomb James Bond then in the next breath having to beg for a dollar for gas. Their wit was matched only by their beats, clearly making their LP one of 1999's most creative and innovative releases. The album is still as relevant today if not more so.|$|E
