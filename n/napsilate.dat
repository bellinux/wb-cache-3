This paper investigates hydrophilic and hydrophobic intermolecular interactions that occur within the series of crystal structures comprising remacemide 1 and six of its salts [2 = chloride; 3 = nitrate; 4 = acetate (C 2 H 3 O 2 -); 5 = hydrogenfumarate (C 4 H 3 O 4 -); 6 = naphthalene- 2 -sulfonate (<b>napsilate,</b> C 10 H 7 O 3 S-); 7 = 1 -hydroxynaphthalene- 2 -carboxylate (xinafoate, C 11 H 7 O 3 -) ]. The hydrophilic interactions are described through graph set analyses of the hydrogen bond motifs and networks. The lattice of 1 comprises unidirectional, one-dimensional chains of molecules parallel to the c-axis. In 2, the cation-anion hydrogen bonding imposes a well-defined hydrophilic stratum structure on the lattice. As the cation itself is amphiphilic, a natural consequence {{of this is the}} creation of two-dimensional stacked layers with alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic character (lattice bilayers). This tendency to form bilayers within the lattice is also observed in structures 3 - 5 (polar anions) and structures 6 - 7 (amphiphilic anions). Relatively few well-directed intermolecular interactions are observed between aromatic rings, either in 1 or in the hydrophobic layers of 2 - 7. Therefore, it is concluded that it is the hydrophilic hydrogen bond interactions that dominate the crystal packing and drive the segregation into lattice bilayers in the salt crystal structures...|$|E
