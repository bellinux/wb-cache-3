More technically, SR occurs if the signal-to-noise ratio of a nonlinear system or device increases for moderate values of <b>noise</b> <b>intensity.</b> It often occurs in bistable systems or in systems with a sensory threshold and when the input signal to the system is [...] "sub-threshold". For lower <b>noise</b> <b>intensities,</b> the signal does not cause the device to cross threshold, so little signal is passed through it. For large <b>noise</b> <b>intensities,</b> the output {{is dominated by the}} noise, also leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio. For moderate <b>intensities,</b> the <b>noise</b> allows the signal to reach threshold, but the <b>noise</b> <b>intensity</b> is not so large as to swamp it.

We carried out numerical simulation of the probability distribution density dynamics and statistical characteristics of the system under study for varying <b>noise</b> <b>intensity</b> values and system parameter values corresponding to a spatially inhomogeneous ordered state in a deterministic case. Physical interpretation of the results obtained that determines the scenario of noise-induced order-disorder transition is given. Mean-field results are compared with numerical simulations of the evolution of the model under study. We find that beginning from some value of external <b>noise</b> <b>intensity</b> the "embryo" of disorder appears inside the ordered phase. Its lifetime is finite, and it increases with growth of <b>noise</b> <b>intensity.</b> At some second <b>noise</b> <b>intensity</b> value the ordered and disordered phases begin to alternate repeatedly and almost periodically.

For the low <b>noise</b> <b>intensity</b> regime we recover the previously proposed algebraic dependence on D of the characteristic escape time, T_esc≃ C(α) /D^μ(α), where C(α) is a coefficient. It is {{shown that the}} exponent μ(α) remains approximately constant, μ≈ 1 for 0 <α< 2; at α= 2 the power-law form of T_esc changes into the known exponential dependence on 1 /D; it exhibits a divergence-like behavior as α approaches 2. In this regime we observe a monotonous increase of the escape time T_esc with increasing α (keeping the <b>noise</b> <b>intensity</b> D constant). The probability density of the escape time decays exponentially. In addition, for low <b>noise</b> <b>intensities</b> the escape times correspond to barrier crossing by multiple Levy steps. For high <b>noise</b> <b>intensities,</b> the escape time curves collapse for all values of α.
