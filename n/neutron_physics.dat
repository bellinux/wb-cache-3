25|$|After gaining his {{doctorate}} at Columbia, Dunning continued {{teaching and research}} there, becoming {{an assistant professor in}} 1935, and an associate professor there in 1938. Dunning was a central figure at Columbia on neutron research, and went on to publish 24 papers on neutrons between 1934 and 1938. In 1936, Dunning received a Traveling Fellowship, which he used to meet and discuss his <b>neutron</b> <b>physics</b> research with many eminent European nuclear physicists including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, and Ernest Rutherford.|$|E

25|$|Frank Harlow, {{who joined}} the Theoretical Division in 1953, and was {{appointed}} as a group leader by Mark in 1959, noted that Mark took a personal interest in the computer systems, then a rapidly developing field. As most weapon research in the 1960s no longer involved the Theoretical Division, Mark branched out, sponsoring research into hydrodynamics, <b>neutron</b> <b>physics</b> and transport theory. He also supported Frederick Reines's research into neutrinos, for which Reines was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.|$|E

Although the British offered refuge to French nuclear scientists, {{including}} Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, they regarded Pontecorvo as an [...] "undesirable". Fortunately, Segrè had been given an offer of employment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by two European expatriates who were looking for an expert on <b>neutron</b> <b>physics.</b> Segrè had turned down the offer — he already had a good job at the University of California — but recommended Pontecorvo.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{introductory}} {{overview of the}} search for continuous gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars. We review the current theoretical understanding of possible emission mechanisms and the expected strength of signals received on Earth. Given the substantial uncertainties involved in <b>neutron</b> star <b>physics,</b> these searches — if sufficiently sensitive — can provide important new information and constraints about <b>neutron</b> star <b>physics</b> {{even in the absence of}} detection. We describe the challenging problem of trying to detect such extremely weak signals and introduce some of the basic data analysis concepts and methods used. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the sensitivities and upper limits achieved so far. These results suggest that the search for spinning neutron stars using LIGO-I is about to enter a regime of “astrophysical relevance”.
