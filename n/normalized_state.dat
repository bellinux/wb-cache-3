40|$|We {{show that}} there is a {{correspondence}} between Goldbach conjecture sequences (GCS) and expectation values of the number operator in Fock states. We demonstrate that depending on the normalization or not of Fock state superpositions, we have sequences that are equivalent and sequences that are not equivalent to GCS. We propose an algorithm where sequences equivalent to GCS can be derived in terms of expectation values with <b>normalized</b> <b>states.</b> Defining states whose projections generate GCS, we relate this problem to eigenstates of quantum harmonic oscillator and discuss Fock states directly associated to GCS, taking into account the hamiltonian spectrum and quantum vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we address the problems of degeneracy, maps associating GCS and Goldbach partitions. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Carl Bender and {{collaborators}} {{have developed}} a quantum theory governed by Hamiltonians that are PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian. To implement this theory, the inner product was redefined to guarantee positive norms of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In the general case, which includes arbitrary time-dependence in the Hamiltonian, a modification of the Schrodinger equation is necessary as shown by Gong and Wang to conserve probability. In this paper, we derive the following selection rule: transitions induced by time dependence in a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian cannot occur between <b>normalized</b> <b>states</b> of differing PT-norm. We show three examples of this selection rule in action: two matrix models {{and one in the}} continuum. Comment: 13 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} supergravity {{backgrounds}} {{have been proposed}} as dual descriptions of strong coupling large-N noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories in 3 + 1 dimensions. However calculations of correlation functions in supergravity from an evaluation of relevant classical actions appear ambiguous. We propose a resolution of this ambiguity. Assuming that some holographic description exists - {{regardless of whether it}} is the NCYM theory - we argue that there should be operators in the holographic boundary theory which create <b>normalized</b> <b>states</b> of definite energy and momenta. An operator version of the dual correspondence then provides a calculation of correlators of these operators in terms of bulk Green's functions. We show that in the low energy limit the correlators reproduce expected answers of the ordinary Yang-Mills theory. Comment: 18 pages, harvmac; typos corrected and references adde...|$|R
40|$|Most {{experimental}} and theoretical studies of adiabatic optimization use stoquastic Hamiltonians, whose ground states are expressible using only real nonnegative amplitudes. This {{raises a question}} as to whether classical Monte Carlo methods can simulate stoquastic adiabatic algorithms with polynomial overhead. Here, we analyze diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. We argue that, based on differences between L 1 and L 2 <b>normalized</b> <b>states,</b> these algorithms suffer from certain obstructions preventing them from efficiently simulating stoquastic adiabatic evolution in generality. In practice however, we obtain good performance by introducing a method that we call Substochastic Monte Carlo. In fact, our simulations are good classical optimization algorithms in their own right, competitive with the best previously known heuristic solvers for MAX-k-SAT at k= 2, 3, 4.

40|$|Reservoir Computing (RC) {{refers to}} a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) framework, {{frequently}} used for sequence learning and time series prediction. The RC system consists of a random fixed-weight RNN (the input-hidden reservoir layer) and a classifier (the hidden-output readout layer). Here {{we focus on the}} sequence learning problem, and we explore a different approach to RC. More specifically, we remove the non-linear neural activation function, and we consider an orthogonal reservoir acting on <b>normalized</b> <b>states</b> on the unit hypersphere. Surprisingly, our numerical results show that the system's memory capacity exceeds the dimensionality of the reservoir, which is the upper bound for the typical RC approach based on Echo State Networks (ESNs). We also show how the proposed system can be applied to symmetric cryptography problems, and we include a numerical implementation. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, Int. J. Mod. Phys. C, 201...|$|R
