5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|There are oft-repeated {{historical}} {{claims that}} Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco {{on a specific}} vessel, the Franzeska, on 23 November 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, {{in whole or in}} part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is substantiated by contemporaneous documentation. What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.|$|E
5|$|After direct American {{intervention}} in 1965, the increased presence of U.S. naval vessels in coastal waters Operation Market Time nullified the seaborne route. The alternative devised by Hanoi was ingenious. Following on the agreement between Sihanouk and the Chinese, an arrangement was also struck between the prince and the DRV government. In October military supplies were sailed directly from North Vietnam on communist-flagged (especially of the Eastern bloc) ships to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville, where that nation's neutrality guaranteed their delivery. The supplies were unloaded and {{then transferred to}} trucks which transported them to the frontier zones that served as PAVN/NLF Base Areas. These Base Areas also served as sanctuaries for PAVN/NLF troops, who simply crossed the border from South Vietnam and then rested, reinforced, and refitted for their next campaign in safety. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> could have been accomplished without the acquiescence of Sihanouk.|$|E

5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was apparent to either side. Sokolov adds {{that the decision to}} not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E

25|$|African {{traditional}} music is frequently functional in nature. Performances may be long and often involve {{the participation of}} the audience.
