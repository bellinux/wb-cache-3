40|$|Hybrid hexamers {{were made}} by {{refolding}} mixtures of two mutant forms of clostridial glutamate dehydrogenase. Mutant Cys 320 Ser (C 320 S) has a similar activity to the wild-type enzyme, but is unreactive with Ellman's reagent, 5, 5 '-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoate) (DTNB). The triple mutant Lys 89 Leu/Ala 163 Gly/Ser 380 Ala (K 89 L/A 163 G/S 380 A), active with <b>norleucine</b> but not glutamate, is inactivated by DTNB, since the amino acid residue at position 320 is a cysteine residue. The chosen ratio favoured 1 : 5 hybrids of the triple mutant and C 320 S. The renatured mixture was treated with DTNB and separated on an NAD(+) -agarose column to which only C 320 S subunits bind tightly. Fractions were monitored for glutamate and <b>norleucine</b> activity and for releasable thionitrobenzoate to establish subunit stoichiometry. A fraction highly enriched in the 1 : 5 hybrid was identified. Homohexamers (C 320 S with 40 mM glutamate and 1 mM NAD(+) at pH 8. 8, or K 89 L/A 163 G/S 380 A with 70 mM <b>norleucine</b> and 1 mM NAD(+) at pH 8. 5) showed allosteric activation; succinate activated C 320 S approx. 50 -fold (EC(50) = 70 mM, h= 2. 4), and glutarate gave approx. 30 -fold activation (EC(50) = 35 mM, h= 2. 3). For the triple mutant, corresponding values were 80 mM and 2. 2 for succinate, and 75 mM and 1. 7 for glutarate, but maximal activation was only about 2 -fold. In the 1 : 5 hybrid, with only one norleucine-active subunit per hexamer, responses to glutarate and succinate were still co-operative, and activation was more extensive than in the triple mutant homohexamer. A single norleucine-active subunit can thus respond co-operatively to a substrate analogue at the other five inactive sites. On the other hand, similar hyperbolic dependence on the <b>norleucine</b> concentration for the hybrid and the triple mutant homohexamer reflected the inability of C 320 S subunits to bind <b>norleucine.</b> With glutamate at pH 8. 8, an h value of 3. 6 was obtained for the 1 : 5 hybrid, in contrast with an h value of 5. 2 for the C 320 S homohexamer.

40|$|Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an {{inherited}} disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism presenting with lifethreatening cerebral oedema and dysmyelination in affected individuals. Treatment requires life-long dietary restriction and monitoring of branched-chain amino acids to avoid brain injury. Despite careful management, children commonly suffer metabolic decompensation {{in the context}} of catabolic stress associated with non-specific illness. The mechanisms underlying this decompensation and brain injury are poorly understood. Using recently developed mouse models of classic and intermediate maple syrup urine disease, we assessed biochemical, behavioural and neuropathological changes that occurred during encephalopathy in these mice. Here, we show that rapid brain leucine accumulation displaces other essential amino acids resulting in neurotransmitter depletion and disruption of normal brain growth and development. A novel approach of administering <b>norleucine</b> to heterozygous mothers of classic maple syrup urine disease pups reduced branched-chain amino acid accumulation in milk as well as blood and brain of these pups to enhance survival. Similarly, <b>norleucine</b> substantially delayed encephalopathy in intermediate maple syrup urine disease mice placed on a high protein diet that mimics the catabolic stress shown to cause encephalopathy in human maple syrup urine disease. Current findings suggest two converging mechanisms of brain injury in maple syrup urine disease including: (i) neurotransmitter deficiencies and growth restriction associated with branchedchain amino acid accumulation and (ii) energy deprivation through Krebs cycle disruption associated with branched-chain ketoacid accumulation. Both classic and intermediate models appear to be useful to study the mechanism of brain injury and potential treatment strategies for maple syrup urine disease. <b>Norleucine</b> should be further tested as a potential treatment to prevent encephalopathy in children with maple syrup urine disease during catabolic stress...|$|E
