5|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} to interpret the origin of volcanism in the NCVP. This includes slab windows, mantle plumes, crustal extension and deglaciation. The most common and best mechanism used to explain NCVP volcanic activity is incipient rifting of the North American Plate caused by crustal extension. As the continental crust stretches, the <b>near</b> <b>surface</b> rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Mafic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava flows, although more viscous felsic magma also makes {{its way to the}} surface and can produce explosive eruptions. Two major structural features, the Tintina and Denali-Coast fault systems, run parallel with the NCVP. Both structures have had strike-slip motions since the Cretaceous period and has resulted in several hundred kilometres of crustal displacement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the <b>near</b> <b>surface</b> layers of the polyimide.|$|E
5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the <b>near</b> <b>surface</b> rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E

We demonstrate a method to modify and reduce the stray electric field by changing the adsorbates distribution. We {{use one of the}} Rydberg excitation lasers to locally affect the adsorbed dipole distribution. By adjusting the averaged exposure time we change the strength (with the minimal value less than 0. 2 V/cm at 78 μm from the chip) and even the sign of the perpendicular field component. This technique is a useful tool for experiments handling Ryberg atoms <b>near</b> <b>surfaces,</b> including atom chips...|$|R
50|$|These ice {{crystals}} usually form when a temperature inversion is {{present at the}} surface and the warmer air above the ground mixes with the colder air <b>near</b> the <b>surface.</b> Since warmer air frequently contains more water vapor than colder air, this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air <b>near</b> the <b>surface,</b> causing the relative humidity of the near-surface air to increase.

5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the <b>near</b> <b>surface</b> smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E

40|$|A mesh {{deformation}} {{scheme is}} developed for a structured multi-block Navier-Stokes code {{consisting of two}} steps. The first step is a finite element solution of either user defined or automatically generated macro-elements. Macro-elements are hexagonal finite elements created from a subset of points from the full mesh. When assembled, the finite element system spans the complete flow domain. Macro-element moduli {{vary according to the}} distance to the <b>nearest</b> <b>surface,</b> resulting in extremely stiff elements <b>near</b> a moving <b>surface</b> and very pliable elements away from boundaries. Solution of the finite element system for the imposed boundary deflections generally produces smoothly varying nodal deflections. The manner in which distance to the <b>nearest</b> <b>surface</b> has been found to critically influence the quality of the element deformation. The second step is a transfinite interpolation which distributes the macro-element nodal deflections to the remaining fluid mesh points. The scheme is demonstrated for several two-dimensional applications...|$|R

50|$|A major {{limitation}} of early detectors {{was the problem}} of surface events. Due to incomplete charge collection, a particle interaction <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> of the crystal gave no ionization signal, so electron recoils <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> could be mistaken for nuclear recoils. To avoid this, the collaboration developed new detectors with interdigitised electrodes. Different voltages are applied {{to a series of}} electrodes so the direction of electric field is different <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> of the crystal, allowing over 99.5% of surface events to be rejected.|$|R

30|$|The above {{results show}} that the {{increase}} in the magma viscosity {{plays an important role in}} explaining the low porosity (close to zero) <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> observed in lava domes. The porosity <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> decreases with increasing ε (Fig. 2 (a)). Considering that the permeability decreases with decreasing porosity (e.g., Mueller et al., 2005) and that there is not a large variation of rc, the increase in ε is ascribed to the increase in the magma viscosity (see Eq. (11)). The viscosity drastically increases in the region <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> because of volatile exsolution and crystallization. As a result, the ascent of the liquid is suppressed owing to large wall friction force, whereas the gas ascends easily (i.e., efficient gas escape). For example, when the viscosity <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> increases up to 1014 Pa s, ε can become larger than 103, which leads to a porosity smaller than 0.2 (Fig. 2 (a)). The porosity <b>near</b> the <b>surface</b> remains low even when the mass flow rate is high, because the porosity in this region is insensitive to θ (Fig. 2 (a)).|$|R
25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, non-destructive testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or <b>near</b> <b>surface</b> stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E

40|$|Spermatozoa tend to swim <b>near</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Such {{attraction}} toward surface vicinity was approximated by the force-dipole {{theoretical approach}} and hydrodynamic modeling, but the physical parameters of surfaces have not usually {{been included in}} these models and their effect on sperm mobility remains unknown. In spermatozoa, changes in wave parameters, together with rotation around their longitudinal axis and circling appear when movement takes place close to surfaces. Here we show, by analysis of microscopy images (including high-speed video), a strong influence of the liquid-solid interface on sterlet spermatozoa motility characteristics compared with motility near the liquid-gas interface. Sperm cells swam at 16 % lower velocity near a liquid-solid interface, rotating at a stable frequency of 25 Hz, each 180 ° rotation corresponding to one beat cycle and circling clockwise (when observed from top). In case of spermatozoa close to a water-air interface, rotation and circling were sporadic and irregular. Sterlet spermatozoa movement <b>near</b> a <b>surface</b> affects their velocity and possibly causes rotation. These behaviors are highly dependent {{on the level of}} suppleness of the interface, as has been previously predicted by modeling. Our results enhance the understanding of how surfaces influence fish spermatozoa motility. These insights on the effects of surfaces on fish spermatozoa motility imply that widely used methods rating sperm motility, such as computer-assisted sperm analysis, might lead to erroneous results. Further study of sperm motility <b>near</b> <b>surfaces</b> is urgently needed to correct our rating methods and better understand sperm behavior in natural conditions. Improved evaluation of sperm motility behavior <b>near</b> <b>surfaces</b> could be used to determine physical properties of aquatic interfaces with various surfaces composed of different materials...|$|R

500|$|Stratiform (a broad {{shield of}} {{precipitation}} {{with a relatively}} similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur {{as a consequence of}} slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow <b>near</b> <b>surface</b> layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result.
