40|$|Paired {{groups of}} male rabbits were {{challenged}} with Treponema pallidum and Mycobacterium bovis BCG. One group had been sensitized to BCG by inoculation 3 weeks before challenge. All animals were challenged intradermally at multiple sites with T. pallidum alone, BCG alone, and both organisms {{into the same}} sites. The resulting lesions were followed clinically and histologically. BCG lesions enlarged more rapidly in sensitized rabbits, but they were otherwise no different {{from those in the}} controls. T. pallidum lesions enlarged and regressed simultaneously in both groups, but in the BCG-sensitized animals they became twice as large as those in the unsensitized rabbits. <b>Mixed</b> BCG-T. pallidum <b>lesions</b> showed the greatest differences in the two groups of animals. Like the pure BCG lesions, they enlarged more rapidly in the sensitized rabbits but began to recede after 1 week. The corresponding lesions in the controls enlarged more slowly and reached their maximum size after 3 weeks when the receding lesions in the sensitized animals were much smaller. The most marked histological-histochemical {{difference between the two groups}} of animals was in the number and activation of macrophages. These cells were more numerous in the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> of BCG-sensitized animals than in similar lesions of the controls and more activated as determined by beta-galactosidase staining. Although sparsely distributed, activated macrophages were more numerous in the pur T. pallidum lesions of sensitized animals than in those of control animals.

Quantitation of treponemes in pure T. pallidum versus <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> was determined in two groups of rabbits challenged intratesticularly.

40|$|Bone metastases are a {{frequent}} occurrence with cancer, and early detection can guide the patient's treatment regimen. Metastatic bone disease can present in density extremes as sclerotic (high density) and lytic (low density) or in a continuum with an admixture of both sclerotic and lytic components. We design a framework {{to detect and}} characterize the varying spectrum of presentation of spine metastasis on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) data. A technique is proposed to synthesize CT and PET images to enhance the lesion appearance for computer detection. A combination of watershed, graph cut, and level set algorithms is first run to obtain the initial detections.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Lung cancer metastases to bone {{produce a}} {{primarily}} <b>mixed</b> osteolytic/osteoblastic <b>lesion.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine if blockade of both pathways would inhibit the formation these lesions in bone. Inhibition of the osteoblastic lesion with noggin and the osteolytic lesion with RANK:Fc was a successful treatment strategy to inhibit progression of <b>mixed</b> lung cancer <b>lesions</b> in bone. INTRODUCTION: Approximately 9 - 30 % of patients with lung cancer develop bone metastases, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. A 549 is a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) line that produces a <b>mixed</b> metastatic <b>lesion</b> in bone. We sought to determine if blockade of key components in both osteolytic and osteoblastic pathways would result in a reduction of a NSCLC tumor progression in a murine model of bony metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used a retroviral vector overexpressing noggin (RN), a specific inhibitor of BMP, and RANK:Fc, a chimeric protein that inhibits the RANK-RANKL interaction. A 549 cells were transduced with RN before implantation in SCID mice. Cells were implanted in a subcutaneous model and tibial injection model. RANK:Fc was administered twice weekly at 15 mg/kg. There were five treatment groups: A 549; A 549 + RN; A 549 + RANK:Fc; A 549 + empty vector; and A 549 + RN + RANK:Fc (n = 10 /group). RESULTS: In SCID mice who underwent subcutaneous A 549 tumor cell injection, animals treated with A 549 + RN had significantly smaller subcutaneous tumor size at 8 weeks. In an intratibial model of bony metastasis, animals injected with A 549 cells developed a <b>mixed</b> lytic/blastic <b>lesion</b> with cortical destruction at 8 weeks. Treatment with RANK:Fc inhibited the formation of osteoclasts, led to a smaller tumor volume in bone, and inhibited the lytic component of the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion.</b> Animals treated with A 549 + RN had a decreased number of osteoblasts in bone lesions, smaller tumor volume, and inhibition of the blastic component of the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> Combination treatment inhibited both the lytic and blastic components of the lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The NSCLC cell line A 549 forms a <b>mixed</b> osteolytic/osteoblastic <b>lesion</b> in vivo. Noggin overexpression inhibited the formation of the osteoblastic aspect of the lesion in bone and the tumor growth in vivo. Treatment with RANK:Fc limited the formation of the lytic aspect of the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> and also inhibited the rate of in vivo tumor growth. Inhibition of both pathways is necessary to effectively inhibit the progression of <b>mixed</b> metastatic <b>lesions</b> in bone...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Up to 80 % of {{patients}} dying from prostate carcinoma have developed bone metastases that are incurable. Castration {{is commonly used}} to treat prostate cancer. Although the disease initially responds to androgen blockade strategies, it often becomes castration-resistant (CRPC for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer). Most of the murine models of <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> derived from prostate cancer cells are androgen sensitive. Thus, we established {{a new model of}} CRPC (androgen receptor (AR) negative) that causes <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> in bone. METHODS: PC 3 and its derived new cell clone PC 3 c cells were directly injected into the tibiae of SCID male mice. Tumor growth was analyzed by radiography and histology. Direct effects of conditioned medium of both cell lines were tested on osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes. RESULTS: We found that PC 3 c cells induced <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> 10 weeks after intratibial injection. In vitro, PC 3 c conditioned medium was able to stimulate tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive osteoclasts. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and endothelin- 1 (ET 1) were highly expressed by PC 3 c while dikkopf- 1 (DKK 1) expression was decreased. Finally, PC 3 c highly expressed bone associated markers osteopontin (OPN), Runx 2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and produced mineralized matrix in vitro in osteogenic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a new CRPC cell line as a useful system for modeling human metastatic prostate cancer which presents the mixed phenotype of bone metastases that is commonly observed in prostate cancer patients with advanced disease. This model will help to understand androgen-independent mechanisms involved in the progression of prostate cancer in bone and provides a preclinical model for testing the effects of new treatments for bone metastases.

40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} (DN) {{has become}} {{the leading cause of}} end-stage renal disease worldwide. Non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD), is known to occur in diabetic patients. The renal and retinal relationship in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) with nephropathy is not uniform. This study was carried to study the histological spectrum of nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria and its relationship with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Total 31 (males - 26; females - 5) proteinuric type 2 diabetic patients were studied. Average age of patients was 50. 7 years. Nephrotic syndrome was noted in 21 (67. 7 %) patients. Overall, isolated DN, NDRD and NDRD superimposed on DN (<b>mixed</b> <b>lesion)</b> were observed in 12 (38. 7 %), 13 (41. 9 %) and 6 (19. 4 %) cases, respectively. DR was absent in 21 / 31 (67. 7 %) cases. The spectrum of nephropathy in patients without DR included: DN in 6 (28. 57 %), NDRD in 12 (57. 14 %) and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> in 3 (14. 29 %). Kidney histology in patients with DR (n- 10) revealed DN in 6 (60 %), NDRD in 1 (10 %) and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesion</b> in 3 (30 %) patients. Thus, absence of DR favors NDRD but does not exclude DN because isolated DN was noted in 28. 57 % cases in absence of DR. Similarly biopsy proven NDRD (pure NDRD; 10 % and mixed lesion; 30 %) was noted in 40 % of cases in presence of DR. In summary, patients with T 2 DM had higher incidence of NDRD. DR is less frequent (32. 3 %) in type 2 diabetes and is a poor predictor of type of nephropathy. Hence, renal biopsy is essential for precise diagnosis of nephropathy in patients with T 2 DM...|$|R

40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) -related {{anal cancer}} lesions are often found {{adjacent to the}} squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). We have assessed the histopathology and associated HPV genotypes in anal SCJ lesions in surgically excised anal warts in HIV-negative and âpositive patients. Methods: Histopathology identified 47 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) adjacent to the SCJ amongst a total of 145 cases of clinically diagnosed anal condylomata. The anal SCJ lesions were further analyzed with p 16, CK 7 and p 63 immunohistochemistry and HPV genotyping. Results: Sixteen (16 / 47) of the excised anal wart lesions contained HSIL; Three were HSIL and exclusively associated with oncogenic HPVs. A further thirteen (13 / 47) were <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> Of these eight were HSILs with LSIL and six were HSILs with papillary immature metaplasia (PIM); Ten of the <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> were associated {{with one or more}} oncogenic HPVs, while three cases were exclusively associated with HPV 6. Conclusions: Clinically diagnosed anal warts cannot be assumed to be limited to low-grade lesions as anal warts of the SCJ often show heterogeneous lesions, with coexistence of LSIL, PIM, and HSIL. Lesions showing PIM, however, may mimic HSIL, because they are hypercellular, but lack the nuclear atypia and conspicuous mitotic activity of HSIL; and are p 16 negative.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between staphylococci and Group A beta hemolytic streptococci in <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions</b> {{was investigated in}} an experimental impetigo model. A strain of staphylococcus of phage Type 71, which {{has been shown in}} vitro to produce a bacteriocin for streptococci and other Gram-positive organisms, eliminates or reduces Group A streptococci in <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> In contrast, staphylococcal strains of phage Types 75 and 81, which do not produce a demonstrable bacteriocin in vitro, exhibit no such effect. Some variation was noted in the in vivo response of two different streptococcal M Types to the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci. Bacterial antagonism is more pronounced when staphylococci and streptococci are injected simultaneously into animals than when staphylococci are superimposed on preexisting streptococcal lesions. Marked variations were found in the numbers of viable streptococci (colony-forming units) recovered from individual lesions containing identical mixtures of streptococci and phage Type 71 staphylococci. The frequency of a demonstrable bactericidal effect was related to the number of streptococci injected. With small inocula of streptococci, the tendency towards an all-or-none effect was particularly striking. No evidence of selection of streptococcal or staphylococcal mutants which might explain this phenomenon was obtained. These observations suggest that the bactericidal effect of phage Type 71 staphylococci on other Gram-positive organisms, previously demonstrated in vitro, appears to operate also in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of single fraction (SF) and multiple fraction (MF) radiation therapy (RT) on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with cancer and bone metastases in the proximal femur. We studied this effect in the radiation field and within metastatic lesions, and differentiated between lytic, blastic, and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions.</b> Methods and materials: This prospective cohort study comprised 42 patients with painful bone metastases, including 47 irradiated femora with 52 metastatic lesions in the proximal femur. Patients received either 8 Gy SF or 20 to 24 Gy in 5 to 6 fractions (MF). Quantitative computed tomography scans were obtained before RT and 4 and 10 weeks after the initial scan. Patients who received MF additionally underwent quantitative computed tomography on the final day of their treatment. Automated image registration was performed. Mean BMD was determined at each time point for each proximal femur (region of interest [ROI]-PF) and in greater detail for a region of interest that contained the metastatic lesion (ROI-ML). Statistical analysis was performed using linear <b>mixed</b> models. Results: <b>No</b> significant differences in mean BMD were found between SF or MF RT over all time points in both ROI-PF and ROI-ML. Mean BMD did not change in ROI-PF with lytic and <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions,</b> but mean BMD in ROI-PF with blastic lesions increased to 109 %. Comparably, when focused on ROI-ML, no differences in mean BMD were observed in lytic ROI-ML but mean BMD in mixed and blastic ROI-ML increased up to 105 % and 121 %, respectively. Conclusions: Ten weeks after palliative radiation therapy in patients with femoral metastatic lesions, a limited increase in BMD was seen with no beneficial effect of MF over SF RT.

In order to re-examine this issue, 25 uremic patients treated by intermittent hemodialysis underwent 99 m-Technetium Methylene Diphosphonate (99 mTc-MDP) bone scan. They were subdivided into three groups according to quantitative bone histology. Group 1 (N = 8) had pure dialysis osteomalacia, group 2 (N = 7) <b>mixed</b> <b>lesions,</b> and group 3 (N = 10) pure osteitis fibrosa. The scintigraphic studies were interpreted {{by means of a}} five point semiquantitative scale. Using this quantification, all but one group 1 patients had decreased bone tracer uptake, and all patients of group 3 had an increased uptake (chi square test of Yates, P < 0. 001). Among patients of group 2, bone uptake was decreased in the three patients with clearly reduced mineralization front and moderate osteitis fibrosa, but it was increased in all patients with severe osteitis fibrosa and subnormal mineralization front. A quantitative analysis of regional tracer uptake into bone was performed in two patients: one of group 2 and one of group 3. The results obtained clearly corroborated the semi-quantitative findings.
