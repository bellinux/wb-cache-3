5|$|After {{reaching}} its peak intensity, the hurricane turned north-northeastward, making landfall <b>near</b> <b>San</b> José, Sonora with winds of 90mph (145km/h). Paine rapidly dissipated over land, although the remnants continued northeastward across Mexico into Texas and the south-central United States. Moisture {{from the system}} combined with an advancing cold front, producing heavy rainfall over Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas.|$|E

5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball and landed on the shoulder again while going for a dig. He heard a strange sound.|$|E
5|$|Further {{strengthening}} {{was expected}} by forecasters, {{but did not}} come. The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00UTC on July20 <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Fernando in Tamaulipas. The storm had sustained winds of 125mph (200km/h), Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on July21.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} {{becoming}} a depression on September20, strong wind shear caused convection to diminish. However, data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass revealed that the system attained gale-force winds, resulting in the depression being upgraded to a tropical storm on 0000 UTC September21. Operationally, the first advisory on storm was not issued until 1200 UTC, where it was named Georgette. Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity increased {{near the center of}} the storm. Little change took place throughout the day as the storm approached Baja California Sur. Around 1800UTC, Georgette made landfall <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Jose del Cabo with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Additionally, a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg) was measured. Shortly before entering the Gulf of California, Georgette weakened to a tropical depression. Maintaining winds of 35mph (55km/h), the storm later made a second landfall <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Carlos in Sonora. Shortly after moving inland, the low-level circulation dissipated over the mountains of western Mexico.|$|E

5|$|In 1467, Catherine sailed {{towards the}} Italian Peninsula, {{possibly}} {{at the suggestion}} of the Veronese humanist Leonardo Montagna, who dedicated two poems to her. She took her own vessel and disembarked in Ancona. By 29 October 1467, the Queen was in Rome, already receiving a very generous pension from the Papal State. Upon arrival, she rented a house for herself and her entourage, consisting of Bosnian nobility who had followed her. On 1 October 1469, she moved to the rione of Pigna, into a house <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Marco Evangelista al Campidoglio. Pope Sixtus IV gave her considerable property adjacent to the Tiber.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, it was {{announced}} that Gaga had been allowed to shoot for a musical project at Hearst Castle, located <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Simeon, California. The shooting took place from February 11–13, at locations including the 84,000 square feet area of the Castle's main terrace, the Neptune Pool and the indoor Roman Pool. The cast from Bravo channel's reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (RHOBH) was also seen around the shoot. The news attracted media attention as {{it was the first time}} since 1960 that a video project was shot there, the last being for Stanley Kubrick's epic film Spartacus; the Deed of gift mandate by the Hearst Corporation prohibited any commercial filming at the location.|$|E

Swing's 11th Airborne Division at Nasugbu, Batangas {{two days}} later. Combining with Sixth Army, the Eighth Army enveloped Manila {{in a great}} pincer movement. Eichelberger assumed {{personal}} command of the operation, which involved an advance on Manila by the lightly equipped 11th Airborne Division. The audacious advance made rapid progress until it was halted by well-prepared positions {{on the outskirts of}} Manila. MacArthur awarded Eichelberger another Silver Star.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, dire wolf fossils {{have been}} {{reported}} in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Nevada. The identity of fossils reported farther north than California is not confirmed. There have been five reports of unconfirmed dire wolf fossils north of 42°Nlatitude at Fossil Lake, Oregon (125,000–10,000YBP), American Falls Reservoir, Idaho (125,000–75,000YBP), Salamander Cave, South Dakota (250,000YBP), and four closely grouped sites in northern Nebraska (250,000YBP). This suggests a range restriction on dire wolves due to temperature, prey, or habitat. The major fossil-producing sites for C.d.dirus are located east of the Rocky Mountains and include Friesenhahn Cave, <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Antonio, Texas; Carroll Cave, near Richland, Missouri; and Reddick, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{remained}} {{for a time}} with the Allied occupation forces in Germany, and was promoted to captain on 18 March 1919. He returned to the United States in June 1919. He was sent to Kelly Field, <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Antonio, Texas, and then to McAllen, Texas. As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron, he flew reconnaissance missions {{along the border with}} Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Poor aircraft maintenance, rough landing strips and bad weather led to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 Airco DH.4 aircraft in just one year.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{off the coast}} of Central America. It moved west-northwest, passing southwest of the Revillagigedo Islands. It then turned north and then north-eastward. For some time, it was a hurricane, and it lost that intensity on or just before September 25. The tropical storm made landfall <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Pedro, California early on September 25 with winds of severe gale strength. It dissipated later that day. The strongest reported wind was of Force 11, reported by a ship, making this system a minimal hurricane. The lowest pressure was reported by the same ship and was 28.67inHg (971mb).|$|E

5|$|Quickly after peaking, {{wind shear}} from the {{approaching}} trough weakened the hurricane, and by six hours after reaching peak intensity, the winds in Hurricane Kenna dropped to 150mph (240km/h) after the eye nearly dissipated. Despite a 27mbar {{increase in pressure}} in 12hours, convective activity increased prior to Kenna making landfall. On October 25 Hurricane Kenna struck <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Blas {{in the state of}} Nayarit with estimated winds of 140mph (225km/h). The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico, and the circulation dissipated on October 26 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. The remnants continued northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Samuel G. Hardaway, a {{survivor}} of Major William Ward's group who had escaped the Battle of Refugio and re-joined Fannin at the Battle of Coleto, also managed to escape the Goliad massacre. As he fled Goliad, he was eventually joined by three other survivors, Joseph Andrews, James P. Trezevant and M. K. Moses. Spies for the Texian army discovered the four men and took them to Baker's camp <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Felipe de Austin on April 2. Several other survivors of the Goliad massacre were found on April 10 by Texian spies. Survivors Daniel Murphy, Thomas Kemp, Charles Shain, David Jones, William Brenan and Nat Hazen were taken to Houston at Groce's Landing where they enlisted to fight with Houston's army.|$|E
5|$|Telegraph reports {{indicate}} that a tropical depression developed in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October24. The depression moved northwestward without differentiating in intensity before making landfall <b>near</b> <b>San</b> Cristóbal, Dominican Republic with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It did not weaken while crossing Hispaniola and instead strengthened into a tropical storm shortly after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the northwestern tip of Haiti. Late on October27, the storm re-curved north-northeastward and pass through the eastern Bahamas. Around that time, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h).|$|E
