2500|$|The Caproni {{was a heavy}} {{aircraft}} and needed a sturdy undercarriage. On each side it {{had a pair of}} mainwheels with [...] diameter tyres on axles joined to a strong frame via short oleo struts. [...] The frame, enclosed with the wheels under fairings, was mounted from the wings under the outer engine by a faired <b>N-strut,</b> of which the forward member was the chief leg. Another pair of struts, almost horizontal, joined the undercarriage frame to the lower fuselage. At the rear the [...] diameter tailwheel was also oleo sprung and damped; it castored through ±90°.|$|E
2500|$|The little {{flying boat}} had a {{conventional}} stepped hull and was stabilized {{on the water}} {{by a pair of}} floats, attached under the [...] outboard engines and retracting into their cowlings. Its enclosed, tandem seat cockpit was shaped to reproduced the form of the 161's nose, though the full sized aircraft had proportionally shorter glazing. [...] The 161 had a twin fin empennage with a <b>N-strut</b> braced, parallel chord tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage on a short pillar with marked dihedral. [...] The fins were of the endplate type, with curved leading edges and roughly symmetric above and below the tailplane; on each, the rudder was split into an upper and lower part. All of these features appeared on the final, full size airliner.|$|E
50|$|The wing {{structure}} {{was formed by}} three built-up girder spars of triangular section with aluminium wing ribs spaced fairly wide apart; the wing fabric was sewn to special eyelets, which were attached to the framework at evenly spaced intervals. The lower wings were attached directly to the fuselage, touching the water when afloat, improving water-borne stability. The low aspect ratio upper wing {{was supported by a}} central frame work and N strut assemblies at 1/3rd span and 2/3rd span. Incidence of the upper wing was adjustable by altering the length of the forward <b>N-strut</b> tubes.|$|E

50|$|The Caproni {{was a heavy}} {{aircraft}} and needed a sturdy undercarriage. On each side it {{had a pair of}} mainwheels with 1350 mm diameter tyres on axles joined to a strong frame via short oleo struts. The frame, enclosed with the wheels under fairings, was mounted from the wings under the outer engine by a faired <b>N-strut,</b> of which the forward member was the chief leg. Another pair of struts, almost horizontal, joined the undercarriage frame to the lower fuselage. At the rear the 480 mm diameter tailwheel was also oleo sprung and damped; it castored through ±90°.|$|E
50|$|The same sloping {{rear member}} of the <b>N-strut</b> was used to join the nacelle to the open rear fuselage. Two pairs of V-shaped steel tube struts were {{attached}} to it at the wing trailing edge and at its foot; the first was horizontal, the other upward sloping, and their rear meeting points were used to support the fabric covered empennage. These points were also wire braced from the wing underside. The tailplane, fitted {{between the end of}} the horizontal V, had straight edges and constant chord, with rectangular elevators. There was a central triangular fin and rectangular rudder, both extending above and below the tailplane; the rudder worked in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E

50|$|Dr.I:The Dr.I was a triplane {{using the}} fuselage, empennage, engine and {{undercarriage}} (apart from a slightly repositioned tailskid) of the D.III. The new wings had a smaller span (6.50 m) but had single bays and <b>N-struts</b> as before. The centre wing {{was attached to}} the upper fuselage and the upper one supported over the cockpit on a <b>N-strutted</b> cabane. Unusually, though there was stagger between the lower pair of wings, there was none between the upper two. The Dr.I took part in the second D competition, held from 27 May to 28 June 1918.|$|R
50|$|The Avia BH-20 was a civil trainer {{aircraft}} {{built in}} Czechoslovakia in 1924. It was a single-bay, unstaggered biplane of conventional configuration. The wings were braced with <b>N-struts</b> at around half-span. The pilot and instructor were seated in tandem, open cockpits.|$|R
50|$|The types {{shared a}} common {{structure}} of a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings braced by <b>N-struts.</b> The fuselage was of fabric-covered steel tube and included two open cockpits in tandem, the forward of which could carry two passengers side-by-side.|$|R
50|$|The Hitachi T.2 was {{a trainer}} {{aircraft}} built in Japan {{in the early}} 1940s. It was a conventional, single-bay sesquiplane with wings braced by <b>N-struts.</b> The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open cockpits, and the undercarriage was of fixed, tailskid type.|$|R
50|$|The Swallow OX-5, {{designed}} by Waverly Stearman, {{was introduced in}} 1927 {{and was the first}} Swallow to be built under an official ATC.

50|$|It was a {{conventional}} flying boat with a duralumin hull and sesquiplane wings braced with <b>N-struts.</b> The tractor configuration engine was {{mounted on the}} leading edge of the upper wing driving a four bladed propeller. Open cockpits were provided for the crew under the upper wing and in a dorsal position amidships.|$|R
5000|$|The PA-1 was {{the first}} air-cooled, radial {{engine-powered}} aircraft. It was a single-seat biplane with <b>N-struts,</b> an all-wood fuselage, and wings with fabric coverings. The USAAS ordered two prototypes. The first one first flew in March 1922. It did not deliver the desired speed, so {{the construction of the}} second prototype was cancelled.|$|R
50|$|The SET XV was {{a fighter}} {{aircraft}} developed in Romania in the mid-1930s. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span braced by <b>N-struts.</b> It was fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage with spatted mainwheels.

5000|$|The S.63 was {{powered by}} a {{push-pull}} pair of [...] water-cooled Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 V-12 engines. These were mounted high above the wing centre on inward-leaning pairs of <b>N-struts</b> {{and a pair of}} central transverse V-struts, canted strongly upwards and uncowled to reduce fire risk. They shared a single, forward-mounted honeycomb radiator and an oil tank positioned between them.|$|R
50|$|The Rose Parrakeet was a single-seat {{sporting}} biplane {{produced in}} small {{numbers in the}} United States during the 1930s. It was a conventional design with staggered single-bay wings of equal span braced by <b>N-struts.</b> The cockpit was open, and the fixed tailskid undercarriage had divided main units. An unusual feature {{was the use of}} a single strut in place of the usual flying wires.|$|R
50|$|The SET 10 (unrelated to the SET X {{design of}} the same year) was a trainer {{aircraft}} produced in Romania in prototype form in the early 1930s. It was a conventional, single-bay biplane with staggered wings braced with <b>N-struts.</b> It was equipped with fixed tailskid undercarriage, and seated the pilot and instructor in tandem, open cockpits. Intended for Romania's aeroclubs and Air Force, no production ensued.|$|R
50|$|It is a single-seat biplane of {{conventional}} configuration, with staggered, single-bay equal-span wings braced with <b>N-struts.</b> The undercarriage is of fixed tailwheel type. The fuselage is fabric-covered welded steel tube, and the wings fabric-covered wood. Plans for the biplane remained available until 1972, {{by which time}} some 7,000 sets had been sold. The prototype is now preserved at the EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|Its {{undercarriage}} {{was fixed}} and conventional with {{two pairs of}} mainwheels set 3.90 m apart under the engines. They were mounted on vertical V-form struts from the inner sides of the engine mountings and oblique, almost horizontal <b>N-struts</b> {{from the bottom of}} the fuselage. The latter were connected to a horizontal box containing the integrated oleo type shock absorbers. Its tailskid had an oil filled shock absorber.|$|R
5000|$|The MSrE M-21 Harag (Hungarian: [...] "Fury") was an {{aerobatics}} aircraft {{built in}} Hungary in 1936, sometimes {{known as the}} Szegedy M-21 after one of its designers, József Szegedy. It was a conventional biplane design with single-bay staggered wings of equal span braced by <b>N-struts.</b> The pilot sat in an open cockpit, and the tailwheel undercarriage featured divided main units. Only a single example was built.|$|R
50|$|The CW-12 and CW-16 {{shared the}} same basic design as {{conventional}} single-bay biplanes with staggered wings braced with <b>N-struts.</b> The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open cockpits, the forward cockpit of the CW-12 having a single seat, while the CW-16's forward cockpit could seat two passengers side-by-side. Both versions of the aircraft were available {{in a variety of}} engine choices, and some CW-16s were exported as trainers to the air forces of Bolivia and Ecuador.|$|R
50|$|The Wichawk is a {{conventional}} design with staggered single-bay wings of equal span braced with <b>N-struts</b> and having fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The pilot {{and a single}} passenger sit in side-by-side configuration in an open cockpit, but the plans make allowances for the aircraft {{to be built in}} two- or three-seat tandem configuration instead. The fuselage and empennage are of welded steel tube construction, with the wings built with wooden spars and aluminium alloy ribs, all covered in doped aircraft fabric.|$|R
50|$|The Grahame-White Type XIII was {{a racing}} {{seaplane}} built {{to compete in}} the Daily Mails 1914 Circuit of Britain air race, to be flown by company founder Claude Grahame-White. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of equal span braced by <b>N-struts.</b> The forward fuselage featured a highly streamlined aluminium engine cowling, {{with the rest of the}} construction being wood and fabric. The landing gear consisted of twin pontoons, with a small third pontoon carried beneath the tail.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{mounting}} was unusual, with airfoil section, N-form struts on {{each side}} connecting the wing spars not to the lower fuselage but instead to the frames that carried the independently rubber sprung undercarriage mainwheels. These frames, enclosed in streamlined fairings 2.50 m apart, were also braced the upper fuselage longerons with shorter <b>N-struts</b> and with inverted V-struts to the central fuselage underside. Short, inverted V-struts attached the wing centre section to the upper fuselage. There were no wing bracing wires.|$|R
5000|$|Because cabane struts often carry {{engine thrust}} {{to the upper}} wing to {{overcome}} its drag, the loads along each diagonal between fore and aft struts are unequal and they are often formed as <b>N-struts.</b> They may also have cross-braced torsion wires to help stop the wing twisting. A few biplane designs, like the British 1917 Bristol Fighter two-seat fighter/escort, had its fuselage clear of the lower wing {{as well as the}} upper one, using ventral cabane struts to accomplish such a design feature.|$|R
2500|$|The Miniplane is a {{conventional}} single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span braced with <b>N-struts</b> and wires. The Miniplane design has fixed undercarriage with a steerable tailwheel and although designed {{with an open}} cockpit, many have been fitted with canopies. The fuselage and [...] the tail fin are of {{a conventional}} truss design constructed of welded steel tube and covered in fabric, and the wing spars and ribs are made from spruce and also fabric-covered. A variant has been built with an all-metal wing construction.|$|R
50|$|Imperial German Navy {{seaplanes}} numbers 1105 to 1106 {{were the}} only two examples of a unique design produced for the navy's flying service during the First World War. They were unarmed biplanes of conventional configuration with staggered wings of unequal span. The empennage included a sizable ventral fin. Intended as training aircraft, the pilot and instructor sat in tandem, open cockpits. The undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The interplane strut arrangement was remarkable for its day, consisting of <b>N-struts</b> and V-struts without any rigging wires.|$|R

50|$|The Ikarus IO (Serbian Cyrillic:Икарус ИО - Извиђач Обални) was a biplane {{flying boat}} {{produced}} in Yugoslavia {{in the late}} 1920s. It was a conventional flying boat design for its day, featuring a large single-bay wing cellule, the staggered wings of slightly uneven span braced with <b>N-struts.</b> The pilot and observer {{sat side by side}} in an open cockpit, and a gunner sat in an open position ahead of them, in the bow. The pusher engine and frontal radiator were carried on struts in the inter-plane gap.|$|R
40|$|Given a lattice Λ ⊂ R n, a {{cylinder}} anchored at two lattice points {{is called a}} strut (or Λ-strut to be precise) if its interior does not contain a lattice point. We are interested in determining the maximum radius for a strut of given length. Optimal Z <b>n-struts</b> are constructed for n = 3, 4. We also derive, through a non-constructive but elementary argument, an achievable upper bound on the product lɛ n− 1 where l and ɛ are the length and radius of the strut, respectively...|$|R
50|$|The Fokker C.VII-W was a {{reconnaissance}} seaplane {{built in}} the Netherlands in the late 1920s. Sharing elements of the highly successful C.V design, the C.VII-W was a conventional, single-bay biplane with wings of unequal span braced with <b>N-struts.</b> The undercarriage consisted of a standard twin-pontoon arrangement, and the fin and rudder continued through to the ventral side of the fuselage, creating a cruciform tail. The pilot and observer sat in tandem, open cockpits. The wing structure was wooden with fabric and plywood covering, and the fuselage was of steel tube construction with fabric covering.|$|R
50|$|The Fokker C.XI-W was a {{reconnaissance}} seaplane {{designed to}} operate from warships that {{was produced in}} the Netherlands in the mid-1930s. It {{was the result of}} a Royal Netherlands Navy specification of 1935 requesting such an aircraft. Fokker's response was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span braced by <b>N-struts.</b> The pilot and observer sat in tandem, open cockpits, and the undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The wings were of wooden construction with plywood and fabric covering, and the fuselage was of steel tube, also covered with fabric.|$|R
