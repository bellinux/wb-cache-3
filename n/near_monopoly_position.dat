40|$|Gum arabic {{is mainly}} {{produced}} from two Acacias {{that are found}} in the gum belt of Sub-Saharan Africa. These are Acacia senegal that produces high quality gum and Acacia seyal that produces low quality gum. In recent years the gum market structure has changed and Sudan lost its <b>near</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>position</b> as Chad and Nigeria became important gum suppliers. In order to understand the competition between Sudan, Chad and Nigeria in the export of high and low quality gum arabic we develop a von Stackelberg model with interdependent markets. Whereas Sudan (the leader) has an absolute cost advantage in the export of high quality gum, Chad and Nigeria (the followers) have a cost advantage in the export of low quality gum. We determine the market equilibrium outcomes and study the impact of development assistance scenarios to promote either the high or low quality gum. Our results suggest that the leader is better off promoting the quality for which it has cost advantage, i. e. the high quality gum. This also leads to a lower reduction in the competitors’ profit than promoting low quality gum. Similarly, when followers promote the quality for which they have cost advantage, i. e. the low quality gum, this results in a lower reduction in the leader's profit than when they promote high quality gum. The best strategy of the followers is, however, sensitive with respect to the elasticities of demand...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three essays {{that combine}} applied models, institutional analysis and empirical work {{in order to}} understand developments in the Russian and Caspian energy sector following the breakup of the former Soviet Union. In the first essay entitled "Partial Privatization: Evidence from the Russian Oil Sector" (joint with Daniel Berkowitz), we document that Russia's oil sector privatization has been partial because the federal government has maintained ownership rights in several vertically integrated companies and has established a <b>near</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>position</b> in the allocation of scarce export transport capacity. We develop the proposition that in these circumstances the federal government would tend to give companies in which it has ownership positions preferential access to world export markets. We develop a classification system of company ownership that distinguishes between state-influence and state-independent companies. Using censored-regression techniques, we find compelling evidence that the state-influence companies had privileged access to export transport by 2003, and argue that this suggests that there are substantial efficiency losses in the Russian oil sector. The second essay, "Caspian Oil Boom: Informational Herding among the Oil Companies", analyzes the potential causes of the Caspian oil rush of 1997 - 1998. It provides an institutional description of foreign investment in the Caspian region in 1997 - 1998, and looks at different possible explanations for the investment boom. We argue that informational herding among oil companies could have contributed to the high investment activity in the region in the late 1990 s, and qualitatively check for the power of the herding against the alternative explanations. In the third essay, "Quality of Information, Information Externalities and Sequential Decisions of Oil Companies," we develop a theoretical model that works out the logic and mechanics of the informational herding explanation for the Caspian oil boom. We show that under certain conditions a second company to enter will invest {{in the development of a}} new oil field even if it received a bad informative signal about the profitability of the project. We also show that when companies receive noisy public and private information, the second company may be more likely to invest after receiving a bad signal...|$|E
40|$|The {{railways}} {{of tropical}} Africa have undergone drastic {{changes in the}} past two decades. On the one hand, some major extensions and improvements have been made, of which the most significant is TAZARA, linking Zambia with Dar es Salaam. On the other hand, the <b>near</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>position</b> has been shattered by the development of road transport, which has deflected substantial traffic that would otherwise have gone by rail, particularly high-value commodities. At the same time with emphasis on road building, the rail systems, except in Central Africa, have been neglected to varying degrees by governments, with a resulting inability even to carry all the traffic that is available, and there has been considerable deterioration in performance. Finally in some areas, political changes have either reduced traffic or resulted in major realignments of traffic patterns. A major consequence has been loss of profits and growing deficits. Despite the overall deterioration, however, the railroads in most tropical African countries continue to {{play a significant role in}} the transport picture and it is generally agreed that rail costs are lower than road transport costs where volume of traffic is substantial. The volume on the major routes is sufficiently great so that the lines are almost certainly economically justifiable, but some of the branch lines are questionable. In Central Africa, although the systems have been seriously affected by political events, much greater stress has been placed on the role of the railways than in either East or West Commonwealth Africa. There is also some evidence of a shift in government policy in other areas toward renewed emphasis on rail transport. All of the governments face a basic dilemma, however: if rail costs are to be kept low, volume must be maintained - yet for some traffic road transport offers real advantages. Earlier attempts to protect the railroads by drastic road transport licensing rules have largely been abandoned. A distinction must be made between the traffic for which road transport offers such great advantage that it is uneconomic to keep it on rail, and the substantial amount which can move by either mode with only marginal advantages or disadvantages. It is difficult for the more free-enterprise-oriented economies to control the mode of transportation used; countries such as Tanzania and Zambia are in a much better position to ensure the allocation of traffic along optimal lines...|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{peace was}} {{subsequently}} restored after the Protestant British occupation. In the time after this, the Catholic religious orders (with {{the exception of}} the Jesuits who were temporarily suppressed by the Spaniards due to their role in anti-imperialist movements in Latin America) became the powerful driving force in the Archdiocese of Manila. The local diocesan clergy resented the foreign religious orders due to their <b>near</b> <b>monopoly</b> of ecclesiastical <b>positions.</b> The opposition of the religious orders against an autonomous diocesan clergy independent of them lead to the martyrdom of priests Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, Jacinto Zamora collectively known as Gomburza. This inspired the Jesuit educated Jose Rizal to form the La Liga Filipina, to ask for reforms from Spain and recognition of local clergy.|$|R

The {{gum arabic}} belt in Sudan {{offered in the}} past {{an example of how}} {{environmental}} conservation and economic development could be achieved simultaneously as it generates a number of private and social benefits to gum producers and the country as a whole. The most important benefits from the gum based system are income from the gum harvest to the poor farmers and combating large scale desertification in the Sudan-Sahel zone. Over the last few decades, however, the gum belt suffered from increased degradation, gum production decreased and Sudan lost its <b>near</b> <b>monopoly</b> <b>position</b> in the gum export market. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain a better understanding of the factors underlying the deforestation of the gum belt and the decline in gum production in Sudan during recent years. Two important gum arabic producing acacias are found in the gum belt: Acacia senegal that produces high quality gum and Acacia seyal that produces low quality gum. The analysis in this study focuses mainly on Acacia senegal and Acacia senegal -based agroforestry system in Kordofan region - a major gum production area in Sudan. Various methodological approaches including theoretical and empirical analysis are employed in the study. A micro econometrics technique is used to identify the effect of socio-economic factors assumed to influence the disadoption of gum production. The study merges the real options approach with agroforestry to analyze farmers' investment decision in the choice between three different land use systems (gum agroforestry, gum forestry and agriculture). Moreover a theoretical scheme of Stackelberg model (non-cooperative oligopoly model) is deployed to analyze the competition in the gum export market for high and low quality gum between the (leader) Sudan and the followers (Chad and Nigeria). It attempts to investigate the effects of market interventions-such as international subsidies on gum market equilibrium and leader's (Sudan 's) long run performance of profits from the gum export. The micro-econometric approach used to analyze the determinants of farmers' disadoption of gum production shows that factors which affect the opportunity cost of labor and income from annual crops tend to influence the observed variation in the behavior of adoption practices in gum production. Income from annual crops has a positive effect on continuous adoption of gum agroforestry. This specific result suggests that gum arabic and other agricultural crops (except groundnut because of overlap in harvest time) do not compete but rather complement one another in the household farming economy. Policy measures that aim to improve agricultural production in the region will induce farmers to settle in their village and reduce the seasonal labor migration trend which in turn will increase the availability of labor for gum production. The theoretical framework developed using a real options approach aimed to analyze the economic incentives for entry (planting gum tree) and exit (abandoning gum forest) in the gum arabic agroforestry. Monte Carlo simulation shows that higher economic benefit is observed from agricultural production than the gum production. Results also suggest that an increase of about nine to ten times on the average opportunity costs of labor is necessary in order for farmers to further abandon gum arabic production and neglect the gum forest. As for the expansion (plantation) of gum forest we analyzed two options: converting idle land into gum forest and converting agricultural land into gum forest. Results show that the incremental average annual benefits of gum agroforestry or forestry systems are above the critical values for converting idle land to a gum arabic forest. This suggests that farmer's could expand gum forest. However, this is not observed, and we suggest two interpretations to explain the observed non-expansion of gum forest into idle lands: scarcity of labor and insecure property rights caused by political instability in the country which discourage long-term investments. Furthermore, the current incremental average annual benefits for converting agricultural land to gum arabic agroforestry (forestry) system are found to be below the calculated threshold values needed for the investment. Results suggest that an increase in the prices of gum arabic respectively of about 315 per cent and 775 percent is needed to induce a shift in land use system from continuous agricultural production to gum agroforestry or forestry land use systems respectively. The analysis of the competition in the gum export market between the three major gum exporters attempts to assess the best strategy for Sudan to pursue in light of the recent changes in the gum market structure and the proposed donor policies of subsidizing gum production in Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis is based on von Stackelberg model and investigates the effect of different subsidy scenarios. Our result shows that the proportionate increase in Sudan 's profit is higher when the leader (Sudan) uses a subsidy to promote high quality gum than when it uses the subsidy to promote the low quality gum. In the case of followers (Chad, Nigeria), however, the decision on which quality to promote appears to be sensitive to the levels of own and cross price elasticities. Moreover, the results suggest that it is in the advantage of Sudan, Chad and Nigeria to adopt an export coordination strategy with some side payments to be made by Sudan as compensation for Chad's and Nigeria's lost profits in case they agree to curtail their export of high quality gum...|$|E
