5|$|The Netherlands were {{partially}} metricated {{when they}} were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French système usuel. (The reform was <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.|$|E

5|$|This {{plan was}} <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> in the reconstruction. Although half-timbered houses were banned at first, the ban was lifted in 1731 as brick houses were {{considerably}} more expensive.

5|$|Susannah Maidment {{and colleagues}} in 2008 {{proposed}} extensive alterations to the taxonomy of Stegosaurus. They advocated synonymizing S.stenops and S.ungulatus with S.armatus, and sinking Hesperosaurus and Wuerhosaurus into Stegosaurus, with their type species becoming Stegosaurus mjosi and Stegosaurus homheni, respectively. They regarded S.longispinus as dubious. Thus, their conception of Stegosaurus would include three valid species (S.armatus, S.homheni, and S.mjosi) and would {{range from the}} Late Jurassic of North America and Europe to the Early Cretaceous of Asia. However, this classification scheme was <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> by other researchers, and a 2017 cladistic analysis co-authored by Maidment with Thomas Raven rejects the synonymy of Hesperosaurus with Stegosaurus. In 2015, Maidment et al. revised their suggestion due to the recognition by Galton of S. armatus as a nomen dubium and its replacement by S. stenops as type species.|$|E
5|$|The {{appeal was}} heard and {{dismissed}} the following day, Thursday, 12 March 2015. As {{part of its}} legal argument, aside from raising safety concerns, Sauber also submitted that van der Garde's contract had been terminated by the team in February {{with the approval of}} the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)'s Contract Recognition Board in any event, and that van der Garde violated confidentiality clauses of the contract by discussing it with the media. Lawyers representing Ericsson and Nasr further argued that van der Garde had <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> due process by failing to give their clients prior notice of his legal action. The court upheld the previous orders to permit van der Garde to participate in the race and adjourned the hearing to the following day, Friday, 13 March 2015, to hear arguments on contempt of court proceedings launched by van der Garde's legal team against Sauber's team principal, Monisha Kaltenborn.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are <b>not</b> <b>followed,</b> the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Challenge era come from the method of play of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada prior to 1893. From 1887 to 1893, the league did not play a {{round-robin}} format, but rather challenges between teams of the association that year, with {{the winner of the}} series being the 'interim' champion, with the final challenge winner becoming the league champion for the year. The Stanley Cup kept the tradition going, but added league championships as another way that a team could win the trophy. If a team in the same league as the current champion won the league championship, it would then inherit the Cup, without a challenge. The only time this rule was <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> was in 1904, when the Ottawa Senators club withdrew from its league, the CAHL. The trustees ruled that the Cup stayed with Ottawa, instead of the CAHL league champion.|$|E

5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September, {{the general}} {{staff of the}} JNA reduced the {{objectives}} of the campaign because it had <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> the initial plan and had become bogged down. The reduced objectives called for offensive and defensive actions, the inflicting of decisive defeats on Croatian forces in Dalmatia and eastern Slavonia, and strikes against vital infrastructure in Croatia, to obtain an agreement on the evacuation of besieged JNA facilities. While some units on the ground started to implement the new orders the same day, they did not take effect completely before 4 October. On 3 October, Serbian and Montenegrin representatives in the Yugoslav Presidency declared that they alone had become the acting federal presidency and assumed control of the JNA. Two days later, the JNA requested that the presidency authorize a general mobilization of forces needed for the campaign, but this was refused by Milošević. By 9 October, the JNA effort was considered a failure. Its commanders formally accepted the role forced on the JNA by Milošević and limited its strategic objectives in Croatia to the protection of Serb-populated areas.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other authors}} {{suggested}} similar taxonomic rearrangements {{around the same}} time. In 1979, Herbert Thomas and Surinder Verma agreed that Indraloris and Sivaladapis were adapids, but placed them in a subfamily of their own, Sivaladapinae. Also in 1979, Frederick Szalay and Eric Delson placed Indraloris in its own tribe, Indralorisini, within Adapidae. In 1980, Indian paleontologists S.R.K. Chopra and R.N. Vasishat placed both of Pilgrim's Sivanasua species in Indraloris and argued that Indraloris lulli, Sivanasua himalayensis and Sivanasua nagrii all represented the same species—Indraloris himalayensis. They listed Sivanasua palaeindica as a second Indraloris species, I.palaeindica, and continued to regard Indraloris as a lorisid. Gingerich and Sahni published in more detail on Sivaladapis in 1984. They then placed the two genera in a separate subfamily of Adapidae, called Sivaladapinae because that name was published two months before Indralorisini. In 1985, Vasishat continued to classify Indraloris and Sivaladapis in a single genus, and Indraloris himalayensis and Sivaladapis nagrii in a single species, but other authors have <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> this classification.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, {{officials}} in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for {{the western end of}} Galveston Island, as the area was not protected by the Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in Surfside in Brazoria County. When the National Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana. After the storm made landfall, flash flood watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas. During the flood event, the National Weather Service in Houston issued 99 flash flood warnings with an average lead time of 40minutes. With an average lead time of 24minutes, the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana issued 47flash flood warnings.

5|$|The Ba'ath Party faced a major dilemma: take {{power through}} {{competitive}} elections or through forceful takeover. Even the liberal and democratic-inclined founding leaders were partial to forceful takeover, citing the corrupt electoral process. Before taking power, the Ba'ath Party gambled {{that it would}} be allowed to share power with Gamal Abdel Nasser in the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR would prove to be Egypt-dominated, and the Ba'ath Party was forced to dissolve itself, but in 1961 the UAR collapsed because of a military coup in Syria. The establishment and the dissolution of the UAR was a catastrophe for the Ba'ath Party as it divided among those who supported the UAR, those who opposed it and those who opposed or supported the traditional leaders of the party. In 1962, Aflaq convened a Ba'ath Party congress and re-established the party. Several branches had <b>not</b> <b>followed</b> orders and had not dissolved during the UAR years. Instead they had become deeply hostile to pan-Arabist thought and had become radical socialists instead. The military committee, which would launch the 8 March Revolution, shared most of their views.|$|E
