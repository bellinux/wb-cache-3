25|$|A <b>noria</b> (Arabic: ناعورة, nā‘ūra) {{performs}} {{the function of}} moving water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation. In this it {{is similar to the}} saqiya and other pumps like the Persian wheel (Rahat in Urdu), but those are generally powered by other means or a combination, usually lifting water from a pond or well. <b>Noria</b> is similar to the modern hydraulic ram, which also uses the power of flowing water to pump some of the water out of the river.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} norias in Hama suggests they were {{developed during the}} Byzantine era, although none of the norias in Hama today precede the Ayyubid period.

The surviving norias {{date back to the}} medieval Islamic period, when norias as large as 20 meters in diameter were built, with 120 water collection compartments and capable of raising more than 95 litres of water per minute. Now only 17 norias remain, unused.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} canals and trajineras, {{the best known}} {{attraction}} in Xochimilco is the Dolores Olmedo Museum. This museum was once the home of socialite Dolores Olmedo. Before this, it was the main house of the La <b>Noria</b> Hacienda, established in the 17th century. Before she died, Ms. Olmedo decided to donate her house, much of {{what was in it}} and her art collection to the public as a museum. The buildings are surrounded by gardens planted with native Mexican species, around which wander peacocks. Another area houses a number of xoloitzcuintle dog. The museum’s collection includes about 600 pre Hispanic pieces, the largest collection of works by Diego Rivera at 140 pieces, {{as well as a number}} of works by Frida Kahlo and Angelina Beloff. It also contains rooms filled with furniture, items from many parts of the world and everyday items used by Olmedo and her family. In November, the museum set up a monumental altar to the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} neighborhoods/communities include Xaltocan, Ejidos de Tepepan, La <b>Noria,</b> Las Cruces, Ejidos de Xochimilco and San Gregorio Atlapulco. San Francisco Caltongo {{is one of}} the oldest neighborhoods of the borough. Xaltocán began as a ranch or hacienda that belonged to the {{indigenous}} caciques. It was later donated to the San Bernardino de Siena monastery. After the monastery was secularized, it became hacienda land again, but over time, parts were sold and it became the current area of Xochimilco. The church for this community was built in 1751 as the hacienda chapel. Originally, it was dedicated to Jesus, then Candlemas and finally the Virgin of the Sorrows (Virgen de los Dolores). It officially became a sanctuary in 1951, declared by the archbishop of Mexico. In 1964, Xaltocán became a parish and in 1976, this church became the official parish church. The main celebration of the church is to an image of the Virgin Mary, which is said to have miraculously appeared in the pen of a turkey kept by an old woman.|$|E

500|$|From the 8th century, {{the medieval}} Islamic world {{underwent}} a transformation in agricultural practice, {{described by the}} historian Andrew Watson as the Arab Agricultural Revolution. This transformation was driven {{by a number of}} factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along Muslim trade routes, the spread of more advanced farming techniques, and an agricultural-economic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency. The shift in agricultural practice changed the economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production, population levels, urban growth, the distribution of the labour force, cooking, diet, and clothing across the Islamic world. Muslim traders covered much of the Old World, and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops, plants and farming techniques across the region, as well as the adaptation of crops, plants and techniques from beyond the Islamic world. This diffusion introduced major crops to Europe by way of Al-Andalus, along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine. Sugar cane, rice, and cotton were among the major crops transferred, along with citrus and other fruit trees, nut trees, vegetables such as aubergine, spinach and chard, and the use of [...] spices such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg and cinnamon. Intensive irrigation, crop rotation, and agricultural manuals were widely adopted. Irrigation, partly based on Roman technology, made use of <b>noria</b> water wheels, water mills, dams and reservoirs.|$|E

The reserves were Loveness Musoni, Leya Bowa and Abba Lungu. The 2006 Confederation of Southern African Football Associations women's tournament {{was held in}} Lusaka. They were in Group A. On 22 August, they tied Namibia 2–2 with <b>Noria</b> Sosala scoring in the 15th minute and Charity Mpongo scoring in the 30th minute [...] for Zambia. They beat Swaziland 7–0 on 24 August, with Charity Mpongo scoring in the 23rd, 43rd, 64th and 67th minutes, Susan Banda scoring in the 37th minute, Gift Lishika scoring in the 41st minute, and Martha Kapombo scoring in the 56th minute for Zambia.

2500|$|The {{production}} of sugar from sugar cane, water clocks, pulp and paper, silk, and various advances in making perfume, were {{transferred from the}} Islamic world to medieval Europe. Fulling mills and advances in mill technology may have also been transmitted from the Islamic world to medieval Europe, along with the large-scale use of inventions like the suction pump, <b>noria</b> and chain pumps for irrigation purposes. According to Watson, [...] "The Islamic contribution was less in the invention of new devices than in the application on a much wider scale of devices which in pre-Islamic times had been used only over limited areas and to a limited extent." [...] These innovations {{made it possible for}} some industrial operations that were previously served by manual labour or draught animals to be driven by machinery in medieval Europe.|$|E

2500|$|As a Liberal {{military}} hero, Díaz had ambitions {{for national}} political power. He challenged the civilian president Benito Juárez, {{who was running}} for what Díaz considered an illegal subsequent term as president. In 1870, Díaz ran against President Juárez and Vice President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. In 1871, he made claims of fraud in the July elections won by Juárez, who was confirmed as president by the Congress in October. In response, Díaz launched the Plan de la <b>Noria</b> on 8 November 1871, supported {{by a number of}} rebellions across the nation, including one by Manuel González of Tamaulipas, but this rebellion failed. Following the death of Juárez of natural causes in 1872, Lerdo became president. Lerdo offered amnesty to rebels, which Díaz accepted and took up residency in Veracruz. In 1874, Díaz served in the legislature, representing Veracruz. Opposition to the presidency of Lerdo grew, particularly as anti-clericalism increased, labor unrest grew, and a major rebellion of the Yaqui in northwest Mexico under the leadership of Cajeme challenged central government rule there. [...] Díaz saw an opportunity to plot a more successful rebellion, leaving Mexico in 1875 for New Orleans and Brownsville, Texas with his political ally Manuel González.|$|E
