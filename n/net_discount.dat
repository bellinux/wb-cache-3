As suggested by the literature, the use of the historical average of the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate in the calculation of the present value of lost future earnings is valid if the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate follows a mean reverting, stationary process. However, if the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate follows a mean averting, non-stationary process forensic economists should perhaps use the current value of the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate in such calculations. A majority of the studies surveyed indicate that the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate experienced a structural break in the late 1970 s-early 1980 s. In general, if the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate is stationary {{as a result of a}} structural break, forensic economists should use the average <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate over the post-break period. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new {{alternative to the}} ongoing debate about stationarity and mean reversion of the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio. Modeling the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio as a fractionally integrated ("I"("d")) process, we apply recently developed frequency domain estimation procedures and find evidence that the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio is an "I"("d") process with 1 / 2 ≤"d" > 1. Although nonstationary, such series behave like stationary processes in one interesting respect; they are mean-reverting. We present results from a simulation experiment suggesting that the finding of a nonstationary, but mean-reverting <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio generally supports the validity of current practice in estimating economic damages in personal injury litigation. Moreover, if recognized and accounted for, the presence of long memory in the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> ratio even offers the potential to significantly improve forecasts of {{the present value of}} future earnings.

30|$|A badly {{understood}} {{feature of}} policy reforms reducing the tax deductibility of mortgage interest {{is that these}} reforms imply a transfer of wealth from current to future generations. Even a balanced budget reform, which ploughs back all extra tax revenues from lower interest deductibility by lower tax rates, still leads to a wealth transfer. Current house prices reflect the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> value of the entitlement to future deductibility. For future generations, the system is a wash. They pay higher house prices {{in exchange for the}} entitlement to tax deductibility. Likewise, the abolishment of the system is a wash: the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> value of lower deductibility cancels against higher house prices. Hence, the current generation bears the full loss of the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> value of deductibility. Offsetting this intergenerational transfer of wealth would require the government to increase its debt, by pre-emptively reducing tax rates. If not, the fall in house prices induced by the reform of the system contributes to the fall in current consumption.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the quality}} of borrowers' {{financial}} positions affect the terms of their credit, changes in financial positions should result in changes to their investment and spending decisions. This idea {{is closely related to}} the financial accelerator. A basic model of the financial accelerator suggests that a firm's spending on a variable input cannot exceed the sum of gross cash flows and <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> value of assets. This relationship is expressed as a [...] "collateral-in-advance" [...] constraint. An increase in interest rates will tighten this constraint when it is binding; the firm's ability to purchase inputs will be reduced. This can occur in two ways: directly, via increasing interest payments on outstanding debt or floating-rate debt, and decreasing the value of the firm's collateral through decreased asset-prices typically associated with increased interest rates (reducing the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> value of the firm's assets); and indirectly, by reducing the demand for a firm's products, which reduces the firm's revenue while its short-run fixed cost do not adjust (lowering the firm's gross cash flow). The reduction in revenue relative to costs erodes the firm's net worth and credit-worthiness over time.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{studied and}} {{discussed}} The Faustmann Method (Land Expected Value- LEV) comparing it with The <b>Net</b> <b>Discounted</b> Value project evaluation criterion, in an infinite horizon (NDV). The method {{was applied for}} determining land value, envisaging eucalyptus plantation in savannah area (cerrado) in Brazil, {{for the purpose of}} charcoal production. For the same situation the <b>Net</b> <b>Discounted</b> Value was applied and compared. The costs considered were establishment, maintenance and harvesting and that the forest was managed with the substitution being done after cutting the original establishment at seven years of age, that is, there is no coppicing transport. The substitution cost was considered equal to that of establishment. The only income considered was the sale of the wood produced for energy (250 st/ha) at the price of US $ 7. 10 /st in the cutting age. The main conclusions were: For any discount rate, LEV is always a larger value than NDV because NDV considers land in the relationship of costs; the assumption that land only has value for wood production, implied by Faustmann methodology, doesn t have theoretical nor practical support; if there is no alternative for land use, then its opportunity cost is zero {{and there would be no}} reason to determine its value; land productive value is not the only value that enters in the formation of its price. The Faustmann methodology doesn t capture the other factors that affect land price, for instance, the speculative effects, cultural values, land protective value, protection against inflation and of statu...|$|R

Ecosystem diversity is expressed in terms of desired structures for forest and afforested agricultural land. Economic effects of possible strategies are examined by comparing attainment of these objectives with the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> returns from commercial timber harvests and agricultural activities. The tradeoffs between timber and non-timber objectives are obtained by means of compromise programming. Two measures of distance between the current objective values and the ideal ones are used to assess attainment of multiple goals. We explore how the choice of a measure affects the decisions and overall performance.

40|$|Changes in {{population}} health status {{are known to}} influence government fiscal transfers {{both in terms of}} lost tax revenue and increased expenditure for health and social services. To estimate the fiscal impact of changes in morbidity and mortality attributed to rotavirus immunisation, we developed a government perspective model to estimate <b>discounted</b> <b>net</b> tax revenue for Ghana and Vietnam. The model derived the impact of rotavirus morbidity and mortality on lifetime productive capacity and related tax transfers, and demand for government transfers in relation to education and healthcare in immunised and non-immunised cohorts. The <b>discounted</b> age-specific <b>net</b> tax revenue was derived by deducting transfers from gross taxes and discounting for time preference. In Ghana, taking into account immunisation costs, tax and transfers, the estimated <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> tax for the immunised cohort was estimated to generate $ 2. 6 billion in net taxes up to age 65. In Vietnam, the net revenue attributed to the immunised cohort reached $ 55. 17 billion suggesting an incremental benefit of approximately $ 29 million. We posit that the government perspective fiscal framework described here is a valid approach for estimating how governments benefit from investments in immunisation that can be considered supplementary to conventional cost-effectiveness approaches for defining value.

40|$|As {{reliability}} based methods gain increased acceptance, {{there is}} greater {{opportunity to use}} scarce resources more efficiently while maintaining a prescribed level of reliability of a structure throughout its service life. The goal is to provide management decisions that will balance lifetime system reliability and expected life-cycle cost in an optimal manner.

Using the discrete maximum principle of Optimal Control Theory, it is shown that under certain conditions a T-period media model can be decomposed into a sequence of T one-period models together with the determination of the corresponding carry-over effects using an iterative procedure. The single period models with their objective functions modified to include the carry-over effects can be solved by conventional methods. Although the conditions for decomposition are not always satisfied, the heuristic solution procedure defined by the decomposition approach has been found to give close to optimal solutions in randomly generated test problems. The solutions obtained in these tests are usually better than the corresponding solutions obtained by the Little and Lodish type of heuristic applied to the present model. Finally, the T-period model is specialized to derive a steady-state formulation of an infinite horizon media planning problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Six {{economic}} variables or subsets thereof {{appear as}} sub-opinions or assumptions in forensic economists ’ reports. While the <b>net</b> <b>discount</b> rate (NDR) {{is the key}} variable, it is typically not primitive; rather, it is typically derived from {{two or three of}} the other five variables, defined here as the nominal discount rate (R), the real discount rate (r), the nominal wage growth rate (G), the real wage growth rate (g), and the increase in prices, or inflation (pi). While some equations connecting these six variables are well known, this paper systematically studies all of the possible interdependencies, providing 12 binary equations in which a variable is determined by two other of the variables, and 12 tertiary equations, in which a variable requires that three of the six variables be specified. These equations permit the construction of a spreadsheet which allows the forensic economist to quickly check an opposing expert’s opinions for internal consistency, to calculate the remaining variables from the stated assumptions or opinions (if possible), and, if impossible, to understand the under-specification. Implicit in this approach is the belief that, in an era with data on real (TIPS) and nominal interest rates as well as various historical and projected nominal and real wage growth rates, an economic expert should have consistent opinions about all six variables regardless of the primitives selected.

40|$|I have {{developed}} a new financial instrument which {{will be much more}} valuable than the bonds or the treasury bills government sells in the open market to raise much needed funds to run the country. These are all interest based instruments and can only be used by institutions. The instrument I am proposing is without interest and will be used by everybody to purchased goods and services in the government and private sector resulting in up to 60 % discounts. This is why these will be massively bought up front in large amounts in the shortest period of time of one month to run the country {{for at least a year}} and much more by the end of the year. INTRODUCTION: The world is facing many challenges with no solution in sight. The main cause of all these ills is the POVERTY. Float bonds which can be used by everybody rich or poor and are not debt to the state so there is no question of interest. How: Take the example of USA which is going through a great recession. USA borrows money by selling treasury bills and the interest based bonds. The suggestion is to sell these bonds on non interest basis EXAMPLE: ONE dollar buys 5 bonds on the condition that the amount should be $ 100000 or multiple of it. Fewer amounts will get the rate of four and three. This discount massive period is only for first month at the start of the implementation of this system. In the second month the rate will be 4 but the rate of 3 will apply to subsequent months for the same amount WHERE THESE BONDS WILL BE USED? 1. All state controlled services and commodities. EXAMPLE: A bill of (any service or Commodity) $ 100 can be paid with 200 bonds and there will be no exception to this rule. A <b>NET</b> <b>DISCOUNT</b> OF 60 %. A simple formula will apply: Total bill in dollars x 2 is the number of bonds surrendered. Price in bonds will not be less than the cost price but without the direct indirect taxes and the duties which are added to the present to make it very expensive. It will attract at least 50 million people to take this opportunity as early as possible. And if one is sure of making 100 % profit within 30 days there will be many more that will help themselves. RESULT - Government gets at least $ 15 trillion within a very short period of time of few days and much more in the rest of the year. THIS IS NOT A DEBT AS STATE HAS SOLD BONDS(Commodity) WHICH IS AN ALTERNATE CURRENCY AND DO NOT CARRY ANY INTEREST. One immediately thinks who will join this club bear the loss and this loss to the state will not be more than total year budget of $ 2. 5 trillion which it collects in one year with all the taxes and the duties but the bond price is simply a cost price without any kind of tax or duty. So there is a net gain of approximately 2. 5 trillion within a short period of time. WHO WILL SELL THESE BONDS? State will float tenders to will select a private agency (USMF) UNITED STATES MONITORY FUND JUST A NAME GIVEN TO THIS ORGANIZATION with the lowest bid WHERE AS second third and forth bidders will be auditors of USMF. This agency will employ at least 20 million unemployed on 10 % commission basis and without any salary. These agents will have to pay $ 500 as an annual fee to USMF in order to build the infrastructure for the sale of bonds. Agents quota Will be $ 300000 per month or they will be allowed to sell their whole year quota in one day or in a month, This will only materialize if the agent shares his commission with the would be buyer. Greater the share of commission quicker the sale. This investor or a buyer will sell these bonds at the same rate of 5 per dollar and his bonds will sell like hot cakes every day as there is no condition of the amount of money to purchase of bonds. In this way even the poorest person will get the same rate or near the same rate as the investor except for the commission which he takes from the agent who makes almost 100 % profit by only investing $ 100000. He will sell these bonds repeatedly and will keep at least 6 % profit every day till the demand lasts. NOW THINK HOW MUCH STATE HAS ACCUMULATED Much more than few years budget in matter of only one month. ...|$|E

This is only the first flood gate of money and there are seven of these yet to open so at the end of 30 days or even much earlier the government declares tax free country for ever. With the removal of all kinds of direct and indirect taxes and duties the price of oil electricity telephone and of all types on other items under government control is almost 60 % less than before as these are being purchased by bonds(which is the cost price) and not with dollars. The production cost of every thing has come down tremendously. State also offers one million duty free if one deposits $ 100000 non refundable. This brings out all the black and spare money which state WAS NOT ABLE TO GET BEFORE AND AS THERE IS NO TAX AND HENCE NO TAX EVASION SO ALL THE MONEY IS WHITE AS IT IS BEING GIVEN TO GOVERNMENT. This was the second flood gate of money which is even bigger than the first one and the exact amount is impossible to asses unless the system is implemented. In order to provide cheep bonds through out the year government offers three types of registration fees. Pay $ 100000 in the start of the year and get the rate of 5 for the rest of the year and this will suit the professional’s and salaried person. Pay $ 10000 yearly and get 20000 new bonds at the rate 5 every month but one has to collect 10000 bonds(equal to fee) to get this cheap rate through out the year. Higher the registration fee More the entitlement of cheep bonds. This registration will suit any small time business who will sell his product cheaper provided 15 % bonds are also paid with rest of cash money by the customer SEE THE NEXT REGISTRATION FOR FARTHER EXPLANATION 15 %BONDS. This will apply to all goods in private sector and does not apply to the government sector. This is a big incentive to accept bonds in the private sector as the business accepting more bonds will have more business than the trader not accepting the bonds so the bonds market will multiply and there will be a constant need for bonds in the open market. The third type of registration will be of $ 100000 which will entitle the business to sell its products through USMF. The value of merchandise sold through this source will help the business to get the 5 bond per dollar rate equal to the amount sold or opt for the duty free option equal the amount sold. But with one condition of surrendering 15 % bonds at each sale in dollars. The example is the merchandised sold through USMF & 1000. The BONDS SURRENDERED 150 ARE DEPOSITED IN STATE ACCOUNT TO BE SOLD AGAIN SO THE CYCLE OF BONDS IS ESTABLISHED. A receipt of of bonds surrendered is obtained from USMF for evidence of sale of merchandise and this receipt will entitle the the traders to get cheep bonds or the duty free option through out the year BUT THE SAME RECEIPT CAN BE USED ONCE ONLY. The benefit to the business is cheap bonds throughout the year and the duty free option will help the industry. The quota which can be sold is ten times the amount of Registration but not more unless the registration fee is increased. Now all the business will opt for this registration in order to reduce the cost of production. These 15 % bonds the business will get back through a chain of dealers sub dealers and ultimately the customer will pay this bond portion as he will get the end product very cheep because of tremendous cut in the cost of production by the factors already mentioned. This will replace the GST or the VAT or the two price system seen all over USA. Almost every body will sell their product through this channel as it will be much costlier to sell the product out side this system as cheap bonds are not available otherwise. According to rough estimate at least $ 1000 trillion transactions are carried out every day in US and at each transaction 15 % bonds are being surrendered,the price 15 bonds is $ 3. So 3 % of 1000 trillion will be $ 30 trillion which goes into government account without any compulsion every day(UNBELIEVABLE) this is the third flood gate of money AND IS CALLED THE GOLD MINE. Now the state is sitting in the driving seat and all the money in banks of private sector have transferred into government account and banks are no more the lenders but are borrower from the state which is the only source left and will invest in business with sound feasibility study checked by the state bank. The state will offer to invest 80 % and the bank will bring investor who is willing to pool rest 20 %. This 20 % will be deposited in the bank and the bank will oversee the running the business, running expenses will be given to the investor from its share of 20 %. There will be no collateral and share of the profit and loss will be shared in the ratio of 60 and 40. The bank will share the 60 % with the investor and 40 % will go to state funds and the state will provide every thing under its control below cost which will farther reduce the cost of production and at the same time will MARKEDLY improve the profit margins OF ALL THE BUSINESSES. No major business can refuse this offer. Any bank showing repeated loss will go out of business as there will be no more funds available from the government source and all other interest based sources are not available any more. Interest based banking is is gone for ever or it may be at a very small scale and the state will not offer loans on interest as these are not any more profitable and risk free as there is no collateral. The amount of profit government will share will be unimaginable and this is the 5 Th flood gate opened. Last but not the least government will acquire all the land on lease without any force and will provide all the needs to the formers THROUGH CORPORATE FARMING SECTOR HIRED BY THE STATE below cost and will become the shareholder according to the mutual contract with the land owner this is the 6 TH flood gate of money. 2 -The drug abuse will be eliminiated when all the possible land is being cultivated by best agriculture engineers there will be much better yield and much more profit to land owner then who will not join hands with the government. THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT WILL BE THERE WILL BE NO MORE POPPY CULTIVATION IN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE POOR AND LARGELY DEPEND ON THE POPPY CROP. NOW THERE IS NO MORE POPPY AND NO MORE DRUGS. 3 -The solution of trerrorism lies in the eliminaton of poverty [...] We have to look at root cause and that is the POVERTY and NOT the religion which is being falsely blamed. Th going rate for a suicide bomber is $ 1000 in Pakistan Iraq and in Afghanistan. Can one believe that any one having at least two meals a day will blow himself ?Never the areas of the countries where these attacks are happening are extremely poor and the extremist elements who themselves are or were poor exploit these very poor people to carryout attacks for money to save their families from dying from hunger and is open secret. Osama Bin Laden has large force that is recruited from poor areas as there in no job anywhere and he provides these raw recruits with only food and shelter and at same time brainwash them and train some of them to carry out these attacks by giving them enough money in their lives to support their dependents. You might mention few isolated cases of being well to do and still carried out these attacks. Once the poverty is removed in these areas by implementing this system these attacks will come to an end immediately. This system is not only meant for USA but will be easily applicable to every country. A STRONG EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO REACH THE RULERS OF THESE COUNTRIES AND ALSO TO MR BUSH BUT SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCCESS. I HAVE THE BLUE PRINT OF A REAL AND PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO GET USA FORCES OUT OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WITHOUT VIOLENCE IN MATTER OF 6 MONTHS. IF ALL THE ABOVE IMPOSSIBLE CLAIMS I HAVE MADE ARE POSSIBLE AND TRUE TO THE LAST DETAIL THEN THERE IS NO REASON THAT THIS MESSAGE SHOULD NOT REACH THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR PROMPT FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION.

40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} aimed to the {{definition}} of technical and economic efficiency from the use of wheels of perspective structural scheme in the undercarriage of the rail vehicles (wagon). Methodology. The use efficiency of wheels of promising design scheme by reducing the motion resistance and wear of the wheel flanges is estimated by calculated values of estimated annual economic effect of implementation and payback period of the costs required for {{the development and implementation of}} the proposed wheel. Non-recurring costs include the cost associated with conducting research and development work, as well as the additional costs required for the manufacture of wheels of promising design scheme. Findings. In the course of computation and analysis of the economic efficiency from introductions of wheels of promising design concept, carried out on the basis of the initial data for the South-West railway, it was determined the profit which can be obtained by reducing the following operating costs: cost of returning the wheel flange on wheel sets; cost of fuel and energy resources for train traction; the value of the idle of cars in the current uncoupling repair; cost of repairs and current maintenance of rail track. In addition, it can be additionally released a number of cars by reducing their downtime. The calculation of <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> income is carried out with the following assumptions: calculation period; estimated increase in the cost of wheel sets with wheels of promising constructive scheme compared to the model, the values of net profit for the accounting period, which was calculated by calculating the average value minus the cost of research, development and manufacturing of wheelset park with wheels of new design scheme. For a given billing period, the calculated value of the <b>net</b> <b>discounted</b> income was obtained and the payback period of the project was determined. Originality. The approaches to the perfection of design scheme of wheels, used in running gear of railway vehicles were substantiated. Practical value. The calculation method proposed in this publication allows evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of using the wheels of promising design scheme in the running gears of railway vehicles...|$|R
