5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In January 1904 six {{specimens}} and an egg {{were collected}} by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but {{did not find any}} evidence of its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous Tintin books, Hergé deliberately broke the adventure formula he had created. It is the only book in the Tintin series where the characters remain at home in Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock's family estate in Belgium, and do <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> abroad or confront dangerous criminals. The plot concerns the visit of the opera singer Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent theft of her emerald.|$|E
5|$|In the postseason, Bill Clark {{was again}} suspended, {{this time by}} coach Everhart for a conduct issue. The day before the CBI game against Princeton, Everhart {{announced}} that Clark would <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> to the game or participate in any practices or team activities until he felt the student ready to return. Clark was reinstated two weeks later, and, as before, no details were revealed.|$|E
5|$|Like most Proteaceae, T.truncata has fine proteoid {{roots that}} arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> far (just several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly {{played no}} Shield cricket the {{following}} season, {{when he was}} selected for the Australian tour to South Africa. Although Bradman had been vice-captain under Woodfull in 1934, he did <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> to South Africa on grounds of ill health, but played a full domestic season despite this. The team was captained by Victor Richardson, and O'Reilly publicly described it as the happiest tour he had been on—he {{was one of several}} players who did not get along with Bradman.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Winton train carried 170 passengers, {{including}} 22 {{of those}} originally rescued, {{who came to}} be known as 'Winton's Children'. Passengers included the first, second, or even third generation of descendants of the original children rescued by Sir Nicholas. The descendants of the children Sir Nicholas rescued had by 2009 grown to number 5,000 people. Passengers on the 2009 train also included Sir Nicholas's daughter Barbara. Other survivors who did <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> on the reunion train instead met it at Liverpool Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{severely limited}} {{his ability to}} play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team. In some cases, he would travel overland by car or train, but the logistics of some matches were such that he would <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> at all. In the build-up to Arsenal's Champions League match against Lyon in February 2001, Wenger spoke of his concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car, because of the exertions involved.|$|E

Linebacker Tony Morrison and {{receiver}} James Crawford were suspended indefinitely from the team and did <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> to the game. Morrison was arrested for public intoxication, petty larceny and destruction of property, while Crawford was charged with defrauding a garage keeper and felony hit and run. On December 12, cornerback Antonio Banks was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery but was not suspended from the team and played in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E

5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Garfield led {{the first}} front porch {{campaign}} for the Presidency. He did <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> that much, and he usually stayed at home to present his presidential agenda to visitors. Garfield enlisted {{the support of the}} other candidates from the convention to help with the campaign. The 1880 Democratic National Convention chose Winfield Scott Hancock as the presidential candidate and William Hayden English as his vice-presidential running mate. The election featured a very close popular vote that put Garfield ahead with a majority of less than 10,000; some sources put the margin as low as 2,000. However, Garfield won the election with 214 of the 369 electoral votes in the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Mississippi came {{storming}} back. Following the field goal, Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an onside kick {{in an effort}} to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead. Onside kicks, unlike an ordinary free kick, can be recovered by the kicking team—but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards. If the kicking team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards, the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball was touched. Unfortunately for Virginia Tech, Simsak's onside kick—though it surprised Ole Miss—did <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> the requisite 10 yards. Mississippi took over at the Virginia Tech 49-yard line, and many of the Ole Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult.|$|E
5|$|Marceau splits {{her time}} between seeing to {{the duties of}} the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), {{interviewing}} passengers about the murder, and examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does <b>not</b> <b>travel</b> to in the book, such as the engine, the baggage car, and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E
