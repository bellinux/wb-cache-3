5|$|The {{remainder}} of Night describes Eliezer's efforts {{not to be}} parted from his father, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> lose sight of him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes {{and the young man}} becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people.|$|E
5|$|Although today our {{opponents are}} at the Rhine and at the Oder, I do not believe yet {{that there will be}} a coup brought about by the German people. Without {{assistance}} from outside, such a coup is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> be considered. Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

Instructing Chabot to hold the Trentapassos defile with three battalions, the French commander determined to smash through Vives' lines with the remaining 23 battalions. Pino's Italian division was in front, followed by Souham's French division. Saint-Cyr ordered Pino to keep his battalions in column formation and crash through the enemy lines by sheer impetus. Pino was forbidden to deploy a single battalion, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> take prisoners.|$|E
25|$|William {{considered}} his veteran army to be sufficient {{in size to}} defeat any forces (all rather inexperienced) that James could throw against him, {{but it had been}} decided to avoid the hazards of battle and maintain a defensive attitude in the hope James's position might collapse by itself. Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had the added benefit of not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.|$|E

Pat Smear was present in many photos posted by Grohl on Twitter and a press release in December confirmed Smear played on every track on the album and was considered a core member of the band once again, having initially left as a full-time member in 1997 before returning as a touring guitarist in 2006.|$|E

On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem very kind.|$|E

Thorfinn finally learns {{that the person}} who ordered for Thors’s death was Floki, as Thors was the mostly likely {{candidate}} to be the third chieftain. Rage crossed Thorfinn’s mind but leaves to sort himself out. Alone, he questions if he can still change for the better and become a kinder person. Thorfinn also meets one of his old crewmates, Atli who is arrested for thievery. Atli says he has a family back home and “will find an honest line of work”. Vagn warns Thorfinn that people like Atli will return to stealing and killing people instead of field labor, so killing him is better than releasing him. Hild leaves after questioning Vagn on the same thing since he is also enjoying an extravagant meal when there are no animals or fields around. Thorfinn wishes to not go to Jomsborg nor fight anyone, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> meet Floki again. Thorfinn states that King Canute will oversee the affairs of Thors’s murder while Thorfinn will complete his own mission without needless bloodshed. Later, Vagn is puzzled when Thorfinn and Hild are trying to stop Vagn’s men from sexually assaulting the slave girls.|$|E

500|$|In Homilies on Ecclesiastes, he wrote: [...] "'I got me slave-girls and slaves.' For what price, tell me? What did {{you find}} in {{existence}} {{worth as much as}} this human nature? What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom.

500|$|Fire {{from the}} {{domestic}} hearth was {{under no circumstances}} given {{out of the house}} on Christmas Eve, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> a neighbor whose fire had gone out. The reason for this prohibition, according to Čajkanović, was the belief that the Eve is a time when the ancestral spirits, guardians of the family's happiness and prosperity, are especially active in this world. Christmas Eve dinner is a feast prepared in their honor, and they join the family at it. They gather on the straw spread over the floor, and on the hearth. These spirits could be removed from the family if any piece of their fire were taken away by an outsider. In people's words, fire should not be given lest the luck be taken away from the house, or for better crops, or because of bees. Referring to the latter explanation, Čajkanović argues that, in the old religion of the Serbs, the bees were regarded as pure and sacred insects, in whom ancestral spirits could dwell. The same explanation, [...] "because of bees", is also given for the aforementioned custom of putting a piece of the badnjak's first splinter in the dough for the česnica.|$|E

500|$|Members of the LDS Church {{believe that}} Jesus Christ will return in glory in his Second Coming. Howard W. Hunter, who was {{president}} of the church's Quorum of the Twelve {{at the time of the}} center's construction, pointed out that although there would be no proselytizing from the center, it still served a valuable purpose. One church member quoted him this way: [...] "Elder Hunter said that our mission was not to harvest, probably <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> plant, but to clear away a few more stones." [...] Latter-day Saints often see the center as a way for them to show local Jews what the church is about by example, rather than by proselyting. This is done by the way students and faculty at the center live their lives, as well as through the hiring of both Israeli and Palestinian workers, as an example of what can be done through cooperation. During construction of the center, for example, the church hired as many as 300 workers at one time, with about 60% of them being Arab and the other 40% being Jewish. Similar cooperation continues today.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fires}} had been {{contained}} there remained the gruesome task of cleaning upbody parts and corpses littered {{the bay and}} port. Of the 320 dead, only 51 could be identified. Most of the uninjured sailors volunteered to help clean up and rebuild the base; Division Two was separated into a group that would stay and clean up and a group that would be moved out. This section of Division Two and all of Divisions Four and Eight were transferred to Camp Shoemaker, about [...] south, where they were assigned barracks duty until July 31, 1944. The men of Divisions One, Five and Seven were reassigned other duty in distant locations and shipped out. The cleanup detail from Division Two dug into {{the wreckage of the}} pier and began tearing out the damaged portions. Beginning in August, Divisions Four and Eight and both sections of Division Two moved to the Ryder Street Naval Barracks in Vallejo, California, across a short channel from Mare Island, where they were assigned barracks duties with no ship-loading. The men were in a state of shock; all were nervous. Many of them inquired about obtaining a 30-day [...] "survivor's leave" [...] sometimes given by the Navy to sailors who had survived a serious incident where their friends or shipmates had died, but no 30-day leaves were granted, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> those who had been hospitalized with injuries. White officers, however, received the leave, causing a major grievance among the enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|In his speeches, Aeschines uses pederastic {{relations}} of Demosthenes {{as a means}} to attack him. In the case of Aristion, a youth from Plataea who lived {{for a long time in}} Demosthenes' house, Aeschines mocks the [...] "scandalous" [...] and [...] "improper" [...] relation. In another speech, Aeschines brings up the pederastic relation of his opponent with a boy called Cnosion. The slander that Demosthenes' wife also slept with the boy suggests that the relationship was contemporary with his marriage.* C. A. Cox, Household Interests, 202. Aeschines claims that Demosthenes made money out of young rich men, such as Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, whom he allegedly deceived with the pretence that he could make him a great orator. Apparently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus killed and mutilated a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of complicity in the murder, pointing out that Nicodemus had once pressed a lawsuit accusing Demosthenes of desertion. He also accused Demosthenes of having been such a bad erastes to Aristarchus so as <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> deserve the name. His crime, according to Aeschines, was to have betrayed his eromenos by pillaging his estate, allegedly pretending to be in love with the youth so as to get his hands on the boy's inheritance. Nevertheless, the story of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still regarded as more than doubtful, and no other pupil of Demosthenes is known by name.* A.W.
