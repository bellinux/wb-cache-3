50|$|<b>Notched</b> <b>trowel</b> is a {{rectangular}} shaped tool with regularly spaced notches along {{one or more}} sides used to apply adhesive when adhering tile, or laying synthetic floor surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Jeff - Jeff has {{issues with}} tiling largely from {{not using the}} <b>notched</b> <b>trowel</b> to create the grooves needed to hold his tiles in place, causing mortar to fill the gaps between tiles. To rectify the problem of falling tiles, Jeff pushes the tiles together, leaving no room for grout.|$|E
50|$|Terry - Terry {{is caught}} by Sheila doing {{incorrect}} things on multiple occasions: first, his water to mix ratio is incorrect (Terry having {{believed that the}} ratio {{is the same as}} that for grout), {{the fact that he did}} not use a <b>notched</b> <b>trowel</b> to apply the mortar to the wall, and finally when the gap between his tile sheets is different from the gap between the tiles on the same sheet. Terry quickly fixes all of these, and is done correctly in 60 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|LATICRETE {{was founded}} in 1956 by Dr. Henry M. Rothberg, a {{chemical}} engineer. Realizing that the installation methods used for tile and stone were outdated, Dr. Rothberg began a research and development program in partnership with Uniroyal Chemical in Naugatuck, Connecticut. The program led {{to the introduction of}} latex to traditional Portland cement-based mortar, resulting in a lighter, more flexible system for installing tile and stone products. This research became the foundation for the [...] "thin-bed" [...] method of installing tile and stone. The thin-bed method involves the application of thin-set adhesive mortars, a product of the research, with a <b>notched</b> <b>trowel.</b> [...] At the time, this was a new alternative to the thick, heavy mortar beds traditionally used by flooring contractors.|$|E
50|$|At the end {{of their}} last challenge, much of the unused plaster and thinset mortar had settled and {{hardened}} (with one even having their <b>notched</b> <b>trowel</b> stuck in their hardened thinset mortar). The contestants begin the challenge of applying the clay plaster over their primed wall by cleaning up their wasted products, totalling over 100 pounds. Again, the contestants use a whole bag (which is far too much) each, mixing a combined 215 pounds of clay (Jaime and Jeff mixing 50 pounds, while Terry and Candace mix 40 pounds of clay, and Ruth with 35 pounds) - nearly a pound of clay for every square foot of wall in the sheds. In retrospect, Jaime states that they {{would have been better off}} mixing one bag together and sharing the mortar.|$|E
