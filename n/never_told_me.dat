500|$|Stalmaster {{convinced}} Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|E

I was a very unpopular young officer for that." [...] Nevertheless, he was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) in September.|$|E

[...] Months after his hire in January, 2010, he publicly admitted to steroid use through parts of his career, including his home run record-breaking season in 1998, and issued a public apology. [...] Commissioner Selig was pleased with McGwire's announcement, adding that [...] "this statement of contrition I believe will make Mark's re-entry into the game much smoother and easier." [...] La Russa stated that, before that day, he [...] "didn’t know anything. [...] Mark and I never confronted it, and he <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> until this morning." [...] McGwire remarked that during the 2005 Congressional hearings, he was then ready to admit to his steroid use, but lawyers advised against it to attempt to attain immunity.|$|E

2500|$|Morton Sobell finally {{admitted}} in 2008 (after {{many years of}} denials) {{that he was a}} Soviet spy. He confirmed that Julius Rosenberg was [...] "in a conspiracy that delivered to the Soviets classified military and industrial information ... the atomic bomb", and that, [...] "He <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about anything else that he was engaged in." [...] However, he stated that he thought the hand-drawn diagrams and other atomic-bomb details that were acquired by David Greenglass and passed to Julius were of [...] "little value" [...] to the Soviet Union, and were used only to corroborate what they had already learned from the other atomic spies. He also stated that he believed Ethel Rosenberg was aware of her husband's deeds, but took no part in them. In a subsequent letter to The New York Times, Sobell denied that he knew anything about Julius Rosenberg's alleged atomic espionage activities – that the only thing he knew for sure was what he himself did in association with Julius Rosenberg.|$|E
2500|$|Kiedis {{was born}} in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to actor John Michael Kiedis, known professionally as Blackie Dammett, and Margaret [...] "Peggy" [...] Noble. His {{paternal}} grandfather's family emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1900s; {{the remainder of his}} ancestry includes Greek, English, French, Dutch, and Mohican. In 1966, when he was three years old, his parents divorced. Along with his two half-sisters, Julie and Jenny, he was raised by his mother and stepfather in Grand Rapids. Each summer, he would visit his father in Hollywood for two weeks, a time during which the two would bond. [...] He idolized his father, and recalled, [...] "Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I'd ever experienced." [...] In 1974, when Kiedis was twelve years old, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time. His father was a struggling actor who sold drugs, which {{had a significant impact on}} Kiedis, as the two would often use marijuana and cocaine together. Kiedis accidentally tried heroin for the first time at age 14, mistaking the substance for cocaine. Through his father Blackie, Kiedis, who worked under the stage name of Cole Dammett, landed his first acting role appearing as Sylvester Stallone's character's son in the 1978 film, F.I.S.T. That same year he would land two more acting jobs, one being on an ABC Afterschool Special and the other an appearance in the film, Jokes My Folks <b>Never</b> <b>Told</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Hawkins {{appeared}} at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival in 2014, as a trio with Francois Houle (clarinet) and Eisenstadt. Hawkins has often played with Louis Moholo-Moholo, who [...] "has <b>never</b> once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what to play or suggested what to play", according to the pianist. In 2015, Hawkins was asked to [...] "write a new book of arrangements for Londons Dedication Orchestra". He also released a trio album of his own compositions, Alexander Hawkins Trio, with Charles and Skinner. From that year, he collaborated with vocalist Elaine Mitchener.|$|R

If I listened too closely, I thought, I would hear the screams of the boys, of the 'large family' dying together. For all his attention to my historical education, my father had neglected to tell me this: history's terrible moments were real. I understand now, decades later, that he could <b>never</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Only history itself can convince you of such a truth.

Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge, he would <b>never</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what he had told.|$|R

He continued to perform with his trio in Los Angeles jazz clubs until shortly before being hospitalized in August 2004. His final public performance with his trio was in Reno, Nevada, {{and he said it}} was the best he had ever played.

Berghofer later said, [...] "In all that time, Pete <b>never</b> once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how to play or what to play." ...|$|R
