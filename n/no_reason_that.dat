Le Droit Humain enjoys fraternal {{relations}} with the Grand Orient de France, the Grande Loge féminine de France, and the Grande Loge de France. The Grand Orient de France, in addition to recognising women's masonry, decided in 2010 that there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> its lodges should {{not be able to}} initiate women, thus adding another strand to international co-masonry.|$|E
5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|One {{account of}} a woman being {{admitted}} to Freemasonry in the 18th century {{is the case of}} Elizabeth Aldworth (born St Leger), who is reported to have surreptitiously viewed the proceedings of a Lodge meeting held at Doneraile House, the private house of her father, first Viscount Doneraile, a resident of Doneraile, County Cork, Ireland. Upon discovering the breach of their secrecy, the Lodge resolved to admit and obligate her, and thereafter she proudly appeared in public in Masonic clothing. Speculative attempts to link the lodge of her initiation with a documented lodge of the Grand Lodge of Ireland have proved futile, but there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> her father should not have instituted a lodge in his home, and the authenticity of her initiation is generally accepted.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} subject to minor criticisms, at both the events {{surrounding}} the opening concerts in Barcelona, and the concerts in Dublin. When rehearsing for the tour in Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 10pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band to rehearse. The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in Dublin was criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, {{and that there was}} <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the stage could not be placed {{in the middle of the}} venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the loudness of the band's crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the Dublin concerts.|$|E
25|$|If a {{woman has}} one or more small prolactinoma, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> she cannot {{conceive}} and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in {{less than one percent}} of pregnant women with prolactinoma. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater, and some doctors consider it as high as 25%. If {{a woman has}} completed a successful pregnancy, the chances of her completing further successful pregnancies are extremely high.|$|E
25|$|A few later {{classical}} philosophers did dispute {{this view}} of comets. Seneca the Younger, in his Natural Questions, observed that comets moved regularly through the sky and were undisturbed by the wind, behavior more typical of celestial than atmospheric phenomena. While he conceded that the other planets do not appear outside the Zodiac, he saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a planet-like object could not move through {{any part of the}} sky. However, the Aristotelian viewpoint proved more influential, and {{it was not until the}} 16th century that Tycho Brahe demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere by measuring the parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.|$|E

25|$|Graphical {{representations}} of the curve sometimes appear to put the rate at around 50%, if the tax base reacts to the tax rate linearly, but the optimal rate could theoretically be any percentage greater than 0% and less than 100%. Similarly, the curve is often presented as a parabolic shape, but there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> this is necessarily the case. The effect of changes in tax can be cased in terms of elasticities, where the optimal elasticity of the tax base {{with respect to the}} tax is equal to 1. This is done by differentiating R with respect to t and grouping terms to reveal that the rate of change of R with respect to t is equal to the sum of elasticity of the tax base plus one all multiplied by the tax base. Thus as elasticity surpasses one absolute value, revenues begin to fall. The problem {{is similar to that of}} the monopolist who must never increase prices beyond the point at which the elasticity of demand exceeds one in absolute value.|$|E

In other words, it covered malpractice, not illicit practice.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics were}} {{dissatisfied}} with {{the scope of the}} novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected stories to tell. Caly Risen of Flak Magazine believed that the immigrant experience was the [...] "heart of the novel", lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a [...] "fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further." [...] Risen wished to read more about the events between Cal's adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal's experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. The Washington Posts Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic also felt that the brief description of Callie's childhood was lacking; the book [...] "gloss over" [...] how her mother did not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O'Nan characterized Cal's relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as [...] "underdeveloped", causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of People had the same view about the novel's end, writing that the conclusion felt [...] "rushed".|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} was released, the {{distributor}} did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because {{the film was}} X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. [...] This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, [...] "it didn't have a big following, ... {{but it is still}} in video stores." [...] The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film [...] "raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the humor of the film [...] "is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems to be sort of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined." [...] Beck also stated that the film was [...] "very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and Flakey Foont. There is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he just seems to be a duck just to give the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum." [...] Beck later called the film [...] "one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today’s vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Bombay High Court, {{the defence}} put forth {{their version of}} the incident, for which there were no {{witnesses}} other than the two men, and no evidence. Hearing Sylvia's confession, an enraged Nanavati wanted to shoot himself, but was calmed down by Sylvia, who {{told him that he}} was not to be blamed and there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he should shoot himself. Since Sylvia did not tell him whether Prem intended to marry her, Nanavati sought to find it out for himself. When Nanavati met Prem at the latter's bedroom, Prem had just come out of the bath dressed only in a white towel; an angry Nanavati swore at Prem and proceeded to ask him if he intended to marry Sylvia and look after his children. Prem replied, [...] "Will I marry every woman I sleep with?", which further enraged Nanavati. Seeing Nanavati go for the gun, enclosed in a brown packet, Prem too went for it and in the ensuing scuffle, Prem's hand caused the gun to go off and instantly kill him.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly {{reviewer}} Leah Greenblatt wrote that the album is [...] "as turgidly epic as the tenets of the genre demand" [...] with Conley [...] "mak no bones about his bad mood".

Gigwise staff member David Renshaw wrote that the instrumentation is [...] "nothing spectacular," [...] while noting that [...] "there are riffs piled on top of riffs ... and a few funky basslines ... but the thing that keeps you coming back to this album is the lyrics".

2500|$|In 1989, Fulufjället {{appeared}} in Naturvårdsverket's {{plan for the}} creation of new national parks. Negotiation with local authorities began the following year, but the project met opposition from the local population. One of the arguments in favor of the creation of the park, beyond the simple protection of nature, was that it would draw more tourists, especially foreigners; this was particularly important since while Idre and Sälen had succeeded in developing winter tourism, Särna had not. The project's opponents retorted that there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> European tourists should choose to visit this distant mountain over the Alpes. Besides that, the national park would necessitate a certain number of restrictions on the locals such as banning of snowmobile use, hunting, and fishing. The council of administration of Älvdalen Municipality heard the locals' negative opinion, and so opposed itself {{to the creation of the}} park. Naturvårdsverket and Dalarna County thus changed their strategy, and surveyed the locals to learn how they thought the mountain ought to be used. Discussions continued following the publication of this study, and in 1999, the locals began to express favorable opinions. The park was no longer seen as a set of restrictions, but as an opportunity for the municipality. This led to the creation of the park in 2002. The official motive {{for the creation of}} the park was [...] "to preserve an area of the central mountains with a distinctive vegetation and a great natural richness in a relatively intact state". It was the first Swedish national park established in the mountains since Padjelanta in 1962. The official inauguration was held 17 September 2002, in the presence of the king Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The park is also part of the Natura 2000 Network since 1995 and is classified a Special Protection Area for the preservation of birds since 1996. The park became one of the first parks of the European network of PAN Parks, created by the WWF to reconcile the protection of nature and tourism.|$|E
