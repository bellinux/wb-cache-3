5|$|Many Black Hebrew {{groups were}} {{founded in the}} United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from Kansas to New York City, by both African Americans and West Indian immigrants. In the mid-1980s, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> Hebrews in the United States was between 25,000 and 40,000. In the 1990s, the Alliance of Black Jews (which is no longer operating) {{estimated}} that there were 200,000 African-American Jews; this estimate {{was based on a}} 1990 survey conducted by the Council of Jewish Federations. The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> Hebrews within that surveyed group remains unspecified.|$|E

Carlsen won two games, against Gelfand and Nakamura, and drew the rest. Although he finished equal on points with Aronian, he placed ahead since the tiebreak {{was determined by the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> games; Carlsen had five black games, while Aronian only had four.|$|E

The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to come forward and be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's See Something, Say Something campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E

5|$|The APFA, {{which later}} {{became known as}} the National Football League (NFL), had a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> players. In the league's first seven years, nine African-Americans played in the APFA/NFL. Two black players took part in the league's inaugural season: Fritz Pollard and Bobby Marshall. In 1921, Pollard coached in the league, {{becoming}} the first African-American to do so.|$|E
5|$|African American industry, {{churches and}} other {{institutions}} grew rapidly in prominence {{through the end of}} the 19th century. The city's African American community was well established by the beginning of the 20th century, when the corner of Lumpkin and Washington Streets became a major center for the city's black culture. This area was known as the Hot Corner, and was owned by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> professional businesses, as well as many performance spaces and a renowned opera house in the Morton Building that hosted such national figures as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. The Morton Theater was one of the preeminent venues in the city in the early 20th century, and is the only such theater to survive to the present, though it was not in operation for many years, until re-opening in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E

50|$|The Marine Corps, being {{a combat}} {{arm of the}} Navy, did not recruit any black soldiers. Instead, the USMC was {{serviced}} by US Navy supply personnel including black laborers. Unlike the US Army which had separate regiments that a soldier could remain in for his entire military career, Marines were individually transferred to various ship's detachments and naval bases. After World War I, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> in both the Navy and the Army was reduced to about 1.5% <b>of</b> the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active servicemen, a proportion {{much lower than the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> in the general population.|$|R

5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> on yellow Islamic wares and celadon. Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end}} of the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E

There were also large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> pioneers and other non-combatant troops. At one point, ten per cent of the British forces at Savannah were black. There were substantial <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> soldiers in the British forces at Charleston, and analyses of British records show that blacks were represented in British units in Rhode Island {{at about the same}} time (1779).|$|R
