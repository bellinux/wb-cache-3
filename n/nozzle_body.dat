This two-step process causes the water to be ejected in a ring-shaped pattern, which causes less water to strike any one location, and thereby reduces erosion while also making it easier to water larger areas.|$|E

For {{liquid fertilizer}}s, variable-orifice nozzles are being implemented since they provide a much larger nozzle flow range compared to traditional fixed orifice nozzles. However, understanding the performance of variable-orifice nozzles under different field operating conditions has been limited. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of variable orifice nozzles in support of variable-rate application. Two common variable-orifice nozzles offered by different companies were selected for this study. They were tested over three flow ranges (0. 76 to 1. 89 L/min) with all tests replicated three times. A commercially available 18. 6 -m, wet boom sprayer equipped with 37 <b>nozzle</b> <b>bodies</b> was used. <b>Nozzles</b> were numbered but then randomly assigned a position along the boom. To evaluate the performance of an individual nozzle, three random nozzle locations along the spray boom were established for both sets of nozzles. Therefore, 18 tests per replication were required to include the 3 flow rates, 3 different locations, and 2 nozzle types. Once the desired flow rate test was established, tip flow was measured using SpotOn Sprayer Calibrator technology. Tip flows were recorded and statistical analyses performed to evaluate flow uniformity (CV) across the boom but also detect off-rate errors by individual nozzles and locations across the boom. With the exception of a few nozzles, the uniformity across the spray boom, as defined by the CV, was acceptable for both nozzle types over approximately a 2 : 1 flow range. Both nozzle types were less uniform at the low flow rate. There were three nozzles of each type that resulted in unacceptable flow errors in multiple tests. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{spray rate}} {{controllers}} along with {{technologies such as}} automatic section control (ASC) provide benefits such as overlap reduction on agricultural sprayers. However, product (liquid) dynamics within the boom plumbing affect off-rate errors and application uniformity during rate changes and ASC actuation. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare nozzle flow stability and uniformity across the boom when using two different boom shut-off valves (2 -way and metered 3 -way) on an 18. 3 -m sprayer boom. Pressure transducers were mounted at 1) the boom manifold, 2) randomly at 12 <b>nozzle</b> <b>bodies</b> across the spray boom, and 3) upstream and downstream of the flow regulating valve. Effective system flow rate was measured using two flow meter(s), one located upstream of the boom control valves (2 -way or metered 3 -way) and another mounted to measure the tank return flow for the metered 3 -way boom valve. Measured nozzle pressure was converted to nozzle flow using the manufacturer’s pressure-flow data. Results indicated that the 2 -way boom versus metered 3 -way valve response was significantly different. Significant differences in damping ratios were found when exiting (under-damped) and reentering (over-damped) of spray zones. For the metered 3 -way boom valve configuration, nozzle flow settled faster (0. 1 to 4. 2 s) virtually eliminating off-rate errors whereas the 2 -way boom valve configuration took up to 34. 3 s to settle with off-rate errors ranging from 3. 3 % to 11. 5 %. The delayed nozzle flow settling times were associated with pressure settling (0. 7 to 31. 4 s) downstream of the regulating valve for the 2 -way configuration. Ground speed and point row angle impacted nozzle flow settling times and off-rate errors. The increase in ground speed and point row angle increased nozzle flow settling time for the 2 -way valve setup, except that acceleration decreased settling times when exiting spray zones. The delayed response contributed to off-rate time which decreased as the sprayer accelerated and point row angle decreased for both the 2 -way (1. 7 to 19. 3 s) and metered 3 -way (2. 1 to 4. 4 s) boom shut-off valve setups...|$|R

This study supports the ongoing research at Cal Poly to effectively thrust vector a hybrid rocket motor. Such thrust vectoring is achieved by small secondary ports in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>body</b> that are perpendicular to the main nozzle. The testing conducted included characterizing and comparing {{the performance of a}} straight aerospike nozzle to that of a thrust-vectored aerospike nozzle. Throttling effects on the aerospike nozzle in an unvectored and in a vectored configuration were also investigated. The interaction between throttling and thrust vectoring of an aerospike nozzle is the focus of this thesis research. This research shows that large-throat/high-thrust operation of an aerospike nozzle provides little thrust vector generation. Conversely, small-throat/low-thrust operation provides ample thrust vector generation. These results have implications in the effectiveness of thrust vectoring an aerospike nozzle with secondary ports.

40|$|Fuel {{pressurisation}} up to 3000 bar, {{as required}} by modern Diesel engines, can result in significant variation of the fuel physical properties relative to those at atmospheric pressure and room temperature conditions. The huge acceleration of the fuel as it is pushed through the nozzle hole orifices is known to induce cavitation, which is typically considered as an iso-thermal process. However, discharge of this pressurised liquid fuel through the micro-channel holes can result in severe wall velocity gradients which induce friction and thus heating of the liquid. Simulations assuming variable properties reveal two opposing processes strongly affecting the fuel injection quantity and its temperature. The first one {{is related to the}} de-pressurisation of the fuel; the strong pressure and density gradients at {{the central part of the}} injection hole induce fuel temperatures even lower than that of the inlet fuel temperature. On the other hand, the strong heating produced by wall friction increases significantly the fuel temperature; local values can exceed the liquid’s boiling point and even induce reverse heat transfer from the liquid to the <b>nozzle’s</b> metal <b>body.</b> Local values of the thermal conductivity and heat capacity affect the transfer of heat produced at the nozzle surface to the flowing liquid.

The aim is to enhance the atomization of these liquids by maximizing the amount of charge that can be introduced into the spray. Spray current measurements showed that atomizer internal geometry is the key parameter and a "point-plane" geometry was found to be optimum. The "point" is the charge injection site, the tip of a needle electrode, coaxial with the "plane," conceptually a disk which contains the atomizer orifice. An important requirement is to place the electrode tip as near as possible to this "plane," while maintaining sufficient current.

40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} improve the use of {{pesticides}} and pesticide consumption and prevent environmental pollution, manufactures and scientists have considered two major trends. The first major trend is improving techniques that are practical and effective use of small quantities of chemicals to reduce the negative effect of residues of pesticides. The use of new methods usually requires investment and cost. The second major trend is changing the parts that are more important to reform the sprayer components {{in order to reduce}} pollution, mainly by including engineering controls, and design and construction of appropriate nozzles. The optimization can be done with the least expensive pesticide. Nozzle is a device for spraying the solution in the form of particles with a certain pattern. Tip of a nozzle is placed in the <b>nozzle’s</b> <b>body</b> and has many different types. The main factors in choosing tips include: material, pattern of distribution, spray angle and the amount of the solution. The spray tip may be made of aluminum, brass, nylon, stainless steel, ceramic or other materials. Nanocomposites are composites that contain at least one component with dimensions in the nanometer range between 1 to 100 nm. This material is suitable as an alternative to overcome the limitations that exist with integrated microcomposites. The aim of this study was the construction and evaluation of a sprayer nozzle with ceramic nanocomposites with good shelf life and optimum performance. Materials and methods: This research was supported by the Agricultural Engineering Research Institute and Nanotechnology Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture. The operations of this study were as follows: 1 - Preparing of materials, including alumina powder and stabilized zirconia powder with yttrium. 2 - Design and manufacture of molds. 3 - Preparation of the samples pressing operations. 4 - Zintering of samples to achieve high density. 5 - Tests to determine the quality of the products. In order to prepare nanocomposite powder mixed with stabilized zirconia alumina, the ratio of 10 / 90 percent by volume of the powder was poured into the mill for three hours and it was stirred in the mixer. Pressing is placing the powder into a mold, and applying pressure to achieve the desired density. In this study, pressing device with 30 tons was manually used and powder sample in the amount of one gram was placed in a semi-cylindrical small hollow. After making a few samples and determining the optimal pressure and time of pressing in action, samples were manufactured under 90 kg cm- 2 pressure at 20 seconds. A high temperature furnace model F 3 L- 1720 was used for zintering. Samples were put into the furnace after forming by a single-axis press. Temperature the of furnace was raised up 1650 °C at a rate of 10 degrees per minute and then the samples were exposed for one hour in order for the heat to be evenly applied in all the <b>body</b> of the <b>nozzle.</b> Finally, a hollow cone spray pattern fan nozzle with a major diameter of 15 mm and an inner diameter of 2 mm was built. Equipment for analyzing used in this study included: X-Ray Diffraction device (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The flow rate output was measured at a pressure of 2 bar in the period of 0 - 50 hours at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 hours. Results and Discussion: XRD analysis of nano-composite stabilizer in the presence of yttria- zirconia- alumina toughness with (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3), yttria stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) and alumina indicates respective phases. For the samples made with better properties, it should be uniformly distributed within it. To evaluate the uniformity, SEM-Mapping test samples were made. The results showed that the distribution of Y, Zr, Al in nanocomposite (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) is almost uniform. The results of changes in the level of output over time showed that the rate of flow in composite (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) nozzle versus ceramic conventional (Al 2 O 3) nozzle after 50 hours of testing under static condition, flow rate was decreased to 30 - 35 percent. Conclusions: Nozzles {{are one of the most}} important terminal parts in sprayers and are used to spread the liquid evenly at a certain flow rate. Addinga nanomaterial ceramic structure as a new solution was effective. By paying attention to reduce the use of chemicals and protection of the resource bases, a correct approach to the development of agricultural mechanization equipment that are essential components should be a priorityas a low-cost solution...|$|R
40|$|Water Jet Cutting Machine System Design for Non-Metal Materials Cutting Process. This {{research}} is a manufacturing {{technology that is}} currently widely developed because it has several advantages compared with other machine tool technology. Water Jet Cutting Machine is the ideal machine for cutting a variety of materials and very flexible compared to laser machines and plasma.

40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), {{working for}} the United States Department of Energy (DOE), has {{conducted}} a preliminary evaluation of the potential of very low fuel input capacity Simplex type pressure atomizing nozzles for use with oil burners designed for residential boilers, furnaces and water heaters. These nozzles under suitable conditions can be sufficiently reliable to enable new heating system designs. This would allow {{for the design of}} heating appliances that match the smaller load demands of energy efficient homes built with modern components and architectural systems designed to minimize energy use. When heating systems are installed with excessive capacity, oversized by three to four times the load, the result is a loss of up to ten percent as compared to the rated appliance efficiency. The use of low capacity nozzles in systems designed to closely match the load can thereby result in significant energy savings. BNL investigated the limitations of low flow rate nozzles and designed long-term experiments to see if ways could be determined that would be beneficial to long-term operation at low input capacities without failures. In order to maximize the potential for success the best possible industry practices available were employed. Low flow rate nozzles primarily fail by blockage or partial blockage of internal fuel flow passages inside the nozzle. To prevent any contaminants from entering the nozzle BNL investigated the geometry and critical dimensions and the current sate of the art of fuel filter design. Based on this investigation it was concluded that the best available filters should be more than capable of filtering contaminants from the fuel prior to entering the oil burner itself. This position was indeed validated based on the long-term trials conducted under this study no evidence resulted to change our position. It is highly recommended that these filters rated at 10 microns and with large filter capacity (surface area), should be used with all oil burner installations. The other possible failure mode had been attributed to fuel degradation and this became the main focus of the evaluation. The degradation of fuel usually occurs faster under higher temperature conditions. To preclude this as much as possible controls that provided for a post-purge of combustion airflow after burner shut down were selected. This provided {{a short period of time}} where the burner's combustion air blower continues to operate after the flame has gone out. This tends to cool the nozzle and in turn the fuel inside the small flow pathways inside the nozzle components. This study concludes that the use of low capacity nozzles is possible but only when the temperature and thermal mass environment of the combustion chamber result in a relatively ''cool'' condition. This was accomplished in one long-term experiment that essentially operated for a full heating season equivalent with no evidence of nozzle plugging or failure. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>body</b> surface temperature was kept at or below 150 F during the duration of the trial. On the other hand, a second system was studied that ended in a partial nozzle blockage and a system failure. In this ''hot environment'' system the <b>nozzle</b> <b>body</b> temperature reached 210 F. This occurred at close to a full heating season equivalent, yet it still would have resulted in a no-heat complaint by the homeowner...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{new knowledge}} about physical and numerical modelling of a non-stationary steel flow into a mould through a subentry shroud with an inner, pressed metering nozzle. The physical and numerical modelling was realized under {{the conditions of}} the Department of Metallurgy and Foundry at VSB-Technical University of Ostrava. A special type of the subentry shroud is used during continuous casting of steel in Tøinecké `elezárny, a. s. During continuous casting of steel, two unfavourable phenomena were observed. In the first case, {{it was not possible to}} increase the casting speed, though the diameter of the metering nozzle was extended. In the second case, a fluctuation of the casting speed among individual casting strands was detected. These two problems did not allow an improvement of the performance of the casting machine. Therefore, the physical and numerical modelling was performed. Attention was focused on the verification of the effect of the inner diameter of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>body</b> and internal diameter of the metering nozzle on the resulting volume flow rates. Four diameters of the metering nozzle – (16; 17; 17. 5; 18) mm – were tested. The physical modelling was done on a 1 : 1 model constructed from Plexiglas. The numerical modelling was realized in the ANSYS FLUENT software. On the basis of the results of the modelling study and in cooperation with the VESUVIUS company, a new type of the profile of the subentry shroud with a metering nozzle was designed. The first experimental results in the steel plant led to an increase in the productivity of the continuous-casting machine. Web of Science 47681480...|$|E
40|$|Described {{here is the}} {{development}} of a flexible simulation model for scramjet hypersonic propulsion systems. The primary goal is determination of sensitivity of the thrust vector and other system parameters to angle of attack changes of the vehicle. Such information is crucial in design and analysis of control system performance for hypersonic vehicles. The code is also intended to be a key element in carrying out dynamic interaction studies involving the influence of vehicle vibrations on propulsion system/control system coupling and flight stability. Simple models are employed to represent the various processes comprising the propulsion system. A method of characteristics (MOC) approach is used to solve the forebody and external nozzle flow fields. This results in a very fast computational algorithm capable of carrying out the vast number of simulation computations needed in guidance, stability, and control studies. The three-dimensional fore- and aft <b>body</b> (<b>nozzle)</b> geometry is characterized by the centerline profiles as represented by a series of coordinate points and body cross-section curvature. The engine module geometry is represented by an adjustable vertical grid to accommodate variations of the field parameters throughout the inlet and combustor. The scramjet inlet is modeled as a two-dimensional supersonic flow containing adjustable sidewall wedges and multiple fuel injection struts. The inlet geometry including the sidewall wedge angles, the number of injection struts, their sweepback relative to the vehicle reference line, and strut cross-section are user selectable. Combustion is currently represented by a Rayleigh line calculation including corrections for variable gas properties; improved models are being developed for this important element of the propulsion flow field. The program generates (1) variation of thrust magnitude and direction with angle of attack, (2) pitching moment and line of action of the thrust vector, (3) pressure and temperature distributions throughout the system, and (4) performance parameters such as thrust coefficient, specific impulse, mass flow rates, and equivalence ratio. Preliminary results are in good agreement with available performance data for systems resembling the NASP vehicle configuration...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{definition}} of an accurate mathematical model of a production common-rail-type injector for automotive diesel engines. The mathematical model defined in a previous work was refined, accounting for {{a broader range of}} effects on injector performance, thus allowing a more strict validation of the model predictions against experimental data. The geometry of the control-valve holes, crucial in determining the actual discharge coefficient, was accurately evaluated by means of silicone molds. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as control valve, needle, and pressure rod were modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme. The axial deformation under pressure of needle, pressure rod, <b>nozzle</b> and injector <b>body</b> was modeled. This effect was found to also affect the control valve device operation, and was properly accounted for. The model obtained was implemented in Simulink; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of the numerical differentiation formulas implicit scheme of second-order accuracy, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. In order to obtain sufficient data for validating the model in its entire operation field, two separate sets of tests were carried out. In the first analysis, a constant reference pressure was imposed in the rail, and the injector energizing time was progressively increased from values relative to small pilot injections to values characteristic of large main injections. The injected volume per stroke was measured by means of a mean delivery meter (EMI) device. During the second set of tests, the injector was mounted on a flow rate meter (EVI) device so as to measure the injection law. Electric current flowing through the injector solenoid, oil pressure in the common rail, and at the injector inlet, needle, and control valve lift were also gauged and recorded. The good agreement between numerical and experimental results allowed the use of the model to gain greater insight into the mechanisms and phenomena that regulate injector behavior. The nozzle hole discharge coefficient dependence upon time and needle lift was discussed, and the trends were presented in several working conditions. The flow in the control volume holes was studied, in order to determine whether cavitation occurs or not, giving an answer to a long disputed topic. Finally, the effects of injector deformation caused by fuel pressure on performance were investigate...|$|R

In this paper the authors present the results of surface topography measurements of precise surface assemblies of some fuel injectors. The measurements have been made with the atomic force microscope (AFM) NT- 206. The results of surface topography measurements were presented in the form of 2 D and 3 D images and also as surface roughness profiles in some selected cross-sections of the investigated surfaces. It has been also shown cumulative roughness height distribution and roughness height distribution as well as Minkowski volume (first Minkowski functional). After scanning the surface on the atomic force microscope, the obtained data were processed with the SurfaceXplorer ® 1. 311 and Gwyddion 2. 35 software. The study concerned some new injector nozzles and also injector nozzles after a certain time of operation. The side and the conical precise surface assembly of the injector <b>nozzle</b> <b>body</b> and needle were tested. The atomic force microscope NT- 206 allows to perform a surface scan of the sample with maximum dimensions of 32 x 32 Pm and a maximum height of roughness ± 1 Pm.
