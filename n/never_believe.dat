Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> {{that a man who}} understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about." ...|$|E

The episode was directed by David Nutter. As Morgan and Wong explained, their episode was written in response to criticisms of the show's initially limited characterization of Scully. Wong said, [...] "Gillian Anderson needed to show off her talents more, {{and this was a}} perfect opportunity to dispel those notions that Scully will <b>never</b> <b>believe.</b> It was time for the character to grow, because she was just doing {{the same kind of thing}} too often."

500|$|McMahon {{commented that}} the SIS {{had a history of}} [...] "furnish {{unreliable}} information on the IRA's foreign intrigues." [...] Yet, these past failures were ignored as the reports reinforced the fears of invasion. MaMahon suggested that [...] "It is even possible that the plans discovered in Holland were planted. Whether deliberate deception or not, British intelligence was well and truly deceived." [...] Historian Eunan O'Halpin argued that while the Dutch document could be seen as a British fabrication, [...] "it is now known... that German deception operations prepared in anticipation of Operation 'Sealion' included the manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack Ireland as a feint during the build up to an invasion of Southern England." [...] Nicholas Mansergh commented that [...] "Ireland had no place" [...] in the initial Sealion plans, and it was not until 3 December 1940 that German planners even looked at the possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure. In his memoirs, Carton De Wiart commented [...] "I can <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> the Germans had any intention of invading Ireland but I am very grateful for any reason which sent us there, for it was an ideal training ground for troops and the division improved enormously from the moment of our arrival." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{sheet music}} {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] {{is written in}} common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Set in the key of A major, it follows the basic chord progression of A–E–D for the verse and A–E–Fm–D progression for the chorus, while Gaga's voice spans from A3 to D5 Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen hence she ultimately asked Clarence Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument. Clemons told Rolling Stone that in January 2011, he was contacted by Gaga's management and {{they wanted him to}} play on Born This Way. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that he could record it on the coming Monday or Tuesday, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. Clemons flew from Florida to New York, and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "The Edge of Glory". She simply told Clemons, [...] "We'll put the tape on and you just play". The recording concluded by 3 a.m. after a few takes.

Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the coming week, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'".

2500|$|Born of English {{parents in}} Ireland, Jonathan Swift {{was working as}} Sir William Temple's {{secretary}} {{at the time he}} composed A Tale of a Tub (1694–1697). [...] The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good [...] "living" [...] from Temple or Temple's influence. [...] There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's Letters. [...] Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. [...] Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.|$|E
2500|$|The modernist critic Yuly Aykhenvald, {{analyzing}} the cliché formula that bonded [...] "Maykov, Polonsky and Fet" [...] into a solid group of similar-minded authors, alleged that Maykov [...] "to {{a lesser extent}} {{than the other two}} freed himself from the habit of copying classics" [...] and [...] "in his earlier works was unoriginal, producing verse that shone with reflected light." [...] Not even his passionate love for classics could help the author submerge [...] "wholly into the pagan element," [...] the critic opined.He was a scholar of antiquity and his gift, self-admittedly [...] "has been strengthened by being tempered in the fire of science." [...] As a purveyor of classicism, his very soul was not deep or naive enough to fully let this spirit in or embrace the antique idea of intellectual freedom. Poems, inhabited by naiads, nymphs, muses and dryads, are very pretty, and you can't help being enchanted by these ancient fables. But he gives you no chance to forget for a moment that – what for his ancient heroes was life itself, for him is only a myth, a 'clever lie' he could <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> himself.|$|E
2500|$|In the season's {{final game}} at Chicago, Curtis was disqualified {{early in the}} game on grounds of {{unnecessary}} roughness. Early in the game, Chicago quarterback Walter Eckersall, considered {{the best player in the}} West, dropped back for a punt from Chicago's 40-yard line, and Curtis broke through and threw Eckersall to the frozen ground as he tried to block the kick. Eckersall lay on the ground knocked out for two minutes following the blow. The referee ruled that Curtis had swung an upper cut at Eckersall's jaw and ruled Curtis out of the game. [...] A newspaper account of the incident reported that, after Eckersall had gotten the punt safely away, Curtis, who had broken through, [...] "came down on the little maroon like a whirlwind, knocking him down." [...] Without Curtis in the lineup, Michigan lost its first game since 1900, losing to Chicago by a score of 2 to 0. After the game, Yost observed, [...] "Michigan's chances were materially lessened when Curtis went out." [...] The ruling ejecting Curtis from the Chicago game became a source of controversy. Eckersall himself spoke in defense of Curtis:"I will <b>never</b> <b>believe</b> that Curtis intended to rough it with me in that unfortunate incident in the Michigan game. He was doing his best to block the punt, but could not stop in time to keep from running me down. I have known Curtis for several years, and he is a gentleman and one of the best sportsmen I have ever met. I feel that he has been unjustly censured for the play in which I was injured and for which he was ruled out of the game." ...|$|E
