50|$|Mr. and Mrs. Tutton {{were charged}} and convicted of {{criminal}} act manslaughter by failing {{their duty to}} provide the necessaries of life for their child, contrary to the criminal negligence provision s. 219 of the Criminal Code (then s. 202). Based on a belief held by the couple {{that the child was}} cured of its diabetes because of a premonition Mrs. Tutton purported to have, they ceased to give their child his daily insulin shots. As a result, the child died shortly thereafter. On appeal by the couple, the Court of Appeal held that, inter alia, the trial judge had erred in that he did not charge the jury that an omission arising under a <b>negligence</b> <b>offence</b> would require the proof of a subjective element of Mens Rea - namely, that the jury was satisfied that the couple knew that there was a risk to the life or safety of their child, and unjustifiably took that risk or closed their minds to any such risk. On appeal to the Supreme Court, their Justiceships took three separate approaches on what the test for criminal negligence should be.|$|E
40|$|Faith healing deaths occur {{infrequently}} in Canada, {{but when}} they do they pose a considerable challenge for criminal justice. Similar to caregivers who absent-mindedly and fatally forget {{a child in a}} hot vehicle, faith healers do not intentionally harm their children. It can seem legally excessive and unjust to prosecute achingly bereaved parents. But unlike ‘hot-car’ deaths, faith healing parents are not absent minded in the deaths they cause. Rather, significant deliberation and strength of will is necessary to treat their child’s ailment with faith alone. Two different Criminal Code provisions can be brought to bear upon these deaths, namely, s. 215 ‘Failing to provide the necessaries of life’ and s. 219 ‘Criminal negligence’. From a public, medical, and scientific perspective treating potentially fatal ailments with ‘faith’ and ‘prayer’ seems like reckless endangerment, giving apparent justification to the more serious criminal negligence charge. But, the fault element in the criminal <b>negligence</b> <b>offence</b> continues to be a vexing issue in Canadian jurisprudence. People accused of negligence-based offences are commonly held to the standard of what a reasonable person might predictably have done in similar circumstances. While it is unnecessary for the impartial trier of fact to conceive of faith healing as ‘reasonable’, it is an open question whether faith healers are sufficiently unreasonable to warrant serious criminal condemnation and possible incarceration when their course of action causes death. Is it justifiable to think of faith healers who cause death as criminally unreasonable? That is, do they depart markedly enough from the standard that criminal negligence is rightly attributed to them? Public attitudes toward religion, religious fundamentalism, and healthcare must be considered when trying to discern what a reasonable person does when treating an ailing child at risk of death...|$|E
5000|$|The {{provisions}} of section 2(2) clarify that section 2(1) {{does not apply}} where the liability has not been [...] "accepted or established to pay compensation for a wrongful act or omission". This avoids the criminal law being a default liability for civil proceedings. Thus, if X lies about an accident to avoid a claim of <b>negligence,</b> no <b>offence</b> is committed. The claimant can commence civil proceedings once the deception is discovered (CLRC, Thirteenth Report, para 16).|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. The year 1999 {{was one of}} {{the worst}} in as many years in terms of the number of {{disciplinary}} cases adjudicated over by the Directorate Labour Relations at the Gauteng Department of Education (hereafter referred to as GDE). A total number of 395 disciplinary cases were lodged with the GDE between 1999 and 2000 and these were serious charges such as: fraud, theft, insubordination, corporal punishment, <b>negligence</b> to sexual <b>offences</b> (Annexure A, GDE Internal Memo, 2001). This situation is not unique to the Gauteng Province only but is even worse in other provinces, where communities have gone on the rampage accusing some educators of impregnating their children, not providing quality education for their children and mismanagement of school funds. (Sapa. 2002. Natal Witness 23 January 2002, p 1. Thompson K. 2000. The Citizen 7 August 2000, p 9. Shillinger K, 2002. Mail and Guardian. 15 November to 21 November 2002, pp 2 - 3.) Ms. Patricia Boikanyo, a spokesperson for the North West Education Department reported that about 133 cases were lodged with her department between the period 2000 to 2002. She further indicated that about 34 educators had been expelled in the same period for crimes ranging from murder, attempted murder, assault, selling examination reports, absenteeism, neglecting duties, intimidation and pointing a firearm. She also reported that about 13 educators were expelled for having sexual relationships with learners, and some of these victims were junior primary school learners (Mfoloe M. 2003. Sowetan, 25 March 2003, p 6). The media on the other hand launched a scathing attack on the Department of Education (hereafter referred to as DOE) for not dealing decisively with educators who continuously disregard the law. “Rape is largely a risk-free activity, says an internal government study. And the rape of Angela (not her 1 real name) once again reveals a disturbing pattern of contempt for the victims, complacency in the justice system, and negligence on the part of those responsible for protecting society’s most vulnerable member’s ” (Shillinger, 2002 : 2 - 3.) “Thirteen year old Dudu Khumalo (not her real name) has been failed by the system. Teacher Manalla Msetho (not his real name) has been accused of rape. ” (Shillinger, 2002 : 2 - 3.) (Mfoloe, 2003 : 6). These are some of the stories carried in the media. The DOE on the other hand embarked on a process of amending the E of EA to include a new section 17 acts of misconduct which carried a mandatory sanction of dismissal when found guilty. This was largely as a response to the many concerns raised by not only the media but also all the stakeholders within the education sector. Prof. T. C. Bisschof...|$|R
