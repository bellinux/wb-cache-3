Bragg soon realized that the new infantry recruits he had sought from Kentucky would not be forthcoming, though many were willing to join the cavalry, and that he lacked the logistical support he needed {{to remain in the}} state. He made his way southeast to Knoxville, Tennessee, through the Cumberland Gap. Bragg was quickly called to the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia, to explain to Jefferson Davis the charges brought by his officers about how he had conducted his campaign, who were demanding that he be replaced as head of the army. Although Davis decided to leave the general in command, Bragg's relationship with his subordinates would be severely damaged. Upon rejoining the army, he ordered a movement to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.|$|E
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great." [...] He {{thought that it was}} indicative of an overall upward trend in the quality of Veronica Mars and praised the episode's balance between the case-of-the-week and the Dean O'Dell story arc. [...] "Like last week's episode, 'There's Got to Be a Morning After Pill' benefited from integrating already established characters into a mystery of the week." [...] He was positive towards the mystery of the week in general, stating that it made him realize {{that it was possible to}} make good episodes with only a stand-alone mystery. However, he was critical of the development of Veronica and Logan's relationship, particularly Logan's new character traits. [...] "Let's just hope they don't get back together again <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> <b>or</b> anytime soon, because this horse has been beaten to death as it is." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend was positive towards the episode, calling it [...] "jam-packed with drama".

500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows {{all he has to}} do is keep his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility he might be able to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

On 3 April, Powell said in the Commons that the time for inquests on the government's failure to protect the Falkland Islands would come later and that although it was right to put the issue before the United Nations, Britain should not wait upon that organisation to deliberate but use forceful action now. He then turned to face Thatcher: [...] "The Prime Minister, shortly after she came into office, received a sobriquet as the [...] "Iron Lady".

Thus, he undertook the seemingly impossible [...] voyage to Timor, the nearest European settlement. [...] Bligh succeeded in reaching Timor after a 47-day voyage, the only casualty being the crewman killed on Tofua. From 4 May until 29 May, {{when they reached the}} Great Barrier Reef, the 18 men lived on [...] of bread per day. The weather was often stormy, and they were in constant fear of foundering due to the boat's heavily laden condition. On 29 May they landed on a small island off the coast of Australia, which they named Restoration Island, 29 May 1660 being the date of the restoration of the British monarchy. Over the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more they island-hopped north along the Great Barrier reef—while Bligh, cartographer as always, sketched maps of the coast. Early in June they passed through the Endeavour Strait and sailed again on the open sea until they reached Coupang, a settlement on Timor, on 15 June 1789. Several of the men who survived this ordeal with him soon died of sickness, possibly malaria, in the pestilential Dutch East Indies port of Batavia, the present-day Indonesian capital of Jakarta, as they waited for transport to Britain.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of citalopram added to typical antipsychotic for the treatment of negative symptoms of inpatients with schizophrenia disorder in Ahvaz Golestan hospital. Subjects and Methods: Forty inpatients suffering from schizophrenia disorder (DSM-IV-TR) were recruited for a randomized double blind clinical trial. Depression was ruled out by Hamilton Depression Questionnaire. They were randomly assigned to either citalopram (20 mg for first week and 40 mg for <b>next</b> <b>weeks)</b> <b>or</b> placebo added on while the typical antipsychotic was continued. The efficacy of drugs was assessed weekly with PANSS scale during 6 weeks. Results: Mean age was 37 / 22 years and 60 % (n= 24) were male. Citalopram did not improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients compared to placebo. Citalopram improved general psychopathology symptoms and total PANSS. Conclusion: Citalopram improved general psychopathology symptoms and total PANSS. Adding citalopram on typical antipsychotic treatment did not improve negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia disorder.

Global data are needed to understand the behaviour of the Earth’s atmosphere and its interaction with the land and oceans - whether it be to predict <b>next</b> <b>week’s</b> weather <b>or</b> <b>next</b> year’s climate, forecasters must have timely, quality-assured, standardized information coming from all corners of the world.

5000|$|Ghost: Rhythms, a 2013 {{of early}} work at Kavi Gupta Gallery, shows the {{influence}} of action painting, Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. Binion pulls stylistic tropes common to folk artists as well, borrowing quilting patterns, layering photographic imagery and motifs and grids. He does all this while using one implement: his characteristic [...] "crayon," [...] or paint stick, which allowed him to move past oil paint. [...] "In 1972 when I started to use them, they were basically industrial marking sticks," [...] he recalls. Binion effectively converts an elementary tool into a refined hand-held instrument. He thrives in the effort of that conversion, having developed an ornate and labored approach that demands strenuous hours, and—as Binion has noted—resonates with the cotton-picking of his childhood. He had to train himself to be ambidextrous to negotiate hand fatigue, and works an entire surface of a painting in one sitting, before returning to rework that surface the <b>next</b> day <b>or</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> month. Some works take years to complete. Depending on how long he lets the paint dry, it becomes more or less malleable, responding to his hand like pigmented, sculptural putty. What results is a mash-up of pointillism.|$|R
