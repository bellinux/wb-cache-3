5|$|In April 1998, the St Germans {{pumping station}} ran at maximum capacity, which was 6134 Ml/d (or 71 tonnes per second), for over 50 hours, and {{this led to}} the {{decision}} to replace it with a brand <b>new</b> <b>installation,</b> with 40% extra capacity. Work started in December 2006, and the pumping station, which is the second largest in Europe, includes a glass wall to enable visitors to see the pumps. The new station was commissioned on 22 April 2010, after which the old station was demolished. A formal opening ceremony was held on 20 April 2011, when the station was opened by Lord James Russell, brother of the Duke of Bedford, and a descendent of the Earl of Bedford who started the process of draining the Fens in the seventeenth century. There are more than one hundred smaller pumping stations scattered throughout the system to maintain the water levels and prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|Windows 8.1 (codenamed Blue) is {{an upgrade}} for Windows 8, a {{computer}} operating system released by Microsoft. First unveiled and released {{as a public}} beta in June 2013, it was released to manufacturing on August 27, 2013, and reached general availability on October 17, 2013, almost {{a year after the}} retail release of its predecessor. Windows 8.1 is available free of charge for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows RT users via the Windows Store. Unlike service packs on previous versions of Windows, users who obtained Windows 8 outside of retail copies or pre-loaded installations (i.e., volume licensing) must obtain Windows 8.1 through <b>new</b> <b>installation</b> media from their respective subscription or enterprise channel. Microsoft's support lifecycle policy treats Windows 8.1 similar to previous service packs of Windows: It is part of Windows 8's support lifecycle, and installing Windows 8.1 is required to maintain access to support and Windows updates after January 12, 2016. However, unlike previous service packs, Windows 8.1 cannot be acquired via Windows Update.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem for}} the {{training}} center was {{the growth of the}} city of San Antonio, which created hazards for training. Consequently, in June 1927 plans were created {{for the construction of a}} single large airfield outside of the city to house all flying training. The United States Congress funded the new field's construction but not the purchase of the land, so the city of San Antonio borrowed the $546,000 needed to purchase the site selected for what became Randolph Field. By the fall of 1931, construction was essentially completed, so the Air Corps Training Center at Duncan Field, San Antonio, Texas adjacent to Kelly Field and the primary schools at Brooks and March moved to the <b>new</b> <b>installation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The AEW.7 version {{would have}} seen the ventral radome {{containing}} the AN/APS-20 radar removed and replaced with a dorsal rotating dome or 'rotodome', similar to that used on the US Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, carrying a newly developed FMICW radar system. To accommodate a <b>new</b> <b>installation</b> {{of the size of the}} rotodome, together with its position right at the rear of the aircraft, the intention was to rebuild the rear fuselage with the single tailfin being substituted by a twin tail arrangement, as well as the wingspan being increased to 60ft (18.3m). The rotodome was designed to be moveable on its installation, able to tip backwards to allow the radar beam to operate clear of interference from the Gannet's propellers, negating the need to replace the Double Mamba with a turbofan engine assembly. In the end, this proposal was not proceeded with.|$|E

25|$|Computer games {{sometimes}} use DRM {{technologies to}} limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them {{to limit the}} number of installations), but can also prove to be a problem if the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or reformatting the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a <b>new</b> <b>installation,</b> making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.|$|E

Critics argued that this change was meant to discourage Windows 10 Pro from being used in business environments, since Microsoft was making it less attractive by reducing the amount of control administrators have over their devices' environment without using an enterprise version of Windows 10.|$|E
500|$|In 1829, {{the federal}} {{government}} purchased 3.5 acres of land on the southeast part of Great Captain Island from Samuel Lyons, prior to the site being selected for a lighthouse.

Completed in 1829, the [...] stone lighthouse was built by Charles H. Smith for $3455.17 and it had a five-room keeper's house. By 1838, it was clear the construction was of poor quality and the walls were cracking. However, the structure remained in use until the new tower was completed in 1868. The original light was composed of 10 lamps with reflectors, but it was upgraded to a fourth Fresnel lens in 1858.
