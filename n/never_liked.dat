5|$|Renoir {{continued}} shooting additional {{scenes with}} some of the actors. The opening scene at the airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport {{in the middle of the}} night with whatever extras they could find. Renoir had almost run out of money when he filmed the car crash scene, which was shot very quickly with Alain Renoir as the camera operator. Renoir <b>never</b> <b>liked</b> the scene and initially removed it. The principal photography was nine and a half weeks over schedule when it was finally wrapped in June.|$|E

On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had <b>never</b> <b>liked</b> him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E

25|$|The main {{proponent of}} using {{ejection}} seats was James Chamberlin, {{head of the}} engineering division of NASA's Space Force Task Group. Chamberlin had <b>never</b> <b>liked</b> the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft {{could get away with}} ejection seats.|$|E

25|$|A 1959 film version, {{produced}} in 70mm Todd-AO by Samuel Goldwyn, was plagued with problems. Rouben Mamoulian, who had directed the 1935 Broadway premiere, {{was hired to}} direct the film, but was subsequently fired in favor of director Otto Preminger after a disagreement with the producer. Mamoulian urged making the film on location in South Carolina after a fire on the sound stage destroyed the film's sets. Goldwyn, who <b>never</b> <b>liked</b> making films on location, considered Mamoulian's request a sign of disloyalty. Robert McFerrin dubbed the singing voice for Sidney Poitier's Porgy as did Adele Addison for Dorothy Dandridge's Bess. Ruth Attaway's Serena and Diahann Carroll's Clara were also dubbed. Although Dandridge and Carroll were singers, their voices were not considered operatic enough. Sammy Davis Jr., Brock Peters and Pearl Bailey (who played Sportin' Life, Crown and Maria) were the only principals who provided their own singing. André Previn's adaptation of the score won him an Academy Award, the film's only Oscar.|$|E
25|$|That same year, Robert F. Kennedy {{was widely}} {{considered}} an impeccable choice {{to run as}} Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had <b>never</b> <b>liked</b> one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn. Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate. Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent {{in the office of}} vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.|$|E
25|$|George and {{his wife}} lived for six years in apartments at the Mikhailovsky palace outside St Petersburg, the {{residence}} of his father Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia. They had two daughters: Princess Nina in 1901 and Princess Xenia in 1903. In 1905, {{the family moved to}} a newly built small palace in the Crimea. Constructed in English style, they gave the property a Greek name, Harax. For nine years the Grand Duke {{and his wife}} led a quiet life. George was a devoted father, but his marriage was a failure. Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna <b>never</b> <b>liked</b> Russia and eventually became estranged from her husband. In June 1914, Maria took her two daughters to England on the pretext of improving her daughters’ health; in reality, she wanted to be separated from her husband. When the war broke out a month after her arrival, the Grand Duchess did not rush back to Russia and later it was too dangerous to attempt a return. Grand Duke George never saw his wife or daughters again.|$|E

500|$|I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You was {{originally}} serialized {{under the title}} Fuck, in issues #26–30 of Yummy Fur, between October 1991 and April 1993.

It was quite planned out, even if I didn't write a full script." ...|$|E
500|$|Alongside Seth's It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken and Joe Matt's The Poor Bastard—works by Brown's Toronto-based {{friends and}} Drawn and Quarterly stablemates—I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You {{is seen as}} a {{prominent}} example of the 1990s autobiographical comics trend. As one of [...] "The Autobiographical Stories from Yummy Fur", it ranked 38th on The Comics Journals list of the top 100 English-language comics of the 20th century. [...] In 2001 Stephen Weiner included I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You in his book The 101 Best Graphic Novels, recommending it to those who enjoy J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{established}} his {{reputation in the}} early alternative comics scene of the 1980s with the surreal, taboo-breaking Ed the Happy Clown. [...] He brought that story {{to an abrupt end}} in 1989 when, excited by the autobiographical comics of Joe Matt and Julie Doucet, he turned towards personal stories. The uncomplicated artwork of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired him to simplify his own. [...] Brown intended I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You as part of a longer work with what became his previous book, The Playboy (1992), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You was the last work of Brown's early autobiographical period.|$|E
500|$|Brown's autobiographical work {{developed}} from {{a scene that}} had been developing since the 1970s and which had reached a peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] Brown's open and self-deprecating example left an impact on cartoonists such as Jeffrey Brown and Ariel Schrag, and his sparse layouts on the likes of Anders Nilsen. [...] Upon the serial's conclusion, reviewer Darcy Sullivan called it [...] "a major step forward for the artist, a leading light in adult comics". [...] American cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez hailed The Playboy and I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You as [...] "probably the best graphic novels next to Maus"; British cartoonist Eddie Campbell called them [...] "the most sensitive comics ever made"; and American comics writer Heidi MacDonald called I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You [...] "a masterpiece" [...] that is [...] "the equal of any 'coming of age' movie".|$|E
500|$|The story gained {{praise from}} fans, critics, and other cartoonists, {{and earned a}} Harvey Award {{nomination}} in 1991 for Best Single Issue or Story. [...] The Playboy, I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You, and several shorter pieces placed No.38 on The Comics Journals list of the best 100 English-language comics of the 20th century as [...] "The autobiographical comics from Yummy Fur". [...] Cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez asserted, [...] "The Playboy and I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You are probably the best graphic novels next to Maus". [...] Critic Frank Young called it a [...] "pivotal work" [...] in the autobiographical comics trend of the early 1990s. [...] Critic Darcy Sullivan considered it required reading {{for those who are}} serious about comics and a [...] "landmark look at an artist's growth", referring to the pace with which Brown's work matured {{over the course of the}} three issues of its serialization.|$|E

500|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher Chris Oliveros saw as stifling comics' growth. These comics had artistic aspirations, and graphic novels became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical [...] and I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You, and Seth's faux-autobiographical It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken garnering considerable attention.|$|E
500|$|I <b>Never</b> <b>Liked</b> You was {{the last}} work from his autobiographical period that started in 1990 with Helder in Yummy Fur #19.

[...] In 2011 Brown returned to autobiography and his relations with women with the graphic novel Paying for It, a polemic arguing for the decriminalization of prostitution.|$|E
