Directed by Alex Zamm and produced by WWE Studios and 20th Century Fox, {{the film has}} a similar plot to the original, but is otherwise <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> {{and none of the}} original cast or characters returned. The lead roles were instead played by Larry the Cable Guy and Santino Marella.|$|E

5|$|The {{stony-iron}} Pallasite meteorites are <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to the Pallas asteroid, being instead {{named after}} the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. The chemical element palladium, on the other hand, was {{named after the}} asteroid, which had been discovered just before the element.|$|E
5|$|Although {{situated}} in an unpopulated area, Wotton station was relatively well used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any {{station on the}} line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although the lines were <b>not</b> <b>connected,</b> a station (also named Wotton) {{was built on the}} new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a stationmaster.|$|E

5|$|An {{interest}} in farming came naturally to William Halliday. Besides teaching, his father, Samuel, farmed successfully in Scotland {{and in the}} United States. Halliday owned a prosperous cotton plantation in Arkansas in addition to several thousand cultivated acres <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> with the model town. The 3500 cultivated acres surrounding the village provided important staples for the town. Forage for the mine mules as well as food for mining families came from company farms. In order to process its own meat, the company operated a slaughterhouse. By using this system the store was able to sell fresh meat at affordable prices.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of Darkness doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Both events, <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> {{publicly}} for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone wrong with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E

5|$|Chester {{station is}} served by the Bloor-Danforth line which {{operates}} between Kennedy and Kipling stations. The station {{was designed to be}} serviced with side platforms as it mainly serves the surrounding neighbourhood. As it is the only station in the system that is <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to a regular bus or streetcar route {{it is one of the}} least used subway stations in Toronto. The 300 Bloor-Danforth Night Bus operates on Danforth from 1:30-5:30 a.m. after the line is shut down for nightly maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four deep level platforms that is <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to any of the others by deep level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E

5|$|Rumors {{spread that}} the strike was weakening. Volunteers and others <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> with the miners {{association}} {{took over the}} mine pumps, which had been abandoned by the miners, {{in order to prevent}} flooding of the tunnels. There were minor acts of violence. The Citizens' Corps prepared for a possible armed confrontation, drilled by those of its members who were Civil War veterans. The group used the mine company store owned by W. W. Scranton as their headquarters, after vacating two other locations because owners feared the presence of the group would attract violence.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{maritime}} fur {{trading in}} the northern Pacific began after the exploration voyages of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov in 1741 and 1742. Their voyages demonstrated that Asia and North America were <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> but that sea voyages were feasible, and that the region was rich in furs. Private fur traders, mostly promyshlenniki, launched fur trading expeditions from Kamchatka, at first focusing on nearby islands such as the Commander Islands. Unlike fur trading ventures in Siberia, these maritime expeditions required more capital than most promyshlenniki could obtain. Merchants from cities such as Irkutsk, Tobolsk, and others in European Russia, became the principal investors.|$|E
5|$|SR56 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route278, and was renumbered SR56 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans in 1964 were to connect SR56 to the north end of SR125 and {{continue}} east to SR67, but these plans did not come to fruition. The eastern end from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club and other community groups. The two ends were <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.|$|E
