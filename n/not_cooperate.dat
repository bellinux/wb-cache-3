5|$|As UN {{air raids}} against the North Koreans intensified, Dean {{was moved to}} Sunan, north of P'yongyang, to a hut where he lived with several guards. They began daily interrogations {{primarily}} aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written condemnation of the UN intervention in Korea, but Dean adamantly refused to do so. Senior North Korean military leaders continued such interrogations through October 1950 but eventually gave up when Dean would <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> and was not intimidated by their threats. Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food {{but he was not}} given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> but he was never actually tortured. Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily. He was kept alone, however, and was never with other American prisoners for the remainder of his confinement. Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography, General Dean's Story. He claimed the North Koreans considered him a war criminal and had many discussions with him about the problems with capitalism in the United States.|$|E

5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did <b>not</b> <b>cooperate.</b> Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|In a flashforward at the prison, Hajj {{brings out}} Reza's brother Hossein Shirazi (Farshad Farahat), and harms him if Reza does <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> in {{providing}} information about Bibi.

As he is investigating, Reza is approached by some of the leaders and accused of stabbing Abbas. A brief argument ensues, but is shortly ended as police begin to ambush the hideout. Abbas hurriedly demands an answer from Reza regarding the betrayer, and Reza is forced to decide which of the revolution leaders stabbed Abbas. In a flashforward, Hajj reveals to Reza that he chose the wrong person, but they were killed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the razing of the Citadel of Saigon, Định organised his local levies into a guerrilla force that initially numbered between 500 and 1000 men, operating out of Thuan Kieu. They were armed with bladed spears, fire lances, knives, sabres, bamboo sticks and swords, trained and on call as necessary. As a local notable who was respected for his leadership and military ability, Định naturally assumed a lead role in the partisan movement that responded to Tự Đức's appeals for popular resistance against European aggression. In the initial phase of the conflict, the local militias concentrated on evacuating the populace from areas that had {{been taken over by}} the French, while urging those who chose to stay to <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> with the Europeans. Snipers were deployed into French areas to assassinate isolated soldiers.|$|E

5|$|On April 24, 1861, Morton {{addressed}} {{a special session}} of the Indiana General Assembly to obtain the legislature's approval to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops. Morton also urged Indiana's legislators to set aside party considerations {{for the duration of}} the war and unite in defense of the Union, but the Republicans and Democrats did <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> for long. Initially, the Democratic-controlled legislature was supportive of Morton's measures and passed the legislation he requested. After the state legislature adjourned in May, however, some of the state's prominent Democrats changed their opinion about the war. In January 1862 the Democrats clarified their position at a state convention chaired by Thomas Hendricks. Indiana's Democrats stated that their support for the integrity of the Union and the war effort, but opposed emancipation of black and the abolition of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> in feeding, {{at least}} not in a strict sense. All such reports are based on {{misunderstanding}} of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|The premier night fighter aces in the RAF—Cunningham, Braham and Branse Burbridge—did not {{appreciate}} press attention. In {{the case of}} Cunningham and Burbridge, this may have stemmed from deeper religious convictions about combat and killing. Burbridge became a priest {{during the war and}} both he and Cunningham did <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> with biographers when approached to have their exploits described in print after the war. During the war, Braham also actively shunned the lime-light. One of the country's best-selling newspapers, the Daily Express, asked to interview him but he declined. Much to Braham's embarrassment, his father gave interviews about his then famous son in 1943. When no stories were forthcoming, the newspapers soon lost interest. Braham and Cunningham were certainly aware of each other {{as a result of the}} press attention, and a competitive rivalry developed. In his book Scramble, Braham mentioned with pride the night he surpassed Cunningham's score permanently.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on 20 July, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. His command was reinforced by several more light tanks from the 1st Cavalry Division. As the tanks fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces. Unable to turn back, Dean and his party attempted to retreat to American lines on their own, but 35 days later, alone and lost in the hills, Dean was captured by North Korean forces. For most of his incarceration, the North Koreans were not aware of his rank. Dean repeatedly attempted to make the North Koreans kill him for fear of divulging information under torture. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> but he was never actually tortured. Eventually his rank was uncovered, but they were unable to gather any intelligence from him.|$|E

5|$|In 1454, the Prussian Confederation, an {{alliance}} of Prussian cities and nobility opposed to the increasingly oppressive rule of the Teutonic Knights, asked King Casimir to take over Prussia and initiated an armed uprising against the Knights. Casimir declared a war on the Order and the formal incorporation of Prussia into the Polish Crown; those events led to the Thirteen Years' War of 1454-66. The mobilization of the Polish forces (the pospolite ruszenie) was weak at first, since the szlachta would <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> without concessions from Casimir that were formalized in the Statutes of Nieszawa promulgated in 1454. This prevented a takeover of all of Prussia, but in the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466, the Knights had to surrender the western half of their territory to the Polish Crown (the areas known afterwards as Royal Prussia, a semi-autonomous entity), and to accept Polish-Lithuanian suzerainty over the remainder (the later Ducal Prussia). Poland regained Pomerelia, with its access to the Baltic Sea, as well as Warmia. In addition to land warfare, naval battles took place in which ships provided by the City of Danzig (Gdańsk) successfully fought Danish and Teutonic fleets.|$|E

He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Young Turks' press conference, Taylor privately met Khánh at the latter's office. He complained about the {{dissolution}} of the HNC and said it did not accord with the values of the alliance and the loyalty Washington expected of Saigon. He added that the US could <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> with two governments at once: a military regime that held power while a civilian body took the responsibility. Khánh testily replied that Vietnam was not a satellite of the US and compared the situation to the US support of the successful coup against Diệm, saying that loyalty was meant to be reciprocated. Khánh had hinted that he felt the Americans were about to have him deposed like Diệm, who was then assassinated, but this rankled Taylor, who had argued against the regime change. Taylor then bemoaned Khánh, saying he had lost confidence in the Vietnamese officer, recommending Khánh resign and go into exile. He also said military supplies currently being shipped to Vietnam would be withheld after arriving in Saigon and that American help in planning and advising military operations would be suspended.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do <b>not</b> <b>cooperate</b> with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E
