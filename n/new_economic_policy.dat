5|$|Stalin's early {{policies}} {{pushed for}} rapid industrialisation, nationalisation of private {{industry and the}} collectivisation of private plots created under Lenin's <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy.</b> As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge, a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution. Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, but were repulsed by the Soviets in December. On Stalin's orders, the USSR launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany. Stalin died in March 1953, his death triggered a power struggle in which Nikita Khrushchev after several years emerged victorious against Georgy Malenkov.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> (NEP). The National Culture Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E

5|$|Through the {{intervention}} of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy,</b> which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and {{was seen as an}} ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks. While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{banning of}} their paper, the Golos Truda group {{continued}} on, however, and issued a final edition {{in the form of}} a journal, in Petrograd and Moscow in December 1919. During the <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> period (1921–1928), it released a number of works, including the publication of the collected works of pre-eminent anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin from its bookstore and publishing house in Petrograd between 1919 and 1922. What little anarchist activity the regime tolerated ended in 1929, after the accession of Joseph Stalin, and the bookshops of the Golos Truda group in Moscow and Petrograd were closed permanently amidst an abrupt and violent wave of repression. The newspaper was also suppressed by the Post Office Department in the United States, where it was succeeded by the widely circulated Khleb i Volya (Bread and Freedom), first published on February 26, 1919, which in turn was banned from the United States and Canada for its anarchist position.|$|E
5|$|Federation brought {{heightened}} tensions {{including a}} conflict with Indonesia as well continuous conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula which escalates to the Sarawak Communist Insurgency and Second Malayan Emergency together with several other {{issues such as the}} cross border attacks into North Borneo by Moro pirates from the southern islands of the Philippines, Singapore being expelled from the Federation in 1965, and racial strife. This strife culminated in the 13 May race riots in 1969. After the riots, the controversial <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputera. Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s. The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects were completed, such as the Petronas Towers, the North–South Expressway, the Multimedia Super Corridor, and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya. However, in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets.|$|E

5|$|Lenin's Bolshevik {{government}} initially shared {{power with}} the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty with the Central Powers and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the market-orientated <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy.</b> Several non-Russian nations secured independence after 1917, but three re-united with Russia through {{the formation of the}} Soviet Union in 1922. In increasingly poor health, Lenin expressed opposition to the growing power of his successor, Joseph Stalin, before dying at his dacha in Gorki.|$|E
5|$|Race is a {{significant}} force in politics, and many political parties are ethnically based. Affirmative actions such as the <b>New</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> and the National Development Policy which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment. There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles. Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party {{with the support of}} UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This is a study of India's major cities {{and how they are}} faring under the conditions of contemporary globalisation. This contemporary globalisation {{is a part of the}} economic globalisation that took place in India especially after 1991, when the <b>new</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> were incorporated. These <b>new</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> were targeted at making India integrate into the larger world economy by introducing more open trade. The sectors that received major attention under the new policies were industrial and the services sector as a whole with particular emphasis on producer services (banking and insurance). As a result of liberalisation and privatisation of these sectors many new producer services firms came up in major Indian cities. Therefore, the main focus is on the inter-city relations based upon the type of advance producer services firms that are operating from these cities. Also it looks at the nodes that the major Indian cities form in larger world city network...|$|R

They present similarities in terms of restructuring their economy and adopting <b>new</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies,</b> given that the main causes of the crisis have been originally embedded within their economic structures themselves. The differences among these patterns, however, concern their response toward international help, especially the IMF, {{as a means to}} save their falling economy. ...|$|R
