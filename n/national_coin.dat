50|$|The Company's directors, {{sitting in}} Amsterdam, adopted {{a unit of}} account system, based on a {{notional}} guilder, divided into 20 notional stuivers. This followed Dutch practice, and reflected the tendency for coins to get debased over time, and hence the nominal value of a given weight of silver to increase. The rijksdaalder, with 25.7 g actual silver weight, was declared the Dutch <b>national</b> <b>coin</b> in 1606, and valued at 47 stuivers, a rate increased to 48 stuivers in 1608. The stuiver and two stuiver coins had a slightly lower silver weight than implied by this conversion rate, reflecting their utility as small change. The weight of silver equal to one guilder unit {{was derived from the}} value in stuivers of the weight of the rijksdaalder coin. This accounting practice correctly reflected inflation over time. However the VOC's accounting guilder of 20 stuivers was fixed at the 1608 valuation of the 25.7g rijksdaalder at 48 stuiver.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} production, supply, and {{circulation}} of <b>national</b> gold <b>coins</b> in Brazil {{in the eighteenth}} century. New estimates have been provided {{of the volume of}} production of these gold coins at Mints of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and Minas Gerais. Comparing the values of this coinage with remittances to Lisbon, {{the first half of the}} eighteenth century reveals a more stable conjuncture than the second half. This latter period shows fluctuations that were expressed in the faster growth of the supply, despite the fall that took place in the production-coinage of gold. Our conclusions question the historiographical theses about the shortage of currency in Brazil throughout the Eighteenth Century. The growth of the economy from the last quarter of the Century onwards implied an increase in the demand for money, which may explain the increase in the supply of <b>national</b> gold <b>coins...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro coins in 2002 presented a unique opportunity to study the crossborder migration and the mixing process of coins in different euro-area countries. This note analyses how many euro coins flow from and into Germany and which composition of coins is to be expected in the long run. A simple model of coin migration is formulated and calibrated for Q 1 coins. The ratio of German coins circulating in Germany is likely to settle around 50 %if past growth of coin volumes continues. In contrast to banknotes, allocation of coin seigniorage depends on <b>national</b> <b>coin</b> issuance. Different national growth rates of coin volumes have important implications for coin seigniorage. Euro coins; mixing process; seigniorage. ...|$|E
