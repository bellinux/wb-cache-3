5000|$|Hydrocarbons (HC) - A {{class of}} burned or {{partially}} burned fuel, hydrocarbons are toxins. Hydrocarbons {{are a major}} contributor to smog, which can be a major problem in urban areas. Prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons contributes to asthma, liver disease, lung disease, and cancer. Regulations governing hydrocarbons vary according to type of engine and jurisdiction; in some cases, [...] "non-methane hydrocarbons" [...] are regulated, while in other cases, [...] "total hydrocarbons" [...] are regulated. Technology for one application (to meet a <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> standard) may not be suitable for use in an application that has to meet a total hydrocarbon standard. Methane is not directly toxic, but is more difficult to break down in a catalytic converter, so in effect a [...] "non-methane hydrocarbon" [...] regulation can be considered easier to meet. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, interest is rising in how to eliminate emissions of it. HC emissions can come not only from a vehicle's engine buts also directly from the fuel tank and lines, 24 hours a day, even when the engine is off; the complex system of fuel vent lines and a charcoal canister is meant to collect and contain fuel vapors and route them either back to the fuel tank or, after the engine is started and warmed up, into the air intake to be burned in the engine.|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{and its effects}} on the ecosystem {{has been a source of}} concern for many environmental pollution organizations in the world. In particular climatologists who are not directly involved in petroleum industry sometimes express concerns about the environmental impacts of gas emissions from flaring at well heads. For environmental and resource conservation reasons, flaring should always be minimized as much as practicable and consistent with safety considerations. However, any level of flaring has a local environmental impact, as well as producing emissions which have the potential to contribute to the global warming. In the present research the Industrial Source Complex (ISCST 3) Dispersion Model is used to calculate the ground level concentrations of two selected primary pollutants (i. e. methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> emitted due to flaring in all of Kuwait Oilfields. In additional, the performance of the ISCST 3 model is assessed, by comparing the model prediction with the observed concentration of methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> obtained from the monitoring sites. The described model evaluation is based on the comparison of 50 highest daily measured and predicted concentrations of methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The overall conclusion of this comparison is that the model predictions are in good agreement with the observed data (accuracy range of 60 - 95 %) from the monitoring stations maintained by the Kuwait Environmental Public Authority (EPA). A specific important conclusion of this study is that, there is a need for a proper emission inventory strategy for Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) as means of monitoring and minimizing the impact of methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> released because of flaring activities...|$|R

40|$|Troposphere {{ozone layer}} {{acts as a}} shield against all {{ultraviolet}} radiation approaching the planet Earth through absorption. It was noticed in mid 80 s that ozone layer has thinned on the poles of the planet due to release of man-made substances commonly known as Ozone Depleting Substances, (ODS) into its atmosphere. The consequences of this change are adverse as the harmful radiations reach {{to the surface of}} the earth, strongly influencing the crops yield and vegetation. These radiations are major cause of skin cancer that has long exposure to Ultra Violet (UV) radiation. United States environmental protection agency and European community have imposed strict regulations to curb the emission of ODS and phase out schedules for the manufacture and use of ODS that was specified by Montreal protocol in 1987. Problem statement: This research deled with data analysis of ozone layer thickness obtained from Abu-Dhabi station and detailed measurement of air pollution levels in Kuwait. Approach: The ozone layer thickness in stratosphere had been correlated with the measured pollution levels in the State of Kuwait. The influence of import of ozone depletion substances for the last decade had been evaluated. Other factor that strongly affects the ozone layer thickness in stratosphere is local pollution levels of primary pollutants such as total hydrocarbon compounds and nitrogen oxides. Results: The dependency of ozone layer thickness on ambient pollutant levels presented in detail reflecting negative relation of both <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and nitrogen oxide concentrations in ambient air.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} directed {{inspection and}} maintenance (DI&M) measurement program has been conducted at four gas-processing plants in the western United States to identify potential sources of cost-effective opportunities for reducing natural gas losses and methane emissions due to fugitive equipment leaks and avoidable process inefficiencies or wastage. Raw natural gas is predominantly methane but may contain varying amounts of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and impurities or contaminants, such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), nitrogen (N 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water vapor (H 2 O). Losses of natural gas to the atmosphere result in direct emissions of these constituents. Losses of natural gas into flare systems or due to excess fuel consumption result in atmospheric emissions of CO 2 and other combustion products.
