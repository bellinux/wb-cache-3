5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of IPv6 DHCP has evolved into DHCPv6; the need for options {{supporting}} PXE within the new DHCP protocol has been addressed by the 2010 published RFC 5970 (DHCPv6 Options for <b>Network</b> <b>Boot).</b>|$|E
25|$|Apple {{has come}} up with a very similar <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> {{approach}} under the umbrella of the Boot Server Discovery Protocol (BSDP) specification. BSDP v0.1 was initially published by Apple in August 1999 and its last v1.0.8 was published in September 2010.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Network</b> <b>booting</b> is {{the process}} of booting a {{computer}} from a network rather than a local drive. In this paper, a novel intelligent <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> protocol is proposed. It extracts all the states of the clients from their booting requests to their normal operations, which is depicted with a finite state machine. Based on the protocol, an intelligent <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> system is implemented with distributed modules, where the maintenance of the <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> system is automated, such as the preparation of the virtual booting partition for the client, loading and passing the booting parameters, and so on. Experiments are carried out to prove the efficiency of the <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> system...|$|R

5000|$|A {{diskless}} node (or diskless workstation) is a workstation {{or personal}} computer without disk drives, which employs <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> to load its operating system from a server. (A computer {{may also be}} said {{to act as a}} diskless node, if its disks are unused and <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> is used.) ...|$|R
25|$|Today in a PXE {{environment}} {{the client}} architecture detection is rarely {{based on the}} identifiers originally included with the PXE v2.1 specification, instead each computer that will be booting from the network should have set DHCP option 93 to indicate the clientâ€™s architecture. This enables a PXE server to know (at boot time) the exact architecture of the client from the first <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> packet. The client system architecture values are listed (among other PXE parameters) within the 2006 published RFC 4578 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Options for the Intel Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE)).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of computer networks, {{there has been a}} persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate configuration parameters, both retrieved at boot time from one or more network servers. This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> process system interoperability.|$|E

50|$|JumpStart {{consists}} of two main parts: <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> of a system, and then network installation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system is}} <b>booted</b> using PXE <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> and the Windows PE Apply image is loaded.|$|R
5000|$|An XPe device can be {{configured}} to boot from {{a properly}} configured network. Synonymous to CD boot, <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> removes {{the requirement of}} having the physical hard drive {{as well as providing}} the [...] "fresh boot" [...] behavior. One bonus to <b>Network</b> <b>Boot</b> though is the ability to service the already setup image. Once the image is updated the image is simply posted to the RIS Server and once clients are rebooted they will receive the updated image.|$|E
50|$|In addition, it is scriptable and can load COMBOOT and COM32 SYSLINUX extensions. This {{allows for}} {{instance}} {{to build a}} graphical menu for <b>network</b> <b>boot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Z-Net {{firmware}} {{was used}} to allow the system to <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> from a file server over the local area network. It was switched out of the main address space once the system had booted.|$|E

5000|$|... 'dsl-version-initrd.iso': Integrates the normally-separate cloop image {{into the}} initrd image; this allows <b>network</b> <b>booting,</b> using PXE. As a regular toram boot, {{requires}} at least 128mb ram.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s/early 1990s, <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> {{was used to}} save {{the expense of a}} disk drive, because a decently sized harddisk would still cost {{thousands}} of dollars, often equaling the price of the CPU.|$|E

5000|$|Intel AMT - {{lets you}} perform {{hardware}} remote {{control of the}} computer based on Intel vPro platform. Supported features include remote power on/off, cold restart, BIOS control, startup control in text mode, <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> from a local CD or disk image file.|$|E
50|$|The DIP-28 (U1) EPROM for <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> may be 8, 16 or 32 kByte size. This means EPROMs of type 64, 128, 256 kbit (2^10) are compatible, {{like the}} 27C256.|$|R
50|$|NIS+ also manages {{several other}} types of data: NFS mounts (auto_master, auto_home), <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> and other {{parameters}} (bootparams, ethers, netmasks, netgroup, networks, protocols, rpc, services), security access (cred), aliases, and timezone.|$|R
50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>booting</b> {{can be used}} to {{centralize}} management of disk storage, which supporters claim can result in reduced capital and maintenance costs. It can also be used in cluster computing, in which nodes may not have local disks.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{its basic}} {{role was to}} {{implement}} a PXE stack, iPXE can be also used as a <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> manager with limited capabilities for menu-based interaction with end users. iPXE can fetch boot files using multiple network protocols, such as TFTP, NFS, HTTP or FTP.|$|E
50|$|Network booting {{proceeds}} {{similarly to}} Solaris' standard network booting capabilities. A JumpStart and network booting server {{is set up}} on the same local network as the system(s) to be installed. Technically, the <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> and install servers can be separate functions, but they are typically the same system.|$|E
50|$|In {{hardware}} virtualization, virtual machines implement virtual drives as part {{of their}} efforts to emulate the behavior of an actual machine. As with an ordinary computer, a virtual machine needs one virtual drive and one disk image to start up, except when it is performing a <b>network</b> <b>boot.</b> More virtual drives are added as needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>booting,</b> {{shortened}} netboot, is {{the process}} of booting a computer from a network rather than a local drive. This method of booting can be used by routers, diskless workstations and centrally managed computers (thin clients) such as public computers at libraries and schools.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{requiring}} {{the use of}} a boot floppy disk to establish the initial network connection, manufacturers of network cards later embedded the protocol in the BIOS of the interface cards as well as system boards with on-board network adapters, thus allowing direct <b>network</b> <b>booting.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical {{departmental}} Windows XP boot {{image is}} usually {{so large that}} it requires a DVD to store, and may be too large for <b>network</b> <b>booting.</b> Accordingly, it is usually installed on a fixed or removable hard drive kept inside the machine, rather than installed over a network or from a ROM.|$|R
50|$|WDS {{functions}} {{in conjunction with}} the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) to load a miniature edition of Windows known as Windows PE for installation and maintenance tasks. WDS functions as both a storage repository for the PXE <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> images as well as a repository for the actual operating system images to be installed on the target computer.|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary desktop {{personal}} computers generally provide {{an option to}} boot from the network in their BIOS via the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE). Post-1998 PowerPC (G3 - G5) Mac systems can also boot from their firmware to a network disk via NetBoot. [...] Old {{personal computers}} without <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> firmware support can utilize a floppy disk or flash drive containing software to boot from the network.|$|E
5000|$|The slim SCPH-70000 PlayStation 2 model {{does not}} work with PS2 Linux at all, {{due to the lack}} of a hard drive interface, though a very few early models in this {{revision}} had solder pads of an IDE interface on the motherboard that could be used (but required modding of the console, thereby voiding its warranty.) Even so, it is possible to <b>network</b> <b>boot</b> from a PXE server ...|$|E
50|$|However, {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to implement <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> to achieve either of the above advantages - ordinary PCs (with the help of appropriate software) can be configured to download and reinstall their operating systems on (e.g.) a nightly basis, with extra work compared to using shared disk image that diskless nodes boot off.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the design and {{implementation}} of Fellowship, a 300 + CPU, general use computing cluster based on FreeBSD. We address the design features including configuration management, <b>network</b> <b>booting</b> of nodes, and scheduling which make this cluster unique and how FreeBSD helped (and hindered) our e#orts to make this design a reality...|$|R
5000|$|... iPXE {{can act as}} a {{boot loader}} for the Linux kernel, with support for multiboot. For other {{operating}} systems, for example Windows CE, iPXE chain-loads corresponding Microsoft boot loader. Additionally, iPXE is scriptable and can load COMBOOT and COM32 SYSLINUX extensions, which, for example, allows SYSLINUX-based graphical menu capabilities to be available for <b>network</b> <b>booting.</b>|$|R
