50|$|Policy {{conflicts}} are broadly classified into domain-independent and application-specific, where the former, as the names suggest, {{are independent of}} the policy application, and the latter are bound by {{the constraints of the}} application domain. Example application domains that have been considered in the literature include quality of service (QoS) in IP networks, distributed systems, firewall security, and call control in telecommunication <b>networks.</b> <b>Policy</b> conflicts can also be classified according to the time-frame at which they can be detected: static conflicts can be detected through off-line analysis at policy specification time, whereas dynamic conflicts can only be detected when policies are enforced as they depend on {{the current state of the}} managed system. For example, conflicts can occur between policies for dynamically allocating resources and those setting quotas for users or classes of service. As such, automation should be a key aspect of dynamic analysis mechanisms so that the operational impact of a conflict can be kept to a minimum.|$|E

Based on a few assumptions we model this learning task as a minimization problem of a nonlinear least-squares cost function.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimited. <b>Network</b> <b>policies</b> are "traffic regulations" for the networks {{which make up}} the Internet. These are necessary for managing the flow of data, for access control to the network, and for managing the network to achieve other types of quality of service goals. However, with the myriad of different <b>policies</b> and <b>networks,</b> all with varying needs, conflicts can arise between <b>network</b> <b>policies.</b> Detecting and correcting these conflicts can be quite difficult for human administrators. Thus, {{there is a need}} for a theoretically sound method for specifying policy and for automatically detecting policy conflicts. This dissertation presents a path-based policy language that is more comprehensive than earlier languages for describing <b>network</b> <b>policy.</b> The Path- based Policy Language (PPL) is a formal language for constructing models of Internet service and access control. This path-based language is extensible and allows for an unambiguous representation of <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> based on both the static and dynamic attributes of today's networks. To support this language, both a compiler and policy conflict tester were developed. These tools accept <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> specified in PPL, translate them into formal logic, and using a theorem prover to test for policy conflicts. PPL allows for the efficient representation of large networks with its abbreviated path format. This path format allows multiple paths to be represented with one statement. NAN...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{advances}} in network management automation and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are easing <b>network</b> <b>policy</b> management tasks. At the same time, these new technologies create a new mode of failure in the management cycle itself. <b>Network</b> <b>policies</b> are presented in an abstract model at a centralized controller and deployed as low-level rules across network devices. Thus, any software and hardware element in that cycle can be a potential cause of underlying network problems. In this paper, we present and solve a <b>network</b> <b>policy</b> fault localization problem that arises in operating policy management frameworks for a production network. We formulate our problem via risk modeling and propose a greedy algorithm that quickly localizes faulty policy objects in the <b>network</b> <b>policy.</b> We then design and develop SCOUT [...] -a fully-automated system that produces faulty policy objects and further pinpoints physical-level failures which made the objects faulty.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of network programmability enabled by innovations such as active network- ing, SDN and NFV offers tremendous flexibility to program <b>network</b> <b>policies.</b> However, it also poses a new demand to network operators on programming <b>network</b> <b>policies.</b> The motivation of this dissertation is {{to study the}} feasibility of using high-level abstractions to simplify the programming of <b>network</b> <b>policies.</b> First, we propose scenario-based programming, a framework that allows network operators to program stateful <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> by describing example behaviors in representative scenarios. Given these scenarios, our scenario-based programming tool NetEgg automatically infers the controller state {{that needs to be}} maintained along with the rules to process network events and update state. The NetEgg interpreter can execute the generated policy implementation on top of a centralized controller, but also automatically infers flow-table rules that can be pushed to switches to improve throughput. We study a range of policies considered in the literature and report our experience regarding specifying these policies using scenarios. We evaluate NetEgg based on the computational requirements of our synthesis algorithm as well as the overhead introduced by the generated policy implementation. Our results show that our synthesis algorithm can generate policy implementations in seconds, and the automatically generated policy implementations have performance comparable to their hand-crafted implementations. Our preliminary user study results show that NetEgg was able to reduce the programming time of the policies we studied. Second, we propose NetQRE, a high-level declarative language for programming quantitative <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> that require monitoring a stream of network packets. Based on a novel theoretical foundation of parameterized quantitative regular expressions, NetQRE integrates regular-expression-like pattern matching at flow-level as well as application-level payloads with aggregation operations such as sum and average counts. We describe a compiler for NetQRE that automatically generates an efficient implementation from the specification in NetQRE. Our evaluation results demonstrate that NetQRE is expressive to specify a wide range of quantitative <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> that cannot be naturally specified in other systems. The performance of the generated implementations is comparable with that of the manually-optimized low-level code. NetQRE can be deployed in different settings. Our proof-of-concept deployment shows that NetQRE can provide timely enforcement of quantitative <b>network</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Operators make {{hundreds}} of changes to a network’s router and switch configurations every day—a painstaking, errorprone process. If the network configuration could instead encode different forwarding behavior for different network states a priori, a network controller could automatically alter forwarding behavior when conditions change. To enable this capability, we introduce state-based <b>network</b> <b>policies,</b> which describe how a network’s forwarding behavior should change {{in response to}} arbitrary network events. A state-based <b>network</b> <b>policy</b> comprises many tasks, each of which encodes the forwarding behavior for a single network management operation (e. g., intrusion detection) {{or part of the}} network (e. g., a sub-organization), and how that behavior should change when network conditions change. Composing these policies produces a networkwide control program that adapts to different operating conditions. We implement state-based <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> in a system called PyResonance and demonstrate with real-world examples and use cases that PyResonance is expressive enough to specify a wide range of <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> and simple enough for many operators to use.
