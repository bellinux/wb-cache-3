40|$|The {{state in}} which a {{discrete}} event simulation is started causes the estimators for equilibrium measures obtained from the simulation to be biased, and to reduce this bias, the collection of data is delayed until a so-called <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> is completed. In this paper, we determine the optimal <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods</b> for steady-state discrete event simulations. We do this by using deterministic numerical methods, that is, methods not using random numbers. We found that in the systems investigated, transient expectations give no indication regarding the optimal length of the <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods,</b> which is counterintuitive. This requires some re-evaluation of some of commonly held opinions about the factors one should take into account when determining <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods.</b> Such factors will also be discussed. ...|$|R
30|$|There is a <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> {{because of}} the non-terminating systems’ nature. When this {{production}} line started to produce a different product, it took approximately 30  min to get first product. Experiments and observations shows that steady state has been reached for all products {{at the end of}} first 60  min of simulation. Consequently <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> has been taken as 60  min and simulation data of first 60  min is not considered in calculations to prevent objective parameters to be affected by this statistics.|$|R
40|$|One {{means for}} dealing with {{initialization}} bias in simulation experiments is to implement a <b>warm-up</b> <b>period.</b> This requires the correct estimation of the initial transient.

The method is tested on empirical data from a simulation model {{that has been used}} in a real-life study. In comparing the results to those from two commonly used warm-up methods, it appears that the SPC method performs well. The strengths and weaknesses of the approach are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The oven is a thermally-insulated {{enclosure}} {{containing the}} crystal {{and one or}} more electrical heating elements. Since other electronic components in the circuit are also vulnerable to temperature drift, usually the entire oscillator circuit is enclosed in the oven. A thermistor temperature sensor in a closed-loop control circuit is used to control the power to the heater and ensure that the oven is maintained at the precise temperature desired. Because the oven operates above ambient temperature, the oscillator usually requires a <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> after power has been applied.

This paper is concerned with the issue of initializing the state of new regions that are added to a running mi-croscopic traffic simulation. A <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> is required where the new road segments must be populated with simulated vehicles. Techniques that convert vehicle flow rate and queue length information to vehicle positions and speeds are pro-posed to minimize this <b>warm-up</b> <b>period.</b> These techniques are evaluated and compared with respect to estimated travel times of vehicles traveling through different paths in the road network under different traffic conditions.

40|$|Starting a {{model from}} an {{unrealistic}} state {{can lead to}} initialization bias in the simulation output. This, in turn, can produce bias in the results and lead to incorrect conclusions. One method for dealing with this problem is to run the model for a <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> until steady state is reached and remove the initialization bias by deleting the data within that <b>warm-up</b> <b>period.</b> Our previous research identified the MSER- 5 algorithm as the best candidate warm-up method for implementation into an automated output analysis system, and for inclusion into existing DES software products. However, during an attempt to implement an automatable sequential version of the MSER- 5 procedure into existing discrete-event simulation software several issues arose. This paper describes the framework and associated adaption of MSER- 5 in order to automate it. It then discusses in detail the implementation issues that arose and some potential solutions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxygen content}} in the ambient air drawn by {{combustion}} engines can be increased by polymer membranes. The authors have previously demonstrated that 23 to 25 % (concentration by volume) oxygen-enriched intake air can reduce hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), air toxics, and ozone-forming potential (OFP) from flexible-fueled vehicles (FFVs) that use gasoline or M 85. When oxygen-enriched air was used only during the initial start-up and <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods,</b> the emission levels of all three regulated pollutants [CO, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and NO{sub x}] were lower than the U. S. EPA Tier II (year 2004) standards (without adjusting for catalyst deterioration factors). In the present work, an air separation membrane module was installed on the intake of a 2. 5 -L FFV and tested at idle and free acceleration to demonstrate the oxygen-enrichment concept for initial start-up and <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods.</b> A bench-scale, test set-up was developed to evaluate the air separation membrane characteristics for engine applications. On the basis of prototype bench tests and from vehicle tests, the additional power requirements and module size for operation of the membrane during the initial period of the cold-phase, FTP- 75 cycle were evaluated. A prototype membrane module (27 in. long, 3 in. in diameter) supplying about 23 % oxygen-enriched air in the engine intake only during the initial start-up and <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods</b> of a 2. 5 -L FFV requires additional power (blower) of less than one horsepower.

40|$|Crossfire {{attack is}} a {{recently}} proposed threat designed to disconnect whole geographical areas, such as cities or states, from the Internet. Orchestrated in multiple phases, the attack uses a massively distributed botnet to generate low-rate benign traffic aiming to congest selected network links, so-called target links. The adoption of benign traffic, while simultaneously targeting multiple network links, makes {{the detection of}} the Crossfire attack a serious challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for early detection of Crossfire attack, i. e., detection in the <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> of the attack. We propose to monitor traffic at the potential decoy servers and discuss the advantages comparing with other monitoring approaches. Since the low-rate attack traffic {{is very difficult to}} distinguish from the background traffic, we investigate several deep learning methods to mine the spatiotemporal features for attack detection.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} to the optimization of pultrusion {{manufacturing process}} from the energy-consumption point of view. The die heating system of external platen heaters {{commonly used in}} the pultrusion machines {{is one of the}} components that contribute the most to the high consumption of energy of pultrusion process. Hence, instead of the conventional multi-planar heaters, a new internal die heating system that leads to minor heat losses is proposed. The effect of the number and relative position of the embedded heaters along the die is also analysed towards the setting up of the optimum arrangement that minimizes both the energy rate and consumption. Simulation and optimization processes were greatly supported by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and calibrated with basis on the temperature profile computed through thermography imaging techniques. The main outputs of this study allow to conclude that the use of embedded cylindrical resistances instead of external planar heaters leads to drastic reductions of both the power consumption and the <b>warm-up</b> <b>periods</b> of the die heating system. For the analysed die tool and process, savings on energy consumption up to 60 % and <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> stages less than an half hour were attained with the new internal heating system.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to determining the <b>warm-up</b> <b>period</b> for steady-state simulation of telephone traffic. The underlying simulation model captures the sophisticated interactions that determine the acceptance and routing of calls between origin and destination nodes across the telephone network. Recognizing that both the arrival and duration of calls are Markovian, approximate satisfaction of the equivalence property of Jackson networks signifies a stochastic steady state. We are able to determine the onset of steady-state behavior, therefore, by monitoring arrival and departure rates observed during the simulation and testing for equivalence. Application of the rule is illustrated using a simple three-node network. ...|$|R
