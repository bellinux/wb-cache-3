An international symposium was held in Lund in September of 1991 to which participants were specially invited who had worked with Lars Erik Nevander in one connection or another during the time of his professorship at Lund University. Invited papers presented by some 20 of the participants illurninated important developments in building physics during the past quarter-century. These papers are published here in their original form. The papers provide an interesting overview of advances in building physics both in Sweden and internationally.

In an oddball paradigm (standard= 75  ms, deviant= 30  ms, within-subjects design), participants were presented with tones at 56, 66, or 76  dB SPL (between-subjects design). At the same time, participants focused on a letter-detection task (find X in a circle of six letters).

On Remains of Agriculture in Forest Settlement Districts) In {{this thesis}} issues on remains of {{agriculture}} in the county of Värmland, Sweden are discussed. The aim {{is to use a}} holistic approach when examining such remains, which goes beyond their mere morphology. Instead focus is put on their inner and outer geographies: the internal relations between different elements of a single remain, and the external relations between the remain and its local context. Also, it is argued that it’s necessary to approach this kind of remains with an open perspective regarding time. The diorama principle as expressed by Torsten Hägerstrand is used. It focuses more on closeness than on similarity. Four separate studies are enclosed to the thesis as appendix’s I–IV. The thesis ends with an outlook to a concept of relational landscape, derived from this work, with outlines future studies. In Appendix I registered remains of agriculture are examined. In Appendix’s II and III the role of agricultural remains for settlement geography studies are analysed. The role of agricultural remains as bearers of meaning in both history and present, and views and values of antiquarians and researchers as well as the public, is examined in Appendix IV. Hopefully a holistic view will illuminate agricultural remains as research source material and bearers of meaning, including both expert and lay knowledge, history as well as present time and the future.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to several subjects in computer science, i. e. computational geometry, robotics, on-line algorithms and combinatorial optimization. We study generalizations of two classical problems. The rst {{problem is a}} geometric search problem. The problem formulation is fairly general and the problem occurs naturally in the elds of robotics distributed systems. The topic is online exploration of parallel paths by non-communicating robots. This loosely relates {{to the design of}} parallel algorithms by combining multiple search strategies, but we study the problem in the context of robot exploration. The second problem is the well known traveling salesman problem. We study a generalization called the time dependent traveling salesman problem (TDTSP) that imposes time dependencies on the edge weights in the TSP instances. The time dependent traveling salesman problem has been well studied using techniques of the operations research community. Computational complexity results for the TDTSP are uncommon though, since the problem is NP-complete and approximation guarantees for the general problem are not possible but there are some interesting restrictions to the TDTSP that deserve some theoretical analysis. In this thesis we give examples of such restrictions and set out the path for further explorations into this subject. A future goal is to classify some restrictions to the TDTSP and to unify two dierent versions of the problem.

40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects > 10 % of the Western population. Conventionally, GERD {{is treated}} by {{reducing}} gastric acid secretion, which {{is effective in}} most patients but inadequate in a significant minority. We describe a new therapeutic approach for GERD, based on inhibition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) with a proposed peripherally acting GABA(B) receptor agonist, (R) -(3 -amino- 2 -fluoropropyl) phosphinic acid (AZD 3355). AZD 3355 potently stimulated recombinant human GABA(B) receptors and inhibited TLESR in dogs, with a biphasic dose-response curve. In mice, AZD 3355 produced considerably less central side effects than the prototypical GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen but evoked hypothermia at very high doses (blocked by a GABA(B) receptor antagonist and absent in GABA(B) -/- mice). AZD 3355 and baclofen differed markedly in their distribution in rat brain; AZD 3355, but not baclofen, was concentrated in circumventricular organs {{as a result of}} active uptake (shown by avid intracellular sequestration) and related to binding of AZD 3355 to native GABA transporters in rat cerebrocortical membranes. AZD 3355 was also shown to be transported by all four recombinant human GABA transporters. AR-H 061719 [(R/S) -(3 -amino- 2 -fluoropropyl) phosphinic acid], (the racemate of AZD 3355) inhibited the response of ferret mechanoreceptors to gastric distension, further supporting its peripheral site of action on TLESR. In summary, AZD 3355 probably inhibits TLESR through stimulation of peripheral GABA(B) receptors and may offer a potential new approach to treatment of GERD.

40|$|In this paper, the {{gravitational}} field equations for static spherically symmetric perfect fluid models with a polytropic equation of state, p = kρ 1 + 1 /n, are recast into two complementary 3 -dimensional regular systems of ordinary differential equations on compact state spaces. The systems are analyzed numerically and qualitatively, using {{the theory of}} dynamical systems. Certain key solutions are shown to form building blocks which, to a large extent, determine the remaining solution structure. In one formulation, there exists a monotone function that forces the general relativistic solutions towards {{a part of the}} boundary of the state space that corresponds to the low pressure limit. The solutions on this boundary describe Newtonian models and thus the relationship to the Newtonian solution space is clearly displayed. It is numerically demonstrated that general relativistic models have finite radii when the polytropic index n satisfies 0 ≤ n � 3. 339 and infinite radii when n ≥ 5. When 3. 339 � n < 5, there exists a 1 -parameter set of models with finite radii and a finite number, depending on n, with infinite radii.

40|$|The IP Table Lookup {{mechanism}} {{is a key}} component of a router in a packet network (such as Internet). A router in the network holds a table where each entry specifies a prefix (at most 32 bits long) and a next hop exit line. When a packet comes to the router the destination address in the header of the packet is read,the longest prefix in the table matching the destination is sought, and the packet is sent to the corresponding next hop exit line. In this paper we propose a data structure, called Adaptive Stratified Tree (AST) to solve the IP Table Lookup problem. For a table of n prefixes of length at most w the AST is built in O(n log n logw) time, uses storage O(n) and allows searching in time O (log n).

Information on the densities and spatial and temporal variations of these stages, as well as on their lengths at the moment of occurrence, can be an important contribution to the knowledge of their dispersion, migrations and to the identification of possible bottlenecks in their recruitment. Therefore the hyperbenthos of the Voordelta, a shallow coastal zone in front of the Dutch Delta, as well as that of the subtidal channels and the intertidal brackish marsh creeks of the Westerschelde Estuary, was sampled monthly during one year by means of a sledge and a stow net. A total of 37 taxa were recorded from 410 samples.

The dominant taxa were clupeid larvae (predominantly herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus, Pomatoschistus spp. (a mixture of sand goby P. minutus and Lozano's goby P. lozanoi), common goby Pomatoschistus microps, Syngnathus spp. (probably almost exclusively Nilsson's <b>pipefish</b> <b>S.</b> rostellatus), plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea and flounder Pleuronectes flesus. Most species were found at a larger size in the Westerschelde (and in the tidal marshes) suggesting migration from the shallow coastal area into the estuary. Several species utilize the tidal marshes in the brackish reaches of the Westerschelde. The nursery value of these areas however, is restricted to specific early life history stages of a few species, especially flounder, bass Dicentrarchus labrax and the common goby. The estuary itself seems to function as a nursery for other species like sole and plaice. The hyperbenthic sledge was found to sample specific life history stages of postlarval flatfish (early settlement stages at the onset of asymmetry), which are not easy to sample with other types of sampling gear...|$|R

Acta Neurol Scand: 2011 : 123 : 424 - 429. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Background - No previous study prospectively investigated the effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on fear of falling (FOF) and falls. Aim - The aim was to prospectively explore whether FOF and fall rate were affected after STN stimulation in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods - Twenty participants (mean age: 65, SD 6. 4) were included. Falls and near falls were recorded (fall diary) during 3 months before and 1 year after surgery. FOF was evaluated using the Falls-Efficacy Scale, Swedish version, FES(S), and the modified Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFFE). Results- After surgery, the FES(S) scores of complex activities improved (P = 0. 026), i. e. median 34 (q 1 -q 3, 26 - 50) vs 43 (32 - 55). SAFFE scores also improved (P = 0. 007) : median 25 (22 - 30) versus 22 (18 - 27). The rate of near falls decreased (P = 0. 014). Nine participants reported no near falls. For the remaining ten participants, the median near fall rate decreased from 6 (3 - 17) to 2 (1 - 8). The rate of falls showed no significant (P > 0. 3) difference. Conclusions - After surgery, fewer activities were avoided owing {{to the risk of}} falling, and fall-related self-efficacy had improved during complex activities. The rate of near falls decreased. The results cannot support any change in fall rate...|$|R

Our algorithm sorts n integers {{in the range}} { 0, 1, 2, …, m− 1 } in linear space in O(n log log n log log log n) time. When log m≥log 2 +ϵn, ϵ> 0, we can further achieve O(n log log n) time. This improves the O(n(log log n) 2) time bound given in M. Thorup (1998) in “Proc. 1998 ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms (SODA' 98),” pp. 550 – 555). This result is obtained by combining our new technique with that of Thorup's. Signature sorting (A. Andersson, T. Hagerup, <b>S.</b> <b>Nilsson,</b> and R. Raman, 1995, in “Proc. 1995 Symposium on Theory of Computing,” pp. 427 – 436), A. Andersson's result (1996, in “Proc. 1996 IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science,” pp. 135 – 141), R. Raman's result (1996, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 1136, pp. 121 – 137, Springer-Verlag Berlin/New York), and our previous result (Y. Han and X. Shen, 1999, in “Proc. 1999 Tenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA' 99),” Baltimore, MD, January, pp. 419 – 428) are also used {{for the design of}} our algorithms. We provide an approach and techniques which are totally different from previous approaches and techniques for the problem. As a consequence our technique can be extended to apply to nonconservative sorting and parallel sorting. Our nonconservative sorting algorithm sorts n integers in { 0, 1, …, m− 1 } in time O(n(log log n) 2 /(log k+log log log n)) using word length k log(m+n), where k≤log n. Our EREW parallel algorithm sorts n integers in { 0, 1, …, m− 1 } in O((log n) 2) time and O(n(log log n) 2 /log log log n) operations provided log m=Ω((log n) 2) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern <b>pipefish</b> <b>s)</b> is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|R
