40|$|Increasing quality requirements, high process safety, low {{production}} costs and short production times are the contrasting items that influence grinding as a manufacturing method. The process setting parameters {{have to be}} chosen in an optimum way corresponding to the quality requirements {{to be able to}} fulfil these demands. It is necessary for this to describe the process in models. Regression approaches are one possibility of process modelling. Because of the high comlexity of the grinding process and the high number of influencing quantities, these approaches quickly reach their limits. By using artificial neural <b>networds</b> and fuzzy logic methods for process modelling, even these complex relations can be learned. Thus, a calculation of the process and quality characteristics is already possible before or during grinding...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} different {{control design}} approaches for stabilizing networks of quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations. These equations are usually conservative which gives them interesting properties to design stabilizing control laws. Two main design approaches are developed: a methodology based on entropies and Lyapunov functions and a methodology {{based on the}} Riemann invariants. The stability theorems are illustrated using numerical simulations. Two practical applications of these methodologies are presented. <b>Netword</b> of navigation channels are modelled using Saint-Venant equations (also known as the Shallow Water Equations). The stabilization problem of such system has an industrial importance {{in order to satisfy}} the navigation constraints and to optimize the production of electricity in hydroelectric plants, usually located at each hydraulic gates.

However, one of the primary goals has been to achieve reasonable homogeneity characteristics which can permit operate a <b>netword</b> of tunels as one only infraestructure.

40|$|Usually {{transport}} systems, {{and roads}} in particular, {{are viewed as}} public goods. However, {{this is not always}} the case. In Sweden {{a large part of the}} road system is privately owned. Most of these privately owned roads are rural roads used by farmers and summer cottage owners, or used for forest transport. The roads are mainly provided by ownership associations. The motivation of this paper is the practical problem of how such an ownership association can dicide the costs for the road <b>netword</b> among the members in a "fair" way. The problem is treated from a game theoretical point of view, making use of the Shapley value. This means that the problem is associated with a game – a mathematical representation of the conflict situation. The Shapley value is a very important solution concept for cooperative games, like tha game in this case. For games corresponding to this specific type of problems, it is shown that the Shapley value has excellent properties, such as being an element of the core, and being very easy to compute.

40|$|The general {{problem of}} {{computing}} posterior probabilities in Bayesian <b>networds</b> is NP-hard (Cooper 1990). However efficient algorithms are often possible for particular applications by exploiting problem structures. It is well {{understood that the}} key to the materialization of such a possibility is to make use of conditional independence and work with factorizations of joint probabilities rather than joint probabilities themselves. Differnent exact approaches can be characterized in terms of their choices of factorizations. We propose a new approach which adopts a straightforward way for factorizing joint probabilities. In comparison with the clique tree propagation approach, our approach is very simple. It allows the pruning of irrelevant variables, it accommodates changes to the knowledge base more easily. It is easier to implement. More importantly, it can be adapted to utilize both intercausal independence and conditional independence in one uniform framework. On the other hand, clique tree propagation is better in terms of facilitating pre-computations...|$|R

Technical communication is divorced from other forms of linguistic experience by making language limiting and reductive rather than creative and expansive. The emphasis on technical/scientific writing as radically different had blinded people to those traits it has in common with all species of composition and has led to a neglect of research, on fundamental rhetorical issues. A complete rhetorical theory of technical discourse should include information about the attitudes and motives of writers, the situations which motivate (or coerce) them to write, definitive features of technical style and form, interrelationship of expression and creativity, and functions of communication in shaping and preserving scientific <b>networds</b> and institutions.

Concerning innovativeness and opinion leadership of the pop marathoners, findings supported some of Rogers' generalizations as follows: 1) Earlier participants/adopters have a higher degree of opinion leadership than later participants/adopters. 2) Individuals tend to be linked to others who are close to them in participant/adopter categories. And, when interpersonal diffusion <b>networds</b> are heterophilous, followers seek opinion leaders who are more innovative. 3) Mass media channels are relatively more important than interpersonal channels for earlier participants/adopters than for later participants/adopters. 4) Later participants/adopters are more likely to discontinue running as a sport innovation than earlier participants/adopters. 5) Opinion leaders are more cosmopolite than their followers...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the Minstrel project, an {{efficient}} reference implementation of a push system relying on open standards. Minstrel follows the component model for push systems introduced in [25]. This thesis presents the design and implementation of the Minstrel broadcasting infrastructure. The broadcasting infrastructure is responsible for active and timely dissemination of information to (a possibly large number of) customers. This distribution process must be efficient, scalable, and should rely on open protocols. To meet the goal of efficiency Minstrel uses a hybrid approach: The Minstrel Active Distribution Protocol (MADP) sends a small sample of the available information to the subscribers (push). If a recipient is interested in the information, s/he uses the Minstrel Receiver Request Protocol (MRRP) to request the actual information (pull). This hybrid approach guarantees that customers are informed about the availability of new information quickly and efficiently via MADP, while <b>netword</b> bandwith is conserved because information which is not explicitly requested via MRRP will not be disseminated. MADP and MRRP are open protocols that use XML messages on top of HTTP. They do not rely on special multicas...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate various morphometric characteristics of microvessels, highlighted by means of anti-CD 34 immunohistochemistry, in the lymph node of 286 patients with HL at diagnosis and investigate their relationship with several clinicopatho­logic parameters and prognosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Microvessel density (MVD), total vascular area (TVA) and several size- and shape-related microvascular parameters were quantitated in the region of most intense vascularization using image analysis. RESULTS: An increase in microvessel caliber parameters (namely area, perimeter, major axis length and minor axis length) and a decrease in MVD was noted with increasing stage. An inverse relationship was similarly recorded between MVD and the number of involved anatomic sites or LDH ratio. In univariate analysis, overall disease-specific survival was adversely affected by MVD and TVA, whereas inferior failure-free survival was associated with the presence of more flattened vessel sections. Multivariate analysis disclosed that the extent of angiogenesis (MVD/TVA), age and the number of involved anatomic sites independently affected overall survival. Accordingly, failure-free survival was independently linked to the shape of micro­vessels and albumin levels or the number of involved anatomic sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the view that angiogenesis in HL provides independent prognostic information, requiring the concomitant evaluation of quantitative and qualitative aspects of microvascular <b>netword.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide high speed {{multimedia}} network communication services such as voice, data and real-time video transmissions, the demand for B-ISDN (Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network) has been recently increased. A basis for packet transmission in B-ISDN, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) [1] has been introduced. ATM is a high-speed connection-oriented packet-switching technique with minimal functionality in the network which differs from the conventional packets switching in many aspects. High-level protocol functions such as error control are performed on an end-to-end basis, not such as link-by-link basis in ATM. In ATM, the multiplexing of transmission capacity into short fixed length transmission slots called cells has been adopted as a flexible and efficient transmission standard. The ATM cell consist of a 48 bytes information payload and a 5 bytes header[1]. The cell requires a mere total of 3 μs for transmission on a 155. 12 Mb/s ATM link. Each cell header conrains an n-bit binary address of the requested output port. These cells are entered and distributed to their destinations, respevtively, by an ATM switch[2]-[5]. An ATM switch of size N {{can be regarded as}} a box with N input ports and N output ports. It routes cells arriving at its input ports in a time-slotted fashion to their desired output ports (destined by their headers). Since all input lines are synchronized and the minimum slot size is equal to the transmission time of a single cell, input and output lines are assumed to operate at the same speed. ･･･Thesis (Ph.

40|$|A very {{important}} requirement of modern machining systems in an 'unmanned' factory {{is to change}} tools that {{have been subjected to}} wear or damage in time. The old tool change strategies are based on conservative estimates from the past tool wear data, hence tools can be replaced too early or too late. This can increase the production cost or endanger the quality of the products. An integrated tool condition monitoring system composed of multi-sensors, signal processing methodology and decision-making plans is a crucial requirement for automtic manufacturing processes. An intelligent tool condition monitoring system for milling operations will be introduced in this report. The system is composed of four kinks of sensors, signal transforming and sampling apparatus and a microcomputer. By using intelligent pattern recognition techniques, different sensor signals are combined and the tool wear states can be recognised reliably. The efficient and effective orthogonal experimental design procedure is applied to comprehensively verify the monitoring system in a limited number of test runs. 50 signal features are extracted from time and frequency domain and they are found {{to be related to the}} development of tool wear values. A fuzzy clustering feature filter has been developed to remove less tool wear relevant features under different cutting conditions. multi-sensor signals reflect tool condition comprehensively and the sensor fusion strategy is used to provide reliable recognition results. Combining fuzzy approaching degree and fuzzy closeness provides a unique and overall fuzzy similarity index, the two-dimensional fuzzy approaching degree. A new type of fuzzy system, the fuzzy driven neural network has been established. The network can assign signal features suitable weights to make the tool wear state recognition process more accurate and robust. The advanced B-spline neurofuzzy <b>networds</b> are also successfully applied in the tool condiiton monitoring process. This powerful modelling system is established by combining the qualitative fuzzy rule representation with the quantitative adaptive numeric processing process. The fuzzy driven neural network and the B-spline neurofuzzy network can then be combined to build a neurofuzzy hybrid pattern recognition system, which is more reliable and accurate. Armed with the well- developed pattern recognition methodology, the established intelligent tool condition monitoring system has the advantages of being suitable for a wide range of machining conditions, robust to noise and tolerant to faults. As can be seen in the thesis, several innovations have been made in the research process of this project. The fuzzy clustering feature filter can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of the tool wear state recognition process. The two-dimensional fuzzy approaching degree comprehensively characterises the similarity between two fuzzy sets. The fuzzy driven neural network indirectly solves the weight assignment problem of the conventional fuzzy system. The established neurofuzzy hybrid pattern recognition system obviously improves the system's recognition resolution and reliabilty...|$|R
