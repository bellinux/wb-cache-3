5|$|At {{school the}} {{following}} day, {{the town is}} stunned by Colin's death. <b>Needy</b> goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. <b>Needy</b> tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip still goes to the dance, hoping to meet with <b>Needy,</b> but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. <b>Needy</b> arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. <b>Needy</b> tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool skimmer by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while <b>Needy</b> watches her boyfriend die.|$|E
5|$|<b>Needy</b> decides {{she must}} kill Jennifer. She goes to Jennifer's home and sees her, already recovered, picking out her next victims in her yearbook. Crashing {{through the window}} with a box cutter, <b>Needy</b> fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart, {{destroying}} the demon and killing her. Jennifer's mother enters and finds <b>Needy</b> with the box cutter {{on top of her}} daughter's body. Soon after, <b>Needy</b> is brought to an asylum. As she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as the ability to hover in the air. Desiring revenge for what was done to her, Jennifer, and Chip, <b>Needy</b> escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; there, she slaughters the members, whose killings are later discovered by local authorities.|$|E

5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between obligations to animals and obligations to <b>needy</b> humans. The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid <b>needy</b> humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While <b>Needy</b> and Chip have sex, <b>Needy</b> senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to <b>Needy,</b> Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
