5|$|The {{discovery}} of Neptune in 1846 {{led to the}} discrediting of the Titius–Bode law {{in the eyes of}} scientists, because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position.

5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} to each other {{have not yet been}} fully explored and <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> consensus exists on the subject.

5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{diamonds}} {{found on}} Earth originated on Earth. Primitive interstellar meteorites {{were found to}} contain carbon possibly {{in the form of}} diamond. A type of diamond called carbonado that is found in South America and Africa may have been deposited there via an asteroid impact (not formed from the impact) about 3billion years ago. These diamonds may have formed in the intrastellar environment, but as of 2008, there was <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> consensus on how carbonado diamonds originated.|$|E
5|$|The Hollow Moon hypothesis, or Spaceship Moon hypothesis, {{proposes that}} Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or {{otherwise}} contains a substantial interior space. <b>No</b> <b>scientific</b> evidence exists {{to support the}} idea; seismic observations and other data collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate {{that it has a}} thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|Many {{people in}} China {{and other parts}} of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have {{medicinal}} properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs. There is <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death. Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} {{this period of}} Antarctic interest is what historian H. R. Mill called 'the age of averted interest'. Following the expedition South by the ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested that there were <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South. It is considered that Ross' influence, {{as well as the}} loss of the Franklin expedition in the Arctic, led to disinterest in polar inquiry, particularly by The Royal Society: the British-founded organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, including those that would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there is a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

5|$|The French book, Le Buste de Nefertiti– une Imposture de l'Egyptologie? (The Bust of Nefertiti– a Fraud in Egyptology?) by Swiss art {{historian}} Henri Stierlin {{and the book}} Missing Link in Archaeology by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the Nefertiti bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the bust to test ancient pigments and that when the bust was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the bust {{would have been a}} sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that <b>no</b> <b>scientific</b> records of the bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery, and while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for the bust, and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing Nefertiti bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders, and that the original was lost in World War II.|$|E
