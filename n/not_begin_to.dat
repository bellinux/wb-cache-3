5|$|Angelou does <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less {{upon the}} conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E

By late August, Bell slipped in the polls to third place, with O'Malley and Stokes tied. Bell and O'Malley began airing television commercials supporting their campaigns in early August, while Stokes did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> air commercials until September. O'Malley also advertised on the radio.|$|E
5|$|Although {{onset of}} DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, {{in more than}} half of all cases {{symptoms}} do <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> appear for at least an hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E

Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an {{important}} Russian supply point after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, preventing them from moving north towards Smolensk.|$|E
5|$|Smetana's early {{songs are}} {{settings}} of German poems for single voice. Apart from his 1848 Song of Freedom, he did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> write pieces {{for a full}} choir until after his Gothenburg sojourn, when he composed numerous works for the Hlahol choral society, mostly for unaccompanied male voices. Smetana's choral music is generally nationalistic in character, ranging in scale from the short Ceremonial Chorus written {{after the death of}} the composer's revolutionary friend Havlíček, to the setting of Song of the Sea, a substantial work with the character of a choral drama.|$|E

5|$|The single did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> sell {{significantly}} until February 2013, when a YouTube video set to {{its music}} developed into an Internet meme {{of the same}} name. The media response to the meme helped increase the single's sales, as it charted at number one for five consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number three in the United Kingdom and number one in both Australia and New Zealand. During the song's chart run, Billboard enacted a policy that included video streams {{as a component of}} their charts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{science fiction}} (sf) had been {{published}} before the 1920s, it did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By {{the end of the}} 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom. Gernsback lost control of Amazing Stories in 1929; it was sold to Teck Publications, and then in 1938 it was acquired by Ziff-Davis. The following year Ziff-Davis launched Fantastic Adventures as a companion to Amazing; the first issue was dated May 1939, and the editor of Amazing, Ray Palmer, took on responsibility for the new magazine as well.|$|E

By the end of the 1930s, the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954.

5|$|Despite the Vance plan's {{requirement}} for the immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually pulled out, the JNA transferred their equipment to the RSK. Because of organisational problems and breaches of the ceasefire, the UNPROFOR did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> deploy until 8 March and took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs. The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarising the UNPAs, maintaining the ceasefire, monitoring local police and creating conditions {{for the return of}} internally displaced persons and refugees. These comprised more than 300,000 Croats who were exiled from RSK-controlled territory and 20,000 Serbs who fled areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) in Operations Swath-10, Papuk-91 and Hurricane-91 in late 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E
5|$|Incubation of {{the eggs}} lasts 11 to 13 days and is {{performed}} solely by the female. The hatchlings are naked and quills do <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed by the parents. Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.|$|E

5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{transformed}} into three cottages during the 17th century, which involved a new door and additional fireplaces being added. The economy and status of Southampton did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> improve until the 18th century, when it became a noted cultural centre. In 1780 the three cottages were converted back into a single building, owned by a MrsCollins as a lodging house for actors. During the Victorian era Southampton saw a huge expansion of its maritime docks {{and the construction of}} a new railway line. The Medieval Merchant's House was converted again, and had become a beer-shop by 1883, and a popular public house called the Bull's Head.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Tanya {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa {{in the middle of}} October. The wave closely followed the path of Tropical Storm Sebastien and was unable to develop in the tropical Atlantic as it moved westward. The system did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> become organized until October25 while south-southeast of Bermuda. However, the Dvorak technique was still unable to classify the system until October26 as the low-cloud swirl became better organized while moving northward in the central Atlantic. That evening, a closed circulation had formed, and it was classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-One by the National Hurricane Center. On the morning of October27, it strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the 19th as well as the final named storm of the season. Operationally, it was not declared a tropical cyclone until that point, when it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Tanya.|$|E

5|$|The territories were {{governed by}} {{mandatory}} powers, {{such as the}} United Kingdom {{in the case of}} the Mandate of Palestine, and the Union of South Africa in the case of South West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, these territories did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore's early jazz pioneers {{included}} Blanche Calloway, one of {{the first}} female jazz bandleaders in the United States, and sister to jazz legend Cab Calloway. Both the Calloways, like many of Baltimore's prominent black musicians, studied at Frederick Douglass High School with William Llewellyn Wilson, himself a renowned performer and conductor for the first African American symphony in Baltimore. Baltimore was also home to Chick Webb, one of jazz's most heralded drummers, who became a musical star despite being born hunchbacked and crippled at the age of five years. Later Baltimoreans in jazz include Elmer Snowden, and Ethel Ennis. After Pennsylvania Avenue declined in the 1950s, Baltimore's jazz scene changed. The Left Bank Jazz Society, an organization dedicated to promoting live jazz, began holding a weekly series of concerts in 1965, featuring the biggest names in the field, including Duke Ellington and John Coltrane. The tapes from these recordings became legendary within the jazz aficionados, but they did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> be released until 2000, due to legal complications.|$|E
5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
