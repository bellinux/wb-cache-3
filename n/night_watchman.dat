5|$|In 1960, Bazna {{moved to}} Germany {{and worked in}} Munich as a <b>night</b> <b>watchman.</b> Bazna and Hans Nogly wrote I was Cicero, which was {{published}} in 1962. It told the story of the Cicero Affair from Bazna's perspective following Moyzisch's book Operation Cicero published in 1950. Bazna died in Munich of kidney disease in December 1970.|$|E
5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a temperance society {{and built the}} Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a <b>night</b> <b>watchman</b> and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district.|$|E
5|$|Newt Lee, the <b>night</b> <b>watchman,</b> {{arrived at}} work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately for the <b>Night</b> <b>Watchmen,</b> {{the very}} police {{department}} in which Marshall himself had once served came to {{view them as}} criminals, and their crusade as illegal. By {{the time of the}} series conclusion, even the FBI had commenced to look into the activities of the <b>Night</b> <b>Watchmen,</b> a probe Marshall was, presumably, able to defuse when a federal agent provided him with the FBI file on the <b>Night</b> <b>Watchmen.</b>|$|R

5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One <b>night</b> <b>watchman</b> was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{conflicts and}} feuds {{leading to the}} gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as pimps, lawmen, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became {{a police officer in}} Prescott, Arizona. He followed that with a job as a <b>night</b> <b>watchman</b> before he became a constable. Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kharrat {{was born}} to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861, during Ottoman rule in Syria. He served as the <b>night</b> <b>watchman</b> of the city's al-Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood's orchards. Damascus was {{captured}} by Arab rebels during World War I in October 1918. Afterward, the Arab Club, an Arab nationalist organization, emerged {{in the city to}} raise support for the rebels. The club assisted the rebels' leader, Emir Faisal, who formed a rudimentary government. Al-Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al-Shaghour. In July 1920, Faisal's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun. Afterward, the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their League of Nations mandate.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. <b>Night</b> <b>watchman</b> Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly <b>night</b> <b>watchman</b> and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{became aware}} {{that there was a}} spy {{operating}} within the Turkish Embassy, they investigated Bazna, installed a new alarm system, and initiated an unsuccessful sting to catch him selling intelligence. He stopped selling information to the Germans by the end of February 1944 and left the embassy within a month or so. After the war, Bazna was questioned for war crimes, but he was never charged with espionage. He attempted to buy and operate a hotel in Ankara with the proceeds of his spying career, but it was discovered that much of the money was counterfeit. He served a brief prison sentence for circulating forged notes. Bazna lived in Ankara with his family for many years and obtained work doing odd jobs. He moved to Munich in 1960 and worked as a <b>night</b> <b>watchman</b> before dying in 1970 of kidney disease. Bazna published a memoir of the Cicero affair in 1962.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{learning}} Sadam's plan, Rin {{decides to}} revive the <b>Night</b> <b>Watchmen,</b> a group of soldiers that, {{at the time of}} his father, faced monsters and spirits, but were killed with the advent of the new king: by his side there are Do-ha, with whom he falls in love, Kang Moo-seok, a swordsman who initially doesn't believe in the supernatural, and Jo Sang-heon, the former captain of the <b>Night</b> <b>Watchmen.</b> While the battle against Sadam rages, Rin also brings to light the truth behind the death of his parents.|$|R
50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth century an {{official}} organism for law enforcement did not exist: chasing and arresting serious offenders was not the duty of the public authority. In fact <b>night</b> <b>watchmen,</b> constables and justices of the peace were not obligated to prosecute felons, but played a marginal role: <b>night</b> <b>watchmen</b> only provided surveillance for petty crimes, made rounds at night as a deterrent, and hosted those felons on hold to be brought before a justice of the peace the next day; while constables passively arrested people charged with a crime when already apprehended, and took them before a justice of the peace.|$|R

There, he discovers that Paris has abandoned him, leaving behind his pawn bullet.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{establish}} a police department in Baltimore occurred in 1784, nearly 60 years after the colonial founding of the town. The city in the newly independent United States authorized a guard force of constables to enforce town laws and arrest those in violation. <b>Night</b> <b>Watchman</b> George Workner was the first law enforcement officer to be killed in the city; he was stabbed during an escape attempt by nine inmates at the Baltimore City Jail on March 14, 1808; his death predated the formal founding of the department.|$|E
