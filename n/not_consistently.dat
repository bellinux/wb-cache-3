5|$|The Westerosi {{characters}} of Game of Thrones speak British-accented English, often (but <b>not</b> <b>consistently)</b> with the accent of the English region {{corresponding to the}} character's Westerosi region; Eddard Stark (Warden of the North) speaks in actor Sean Bean's native northern accent, and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a southern accent, while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish accent. Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent.|$|E
5|$|There {{are very}} few Arabians {{registered}} as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does <b>not</b> <b>consistently</b> lighten with age, while a gray does.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was <b>not</b> <b>consistently</b> the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were <b>not</b> <b>consistently</b> developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did <b>not</b> <b>consistently</b> vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still {{determining}} their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E

5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are <b>not</b> <b>consistently</b> available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E
5|$|After the Predators' {{regular season}} success in 2005–06, the team bolstered their lineup by {{acquiring}} centre Jason Arnott and winger Jean-Pierre Dumont. In response to Arnott's signing, Kariya {{commented that the}} centre position, as well as size, were weaknesses for the team the previous year, especially when they matched up against the Sharks' top two centres, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau, in the playoffs. Leading up to the 2006–07 season, the Predators were picked by many analysts in the media (including those from The Globe and Mail and ESPN) to contend for the Stanley Cup. Prior {{to the start of}} the campaign, the Predators announced defenceman Kimmo Timonen as the team's new captain, while naming Kariya and Steve Sullivan as alternates (the two served in that role the previous season, as well, but not on a permanent basis). With Kariya leading the team in scoring, the team boasted the top record in the league by the All-Star break. At the NHL trade deadline, the team further bolstered their lineup by acquiring high-profile centre Peter Forsberg from Philadelphia. Forsberg joined Kariya on the top line, though <b>not</b> <b>consistently.</b> With 76 points (24 goals and 52 assists)—the second highest total in team history—over 82 games, Kariya led the Predators in scoring for a second-straight year. His seven shootout goals (over 11 attempts) tied for second in the league, one behind Erik Christensen of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Predators continued to improve and finished with a new team record of 51 wins and 110 points. Despite ranking as the second-best team in the West, Nashville seeded fourth in their conference (divisional winners within the conference take the top three seeds; Detroit beat the Predators by three points in the Central Division). Playing against the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive year, the Predators were once again eliminated in five games. Kariya struggled with two assists during the series.|$|E
