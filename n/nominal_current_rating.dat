2500|$|There are {{two groups}} of devices. G (general use) {{instantaneous}} RCDs have no intentional time delay. They must never trip at one-half of the <b>nominal</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating,</b> but must trip within 200 milliseconds for rated current, and within 40 milliseconds at five times rated current. [...] S (selective) or T (time-delayed) RCDs have a short time delay. They are typically used at the origin of an installation for fire protection to discriminate withGdevices at the loads, and in circuits containing surge suppressors. They must not trip at one-half of rated current. They provide at least 130 milliseconds delay of tripping at rated current, 60 milliseconds at twice rated, and 50 milliseconds at five times rated. The maximum break time is 500 ms at rated current, 200 ms at twice rated, and 150 ms at five times rated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{new series}} {{connected}} 25 T hybrid magnet system {{is being developed}} by the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB) for neutron scattering experiments. In collaboration with CRPP, high temperature superconducting (HTS) current leads {{have been developed for}} the powering of the outer superconducting coil. These HTS current leads, with a <b>nominal</b> <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> of 20 kA, have been designed and are being manufactured by CRPP, based on the design of the 18 kA EDIPO leads. Each of the two current leads consists of an HTS module cooled only by heat conduction from the cold end and a copper part actively cooled by helium gas of 44 K inlet temperature. To reach a temperature of 53. 7 K at the warm end of the HTS a helium mass flow rate of 1. 37 g/s per lead is required at a current of 20 kA. The estimated heat leak at the 4. 5 K level caused only by heat conduction is as low as 1. 4 W. The evolution of the temperatures {{in the case of a}} loss of flow has been calculated. In addition to the design, the main fabrication steps are described...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis presents {{data from a}} simulation study of the thermal and electrical characteristics of a Gate Turn Off (GTO) thyristor. At present, {{most of the research}} on GTO thyristors has focused on their use in power electronic systems at high switching frequencies. As a result, the behavior of GTO thyristors at very low switching frequencies is not well understood. Previous research projects have shown experimentally that GTO thyristors are capable of interrupting significantly more than their <b>nominal</b> turn-off <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> when used in pulsed power applications at low switching frequencies. This work demonstrates the use of physics-based computer simulation to study the electrothermal turn-off characteristics of a GTO thyristor at low switching frequencies. The computer model used in this project simulated both the electrical and the thermal characteristics of a GTO thyristor and allowed its internal properties - such as current density, electric fields, and lattice temperature - to be investigated. The model was used to track the generation, transfer, and dissipation of energy within the structure of the device and show that the current interruption capability of a GTO thyristor may depend on its switching frequency due to the thermal energy that is generated and stored in the device during turn-off.

It also finds relatively small size (40 observation) annual data sets do not lead to problems achieving statistical significance, at least in simple IS curve models. It also finds that post - 1980 White and Newey - West correction methods for hetroskedasticity make it far more likely that any {{of a wide variety of}} interest rates and lags will be found statistically significant than was the case in earlier studies, but that correcting for multicollinearity between rates again leaves only the real prime and Federal funds rate lagged two periods and perhaps the <b>current</b> <b>nominal</b> mortgage <b>rate</b> significant. The effect of changes in the prime rate and mortgage rates on the GDP, though systematic, appears to be small, implying the IS curve may be nearly vertical and the Fed’s interest rate policy of little significance unless rate changes are draconian. We estimate that even a five percentage - point change in the real Federal funds and prime rates changes GDP only 2. 4 %, and employment only 1. 2 % maximally (using Okun’s law). Other findings were that nominal interest rates deflated by adaptive expectations models of inflation using the past two year’s inflation seem to best describe how businesses calculate real rates. Rational expectations models were least successful. Other rates examined include the ten year treasury rate, the Aaa and Baa corporate rates. They were seldom found statistically significant, but the mortgage rate’s estimated marginal effect seems to also capture these rates’ effect on the economy. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} it is not {{necessary}} for the central bank to react to the exchange rate to have a desirable outcome in the economy. Indeed, when the Taylor rule includes contemporaneous data on the variables in the rule, the central bank can disregard from the exchange rate {{as long as there is}} enough with interest rate inertia in monetary policy. The reason is that interest rate inertia and a reaction to the <b>current</b> <b>nominal</b> exchange <b>rate</b> change are perfect substitutes in monetary policy. Hence, we give a rationale for the central bank to focus on the interest rate change rather than the interest rate level to have a desirable outcome in the economy, which we define as a determinate rational expectation equilibrium that is stable under least squares learning.
