2500|$|During hibernation, predators of Indiana bats {{may include}} black rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) [...] and <b>northern</b> <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor). During other {{times of the}} year <b>northern</b> <b>raccoons</b> have been {{observed}} trying to grab bats from the air when they attempt to fly away. Skunks (Mephitidae), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and feral cats (Felis catus) may pose a similar threat. If Indiana bats fly from their day roosts during the day, they may be susceptible to predation by hawks (Accipitridae). Indiana bats foraging at night may also be susceptible to predation by owls (Strigidae). While not a predator, woodpeckers (Picidae) may disturb roosting bats through their foraging activities by peeling away sections of bark being utilized by Indiana bats, causing Indiana bats to fly from the roost during the day and making the tree unsuitable for future habitation.|$|R
5000|$|The raccoon ( [...] or , Procyon lotor), {{sometimes}} spelled racoon, {{also known}} as the common raccoon, North American raccoon, <b>northern</b> <b>raccoon</b> and colloquially as coon, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm and a body weight of 3.5 to 9 kg. Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years. The diet of the omnivorous raccoon, which is usually nocturnal, consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the primary}} threats to sea turtle {{reproduction}} in Florida is nest predation by Northern Raccoons (Procyon lotor). We examined 10 years of nest deposition data from a high-density sea turtle nesting beach at Sebastian Inlet State Park, Florida, USA, along with data on raccoon road-kills from the adjacent road, and data on park attendance (as an index of local traffic) to make inferences about raccoon activity patterns relative to turtle nesting. <b>Northern</b> <b>Raccoon</b> road-kills diminished during turtle nesting, even though local traffic was higher. Virginia Opossums (Didelphis virginiana), the only other mammal consistently found as road-kills, did not show a decrease during turtle nesting season, but only rarely function as primary predators of turtle nests. We believed the most logical interpretation was that the abundant food resource of turtle eggs attracts raccoons to the beach during turtle nesting {{and they do not}} leave the beach area until the nesting season ends. The large numbers of <b>Northern</b> <b>Raccoon</b> road-kills during the fall-winter might be a signal that management actions to protect turtle nests might be needed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Northern</b> <b>raccoon</b> Procyon lotor is {{a species}} native to North and Central America, but alien populations have {{established}} in Europe, several Caribbean islands, and Japan, being introduced for fur farming, hunting, or as pets/attraction in animal parks. In the introduced range, raccoons may impact on breeding birds and amphibians, exert crop damages and transmit pathologies to wild species and humans. The species {{has been introduced}} also in Italy, where the only known reproductive population is observed since 2004 in Lombardy, along the Adda river. We reconstructed the current distribution range of the <b>Northern</b> <b>raccoon</b> in Italy, collecting information from scientific papers, articles in newspapers and books, as well from experts and local reporters. A total of 53 occurrence points were collected from 38 observation sites. Since 2008, records from Lombardy increased, and sporadic observations were reported from seven other regions. A complete lack of records from the Northernmost provinces of Lombardy (Varese, Como and Sondrio) suggests that the only Italian population does not derive from a range expansion from Switzerland, {{but it should be}} considered as an independent, new introduction. Accidental observations of single individuals possibly escaped from captivity are often ignored, and only some of them were removed from the wild. An analysis of the potential distribution of the species was performed in a species distribution modeling framework (Maxent). A global model was built up considering the occurrences of reproductive populations from the native range and introduced areas in Europe and Japan and then projected to Italy. The model suggested a very low suitability of the Alpine region, thus providing support to the hypothesis that the Italian population did not derive from dispersal from Switzerland. If escapes or releases of raccoons will continue, there is a risk that the species could adapt to other areas, making its containment more difficult. Download the complete issue...|$|E

2500|$|Mississippi kites, {{peregrine}} falcons and merlins are raptors {{that are}} known to take adult chimney swifts in flight, being among the select few avian hunters fast enough to overtake the appropriately named swift on the wing. Eastern screech-owls have been seen attacking colonies, as have non-avian predators including eastern rat snakes, <b>northern</b> <b>raccoons</b> and tree squirrels. These {{are most likely to}} take nestlings but may take some nesting adults as well. When disturbed by potential predators (including humans) at the colony, adult chimney swifts slap their wings together after arching back and taking flight, making a very loud noise known either as [...] "booming" [...] or [...] "thunder noises". When disturbed, nestlings make a loud, raspy raah, raah, raah sound. Both sounds seem designed to startle potential predators.|$|R

The lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum L.) has been implicated as a vector. To identify candidate vertebrate amplification hosts associated with enzootic maintenance of the virus, sera and ticks were sampled from 160 mammals (8 species) and 139 birds (26 species) captured near 2 human case residences in Andrew and Nodaway Counties in northwest Missouri. HRTV-specific neutralizing antibodies were identified in <b>northern</b> <b>raccoons</b> (42. 6 %), horses (17. 4 %), white-tailed deer (14. 3 %), dogs (7. 7 %), and Virginia opossums (3. 8 %), but not in birds.

40|$|Loss {{of large}} {{mammalian}} carnivores may allow smaller mesopredators to become abundant and threaten other community members. There is considerable debate about mesopredator release {{and the role}} that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, Eira barbara; white-nosed coati, Nasua narica; <b>northern</b> <b>raccoon,</b> Procyon lotor; and common opossum, Didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in Costa Rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species’ detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing {{a serious threat to}} resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the Neotropics...|$|E
40|$|Populations of mesopredators (mid-sized {{mammalian}} carnivores) {{are expanding}} {{in size and}} range amid declining apex predator populations and ever-growing human presence, leading to significant ecological impacts. Despite their obvious importance, population dynamics have scarcely been studied for most mesopredator species. Information on basic population parameters and processes under a range of conditions is necessary for managing these species. Here we investigate survival, recruitment, and population growth rate of a widely distributed and abundant mesopredator, the <b>northern</b> <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor), using Pradel’s temporal symmetry models and. 6 years of monthly capture-mark-recapture data collected in a protected area. Monthly apparent survival probability was higher for females (0. 949, 95 % CI = 0. 936 – 0. 960) than for males (0. 908, 95 % CI = 0. 893 – 0. 920), while monthly recruitment rate was higher for males (0. 091, 95 % CI = 0. 078 – 0. 106) than for females (0. 054, 95 % CI = 0. 042 – 0. 067). Finally, monthly realized population growth rate was 1. 000 (95 % CI = 0. 996 – 1. 004), indicating that our study population has reached a stable equilibrium in this relatively undisturbed habitat. There was little evidence for substantial temporal variation in population growth rate or its components.

50|$|Many animals prey on eastern towhees {{and their}} eggs, {{including}} reptiles, mammals, and birds. A literature review summarizes several reports demonstrating that predators {{are a major}} cause of nest failure. The highest nest predation rate noted was 88% in a New York study. Mammals that are likely nest predators include <b>northern</b> <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor), domestic cats (Felis catus), and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Snakes such as bullsnakes (Pituophis catenifer), rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) and garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) have been reported eating eastern towhee eggs. Weasels (Mustela spp.) and blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) are also likely nest predators. Several birds are known to prey on both young and adult eastern towhees, including northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Broad-winged (Buteo platypterus), short-tailed (Buteo brachyurus), sharp-shinned (Accipiter striatus) and Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii). Other predators include barred (Strix varia), short-eared (Asio flammeus) and eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio) and even the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), which is scarcely larger than a towhee. At least some mammals also feed on adult eastern towhees. In Maryland, an eastern towhee was found in the stomach contents of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes).|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} placing camera traps at river otter (Lontra canadensis) latrines (discrete sites in riparian areas where otters regularly deposit scats, urine, and anal secretions) to detect other carnivores occupying Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey, USA. We postulated that scents at latrines may serve as an attractant to other carnivores and evaluated this premise by using camera traps to compare carnivore detection rates (overall and by species) and richness (overall and for each survey month) between latrine (n= 5) and non-latrine riparian areas (n= 5). On average carnivore richness was about 1. 7 times {{higher than that of}} a non-latrine, and mean richness was higher at latrines for all survey months. Likewise, the overall carnivore detection frequency was 3. 5 times greater at latrines, and the detection frequencies for red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), <b>northern</b> <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor), river otters, mink (Neovison vison), long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were greater at latrines. American black bears (Ursus americanus) and eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) where detected more frequently at non-latrines. Our study provides evidence that placement of camera traps at otter latrines may serve as a new and novel approach for monitoring carnivore populations in riparian areas...|$|R
40|$|Jacob L. BowmanThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify landscape variables associated with habitat fragmentation, which predicted the presence of mesocarnivores in urban landscapes. I used remote cameras to detect mesocarnivores in 21 urban forest fragments in Newark, Delaware. I conducted remote camera surveys June 2012 through July 2012 and June 2013 through July 2013. Using linear regression models, I determined if any of the following 6 landscape characteristics (i. e. proportion of multiflora rose cover within the plot; distance to the nearest road, stream, and house; patch size; and patch area to perimeter ratio) were related to species richness and relative abundance of <b>northern</b> <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and domestic cat (Felis catus). Patch size was negatively related to species richness and relative abundance of raccoon, opossum, and cat, suggesting these 3 species utilize smaller patches while red fox, the only mesocarnivore with a positive relationship to patch size utilizes larger forest fragments. Species richness and raccoon relative abundance shared a negative relationship with distance to road, a likely result of high raccoon detection and their affinity for human-dominated landscapes. Domestic cats were positively related with patch area to edge ratio, contrary to red fox which was negatively related with patch area to edge ratio. While my research is only applicable to the 4 target species found in Newark forest patches, the results provide further insight to mesocarnivore habitat use within urban forest fragments.

40|$|Road {{drainage}} structures, hereafter designated culverts, {{are often}} used by wildlife and other animals to cross under roadways. However, crossings may vary by species, culvert design, different environmental factors, and land-use and land-cover (LULC) at culvert sites. We monitored 265 culverts located throughout Maryland, USA, with motion-detecting game cameras to assess seasonal and regional effects on culvert crossing rates by wildlife and other animal species considered common to the areas. <b>Northern</b> <b>raccoon</b> (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) exhibited lower crossing rates in culverts during winter than at other times of the year. We did not detect any difference in seasonal crossings for other species, but several species exhibited similar patterns of lower crossings/culvert/day during winter. We detected more crossings/culvert/day in the Piedmont ecoregion of Maryland for several species associated with farmland and suburbia (e. g., raccoon and red fox [Vulpes vulpes]). In contrast, opossum and free-ranging domestic cat (Felis catus) crossing rates were greater in the Appalachian Mountain ecoregion. The crossing rates for the only bird species we recorded on camera traps, the great blue heron (Ardea herodias), tended to increase from west to east, with its highest crossing rate on the Eastern Shore (lower coastal plain) of Maryland, where these birds {{are known to be}} abundant in tidal marshes. Besides a myriad of LULC and structural variables known to affect wildlife and other animal crossing rates, seasonal and regional differences in animal use must also be taken into consideration for culvert design and placement or retrofitting existing culverts to enhance crossings by particular animal species...|$|E
