25|$|Jewelery (such as brooches), weapons (including swords with {{decorative}} hilts) {{and clothing}} (such as capes and sandals) {{have been found}} in a number of grave sites. The grave of Queen Aregund, discovered in 1959, and the Treasure of Gourdon, which was deposited soon after 524, are notable examples. The few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts that have survived, such as the Gelasian Sacramentary, contain a great deal of zoomorphic representations. Such Frankish objects show a greater use of the style and motifs of Late Antiquity and a lesser degree of skill and sophistication in design and manufacture than comparable works from the British Isles. So little has survived, however, that the best quality of work from this period may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented.</b>|$|E

500|$|On 30 December 2009, Parliament {{was put on}} hold, or 'prorogued' at {{the request}} of the Prime Minister. According to his spokesman, he sought this prorogation to consult with Canadians about the economy. The move caused cries from {{opposition}} MPs who labelled it as an attempt to [...] "muzzle parliamentarians amid controversy over the Afghan detainees affair." [...] Prorogation prevented the parliamentary committee from continuing to probe the issue. Although informal committee meetings continued, they had no power to compel testimony or grant immunity, and Conservative MPs would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented.</b>|$|E

Huggins described this in 1969 as tantamount to [...] "kicking [...] out of the Commonwealth". When Northern Rhodesia became Zambia on 24 October 1964, Southern Rhodesia dropped [...] "Southern" [...] from its name, and initiated legislation to this effect. Britain refused assent two months later, saying that although the colony was self-governing, it did not have the power to rename itself. Salisbury continued using the shortened name anyway.|$|E

500|$|The game is an {{adaptation}} of Peter Jackson's 2002 film [...] and his 2003 film , which was released shortly after the game. As it is not {{an adaptation}} of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 novel, The Return of the King, the third volume in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, anything from the novel not specifically mentioned or depicted in the films could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> in the game. This is because, at the time, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months into}} his premiership, Smith was deeply {{offended}} when Whitehall informed him that, {{for the first}} time since 1932, Southern Rhodesia would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference as the decision had been taken to only include fully independent states in future. The quarrel over the terms for independence caused the Southern Rhodesian military's traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and motivated Britain to cut off financial aid to Salisbury around the same time. The United States promptly followed suit. Political violence between the rival black nationalist movements in Rhodesia intensified during mid-1964, leading to jail terms or preventive restriction for several prominent nationalists, and concurrent bans for their respective parties. When Northern Rhodesia became Zambia in October 1964, Southern Rhodesia dropped [...] "Southern" [...] from its name, and initiated legislation to this effect, but Britain refused assent, saying that the colony could not legally rename itself. Salisbury continued using the shortened name anyway.|$|E
500|$|Salisbury's blunt {{refusal to}} be part of the Wind of Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military's {{traditional}} British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time. In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, despite Salisbury's record of attendance going back to 1932, because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states. This decision, taken by Britain to preempt the possibility of open confrontation with Asian and black African leaders at the conference, deeply insulted Smith. Lord Malvern equated Britain's removal of Southern Rhodesia's conference seat with [...] "kicking us out of the Commonwealth", while Welensky expressed horror at what he described as [...] "this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth".|$|E

500|$|Smith, who {{had been}} to the UK only four times before 1964 and never more than briefly, was soon {{labelled}} a [...] "raw colonial" [...] by Whitehall. He was almost immediately at loggerheads with the UK government, which he claimed had forsaken British ideals, and the Commonwealth, which he said had abandoned its own founding principles amid the Wind of Change. He accused both of isolating Southern Rhodesia because it still respected these values. When he learned in June that Salisbury would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference {{for the first time since}} 1932, he was deeply insulted and alleged British betrayal, double standards and appeasement. Three months later, Smith accepted the British condition that the independence terms had to be acceptable to majority opinion, but impasse immediately developed regarding the mechanism by which black views would be gauged. Labour's narrow victory in the October 1964 UK general election meant that Smith would be negotiating not with Sir Alec Douglas-Home but with Harold Wilson, who was far less accommodating towards the RF stand. Smith declared acceptability to majority opinion to have been demonstrated after a largely white referendum and an indaba of tribal chiefs and headmen both decisively backed independence under the 1961 constitution in October and November 1964, but black nationalists and the UK government dismissed the indaba as insufficiently representative of the black community.|$|E
