40|$|The {{expansion}} of urban areas {{has a negative}} impact on the environment. The increase of impervious or <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> is directly proportional to this expansion. The estimation of <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> has often been executed using remote sensing imagery, although only on a local to regional scale, using medium and recently available high resolution images like LANDSAT TM and IKONOS. In order to develop a global policy and strategy on urban expansion matters, consistent time series of area statistics on urban land use on a national and global level will become indispensable. This research explores the possibilities of SPOT VEGETATION imagery, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, for urban monitoring in order to generate statistics of <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> over larger zones. While low resolution imagery offers the advantage of covering a large area in small temporal intervals, its spatial resolution is too coarse to monitor most urban objects. In order to tackle this problem, a sub-pixel classification was applied and unmixed <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> area statistics were produced. Endmember selection is a key element in the sub-pixel classification process in which the spectrally complex <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> class should be distinguished from other general classes. To find the most favourable temporal interval or period for endmember selection, several datasets were developed and explored. SPOT-VEGETATION images were acquired in summer and winter for Flanders (Belgium). This region is characterised by a highly fragmented urban land-cover and large availability of reference data. Spectral unmixing of the multitemporal datasets illustrates that the endmember spectra differs for three different endmember selection techniques, affecting the quality of the final sub-pixel classification.
