5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, No.1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south-eastern Australia. Headlam continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15January 1940, when {{he was assigned to}} Headquarters Laverton as the station <b>navigation</b> <b>officer.</b> On 27March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. He was promoted to squadron leader on 1June 1940. Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul's Anglican Church in Frankston; the couple would have a son and a daughter.|$|E

In 1905 - 1906, Erich Raeder served aboard the ship has her <b>navigation</b> <b>officer.</b> By 1908, she {{was assigned to the}} gunnery training squadron and tasked with training the fleet's gunners. She remained with the fleet until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense, along with her sister ships. On 31 August 1915, the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized, and Frithjofs crew was transferred to other warships. She was then used as a barracks ship in Danzig. On 17 June 1919, she was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to A. Bernstein in Hamburg. Frithjof was rebuilt as a merchant ship in 1923 at Deutsche Werke; she only served in this capacity for seven years, and was dismantled for scrap in Danzig in 1930.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{research}} {{as a whole is}} dedicated to studies of the work load of <b>navigation</b> <b>officers</b> and, consequently, is related to the current international research on the quality of working life. Issues of seafarers' working time are very topical because in recent years the load of <b>navigation</b> <b>officers</b> has significantly increased, either due to increase in shipping intensity, or {{in the context of the}} new international maritime law, for example, compliance with the requirements of the ISM CODE (International Management safety Code), THE ISPS (The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code). Irregularities are observed in practice of the seafarers' working hours and rest hours, and even the mismatch, as presented in the port of inspection materials. This article is intended to assess the 2 nd and 3 rd Officer's load compliance with the regulatory enactments for the work and rest regime to develop proposals to load optimization. Load analysis of <b>Navigation</b> <b>officers</b> is based on international maritime regulations that determine the work and rest regime on ships STCW (The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers), MLC (Maritime Labour Convention). In the article, concrete data is used from the research, which was conducted 18 months on the Handy type of tanker from July, 2012 till December, 2013 in the real time mode. In the article is also concrete data used from 340 survey respondents, which reflects the views of the <b>navigation</b> <b>officers</b> on violations of the work and rest regime on the ship and the fatigue issue...|$|R

25|$|Because of {{the change}} in {{destination}} from Plymouth to Milford Haven, and thus having no charts of the south coast of Ireland, LST-21s <b>navigation</b> <b>officer</b> took a plotting sheet and drew in the mineswept channel and the lights were plotted in by taking their position from the Admiralty list of lights. With that as a chart, they proceeded through the mineswept channel. At 14:55, the escort reported unidentified aircraft and fired its anti-aircraft guns. LST-21 went to General Quarters.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{existing}} cartographic problems can probably {{be traced back to}} a 1946–47 British cartographic survey conducted by the crew of HMS Childers. According to the account of its former <b>navigation</b> <b>officer</b> {{it is possible that the}} islets in question were wrongfully charted as belonging to Turkey by his predecessor. The reason was that during the Second World War boats of a British Special Boat Service flotilla often evaded German patrols by making fast alongside Turkish fishing boats near the islet and convincing the Germans that they were Turkish fishermen in Turkish territory.|$|E
25|$|At 23:00 on 29 July 1945 I-58 {{surfaced}} 250 {{miles north}} of Palau and headed south. Shortly afterwards the <b>navigation</b> <b>officer</b> Lt.

500|$|Yorck was {{launched}} on 14 May 1904, and commissioned into the German navy on 21 November 1905. At the commissioning Field Marshal Wilhelm von Hahnke spoke, saying, [...] "old wisdom, si vis pacem, para bellum—he who wants peace shall {{be prepared for}} war...may the guns and machines of the Yorck be operated only by men with iron hearts and an iron will, men who know no other order than to put their lives at risk when the might, the greatness and honor of the German people are being fought for." [...] After her commissioning, Yorck served with the fleet in the cruiser squadron. In 19081909, Erich Raeder served aboard the ship as Yorcks <b>navigation</b> <b>officer.</b> From 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912, Franz von Hipper, later commander-in-chief of the German navy, served as the ship's commanding officer.|$|E
500|$|Hearing cries, Bourke {{entered the}} harbour {{but could not}} {{identify}} the lost men. Despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire, Bourke returned {{to the scene of}} the wreck four times before they discovered two sailors and Vindictives badly wounded <b>navigation</b> <b>officer</b> Sir John Alleyne clinging to an upturned boat. Hauling the men aboard, Bourke turned for the safety of the open sea, but as he did, two [...] shells struck the launch, smashing the lifeboat and destroying the compressed air tanks. This stalled the engines and caused a wave of highly corrosive acid to wash over the deck, causing severe damage to the launch's hull and almost suffocating the unconscious Alleyne. Under heavy fire, the boat staggered out of the harbour and was taken under tow by another late-arriving motor launch. After the operation, Bourke's launch was discovered to have 55bullet and shrapnel holes.|$|E
500|$|A shell {{from one}} of the British cruisers hit Mainz at around 13:00, which jammed her rudder at ten degrees to starboard. Her crew shut off the port engine in an attempt to correct the ship's course, but she {{continued}} to turn to starboard. By 13:20, the majority of the ship's guns had been disabled and the ship's superstructure had been shot to pieces. Her center and aft funnel collapsed after suffering several hits. A torpedo from the destroyer [...] then hit the ship on her port side, amidships; this prompted the ship's commander to order the crew to abandon the stricken cruiser. He then left the conning tower with the <b>navigation</b> <b>officer,</b> both of whom were immediately killed by a shell hit. The ship's communication system was out of service, and so the order to abandon ship did not reach the entire crew. The ship's executive officer then reached the bridge, and reiterated the order to abandon the crippled ship at 13:35.|$|E
50|$|On {{commencement}} of hostilities in the Second World War, the RN once again called upon {{the experience and}} professionalism of the RNR from the outset to help it to shoulder the initial burden until sufficient manpower could be trained for the RNVR and 'hostilities only' ratings. Again, RNR officers found themselves in command of destroyers, frigates, sloops, landing craft and submarines, or as specialist <b>navigation</b> <b>officers</b> in cruisers and aircraft carriers. In convoy work, the convoy commodore or escort commander was often an RNR officer. As in the First World War, the RNR acquitted itself well, winning four VCs.|$|R
5000|$|From 1865 to 1868, Valois circumnavigated {{the world}} on the Corvette Vineta, and, {{subsequently}} on the Sail Corvette Nymphe.

25|$|After {{the liberation}} of Norway on 8 May 1945, the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board started to {{initiate}} operations of civilian airliners. For 1945, the task {{was given to the}} Royal Norwegian Air Force, who used surplus aircraft to operate a limited number of routes. At the same time, Thomas Olsen and Thomas Falck started mobilizing among shipowners and other businesspeople to raise capital for DNL, {{while at the same time}} trying to ensure the employment of military pilots, <b>navigation</b> <b>officers</b> and other people with aviation competence. Egil Gløersen was sent to the United States to study the operations of United Airlines and Northwest Airlines.

500|$|Kristine Kochanski (originally {{portrayed by}} Clare Grogan before Chloë Annett {{took on the}} role from series VII) was {{initially}} a Red Dwarf <b>navigation</b> <b>officer</b> whom Lister {{had a crush on}} (later retroactively altered to be his ex-girlfriend) and whose memory he had cherished ever since. In one episode, the crew happens upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident. She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses. By the first episode of the [...] specials, Lister believes her dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her [...] "death") had lied to Lister. Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her.

Leonard married Jean Chaplin Scott in Westmount, Quebec on 10 October 1921, and with the Royal Canadian Navy depleted of ships on which he could serve, at this point he considered a civilian career, in 1924 qualifying as master of a foreign-going vessel. Deciding to remain with the armed forces, Murray joined many of his colleagues and spent the inter-war years alternating between shore assignments as a training officer with the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, and serving aboard Royal Navy vessels, which in Murray's case included [...] (during a tour in 1923 in Turkey where he befriended Lord Louis Mountbatten), and [...] Understandably, this provided Murray and his peers, including Percy W. Nelles, with a distinct anglophile and, in matters military, Royal Navy bias. In January 1925, Murray was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and spent two years at the Royal Canadian Navy's main training base at HMCS Stadacona. In 1927, Murray returned to the UK where he did a tour aboard [...] and then spent 1928 studying at the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich. During a simulation exercise at the College, Murray broke new ground by planning large convoys – convoys that were regarded at the time as [...] "almost suicidal", but which had become normal by the time of the Battle of the Atlantic. Upon return to Canada in January 1929, Murray was promoted to Commander and became the senior naval officer at CFB Esquimalt.
