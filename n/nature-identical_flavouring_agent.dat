Early <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> were aniseed, coriander, caraway seeds and rosewater.

40|$|<b>Flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been}} used {{worldwide}} in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Most of the <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> used are synthetically produced which at times lack the natural taste of the material. This study aimed to study the usage of tropical fruits as natural <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> and the best mechanism and solvent system {{that are able to}} extract the best quality of <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent.</b> The tropical fruit chosen in this study is A. heterophyllus L. or commonly known as jackfruit. Three solvent systems (50 %, 70 % and 90 % ethanol) and two processing mechanisms (blended and whole fruit flesh) are studied in this research. The utilization of jackfruit waste (perigones) is also studied. The total phenolic content (TPC) of each extract was measured and the samples with the highest and lowest TPC content was evaluated using trained panelists. The results of the study showed that the sample extracted using solvent system with the highest polarity and blended mechanism (50 % EtOH Blended) contains the highest concentration of phenols while the lowest TPC was measured in 90 % EtOH whole jackfruit flesh. The perigones of the jackfruit also showed a significant amount of phenols which can be further utilized. The results of the sensory evaluation showed {{no significant difference between the}} sample with the highest and lowest TPC. This shows that for the production of <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> from A. heterophyllus L. blending is not required to produce a <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> that is acceptable by consumers which will reduce the cost of production...|$|R

50|$|Flavoured syrups {{are made}} by infusing simple syrups with <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> during the cooking process. A wide variety of <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> can be used, often in {{combination}} with each other, such as herbs (rosemary), spices (chipotle chilis; cardamom), or aromatics (orange peel; lemongrass; ginger). For instance, syrupus aromaticus is prepared by adding certain quantities of orange flavouring and cinnamon water to simple syrup. This type of syrup is commonly used at coffee bars, especially in the United States, to make flavoured drinks. Infused simple syrups {{can be used to}} create desserts, or, to add sweetness and depth of flavour to cocktails.|$|R

40|$|In a 5 x 5 Latin {{square with}} 12 -day periods, 35 {{yearling}} Hereford steers, 358 +or- 32 kg, {{were randomly assigned}} to one of 5 groups to estimate the effects of adding <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> to grass-legume silage at feeding time. <b>Flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> chosen represented major taste groups: sweet (0. 025 % aspartame (Asp) as fed), acid (0. 625 % hydrochloric acid (HCl) as fed), salt (0. 6 % sodium chloride (NaCl) as fed) and monosodium glutamate (MSG at 1 % as fed). Daily intakes were measured. Monosodium glutamate increased silage intake (P< 0. 05). It is suggested that adding MSG may be of possible practical use as a silage additive to increase silage intake by yearling steers. ...|$|R
