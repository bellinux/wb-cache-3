Here, using synchronous high-speed video and laser vibrometer recordings followed by experimental manipulations of putative sound-producing structures, we explored the mechanisms of seismic signal production in the courtship display of Schizocosa stridulans Stratton. Two types of seismic courtship signals were observed: ‘rev’ and ‘idle’ signals.

This <b>multi-component</b> <b>signal</b> is produced by independent structures and represents a parallel multi-component display. By contrast, idle displays consist of a high-intensity component produced by drumming of the forelegs on the substrate (percussion) followed by a high-frequency component produced by flexions of the male pedipalp (stridulation). While {{the components of the}} idle display are also produced by independent structures, the leg drumming and palp flexions occur serially and do not overlap in time.

50|$|For <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> in general, the {{distribution}} of its auto-term and cross-term within its Wigner distribution function is generally not predictable, and hence the cross-term cannot be removed easily.

30|$|For a <b>multi-component</b> <b>signal,</b> {{consisting}} of a sum {{of two or more}} mono-component signals, the notion of a single IF becomes inappropriate. To characterise this type of signals, each mono-component is assigned its own IF. Among several IF estimation methods specifically designed for <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> that were previously proposed by some of the authors of this article in[21, 27], the method in[21] is selected; it estimates IFs of <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> by detecting and linking the local peaks of the TFD. This method has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge about the signal under analysis except that its components are clearly separated in the time-frequency (TF) domain; a condition often satisfied by newborn EEG signals. The method has been successfully applied to biomedical signals such as EEG and ECG[20, 28, 29]. As seizure signals mostly have a high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio[16, 22], we decided to use this more established method for IF estimation rather than, for example, using the more recently proposed method for extracting IF from signals with low SNR[27]. More details on the IF estimation method is given in Section “Methods”.|$|R

In this paper, the instantaneous frequency of signal is estimated with the Viterbi algorithm that is not sensitive to the SNR. In 2004, Igor Djurovic and L. Jubisa Stankovi proposed a method to estimate the instantaneous frequency of <b>multi-component</b> <b>signal</b> by combining the Viterbi algorithm to WVD [22].|$|R

Various IF estimation approaches for <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> have been proposed (see e.g., [[6], Chapter 10] and [42, 43]). Such methods first localize and extract signal components from the signal T-F representation and then apply an IF estimation procedure.

30|$|We {{classified}} {{the newborn}} EEG seizure components {{based on their}} parametric IF models using the following process. First, IFs of seizure components were obtained using an IF estimation method specifically designed for <b>nonstationary</b> <b>multi-component</b> signals[21]. This method starts by mapping the time-domain EEG signals into the time-frequency domain using a suitably chosen quadratic TFD and followed by TFD local peak detection and component linking operations. Each extracted IF is then fitted to the above four parametric models using a large scale nonlinear least squares algorithm[32, 33]. The seizure pattern is finally assigned to the class represented by the parametric IF model that best fits, in the least mean squared error sense, the IF extracted from the seizure component.

The IF of signal components is then estimated from the ADTFD using an image processing algorithm. Using the mean square error between the original IF and estimated IF as a performance criterion, experimental results indicate that the ADTFD gives better IF estimation performance compared with other TFDs for a <b>multi-component</b> <b>signal.</b> For example, for signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB, the IF estimate obtained using the ADTFD achieves a mean square error of ? 42 dB for a weak signal component, which is an improvement of ? 12 dB compared with other TFDs.

40|$|Majority of the time-frequency {{representations}} (TFRs) {{make some}} kind of compromise between auto-component’s resolution and cross-terms suppression during the analysis of time varying signals. Linear TFRs offer no cross-terms but have low resolution of auto-components. Quadratic TFRs offer better resolutions of auto-components but have cross-terms. The proposed research focuses on TFRs that can combine the advantages of both linear and quadratic TFRs. In {{the first part of this}} research, a modified form of Gabor Wigner Transform (GWT) has been proposed by using adaptive thresholding in Gabor Transform (GT) and Wigner Distribution (WD). The proposed GWT combines the advantages of both GT and WD and provides a powerful analysis tool for analyzing <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals.</b> This technique is however not very efficient for <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> having large abrupt amplitude variation in its auto-components. In <b>multi-component</b> <b>signal</b> analysis where GWT fails to extract auto-components, the combination of signal processing techniques such as fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and image processing techniques such as image thresholding and segmentation have proven their potential to extract auto-components. In the second part of this research, an algorithm is proposed for an effective representation in time-frequency domain called Modified Fractional GWT that combines the strengths of GWT, image segmentation and FRFT. This representation maintains the resolution of auto-components besides recognizing FRFT, a powerful tool for signal analysis. Performance analysis of proposed fractional GWT reveals that it provides solution of cross-terms of WD and worst resolution faced by linear TFRs. In the third part of this work, a novel algorithm for effective representation of <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals</b> in time-frequency domain is proposed. The scheme not only suppresses the cross terms but also ensures that all the auto-components even very weak ones are properly shown in time-frequency domain. The scheme also results in much localized time frequency representation (TFR). The algorithm uses the strengths of GWT and linear time-varying (LTV) filtering in time domain to design a filter in time-frequency domain that suppresses cross terms and enhances auto components through an iterative approach. Performance analysis of proposed algorithm reveals that it provides concentrated and high resolution auto-components which are desirable for a TFR. The TFRs are used to separate and extract signal’s auto-components which are buried in noise and are used to estimate the instantaneous frequency of a <b>multi-component</b> <b>signal</b> in low SNR scenarios.

Since this technique {{can be applied to}} mono-component signals only, a filtering process is a necessary preliminary step for getting the random decrement signature when applying on <b>multi-component</b> <b>signals.</b> But filtering is the most critical step with a high influence on the accuracy of the modal parameter estimation, especially when the signal is composed of very closely-spaced modes.
