5|$|The {{extraordinary}} initial {{success of}} Pinafore in America was seen first-hand by J. C. Williamson. He soon made arrangements with D'Oyly Carte {{to present the}} opera's first authorised production in Australia, opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. Thereafter, his opera company played frequent seasons of the work (and the subsequent Savoy operas) until at least 1963. In the U.S., the piece never lost popularity. The Internet Broadway Database links to a <b>non-exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of 29 productions on Broadway alone. Among the professional repertory companies continuing to present Pinafore regularly in the U.S. are Opera a la Carte, based in California, Ohio Light Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons. Pinafore is still performed around the world by opera companies such as the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen; Australian Opera (and Essgee Entertainment and others in Australia); in Kassel, Germany; and even Samarkand, Uzbekistan.|$|E

25|$|If the two {{terminal}} repeats in a solenoid do {{not physically}} interact, {{it leads to}} an open or linear structure. Members of this group are frequently rod- or crescent-shaped. The number of individual repeats can range from 2 to over 50. A clear advantage of this topology is that both the N- and C-terminal ends are free to add new repeats and folds, or even remove existing ones during evolution without any gross impact on the structural stability of the entire domain. This type of domain is extremely common among extracellular segments of receptors or cell adhesion molecules. A <b>non-exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of examples include: EGF repeats, cadherin repeats, leucine-rich repeats, HEAT repeats, ankyrin repeats, armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, etc. Whenever a linear solenoid domain structure participates in protein-protein interactions, frequently at least 3 or more repetitive subunits form the ligand-binding sites. Thus - while individual repeats might have a (limited) ability to fold on their own – they usually cannot perform {{the functions of the}} entire domain alone.|$|E

In particular, there is an entire appendix section dedicated to a <b>non-exhaustive</b> <b>listing</b> of common sources of undefined behavior in C. Moreoever, compilers are not required to diagnose code that relies on undefined behavior.

This can result in bugs that occur when optimizations are enabled on the compiler, or when a compiler of a different vendor or version is used.|$|R

500|$|Following {{discussions between}} the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services Authority {{and the major}} banks, {{proceedings}} were issued on 27 July 2007 in a test case against the banks to determine the legality and enforceability of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts. It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a <b>non-exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are irrecoverable at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [...] AC 79 along with Murray v Leisure Play [...] EWCA Civ 963, where it was held that a contractual party can only recover damages for an actual loss or liquidated losses. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously. On 24 April 2008, the High Court found that although these charges could not constitute penalties, they are challengeable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. On 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that fees for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques are subject to regulation by the OFT under these rules.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Aquifer Reference System of France (BDLISA 1) {{proposes a}} {{delineation}} of its hydrogeologicalunits, including aquifer reservoirs and impervious units, according to local,regional and national scale. Each unit {{is characterized by}} a class of permeability, porosity andtype of geological formation. The ranking number increases with increasing depth and thisenables identification of the vertical position at each point with respect to the other units. Thus, an aquifer in a sedimentary basin can be covered by several dozen other units. Theclasses enable identification of all carbonate rocks in France and their vertical position: fromsurface outcrops down to deep carbonates (Figure 1). Carbonate rocks cover more than 60 %(350, 000 km²) of Metropolitan France, of which 55 % (193, 000 km²) in outcrop. Each carbonate rock is a potential karst aquifer (World Karst Aquifer Mapping Project). Nevertheless, the absence or differing degrees of karstification demand a classification ofthese aquifers according to karst indicators. Specialists strive to find approaches that are bothadapted and homogeneous on a national scale. Initially, BDLISA was built on a regional scale, witheach region employing its own approach depending ondata availability: mapping of all surface disordersrelated to karst (swallets, sinkholes, dolines etc.),tracer tests in karst aquifers and identification ofgroundwater catchment areas, borehole analyses (flowout by fractures and karst) 2, karst springs, wells withvery high specific discharge, stream sink, etc. In a later stage, and in order to harmonize the nationalscale of BDLISA, two approaches were proposed depending on the surface karstification rate: 1) The whole unit is classed as a karst aquifer: four classes distinguish whether thegeological formation can be characterized by a network of underground karst systems or,moreover, a second or third network, all being part of the hydrodynamic system. 2) Karst only constitutes part(s) of the unit: a supplementary layer enables the delineation ofareas inside the aquifer unit where the presence of karst is well known. The national cavity database 3 provides a <b>non-exhaustive</b> <b>listing</b> of natural karst cavity as wellas karst springs and wells with very high specific discharge (BSS). These GIS layers wereoverlain on the extension of carbonate rocks. This information enabled a better understandingof many karst areas. For approach 1, the complete unit classed as karst aquifer, the mappingreveals 2 / 3 of the karst at outcrop and 1 / 3 in the subsurface (25 %, corresponding to 545 unitsat local scale). For approach 2, 108 karst areas have been delineated and linked to their 60 aquifer units. A new 1 : 1 M scale hydrogeological map of France will be published in 2015, based on theinformation of the BDLISA units. It is designed for hydrogeologists and is a communicationand educational tool: the representation of karst aquifers had to be modified in order to allowvisibility at this scale by a differentiation of karst aquifer outcrops and deeper karst units, thedisplay of karst springs (World Karst Aquifer Mapping Project) and karst aquifer labels...|$|R
