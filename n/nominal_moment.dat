40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{to use a}} curve of {{changing}} vibration amplitude of the rotating moment on the worm shaft of reducer {{in the process of}} growing brake (loading) moment as one of criteria of the worm reducer operability. A condition of reducer operability at the <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> is lack of vibrations of the rotating moment with a critical value of amplitude. It is shown that vibrations of rotating moment on a shaft of the electric engine, by their nature, are self-vibrations in the system with "negative friction". Values of the brake moment at which there is a sharp increase of vibration amplitude leading to operability loss correspond to the <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> for this reducer or to the brake moment, corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is shown that different lubricants differently influence on the generation of self-vibrations. The most efficient damping occurs when using oil with the additive "Striboil", and the reason of falling efficiency at the excess of the <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> is essentially increased energy losses at generation of vibrations with "negative friction", especially when approaching to the resonance area. Thus, taking into account a nature of damping vibrations, with using different lubricants, allows us to increase the permissible tension since the more is a damping value the more is a brake moment corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is noted that, when using the additives to oils, a growth of the permissible tension is caused by the processes of film formation increasing the real contact area, which increases its share of the nominal contact area determined by the Hertz formula. </p...|$|E

40|$|A column design {{method has}} been {{developed}} for use in braced frames with discontinuous columns using flexible cap and base plates and floor beams that are either simply supported or continuous. The method {{is intended to be}} used with shallow floor construction with concrete or steel/concrete composite slabs in which the floor slab occupies the depth of the floor beams and is fully grouted to the beams so that the slab restrains the full depth of the beams and was developed to simplify the design of discontinuous columns in frames using Corus ASB type floor construction without resorting to methods using <b>nominal</b> <b>moments.</b> Floor beams are therefore designed to carry the floor loads without interaction with the columns. Columns are designed to resist the floor beam reactions with column end-rotations equal to the slope of the floor beams at the top or bottom of the column, whichever is the greater. The method incorporates the elasto-plastic behaviour of columns subject to axial compression and large end-rotations. The design procedure uses rectangular stress blocks of classic plastic cross-sectional resistance and includes the end-rotations of the columns and the effects of imperfections. Therefore the approach is similar to classic second-order rigidplastic analysis but with the important additions of actual end-rotations and an initial imperfection. The method has been verified by physical tests on full-scale columns and finite element analysis using non-linear geometry and material properties.

Among the proposed solutions, reduced beam section (RBS) connection becomes the most prospective alternatives. In RBS, some of flanges section area of beams are reduced so that its <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> capacity decreasing. The effort leads to the movement of plastic hinges location from the face of beam-column connection to the section of RBS, resulting the more safe plastic collapse mechanism. The research on special moment frames (SMF) using RBS in one direction has been conducted and the result show that the structures experience safe mechanism although their drift are quite excessive. Furthermore, the use of RBS in two orthogonal direction of SMF resulting good structural performance, but inefficient in the columns’ section. Continuing the last research, this study is aimed to observe the structural performance of steel dual system, SMF and concentrically braced frame (CBF), using RBS.

40|$|Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC) is a new, innovative {{construction material}} {{that can be}} placed into forms {{without the need for}} mechanical vibration. The mixture proportions are critical for producing quality SCC and require an optimized combination of coarse and fine aggregates, cement, water, and chemical and mineral admixtures. The required mixture constituents and proportions may affect the mechanical properties, bond characteristics, and long-term behavior, and SCC may not provide the same inservice performance as conventional concrete (CC). Different SCC mixture constituents and proportions were evaluated for mechanical properties, shear characteristics, bond characteristics, creep, and durability. Variables evaluated included mixture type (CC or SCC), coarse aggregate type (river gravel or limestone), and coarse aggregate volume. To correlate these results with full-scale samples and investigate structural behavior related to strand bond properties, four girder-deck systems, 40 ft (12 m) long, with CC and SCC pretensioned girders were fabricated and tested. Results from the research indicate that the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials Load and Resistance Factor Design (AASHTO LRFD) Specifications can be used to estimate the mechanical properties of SCC for a concrete compressive strength range of 5 to 10 ksi (34 to 70 MPa). In addition, the research team developed prediction equations for concrete compressive strength ranges from 5 to 16 ksi (34 to 110 MPa). With respect to shear characteristics, a more appropriate expression is proposed to estimate the concrete shear strength for CC and SCC girders with a compressive strength greater than 10 ksi (70 MPa). The author found that girder-deck systems with Type A SCC girders exhibit similar flexural performance as deck-systems with CC girders.

40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental/research {{program has}} taken place at the University of Sherbrooke FRP Durability Facility. The program, consisting of four phases, studies the creep performance of FRP bars {{as well as the}} overall long-term behaviour of FRP reinforced concrete beams. Phase 1 deals with the creep performance of two types of GFRP bars subjected to different levels of sustained axial load; causing creep rupture at higher levels. In Phase 2, six different types of GFRP bars are tested under two levels of allowable service load, according to the currently available North American standards. The test duration, for the two phases, exceeded 10000 hours (417 days) wherein regular monitoring' of creep strain evolution took place and. the creep coefficient of GFRP bars was calculated. Residual tensile tests and microstructural analysis followed the long-term testing period. It was found that 45 % of the GFRP bars' tensile strength, fu,ave, is a safe limit for GFRP exhibiting sustained load, in standard laboratory conditions. Microstructural analysis shows that the increase in creep strain, after the 10000 hour period, is negligible for GFRP bars under allowable service load. Phase 3 consists of twenty reinforced concrete beams (ten pairs) comprising GFRP, CFRP, and steel reinforcing bars. The dimensions of which are 100 mm x 150 mm x 1800 mm, installed under third-point sustained load, for a period exceeding one year. Exhibiting a maximum applied moment of 25 % of their <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> capacity, Mn, all beams were regularly monitored in terms of (i) time-dependent deflection, (ii) strain increase in concrete and reinforcement and (iii) crack widths. Theoretical predictions for immediate deflection were calculated, using three methods (ACI 440. 1 R- 06, CAN/CSA S 806 - 02 and the ISIS Canda Design Manual (2007)), and compared to the obtained experimental results. Results showed that the calculations, regarding immediate deflection, under estimate by 67 %; underestimate by 10 %; overestimate by 11 %, for the aforementioned methods, respectively. The long-term to immediate deflection ratio,. l, was calculated for all beams and compared to ACI 440. 1 R- 06 and CAN/CSA S 806 - 02 predictions. Results showed that the North American standards are conservative as regards long-term deflection prediction. Immediate crack width results were compared to the prediction equations adopted by ACI 440. 1 R- 06 and CAN/CSA S 6 - 06, on the one hand, and by the ISIS Canada Design Manual (2007) on the other hand. Satisfactory results were found when the k b bond-coefficient factor is taken as 1. 2 and 1. 0, respectively. From the obtained data, the time-dependent kt multiplier, accounting for crack width increase after one year, was deduced as 1. 7 and 1. 5 for both models, respectively. Phase 4 deals with four full-scale GFRP reinforced concrete beams, of dimensions (215 mm x 400 mm x 4282 mm), subjected to uniform distributed load for a period of six months. Sizeable concrete blocks (of dimensions 610 mm x 762 mm x 1219 mm and weight = 13334 kN) were arranged on top of the beams to simulate sustained uniform distributed load. The main study parameters, of this phase, are (i) bottom reinforcement ratio and (ii) type of upper/compression reinforcement (GFRP and/or steel). The applied moment ranges from 15 to 21 % of the <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> capacity for the beams. Numerical modelling took place using a computer program (Fortran- 2003) based on the age-adjusted effective modulus method, to predict the long-term deflection of the beams. The creep and shrinkage coefficients were calculated based on the ACI Committee 209 recommendations (1992) and CEB-FIP Model Code (1990). The theoretical curves were in very good agreement with the measured values. Furthermore, the empirical models available in ACI 440. 1 R- 06 and CAN/CSA S 806 - 02 were used for long-term deflection prediction. These predictions showed that both models can serve as upper bound and lower bound limits for the measured long-term deflection curves, respectively. As regards crack width prediction, the equations adopted by ACI 440. 1 R- 06 (same as that of CAN/CSA S 6 - 06) and by the ISIS Canada Design Manual (2007) yield satisfactory results when the kb bond-coefficient factor is 1. 2 and 1. 0 respectively (similar to phase 3). For both equations the time-dependent kt multiplier is deduced as 1. 4, after six months. [...] Résumé abrégé par UMI...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringHayder A. RasheedFiber {{reinforced}} polymer {{has recently}} {{become a popular}} replacement for steel rebar, used to reinforce concrete. Therefore much research is taking place to help develop and propose methods for best approximating the response of FRP reinforced members, to make them comparable to steel reinforced members. With this popularity comes multiple approaches to FRP deflection calculations. However, this study is significant, because it investigates the cracking moment equation adopted by ACI 318, in conjunction with {{state of the art}} deflection calculation methods. Specifically this research compares four deflection calculation methods. The first approach is proposed by Bischoff and implemented by ACI 440 in its latest revision. The second deflection calculation method is proposed by Rasheed et al. The third calculation is also suggested by Bischoff, as it is specific to four point bending. The fourth calculation method is proposed by this specific research and seeks to find a median between both the Bischoff and Rasheed equations. This fourth technique will be referred to as the Rasheed-Jacobs method, proposed to create a more conservative and relevant method for investigating the effect of cracking moment on the deflection calculations. This research was done with the help of Dr. Shawn Gross, and the database he had previously built through his investigation on FRP reinforced beams. Gross’s database shows results for 106 samples tested using the actual experimental cracking moment as well as the ultimate moment capacity values. Of these 106 samples, 56 independent samples were used to investigate three different moment levels of 0. 333 Mn, 0. 400 Mn, and 0. 467 Mn. From this research, Gross’s database was used to calculate the cracking moment of FRP reinforced beams based on ACI 318 - 08. A program was developed that uses the Gross database samples to calculate the cracking moment and deflection with the Rasheed, Bischoff, and Bischoff 2 models as well as the new Rasheed-Jacobs model. This program calculates the Rasheed-Jacobs results, and then graphs the findings against the deflection values from the Rasheed, Bischoff, Bischoff 2 models. These graphs showed very similar patterns amongst all four models, with the Rasheed-Jacobs results mainly falling on the more conservative side. However, when looking at the predicted deflection verse the Gross experimental deflection, the best results came from the 0. 467 Mn moment level, which shows consistent correlation while the lower moment levels are being less predictable using the cracking moment based on the ACI equation. It can reasonably be said that the 0. 467 Mn shows the best correlation between the four methods and the experimental results, because it is farther away from the actual <b>nominal</b> cracking <b>moment</b> of the FRP reinforced concrete beams...|$|R
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} sandwich wall panels(PCSWPs) {{have been}} in use for over 60 years. They provide a very efficient building envelope for many buildings. Characteristic PCSWPs comprise an outer and inner layer (or wythe) of concrete separated by an insulating material. To use all of the material as efficiently as possible, the layers are attached by connectors which penetrate through the insulating layer and are embedded in either concrete wythe. These connectors {{make it possible for}} both layers of the wall to work together when resisting loads. The connectors are made out of plastic, or FRP, to prevent heat transfer {{from one side of the}} wall to the other. This research evaluated several different FRP systems by fabricating and testing 41 small scale “push-off” specimens (3 ft. by 4 ft., 0. 91 m by 1. 22 m) and eight full-scale sandwich panel walls to evaluate the percent composite action of various connectors and compare the results to those provided by the composite connector manufacturers. Testing of push-off specimens was performed by applying loads perpendicular to the connectors and measuring the amount of deformation that occurred. By determining the load-deformation relationship, engineers can make more informed decisions about the full-scale behavior. This project aimed to validate current procedures using these methods, and to develop simpler, more efficient methods for predicting overall strength of this innovative building system. This study concluded that the reported degrees of composite action from each manufacturer are considered conservative in all instances for the connectors tested. Additionally, the intensity and type of connectors are important factors in determining the degree of partial composite action in a panel. Two methods to predict elastic deformations and cracking were developed(the Beam-Spring model and the Elastic Hand Method) and were compared to the elastic portions of the full-scale testing performed in this study, yielding promising results. Anew method(thePartially-Composite Strength Prediction Method) was also created to predict the <b>nominal</b> <b>moment</b> capacity of concrete sandwich wall panels that is easier to implement than current methodologies and shown to be accurate.
