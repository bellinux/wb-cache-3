5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests {{there would be no}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E
25|$|Half of the Bangladesh's 12 million tube wells contain {{unacceptable}} {{levels of}} arsenic {{due to the}} wells not being dug deep enough (past 100 metres). The Bangladeshi government had spent less than US$7 million of the 34 million allocated for solving the problem by the World Bank in 1998. Natural arsenic poisoning is a global threat, 140 million people affected in 70 countries on all continents. These examples illustrate the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> each location {{on a case by}} case basis and not assume what works in one area will work in another.|$|E
25|$|In {{looking at}} the issue of {{antidepressant}} use, some academics have highlighted the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, {{due to the fact}} that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations. These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures. In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.|$|E

25|$|The module {{was also}} used as a {{mounting}} point for the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP), a set of four experiments intended to {{study the effects of}} space debris impacts and exposure to the space environment on a variety of materials. The materials used in the experiments were being considered for use on the ISS, and by exposing them at a similar orbital altitude to that flown by the station, the experiments provided an assessment of the performance of those materials in a similar space environment. MEEP also fulfilled the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the occurrence and effects of man-made debris and natural micrometeoroids through capture and impact studies. The experiments were installed on the docking module during STS-76, and retrieved during STS-86.|$|E
25|$|Altruism is {{constantly}} referenced by proponents of organ gifting. Authors such as Sahlins (1972), incorporated Maussian concepts of gifting and reciprocity and expanded them to describe three {{different types of}} transactions: generalized reciprocity (system of giving without taking account of how much is given), balanced reciprocity (direct exchange, expectation of equal value), and negative reciprocity (obtaining something for nothing). Individuals engage in {{each one of these}} transaction depending on the person they are exchanging with and the social distance involved. Sahlins' (1972) work has pointed to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the different types of relationships behind gift-giving and the characteristics of the transaction. In the case of generalized reciprocity, altruistic relationships are present and the expectation of reciprocity is indefinite.|$|E

He said [...] "I happen to think the President {{is on the right}} side of history here.

2500|$|During a {{counter-insurgency}} seminar {{conducted by}} Sri Lanka Army in June 2011, Lawrence Smith - an attaché of the American embassy in Sri Lanka from 2008 revealed [...] "...from what I was privileged {{to hear and}} to see, the offers to surrender that I am aware of {{seemed to come from}} the mouthpieces of the LTTE -- Nadesan, KP -- people who weren't and never had really demonstrated any control over the leadership or the combat power of the LTTE. So their offers were a bit suspect anyway, and they tended to vary in content hour by hour, day by day.

2500|$|The defense called {{forensic}} pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz, who performed a second autopsy on Caylee after Garavaglia and challenged Garavaglia's autopsy report. He called her autopsy [...] "shoddy," [...] {{saying it was}} a failure that Caylee's skull was not opened during her examination. [...] "You <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the whole body in an autopsy," [...] he said. Spitz stated {{that he was not}} allowed to attend Garavaglia's initial autopsy on Caylee's remains, and that, from his own follow-up autopsy, he was not comfortable ruling the child's death a homicide. He said he could not determine what Caylee Anthony's manner of death was, but said that there was no indication to him that she was murdered. Additionally, Spitz testified that he believed the duct tape found on Caylee's skull was placed there after the body decomposed, opining that if tape was placed on the skin, there should have been DNA left on it, and suggested that someone may have staged some of the crime scene photos. [...] "The person who took this picture, the person who prepared this, put the hair there," [...] stated Spitz. When asked by Ashton during cross-examination, [...] "So your testimony is the medical examiner's personnel took the hair that wasn't on the skull, placed it there?", Spitz answered, [...] "It wouldn't be the first time, sir. Ican tell you some horror stories about that." ...|$|E

60|$|Neale dismounted, {{threw his}} bridle, and looked searchingly around. But Larry, always more {{comfortable}} on horseback than on land, kept his saddle. Suddenly Neale felt inexplicably drawn {{in a certain}} direction--toward a rocky ledge. Still he heard nothing except {{the wind in the}} few scraggy trees. All the ground in and around the scene of the massacre had been gone over; there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> it again. Neale had nothing tangible upon which to base his strange feeling. Yet absurd or not, he refused to admit it was fancy or emotion. Some voice had called him. He swore it. If he did not make sure he would always be haunted. So with clear, deliberate eyes he surveyed the scene. Then he strode for the ledge of rock.|$|E
60|$|The temple {{itself was}} really {{a part of the}} palace and similar in architecture. There were several {{ceremonial}} places of varying sizes, the purposes of which Tarzan could only conjecture. Each had an altar in the west end and another in the east and were oval in shape, their longest diameter lying due east and west. Each was excavated from the summit of a small hillock and all were without roofs. The western altars invariably were a single block of stone the top of which was hollowed into an oblong basin. Those at the eastern ends were similar blocks of stone with flat tops and these latter, unlike those at the opposite ends of the ovals were invariably stained or painted a reddish brown, nor did Tarzan <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> them closely to be assured of what his keen nostrils already had told him--that the brown stains were dried and drying human blood.|$|E
6000|$|We may omit {{here all}} {{discussion}} of the historical progress of socialism and the stages whereby it changed from the creed of a few theorists and revolutionists to being the accepted platform of great political parties, counting its adherents by the million. All of this belongs elsewhere. It suffices here to note that {{in the process of}} its rise it has chafed away much of the superfluous growth that clung to it and has become a purely economic doctrine. There is no longer any need to discuss in connection with it the justification of marriage and the family, and the rightness or wrongness of Christianity: no need to decide whether the materialistic theory of history is true or false, since nine socialists out of ten to-day have forgotten, or have never heard, what the materialistic theory of history is: no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> whether human history is, or is not, a mere record of class exploitation, since the controversy has long shifted to other grounds. The essential thing to-day is not the past, but the future.
