2500|$|Stevia {{has been}} widely used as a <b>natural</b> <b>sweetener</b> in South America for centuries and in Japan since 1970. [...] Due to its unique {{characteristics}} of zero glycemic index and zero calories, it is fast becoming popular in many other countries. In 1987, the FDA issued a ban on stevia because {{it had not been}} approved as a food additive, although it continued to be available as a dietary supplement. After being provided with a significant amount of scientific data proving that there was no side-effect of using stevia as a sweetener from companies such as Cargill and Coca-Cola, the FDA gave a [...] "no objection" [...] approval for GRAS status in December 2008 to Truvia, a blend of rebiana and erythritol (developed by Cargill and The Coca-Cola Company), as well as PureVia (developed by PepsiCo and the Whole Earth Sweetener Company, a subsidiary of Merisant), ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAgave syrups {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} as new <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> Identification, classification and discrimination by infrared spectroscopy coupled to chemometrics (NIR-MIR-SIMCA-PCA) and HPAEC-PAD of agave syrups from <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners</b> were achieved. MIR-SIMCA-PCA {{allowed us to}} classify the <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners</b> according to their natural source. Natural syrups exhibited differences in the MIR spectra region 1500 – 900 cm− 1. The agave syrups displayed strong absorption in the MIR spectra region 1061 – 1063 cm− 1, in agreement with their high fructose content. Additionally, MIR-SIMCA-PCA allowed us to differentiate among syrups from different Agave species (Agave tequilana and Agave salmiana). Thin-layer chromatography and HPAEC-PAD revealed glucose, fructose, and sucrose as the principal carbohydrates {{in all of the}} syrups. Oligosaccharide profiles showed that A. tequilana syrups are mainly composed of fructose (> 60 %) and fructooligosaccharides, while A. salmiana syrups contain more sucrose (28 – 32 %). We conclude that MIR-SIMCA-PCA and HPAEC-PAD can be used to unequivocally identify and classified agave syrups...|$|R
50|$|Its taste {{profile is}} closer to sucrose than other <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners</b> (apart from thaumatin). Unlike other sweet-tasting proteins, it can {{withstand}} heat, making it more suitable for industrial food processing.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{public awareness}} of adverse health impacts from excessive sugar consumption has created increasing interest in plant-derived, natural low-calorie or zero-calorie sweeteners. Two plant species which contain <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> Stevia rebaudiana and Siraitia grosvenorii, have been extensively profiled to identify molecules with high intensity sweetening properties. However, sweetening ability does not necessarily make a product viable for commercial applications. Some criteria for product success are proposed to identify which targets {{are likely to be}} accepted by consumers. Limitations of plant-based production are discussed, and a case is put forward for the necessity of biotechnological production methods such as plant cell culture or microbial fermentation to meet needs for commercial-scale production of <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Truvia (marketed and stylized as truvía) is a stevia-based sugar {{substitute}} developed jointly by The Coca-Cola Company and Cargill. It is distributed and marketed by Cargill as a tabletop sweetener {{as well as}} a food ingredient. Truvia is made of rebiana, erythritol, and natural flavors. Because it comes from the stevia plant, Cargill classifies it as a <b>natural</b> <b>sweetener</b> {{in addition to being a}} non-nutritive sweetener, although Cargill has settled lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing of Truvia as [...] "natural". Since its launch in 2008, Truvia <b>natural</b> <b>sweetener</b> has become the second best-selling {{sugar substitute}} in units in the U.S. behind Splenda, surpassing Equal and Sweet'n Low.

25|$|In the USA {{there are}} tariffs on the {{importation}} of sugar, and subsidies {{for the production of}} maize (corn). High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is derived from corn, and significantly cheaper there than sucrose as a sweetener.

30|$|Although all {{oligosaccharides}} are exhibiting prebiotic properties but fructo-oligosaccharides {{has gained}} much attention as artificial sweeteners {{because they provide}} sweet taste to the consumer and do not increase the blood glucose level. Therefore, they find important place in the food of diabetics. Thus, fructooligosaccharides act as artificial sweeteners with functional properties apart from sweetness {{similar to that of}} <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of thin film drug technology is its taste and color. The sweet taste in formulation is more important in case of pediatric population. <b>Natural</b> <b>sweeteners</b> as well as artificial sweeteners are used to improve {{the flavor of the}} mouth dissolving formulations for the flavors changes from individual to individual. Pigments such as titanium dioxide is incorporated for coloring.|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from all}} the above stated prime health {{benefits}} fructooligosaccharides also has artificial sweetness and low caloric value. Artificial sweeteners are constantly in demand due to need of diabetics and health conscious consumers. Initially the demand was satisfied by aspartame agent or <b>natural</b> <b>sweeteners</b> like palatinose. Due to their popular use all types of oligosaccharides remained poorly exploited despite their functional properties (Mussatto et al. 2009).|$|R
